&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian FARC rebels killed five soldiers after attacking them with explosives near the border with Ecuador while troops were eradicating illegal coca crops used to make cocaine, the army said Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombia's long war is waning due to President Alvaro Uribe's U.S.-backed campaign to deploy troops to take on the guerrillas, but Latin America's oldest insurgency is still a force in rural areas where the state presence is weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Five soldiers were killed in an attack carried out by the 48th Front of the FARC in a rural zone," the army said in a statement referring to the guerrilla unit involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack with explosives and improvised land mines took place in Putumayo province near Ecuador's border in the south of Colombia, where rebels and drug traffickers fight over coca fields. Colombia is the world's No. 1 cocaine exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uribe steps down this year after two terms marked by his hard line against the FARC or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. His former defense minister Juan Manuel Santos and independent Antanas Mockus are leading the race before an election this month to succeed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violence, kidnapping and bombings from the four-decade-old war have generally eased and urban attacks are now rare. The FARC has stepped up attacks before the election. But its operations are limited to ambushes and hit-and-run attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Patrick Markey in Bogota; Editing by Peter Cooney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday launched a strong defense of Berkshire Hathaway Inc's $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc and the investment bank's embattled chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett also said Berkshire swung to a $3.63 billion first-quarter profit, compared with a year-earlier $1.53 billion loss, helped by an improving economy and gains from investments and derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett said operating earnings rose 30 percent from a year earlier to $2.22 billion from $1.71 billion, helped by "a pretty good uptick" in activity among Berkshire's roughly 80 operating units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire's investment in Goldman preferred shares in September 2008 has become controversial for Buffett, given his long-standing emphasis on good corporate ethics and criticism of Wall Street excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett said he did not hold against Goldman the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil fraud lawsuit alleging the bank hid from investors that securities underlying a risky debt transaction were chosen by Paulson  Co, a hedge fund firm that was betting they would lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has called the charges unfounded, and Paulson was not charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News that investigators opened a criminal probe into Goldman has led to increased speculation about Blankfein's job security, but Buffett expressed strong support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked who should run Goldman if Blankfein were replaced, Buffett said: "If Lloyd had a twin brother, I would vote for him. I have never given that a thought."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $5 billion investment consists of preferred shares that throw off $500 million in annual dividends, plus warrants to buy an equal amount of common stock.

  (Adds comments on Goldman, succession and acquisition plans)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OMAHA, Neb., May 1 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday
launched a strong defense of Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N)
(BRKb.N) $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) and the investment bank's embattled chief executive,
Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at Berkshire's annual meeting before an estimated
40,000 shareholders, Buffett's forceful defense makes him
perhaps Goldman's most powerful defender in the wake of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's civil fraud lawsuit
on April 16 against the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett also said Berkshire swung to a $3.63 billion
first-quarter profit from a year-earlier $1.53 billion loss,
helped by an improving economy and gains from investments and
derivatives. Operating earnings rose 30 percent to $2.22
billion from $1.71 billion, reflecting "a pretty good uptick"
in business activity, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC lawsuit alleged that Goldman hid from investors the
fact that securities underlying a risky debt transaction were
chosen by Paulson  Co, a hedge fund firm that was betting they
would lose value. Goldman has called the charges unfounded, and
Paulson was not charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berkshire's investment in Goldman preferred shares in
September 2008 has become controversial for Buffett, given his
long-standing emphasis on good corporate ethics and criticism
of Wall Street excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News that investigators have opened a criminal probe into
Goldman has led to increased speculation about Blankfein's job
security but Buffett expressed strong support. [ID:nLDE63K1ON]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked who should run Goldman if Blankfein were replaced,
Buffett said: "If Lloyd had a twin brother, I would vote for
him. I have never given that a thought."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charlie Munger, who is Berkshire's vice chairman and sat
beside Buffett, said "there are plenty of CEOs I'd like to see
gone," but that Blankfein is not one of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $5 billion investment consists of preferred shares that
throw off $500 million in annual dividends, plus warrants to
buy an equal amount of common stock. Goldman can buy back, or
"call," the preferreds at a premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We love the investment," Buffett said. "Our preferreds are
paying $15 a second, so as we sit here, 'Tick, tick, tick,
tick,' that's $15 every second," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DERIVATIVES, ACQUISITIONS, SUCCESSION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett added that the SEC lawsuit was not a serious enough
event to raise reputational issues that would call into
question the Berkshire investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked whether Goldman should have disclosed it had received
a "Wells notice" from the SEC indicating possible civil
charges, Buffett said such notices are not necessarily material
to larger companies such that disclosure is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If it leads to something more serious, then we will look
at the situation at that time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett and Munger also discussed the potential overhaul of
financial regulation now being weighed in Congress. Munger
argued the system should become "less permissive" for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What we need is a new version of Glass-Steagall," Munger
said, referring to a Depression-era law that kept commercial
and investment banks separate. It was repealed in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berkshire has opposed a provision in proposed legislation
that could force it to post more collateral on its roughly 250
derivatives contracts, mainly tied to longer-term performance
of stock price indexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Buffett said Berkshire would likely "not have to put up
a dime" because the company is unlikely to be regarded as so
"dangerous to the system" as to require such collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investments and derivatives generated $1.41 billion of
Berkshire's preliminary first-quarter profit, compared with a
year-earlier $3.24 billion loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insurance profit fell just 3 percent, while profit in
regulated businesses such as utilities and newly acquired
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp, as well as manufacturing,
service  retailing businesses, roughly doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Final results are expected May 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett said he still wants to make large acquisitions,
even after spending $26.5 billion in February to buy the
railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're as interested as ever," he said. "If I get a call
for a $10 billion deal on Monday, and I like it, I will say
yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett, 79, offered no new clues as to  who might succeed
him as chief executive officer and chief investment officer at
Berkshire. He repeated that Berkshire would install a new CEO
within 24 hours of his departure, and but take more time to
install one or more chief investment officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2:58 A.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only about half the attendees at Saturday's meeting were
able to fit in the main arena at Qwest Center Omaha. Hundreds
lined up to enter hours before its 7 a.m. opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I was first in line at this door at 2:58 a.m.," said Bill
Guenther, 57, a forester from Newfane, Vermont, who said he
owns 50 Berkshire Class B shares and was at his first meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I've always been a fan of Warren Buffett," he said. "I'm
an old-school sort, I'm not a dot-commer, I'm not a techie, I
don't even have a TV at home. But I've always admired Warren.
He was called a dinosaur during the big dot-com bust, and when
all that collapsed, we saw he was doing it the right way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before the meeting, Buffett ambled around a nearby exhibit
hall featuring Berkshire companies, spending 10 minutes
marveling at a model railroad at the Burlington Northern
exhibit, and strumming a ukulele as he belted out "I've Been
Working On The Railroad" with The Quebe Sisters Band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He later picked up his usual vanilla and orange bar at a
Dairy Queen stand, but did not pay the $1 he usually does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We got his donation earlier," the vendor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett is worth $47 billion, Forbes magazine said in
March.

  (Adds Blankfein and Buffett comments, paragraphs 7, 17-18)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OMAHA, Neb., May 1 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday
launched a forceful defense of Berkshire Hathaway Inc's
(BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) and the investment bank's embattled chief executive,
Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett said he did
not hold against Goldman the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission's civil fraud lawsuit against the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC alleged on April 16 that Goldman hid from investors
that securities underlying a risky debt transaction were chosen
by Paulson  Co, a hedge fund firm betting they would lose

were replaced, Buffett said: "If Lloyd had a twin brother, I
would vote for him. I have never given that a thought."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charlie Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman, said there are
"plenty" of chief executives he would like to see replaced, but
Blankfein is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking Friday on PBS' "Charlie Rose" show, Blankfein said
"the firm is guiltless," and that Goldman would "thrive," not
merely survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Lloyd Blankfein will survive?" Rose asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Well, Lloyd Blankfein will -- yeah, I'll be here,"
Blankfein answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As CEO of Goldman Sachs?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's my expectation and that's my duty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BIG DIVIDENDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis,
Berkshire obtained $5 billion in Goldman preferred shares,
which throw off $500 million in annual dividends, plus warrants
to buy an equal amount of common stock. Goldman can buy back
the preferreds at 110 percent of face value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We love the investment," Buffett said. "I do not hold
against Goldman the fact at all" that the SEC sued. He said it
did not fall "within my category" of where reputational issues
would call into question the Berkshire investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If it leads to something more serious, then we will look
at the situation at that time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has called the SEC charges unfounded, but its
shares have lost nearly $23 billion in market value since the
lawsuit was filed, falling to about $76.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein and other Goldman executives underwent a long
grilling on Tuesday at a U.S. Senate hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, meanwhile, has also seen its reputation among the
general public take a beating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Referencing Blankfein's much-criticized comment last year
that Goldman was doing "God's work," Buffett said: "I would bet
that was delivered as a throwaway line ... but he's gotten
killed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TICK, TICK, TICK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noting Berkshire's own bond insurance business, Buffett
said he would not care who was on the other side of
transactions in deciding when to enter a contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't care if John Paulson is shorting these bonds," he
said. Referring to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, he
added: "If they told me Ben Bernanke was on the other side of
this trade, it wouldn't make a difference to me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett also speculated that the federal government is
telling Goldman not to exercise its call option, which he said
actually makes the investment look better for Berkshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our preferreds are paying $15 a second, so as we sit here,
'Tick, tick, tick, tick,' that's $15 every second," he said.
"Recent developments have probably delayed the calling of our
preferred for some time, so 'tick, tick, tick' will go on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Legal experts said it is too soon to assess whether
prosecutors will find enough evidence to file criminal charges.
Many said it is unlikely, citing the higher burden of proof in
criminal cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked whether Goldman should have disclosed that it had
received a "Wells notice" from the SEC indicating possible
civil charges, Buffett said not all such notices are material,
and that the larger the company, the less likely they will be.

launched a strong defense of Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N)
(BRKb.N) $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) and the investment bank's embattled chief executive,
Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett also said
Berkshire swung to a $3.63 billion first-quarter profit,
compared with a year-earlier $1.53 billion loss, helped by an

Buffett said: "If Lloyd had a twin brother, I would vote for

throw off $500 million in annual dividends, plus warrants to

being weighed in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Munger argued the system should be changed to be "less
permissive" to banks. "What we need is a new version of
Glass-Steagall," he said, referring to a Great Depression-era
law that kept commercial and investment banks separate. It was
repealed in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berkshire has opposed a provision in proposed legislation
that could force it to post more collateral on its roughly 250
derivatives contracts, mainly tied to longer-term performance
of stock price indexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Buffett said Berkshire would likely "not have to put up
a dime" because the company is unlikely to be regarded as so
"dangerous to the system" as to require such collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investments and derivatives generated $1.41 billion of
Berkshire's preliminary first-quarter profit, compared with a
year-earlier $3.24 billion loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insurance profit fell just 3 percent, while profit in
regulated businesses such as utilities and newly acquired
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp, as well as manufacturing,
service  retailing businesses, roughly doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Final results are expected May 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2:58 A.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attendance at the meeting is believed to have reached a
record 40,000, with only about half of attendees able to fit in
the main arena at Qwest Center Omaha. Hundreds lined up to
enter prior to its 7 a.m. opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I was first in line at this door at 2:58 a.m.," said Bill
Guenther, 57, a forester from Newfane, Vermont, who said he
owns 50 Berkshire Class B shares and was at his first meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I've always been a fan of Warren Buffett," he said. "I'm
an old-school sort, I'm not a dot-commer, I'm not a techie, I
don't even have a TV at home. But I've always admired Warren.
He was called a dinosaur during the big dot-com bust, and when
all that collapsed, we saw he was doing it the right way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before the meeting, Buffett ambled around a nearby exhibit
hall featuring Berkshire companies, spending 10 minutes
marveling at a model railroad at the Burlington Northern
exhibit, and strumming a ukulele as he belted out "I've Been
Working On The Railroad" with The Quebe Sisters Band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He later picked up his usual vanilla and orange bar at a
Dairy Queen stand, but did not pay the $1 he usually does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We got his donation earlier," the vendor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett, 79, is worth $47 billion, Forbes magazine said in
March.

&lt;p&gt;OMAHA, Neb. May 1 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday
launched a strong defense of Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N)
(BRKb.N) $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

chosen by Paulson  Co, a hedge fund firm betting the
securities would lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berkshire in September 2008 obtained $5 billion in Goldman
preferred shares, which throw off $500 million in annual
dividends, plus warrants to buy an equal amount of common
stock. Goldman can buy back the preferreds at 110 percent of
face value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We love the investment," Buffett said. He said "I do not
hold against Goldman the fact at all" that the SEC sued, and
that it did not fall "within my category" where reputational
issues would call into question the Berkshire investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If it leads to something more serious, then we will look
at the situation at that time," he said.

&lt;p&gt;OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday launched a forceful defense of Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and the investment bank's embattled chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett said he did not hold against Goldman the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's civil fraud lawsuit against the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged on April 16 that Goldman hid from investors that securities underlying a risky debt transaction were chosen by Paulson  Co, a hedge fund firm betting they would lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News that investigators have opened a criminal probe involving Goldman has led to more speculation about Blankfein's hold on his job, but Buffett expressed strong support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whom he would like to see run Goldman if Blankfein were replaced, Buffett said: "If Lloyd had a twin brother, I would vote for him. I have never given that a thought."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman, said there are "plenty" of chief executives he would like to see replaced, but Blankfein is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking Friday on PBS' "Charlie Rose" show, Blankfein said he expects to keep his job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lloyd Blankfein will survive?" Rose asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well, Lloyd Blankfein will -- yeah, I'll be here," Blankfein answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As CEO of Goldman Sachs?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's my expectation and that's my duty, and I seal that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG DIVIDENDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, Berkshire obtained $5 billion in Goldman preferred shares, which throw off $500 million in annual dividends, plus warrants to buy an equal amount of common stock. Goldman can buy back the preferreds at 110 percent of face value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We love the investment," Buffett said. "I do not hold against Goldman the fact at all" that the SEC sued. He said it did not fall "within my category" of where reputational issues would call into question the Berkshire investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it leads to something more serious, then we will look at the situation at that time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has called the SEC charges unfounded, but its shares have lost nearly $23 billion in market value since the lawsuit was filed, falling to about $76.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein and other Goldman executives underwent a long grilling on Tuesday at a U.S. Senate hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TICK, TICK, TICK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting Berkshire's own bond insurance business, Buffett said he would not care who was on the other side of transactions in deciding when to enter a contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't care if John Paulson is shorting these bonds," he said. Referring to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, he added: "If they told me Ben Bernanke was on the other side of this trade, it wouldn't make a difference to me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett also speculated that the federal government is telling Goldman not to exercise its call option, which he said actually makes the investment look better for Berkshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our preferreds are paying $15 a second, so as we sit here, 'Tick, tick, tick, tick,' that's $15 every second," he said. "Recent developments have probably delayed the calling of our preferred for some time, so 'tick, tick, tick' will go on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts said it is too soon to assess whether prosecutors will find enough evidence to file criminal charges. Many said it is unlikely, citing the higher burden of proof in criminal cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether Goldman should have disclosed that it had received a "Wells notice" from the SEC indicating possible civil charges, Buffett said not all such notices are material, and that the larger the company, the less likely they will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Buffett says has no problem with Abacus transaction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Investors not defrauded if counterparties do better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Manufacturing improving, housing recovery in sight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel and Svea Herbst-Bayliss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OMAHA, Neb., May 2 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Sunday
intensified his feisty defense of a controversial mortgage
transaction marketed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), saying
the investment bank's behavior does not warrant public fury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett also said he is seeing real signs of improvement in
the economy, especially in manufacturing, though it will take
another year for a sustainable housing recovery to take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's third-richest person spoke at a press
conference, a day after his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc
(BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) held its annual meeting for tens of thousands
of shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berkshire owns $5 billion of Goldman preferred shares with
a hefty 10 percent dividend, and Buffett has become Goldman's
most powerful defender since it became the target of a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission's civil fraud lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The April 16 complaint alleged that Goldman hid from
clients that securities underlying the mortgage transaction,
Abacus, were chosen by Paulson  Co, a hedge fund firm betting
they would lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman rejected the allegations, and Paulson was not
charged. Buffett on Saturday said he loved the $5 billion
investment and defended Goldman's chief, Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't have a problem with the Abacus transaction at all,
and I think I understand it better than most," Buffett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sitting beside Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger,
Buffett said he saw nothing in Goldman's behavior to justify
the intense criticism it faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's very strange to say, at the end of the transaction,
that if the other guy is smarter than you, that you have been
defrauded," Buffett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett also said he had no reason to believe Goldman
misled ACA, which helped create Abacus, about Paulson's
involvement, and that it should not have mattered to ACA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Any bond insurer that is making a decision about what to
insure and what to charge for it should not care a whit about
who is on the other side of the transaction," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett said Berkshire itself is better off because it
regularly enlists investment banks, such as Goldman, including
when it was much smaller in the late 1960s and needed capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LIGHTER MOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like shareholders, including the many who streamed to
Buffett's barber to get a trim, Buffett and Munger appeared
more relaxed at this year's events relative to last year, when
worries about the economy and swine flu prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the press conference, Buffett took a bag of peanut
brittle from Munger -- saying "I'll get that Charlie" -- and
ostentatiously gnawed it open with his teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just over an hour earlier, Buffett appeared at the nearby,
Berkshire-owned Borsheim's Fine Jewelry, where he played table
tennis with Ariel Hsing, 14, the top-ranked U.S. female player
under age 20. Buffett unveiled, as a joke, a giant blue paddle
to give him a better shot of winning. (Didn't help.) Several
Berkshire-themed items at Borsheim's sold out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the press conference, Buffett's said Berkshire's
manufacturing businesses, including the conglomerate Marmon
Holdings Inc and toolmaker Iscar Metalworking Cos, are
benefiting from "pretty significant improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said luxury goods units including Borsheim's and the
NetJets Inc plane leasing unit are seeing improved business,
albeit from a "very, very low level," while results for
housing-sensitive businesses such as Acme Brick Co and the
insulation maker Johns Manville remain "very poor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet Buffett cautioned policymakers not to artificially
stimulate housing sales and perhaps derail a recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What would bother me is if we were to overstimulate them,
and create a permanent overhang," he said. "I want to have a
sustainable recovery, and I don't think you're going to have to
wait more than a year for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the press conference, Buffett maintained enthusiasm for
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, saying "there's no one
in the United States that I know of whom I would rather have
running the Fed than Ben Bernanke."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "HIGH-IQ BOOBS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett has a much longer-term horizon for his largest
acquisition, the $26.5 billion February takeover of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The key factor in our railroad investment is whether more
people are moving goods 10, 20 or 50 years from now," he said.
"The odds of that happening are extremely high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffett and Munger had harsh words for some professions,
including accountants and investment bankers, whom they said in
part caused the 2008 crisis because they were too greedy and
could not stand up to management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Everywhere you look this problem has been caused by
high-IQ asininity" perpetrated by "high-IQ boobs," Munger said.
"People who know the edge of their own competency are safe, and
those who don't, aren't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Munger added: "Investment banking will behave more
responsibly if we as citizens force it to behave more
responsibly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while Berkshire wants to make non-U.S. acquisitions,
Buffett admitted its size rules out most countries, where the
businesses or financial markets are too small. Berkshire's
market value is about $190 billion, Reuters data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Business opportunities, we can stretch out to 30 or 40
countries," Buffett said. "Our problem is finding them."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - April's jobs report and a slew of other economic indicators may bolster U.S. stocks this week, but jitters over Greece's debt and investigations into Goldman Sachs will test the market's resiliency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Sunday stood by his feisty defense of a controversial mortgage transaction marketed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc, saying the investment bank's behavior did not warrant public opprobrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I don't have a problem with the Abacus transaction at all, and I think I understand it better than most," Buffett said at a press conference. He added that he saw nothing in Goldman's behavior to justify more criticism than Wall Street gets generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Buffett's insurance and investment company, owns $5 billion of preferred shares that throw off a 10 percent annual dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett said at Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday that he still loved the investment, and offered forceful support for Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defense has made Buffett perhaps Goldman's most powerful defender following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's civil fraud lawsuit on April 16 against the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That lawsuit alleged that Goldman hid from investors that securities underlying Abacus were chosen by Paulson  Co, a hedge fund firm that was betting they would lose value. Goldman has rejected the allegations, and Paulson was not charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very strange to say, at the end of the transaction, that if the other guy is smarter than you, that you have been defrauded," Buffett said. "It seems to me that that's what they are saying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett also said he had no reason to believe that Goldman misled ACA, which helped create the transaction, about Paulson's involvement -- and that it should not matter to ACA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any bond insurer that is making a decision about what to insure and what to charge for it should not care a whit about who is on the other side of the transaction," he said.

 (Adds Buffett comments, background, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel and Svea Herbst-Bayliss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OMAHA, Neb., May 2 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Sunday

he still loved the investment, and offered forceful support for
Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The defense has made Buffett perhaps Goldman's most

interim chairman in 1991 to clean up internally after a
Treasury auction scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said his big fear at the time was that a thorough
scrubbing of internal processes could result in "something
coming up that I didn't know about."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein could support the Volcker Rule depending on its details, he said during an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It has a broad definition that invites a study, and regulations and depending on what it says I could," Blankfein said, according to a transcript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that parts of the Volcker plan - which basically aims to put limitations and restrictions on proprietary trading by banks - are warranted but not all versions of it would have his support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am not really sure where it comes out.

&lt;p&gt; May 2 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKa.N)
(BRKb.N) Chairman and Chief Executive Warren Buffett and Vice
Chairman Charlie Munger draw large crowds to Omaha each year
for the company's annual meeting, fielding questions from
shareholders for more than five hours.

 This year's meeting had a more upbeat tone than last
year's, when fallout from the financial crisis and fears of
swine flu dampened the mood. Buffett and Munger snacked on
peanut brittle and fudge from See's Candies, a Berkshire unit,
as they tackled shareholder questions by offering a mixture of
business wisdom, wit and occasional humorous asides.

 The following are excerpted comments from the meeting:

 ON BERKSHIRE INVESTMENT IN GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC (GS.N)
AND THE BANK'S "ABACUS" TRANSACTION:

 Buffett, discussing ABN Amro investment in Abacus: "It's
hard for me to get terribly sympathetic ... The bank made a
dumb credit deal."

 Buffett, explaining why the thinking of a party on the
other side of a trade is irrelevant to making your own
investment decision: "If they told me (Federal Reserve
Chairman) Ben Bernanke was on the other side of the trade, it
wouldn't make a difference to me ... For the life of me, I
don't see whether it makes any difference whether it was (hedge
fund manager) John Paulson on the other side of the deal, or
whether it was Goldman Sachs on the other side of the deal, or
whether it was Berkshire Hathaway on the other side of the
deal.... I don't care if John Paulson is shorting these bonds.
I'm going to have no worries that he has superior knowledge."

 Buffett, on $5 billion investment in Goldman, which can be
called by Goldman, and why recent events may benefit Berkshire:
"Our preferreds are paying $15 a second, so as we sit here,
'tick, tick, tick, tick,' that's $15 every second.... The
Federal government has probably been telling Goldman you can't
call that preferred until we tell you we can.... Recent
developments have probably delayed the calling of our preferred
for some time, so 'tick, tick, tick' will go on, and we'll be
getting $500 million a year.... We love the investment."

 Buffett, on experience in fixing problems at Salomon Inc:
"Get it right, get it out, get it fast, and get it over."

 Munger, on whether Goldman should have disclosed "Wells
notice" sooner: "There has to be some materiality standard."

 Buffett, on replacing Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein: "If
Lloyd had a twin brother, I would vote for him."

 Munger, on replacing Blankfein: "There are plenty of CEOs
I'd like to see gone," but Blankfein is not one of them.

 Buffett: "I do not hold against Goldman the fact that an
allegation has been made (by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission). If it leads to something more serious, then we
will look at the situation at that time."

 ON REGULATORY REFORM AND BERKSHIRE'S DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS:

 Buffett: "If Berkshire were found to be dangerous to the
system, then we could be required to post collateral on
retroactive contracts.... If the bill passes tomorrow, we would
not have to put up a dime."

 Munger: "What we need is a new version of Glass-Steagall.
(Banks) should have a much simpler and safer way of doing
business."

 Munger, if he were put in charge of overhauling financial
regulation: "I would make Paul Volcker look like a sissy."

 ON GREEK DEBT CRISIS AND CURRENCIES:

 Buffett on Greece: "I really don't know how this movie
ends, and I try not to go to movies like that.... This will be
high drama, in my view."

 Buffett on currencies: Events of the past few years would
make him "more bearish on currencies of all kinds.... If you
really could run budget deficits of 10 percent of your GDP and
could do it for a long period of time, the world would have
been doing it for a long time before this."

 ON SUCCESSION AT BERKSHIRE:

 Buffett: "If I die tonight, there will be a new CEO in
place in 24 hours. (As for new chief investment officers),
investors don't need anything done next week. I can go on
vacation. They could wait a month, they could wait two
months.... I did just have a physical. It came out fine."

 ON THE ECONOMY:

 Buffett: "The prospects for significant inflation have
increased."

 Buffett, on stimulus efforts: "They may well have been the
correct responses, but we may find that weaning ourselves from
the medicine is harder than solving the original (problem)."

 Buffett: "We will hire people when we have something for
them to do.... I don't think Berkshire Hathaway should be the
social safety net.... Significant unemployment (is) not going
to go away fast, although it is going to go away."

 Buffett, on low interest rates: "People talk about easy
money policies, but this is easy for people who've got the
money.... If we do run into trouble, the blame should not go to
the (Federal Reserve), the blame should go to the Congress."

 ON CHINA, WHERE BERKSHIRE INVESTS IN BYD CO (1211.HK):

 Munger:  "I always thought the Chinese people had enormous
potential for huge and rapid progress.... China is setting a
new record for advancement of civilization at a very rapid
rate. It's fun to watch."

 ON LARGE ACQUISITIONS:

 Buffett: "If we get a couple of, three or four serious
calls that meet our criteria, that's a good year.... We're as
interested as ever.... I would love it if, Monday morning, my
phone rings with some big deal.... If I get a call for a $10
billion deal on Monday, and I like it, I will say yes."

 ASIDES:

 Buffett: "I like to look in the mirror and say enough of my
shareholders love me."

 Munger, often after Buffett finished speaking: "I've got
nothing to add."

 Buffett, after Munger once finished speaking, "I've got
nothing to add."

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, May 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
www.EnergyStockAlerts.com is a premier source for microcap and blue chip
research and commentary.

    The scale and carnage of BP's recent oil spill disaster continues to grow
on a daily basis. The Wall Street Journal, citing industry experts, on
Friday estimated the size of the continuing oil leak at 25,000 barrels a
day (up from the U.S. government's Thursday estimate of 5,000 barrels a
day). BP shares have fallen 12% since the disaster.

    The accident has forced President Barack Obama to put on hold politically
sensitive plans to expand offshore U.S. oil drilling. In March, President
Obama unveiled plans for a limited expansion, in part to try to win
Republican support for climate change legislation. The White House
announced Saturday morning the President will travel to the gulf coast
today to get an update on efforts to contain the massive spill.

    Yesterday news reports that several banks (including Goldman Sachs, GS
and Citigroup, C), recommended buying BP shares. They argue investors are
over reacting since the April 20 explosion.

    Yesterday oil giant BP (BP) released news that it has tested the
dispersants (manufactured by Nalco Holding Co. (HAL)), on Friday night
and authorized it's use on a larger scale. BP also added, it is looking
for additional suppliers to begin manufacturing the material in mass
quantities.

    Investors should note that shares of companies that provided services or
operated the sunken Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, including Halliburton
(HAL) fell sharply as worries deepened about liability from spill.

    Oil Prices Expectations in 2010 and 2011

    Barclays recently stated oil prices are likely to stay in the range of
$80-$90, while other Barclays' analysts state, If Asian demand can
grow at such rapid rates when prices are in the $70 to $80 range, then
prices cannot stay in that range for much longer.

    Considering the Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI) is quoted as saying
Asian demand for oil will increase by more than 2 million barrels per
day, what is the logical conclusion? What most people don't realize is
the depth of industries and products that rely on oil and gas.

    Oil is involved in nearly every aspect of manufacturing - from the
production of chemicals, plastics and detergents to medicines, building
materials and even clothing. Petroleum-based products make up a
significant portion of the materials Americans use every day.

    Why do the wealthiest people in the world invest in oil and gas?

    It comes down to the basic economics of supply and demand. Energy is in
high demand throughout the world. The global economy is growing. And
domestic consumption is growing.

    What does this means for the average American investor?

    Take a look at microcap companies like Paradigm Oil and Gas, Inc., PDGO.
Less than a month ago PDGO was sitting at $0.40 per share. We've watched
this domestic diva steadily rise with the release of great news,
including their 100% property acquisition with over 10 million barrels of
probable reserves. PDGO closed last Friday at $1.29. That's a solid ROI
of over 300%!

    How does the normal investor see a 100% return on oil?

    In our opinion, it looks like ( PDGO:OTCBB ) is heading there in a hurry.
But they are not the only domestic, oil and gas company that is showing
some great investment opportunity in the OTCBB energy sector. With more
good news expected, PDGO will continue to generate significant investor
interest in the company. Our recommendation is to keep PDGO on your radar
and watch this week's reactions across the web as the stock continues to
move north.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has released a new version of its Producer software, fixing a critical security problem that plagued the product for several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producer is a free add-on tool that helps users capture and add multimedia components to their PowerPoint presentations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last March, Microsoft warned of a critical security bug in the product, but it didn't release a new update. Instead, it said that Producer 2003 users should simply uninstall their software. On Monday, however, it posted an update, and is now recommending that "all customers using Producer 2003 upgrade to the new version," according to a blog post from the Microsoft Security Response Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in March, Microsoft said it was not updating Producer 2003 because it wasn't designed for automatic updates. "Based on our investigation, we determined that the best way to protect the vast majority of customers was to release an update addressing the components that shipped with Windows," Microsoft said in a blog post. "We recommend that customers either uninstall the application or apply an available Microsoft Fix It to disassociate the project file type from the application to add an extra layer of security."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flaw, which has to do with the way Producer reads certain file formats, also affects Windows Movie Maker. But Microsoft issued a Movie Maker patch when it first warned of the issue in March. A similar product, Windows Live Movie Maker -- which runs on Vista and Windows 7 -- is not affected by the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft doesn't know of anyone exploiting the bug in online attacks, but it's worried that hackers might be able to use it to install unauthorized software on victims' computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Producer 2003 was a little-known product," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations with security vendor nCircle, via instant message. "What we have is the official replacement for the flawed product."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another big player may enter the ring in the Apple-Adobe brouhaha: Either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission will look into the legality of Apple's Flash ban, according to a story in The New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOJ and FTC are negotiating over which organization is going to take up the anti-trust inquiry. The inquiry will focus on whether the ban kills competition by shackling programmers from using third-party developer tools, a source told The New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Apple may just be an evil empire in the making, writes CIO.com's Tom Kaneshige. | Last week was a wild one for Apple. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple CEO Steve Jobs blasted Flash in a blog post last week. He complained that Flash is closed technology that drains battery life. Thus, iPhones and iPads won't be supporting Flash anytime soon. Adobe's stock fell two percent that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen fired back, saying Jobs' technical complaints are a mere "smokescreen" to Apple's real intent: apps that run only on Apple mobile devices. Now mobile app developers will need "two workflows," one for the iPhone OS and another for the other mobile platforms that support Flash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision over which department will make the inquiry is reportedly only days away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ironic twist, Apple historically has played the role of the underdog, calling for inquiries into the monopolistic behavior of its competitors. With the success of the iPhone, however, Apple is now the giant in question, with its actions subject to review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Kaneshige is a senior writer for CIO.com in Silicon Valley.

&lt;p&gt;IBM bolstered its data-integration portfolio Monday, announcing the acquisition of Cast Iron Systems, which focuses on connecting on-premise systems with cloud-based software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cast Iron's capabilities will help IBM customers build hybrid clouds that combine on-premise applications, public cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services, and private cloud deployments. Its technology is available as a physical or virtual appliance, or a cloud service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Blue's software division has made more than 55 acquisitions since 2003, according to a statement. This one makes sense for a number of reasons, said Redmonk analyst Michael Cot&#233;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cast Iron has already built out integrations for many of the top SaaS products, such as Salesforce.com and Oracle CRM on Demand, Cot&#233; said. "For a company like IBM, if there's someone who's already solved that problem, it's an easier thing to buy [them] than do it on your own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's large enterprise customers are also "looking to them to be the trusted source for all this cloud hoopla," and the company stands to make ample services revenue in connection with developing hybrid clouds, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the deal provides evidence that cloud computing is reaching a more mature stage among enterprises, which are already showing a willingness to use SaaS (software as a service) applications, he said: "When you get past the first rung, the next step is integrating with all sorts of on-premises processes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is buying a strong company in Cast Iron, and technology that could have broad appeal, said Rebecca Wettemann, vice president of research at Nucleus Research. "It's a great way for IBM to go back to Cognos customers, SPSS customers, even Oracle and SAP customers and say, 'we can be your one-stop-shop for integration in the cloud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it will be interesting to see how IBM handles Cast Iron's existing partnerships, which include deals with Oracle, Google and Microsoft, she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cast Iron's existing customers shouldn't have too much to worry about, and could even benefit from greater product investment by IBM, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc, in a rare move, disclosed information about the many lawsuits and shareholder challenges facing the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which made the disclosure in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange commission, has been criticized for being too tight-lipped about its legal entanglements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disclosure came nearly a week after Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein faced off with a Senate panel about the role the dominant Wall Street bank played in the subprime mortgage market meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes after Goldman lawyers received a subpoena to testify or give information in an insider trading case that parallels the U.S. government's case against the Galleon hedge fund's founder, Raj Rajaratnam, according to a court document made public on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman filing says several shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the bank, accusing it and its executives of "breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, abuse of control, mismanagement and unjust enrichment ... and challenging the accuracy and completeness of GS Inc's disclosure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which included copies of a half dozen shareholder complaints in the filing and a shareholder letter, said the lawsuits seek declaratory relief, compensatory damages, restitution and corporate governance reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholder lawsuits began pouring in after the SEC accused Goldman of failing to tell investors the securities underlying a so-called synthetic collateralized debt obligation were chosen by billionaire hedge fund investor John Paulson, whose fund was betting that the CDO would lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also has been criticized for not telling shareholders that it received a Wells Notice last summer from the SEC, signaling the likelihood of civil charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the shareholder lawsuits allege Goldman's failure to disclose the Wells Notice cost them dearly, given the 21 percent drop in the company's shares since the filing of the SEC civil suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GALLEON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also received a subpoena to testify or provide information in a case of alleged insider trading, according to a court document made public on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subpoena to Goldman Sachs  Co and Goldman Sachs Execution and Clearing LP on April 15, requests "all trading records and monthly account statements associated with account number UF703881" of Michael Kimelman, a former trader at Quad Capital LLC and Incremental Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimelman is charged in a case running parallel with the one U.S. prosecutors are pursuing against Galleon hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam. Prosecutors described the probe as the biggest-ever U.S. hedge fund insider trading case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimelman was arrested and charged last November 5 along with Zvi Goffer, a onetime Galleon employee who later started the Incremental Capital trading firm and five other traders or lawyers. They have all pleaded not guilty to an indictment and are free on bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subpoena, signed by presiding Manhattan federal court Judge Richard Sullivan, was submitted by Kimelman's lawyer. It asks representatives of the investment bank's legal department to appear before the judge at a hearing in the case on May 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Goldman Sachs could not immediately be reached to comment. Lawyers for Kimelman could not be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors have accused Rajaratnam of obtaining confidential information on Goldman, but have not formally included those in the charges, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Rajaratnam sought information on the purchase by Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc of preferred Goldman shares before the transaction became public in 2008. They also said he conspired to obtain confidential information about Goldman's quarterly earnings before public announcements on or about June 17, 2008, and December 16, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sri Lankan-born Rajaratnam, a U.S. citizen, has pleaded not guilty and is free on bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder and Grant McCool; editing by John Wallace, Maureen Bavdek, Andre Grenon and Robert MacMillan)&lt;/p&gt;

risks are now comparable to those of Morgan Stanley (MS.N) for
the first time since October 2007 based on prices of credit

traded at around 162 basis points on Monday, or $162,000 per

from more than 100 basis points in April 2009, Markit data

bank on April 16 was charged with fraud by the Securities and

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Chevron Profits Soar on Oil Prices

Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) -- the second largest U.S. oil company -- posted
significantly better-than-expected first-quarter 2010 earnings. As has been the
case with the other oil majors that have already reported, such as Exxon (NYSE:
XOM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), BP Plc (NYSE: BP) and Royal Dutch Shell PLC
(NYSE: RDS.A), results were boosted by higher crude realizations. Robust
upstream production growth also contributed towards Chevron`s strong results. 

Earnings per share (excluding foreign-currency effects and employee reduction
charges) came in at $2.46, blowing past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.94
and the year-ago adjusted profit of 75 cents. Quarterly revenue of $48.2 billion
was up 33.4% from the year-earlier level. 

Chevron`s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 4.5% from the
year-earlier level to 2.8 million oil-equivalent barrels per day (MMBOE/d),
driven by new project start-ups (in the U.S., Nigeria, and Angola), expansion of
capacity at Tengiz in Kazakhstan, together with the restoration of Gulf of
Mexico volumes that were offline in the first quarter of 2009 due to hurricanes.


U.S. volumes rose 9.4%, while Chevron`s international operations experienced an
approximately 2.9% rise in output. Gains on the production front were supported
by higher realized oil prices, resulting in a 242.8% year-over-year rise in
upstream earnings to $4.7 billion.

&lt;p&gt; * Accused trader wants Goldman to provide records&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Trader swept up in broad hedge fund insider probe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Grant McCool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Lawyers for Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) have been served a subpoena to testify or provide
information in a closely watched case of illegal insider
trading allegations, according to a court document made public
on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The subpoena to Goldman Sachs  Co and Goldman Sachs
Execution and Clearing LP on April 15, requests "all trading
records and monthly account statements associated with account
number UF703881" of Michael Kimelman, a former trader at Quad
Capital LLC and Incremental Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kimelman is charged in a case running parallel with the one
U.S. prosecutors are pursuing against Galleon hedge fund
founder Raj Rajaratnam. U.S. prosecutors described the probe as
the biggest hedge fund insider trading case ever in the United
States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kimelman was arrested and charged last Nov. 5 along with
Zvi Goffer, a onetime Galleon employee who later started the
Incremental Capital trading firm, and five other traders or
lawyers. They have all pleaded not guilty to an indictment and
are free on bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The subpoena, signed by presiding Manhattan federal court
Judge Richard Sullivan, was submitted by Kimelman's lawyer
Morris Fodeman. It asks representatives of the investment
bank's legal department to appear before the judge at a hearing
in the case on May 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No other details were provided, other than that Goldman
acknowledged receipt on April 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Goldman Sachs could not immediately be
reached to comment. Lawyers for Kimelman could not immediately
be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. prosecutors have accused Rajaratnam of obtaining
confidential information on Goldman, but have not formally
included those in the charges, according to court documents.
Prosecutors said Rajaratnam sought information on Warren
Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKa.N) purchase of preferred
shares in Goldman before the transaction became public on Sept.
23, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also said he conspired to obtain confidential
information about the quarterly earnings of Goldman before
public announcements on or about June 17, 2008, and Dec. 16,
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sri Lankan-born Rajaratnam, a U.S. citizen, has pleaded
not guilty and is free on bail. His co-defendant, former New
Castle Funds LLC trader Danielle Chiesi, has also pleaded not
guilty. Their trial is scheduled to start on Oct. 25 before
Judge Richard Holwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eleven defendants have pleaded guilty out of 21 charged.
Eight people, some of them Rajaratnam's former friends and
business associates or onetime Galleon employees, have signed
cooperation agreements with prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cases are USA v. Goffer et al, U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York, No. 10-056 and USA v Raj
Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi, No. 09-01184.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms J.P. Morgan Commercial Mortgage Finance Corp.'s mortgage
pass-through certificates, series 2000-C9, and assigns Loss Severity (LS)
ratings as follows: 

--Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$5 million class F at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable; 

--$14.3 million class G at 'AA/LS2'; Outlook Stable; 

--$20.4 million class H at 'BB+/LS2'; Outlook Stable. 

Fitch does not rate the $16.4 million class J certificates. The class K and
class NR certificates have been reduced to zero due to realized losses. The
class A-1, A-2, B, C, D, and E have been paid in full. 

The rating affirmations are due to an increase in Fitch expected losses
following Fitch's prospective review of potential stresses and expected losses
associated with specially serviced assets. Fitch expects losses of 6%
(approximately $3.3 million) of the remaining pool balance from the loans in
special servicing and the loans that are not expected to refinance at maturity
based on Fitch's refinance test. 

As of the April 2010 distribution date, the pool's collateral balance has paid
down 93.4% to $54.1 million from $814.4 million at issuance. Three of the
remaining loans have defeased (13.5%). 

As of April 2010, there are six specially serviced loans (34%). The largest
specially serviced loan is secured by a 1,017,399 square foot (sf) industrial
facility located in Elizabeth, NJ. The loan transferred to special servicing in
October 2009 for imminent default due to market conditions, which have prevented
the borrower from fully leasing the property. The special servicer is working
with the borrower to cure the default. 

The second largest specially serviced loan is secured by a 250 unit multifamily
property located in Colorado Springs, CO. The loan is currently in foreclosure
and the special servicer is working with the borrower to take title to the
property or payoff the loan. 

Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining non-defeased loans by applying a
10% reduction to 2008 fiscal year end net operating income and applying an
adjusted market cap rate between 7.5% and 10.5% to determine value. 

Similar to Fitch's prospective analysis of recent vintage CMBS, each loan also
underwent a refinance test by applying an 8% interest rate and 30-year
amortization schedule based on the stressed cash flow. Loans that could
refinance to a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 times or higher were
considered to payoff at maturity. Under this scenario, one loan is not expected
to payoff at maturity and incurs a loss when compared to Fitch's stressed value.


Additional information on Fitch's amended criteria for analyzing recent vintage
U.S. CMBS is available in the July 7, 2009 report, 'Surveillance Methodology for
Recent Vintage U.S. CMBS,' which is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' under

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Zamansky &amp; Associates LLC ("Zamansky") (http://www.zamansky.com) and Lovell
Stewart Halebian Jacobson LLP ("Lovell Stewart") (http://www.lshllp.com) today
announced the filing of a class action complaint on April 30, 2010 in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of
purchasers of shares of the common stock of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ("Goldman"
or the "Company") (NYSE:GS) between January 2, 2007 and the time it was publicly
revealed on April 16, 2010 that the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
had sued Goldman (the "Class Period") in connection with its misconduct relating
to the structuring and sale of ABACUS 2007-AC1, seeking to pursue remedies under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). The case has been
assigned Civil Action No. 10-cv-3616 before the Hon. Barbara Jones. 

If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than
Friday, June 25, 2010. If you wish to discuss this action or have any questions
concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff`s
counsel, Jacob H. Zamansky or Edward H. Glenn, Jr. at 212-742-1414, or via
e-mail at Jacob@zamansky.com. You can view a copy of the complaint as filed at
http://www.zamansky.com. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to
serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do
nothing and remain an absent class member. 

The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants failed to
disclose material adverse facts about the Company`s true financial condition,
sources of revenues, business and prospects in violation of the Exchange Act.
Specifically, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose that: (i)
the Company had, in violation of applicable law, not fully disclosed the facts
and circumstances concerning the formation and sale of the ABACUS 2007-AC1 deal
and other similar CDO deals to investors and as a result had engaged in
materially misleading conduct; (ii) the Company had, in fact, bet against its
clients and constructed collateralized debt obligations that were likely, if not
designed, to fail while at the same time earning substantial revenues from the
such conduct; (iii) the Company had received a Wells Notice from the SEC about
the ABACUS transaction but failed to inform shareholders of this fact until the
SEC brought a lawsuit against the Company alleging fraud based upon the same
conduct described in the Wells Notice; and (iv) should the SEC file a formal
complaint, as it eventually did, Goldman could potentially suffer material
adverse effects to its core business lines and profitability, among other
negative and deleterious results. 

After the market opened on April 16, 2010, it was revealed that Goldman`s U.S.
broker-dealer, GS, had been sued by the SEC "for making materially misleading
statements and omissions in connection" with ABACUS 2007-AC1. As news of
Goldman`s misconduct reached the market, Goldman shares immediately plummeted
$24.05 in price, declining from $184.27 per share on April 15, 2010 to close at
$160.70 per share on April 16, 2010. Goldman shares fell an additional $15.04
per share on April 30, 2010 to close at $145.20 per share in response to
investor concerns about the potential criminality of Goldman's misconduct. 

Plaintiff is represented by the law firms of Zamansky &amp; Associates LLC and
Lovell Stewart Halebian Jacobson LLP, two of the country's premier national law
firms that represent institutional and individual investors in class action,
complex securities and corporate governance litigation. The firms have achieved
many notable results for investors over many years, including some of the

closely: BP p.l.c (BP), Citigroup Inc. Copyright, General Electric
Company (GE), Pfizer Inc. (PFE).

    We Believe BP needs to be watched extremely closely while facing negative
press, and presidential blame due to the recent spill in the gulf. Our
team feels that at these levels, Citigroup could see upward momentum in
the near term. When GE announced today that it will add an additional 220
jobs in Michigan, bringing its expected total to 1300 new high
value jobs, we feel it is shows expansion and has great
expectations. Our team is watching Pfizer closely after High Court
rejects appeal by the company in investor suit.

the success of our subscribers! In today's markets knowledge is more than
power, its money. This is why our team at PremierePennyStocks.com scours
the markets to keep our subscribers tuned in to undervalued stocks with

stock companies - companies that allow our investors to bring home big
profits. We work diligently and provide all investors - large or small -
an opportunity to track stocks with the potential to make big gains.

    Many of our subscribers aren't stock brokers, or day traders, they're
hard working everyday employees attempting to diversify, and achieve
maximum gains in minimal time. Our years of experience can be your best
resource for investing. We only provide our subscribers with alerts that

    PremierePennyStocks.com alerts investors to promising small cap
companies, most of which are overlooked by your run of the mill Wall
Street investment advisors. Since you do not need to have a million
dollar portfolio to benefit in the small cap market, many investors are
searching for credible micro and small cap investments due to the
enormous gains potential. While it's hard to find a $5.00 stock that goes
to $50.00, finding a micro or small cap stock that goes from $0.05 to
$0.50 can be a weekly occurrence.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM said it bought privately held software company Cast Iron Systems to bolster its expertise in cloud computing, an increasingly popular technology that helps companies cut costs by enabling access to software online.&lt;/p&gt;

(CRM.N), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), NetSuite Inc (N.N) and SAP
(SAPG.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said it expects global cloud computing market,
including "software as a service," to grow to $126 billion by
2012 from $47 billion in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said they expect deals in cloud computing by IBM
and such other technology vendors such as Hewlett-Packard Co
(HPQ.N), Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and EMC Corp (EMC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Targets could include similar small companies specializing
in cloud computing, like Boomi, Hubspan and informatica, they
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think software as a service will continue to undergo a
shakeout, absolutely," said Forrester Research analyst Liz
Herbert. "There are lots of these small providers in spaces
like integration and billing and provisioning ... We are seeing
and we expect to see more acquisitions activity from major
providers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM does not always announce terms of individual deals but
has said it spent a gross $1 billion on acquisitions in the
first quarter. For all of 2009, it spent $1.5 billion,
including $1.2 billion cash to buy business analytics company
SPSS Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cast Iron, whose approximately 75 employees will join IBM,
said the deal will help it gain broader customer reach. Its
current clients include Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) and ShoreTel
Inc (SHOR.O).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - With Goldman Sachs taking a public beating over its perceived role in the financial meltdown, investors eyeing the bank's plunging shares may be tempted to look beyond its growing legal trouble and take a chance on longer term gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs Inc hit their lowest level since last summer on Friday after news reports that U.S. federal prosecutors launched a criminal investigation. It comes less than two weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Goldman with civil fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this poses a tough question: sell the shares to stem the pain; or nab them at an enticing discount?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SELL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multitude of risks and uncertainty now facing Goldman on several fronts is the greatest concern, said Matthew Albrecht, a banking and brokerage analyst at SP Equity Research. He downgraded the bank to "sell" from "hold" Friday, and cut his price target for Goldman to $140 from $180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've seen the SEC fraud charges a few weeks ago, and we saw the hearings on Capitol Hill this week that painted many of its employees in an unfavorable light, rightly or wrongly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combine that with the criminal investigation and the pending financial reform legislation that could affect Goldman's business model, "and I see a riskier investment here with downside more likely than upside," Albrecht said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are just better alternatives if you want to be exposed to the big banks or the big financial firms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC lawsuit and the criminal probe could damage Goldman's reputation in the long-term, the analyst added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is going to hurt their business in an industry that is based on reputation and your relationships with other people, with other firms. I certainly think this makes their job a lot more difficult to gain new clients and to retain older clients, and that's kind of reflected in my downgrade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ralph Cole, a portfolio manager at Portland, Oregon-based Ferguson Wellman Capital Management, which manages $2.6 billion in assets and owns Goldman stock, said: "I've been pretty convinced it's dead money for the next three to six months until you get some more clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To really be a catalyst for this stock they need to not just settle one of these cases, they need to win it. And that would take too long," Cole added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the shares are a 'buy' here," said Paul Harris, portfolio manager at Toronto-based Avenue Investment Management, which has C$140 million ($138 million) under management and owns Goldman shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is not an expensive stock, and if you look at earnings -- which people are not even thinking about -- you can see that they're very strong, and that they continue to do well," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the global marketplace, people won't stop dealing with Goldman. It's too hard to not include these guys in a deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC charged Goldman, the world's most powerful investment bank, with allegedly hiding information from investors about a mortgage-related security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is an open question as to whether Goldman did anything illegal, Harris said. "The people who bought these things were sophisticated people, and they actually knew that there was a seller on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the news media start to calm down again, the stock will head up," he added. "No news is good news for Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cole, of Ferguson Wellman, said: "If you could buy this stock and not look at it for a year, I think you'd feel really good. Longer term there's real value in this company, and longer term that's what wins out for most investors," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have shareholders and investors that are patient and aren't going to worry about the headline risk, I think you can feel good about this purchase today at these levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Spicer and Maria Aspan, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Sunday intensified his feisty defense of a controversial mortgage transaction marketed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), saying the investment bank's behavior does not warrant public fury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buffett also said he is seeing real signs of improvement in the economy, especially in manufacturing, though it will take another year for a sustainable housing recovery to take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's third-richest person spoke at a press conference, a day after his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) held its annual meeting for tens of thousands of shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire owns $5 billion of Goldman preferred shares with a hefty 10 percent dividend, and Buffett has become Goldman's most powerful defender since it became the target of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's civil fraud lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April 16 complaint alleged that Goldman hid from clients that securities underlying the mortgage transaction, Abacus, were chosen by Paulson  Co, a hedge fund firm betting they would lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman rejected the allegations, and Paulson was not charged. Buffett on Saturday said he loved the $5 billion investment and defended Goldman's chief, Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't have a problem with the Abacus transaction at all, and I think I understand it better than most," Buffett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting beside Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, Buffett said he saw nothing in Goldman's behavior to justify the intense criticism it faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very strange to say, at the end of the transaction, that if the other guy is smarter than you, that you have been defrauded," Buffett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett also said he had no reason to believe Goldman misled ACA, which helped create Abacus, about Paulson's involvement, and that it should not have mattered to ACA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any bond insurer that is making a decision about what to insure and what to charge for it should not care a whit about who is on the other side of the transaction," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett said Berkshire itself is better off because it regularly enlists investment banks, such as Goldman, including when it was much smaller in the late 1960s and needed capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIGHTER MOOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like shareholders, including the many who streamed to Buffett's barber to get a trim, Buffett and Munger appeared more relaxed at this year's events relative to last year, when worries about the economy and swine flu prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the press conference, Buffett took a bag of peanut brittle from Munger -- saying "I'll get that Charlie" -- and ostentatiously gnawed it open with his teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over an hour earlier, Buffett appeared at the nearby, Berkshire-owned Borsheim's Fine Jewelry, where he played table tennis with Ariel Hsing, 14, the top-ranked U.S. female player under age 20. Buffett unveiled, as a joke, a giant blue paddle to give him a better shot of winning. (Didn't help.) Several Berkshire-themed items at Borsheim's sold out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the press conference, Buffett's said Berkshire's manufacturing businesses, including the conglomerate Marmon Holdings Inc and toolmaker Iscar Metalworking Cos, are benefiting from "pretty significant improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said luxury goods units including Borsheim's and the NetJets Inc plane leasing unit are seeing improved business, albeit from a "very, very low level," while results for housing-sensitive businesses such as Acme Brick Co and the insulation maker Johns Manville remain "very poor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Buffett cautioned policymakers not to artificially stimulate housing sales and perhaps derail a recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What would bother me is if we were to overstimulate them, and create a permanent overhang," he said. "I want to have a sustainable recovery, and I don't think you're going to have to wait more than a year for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the press conference, Buffett maintained enthusiasm for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, saying "there's no one in the United States that I know of whom I would rather have running the Fed than Ben Bernanke."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HIGH-IQ BOOBS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett has a much longer-term horizon for his largest acquisition, the $26.5 billion February takeover of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key factor in our railroad investment is whether more people are moving goods 10, 20 or 50 years from now," he said. "The odds of that happening are extremely high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett and Munger had harsh words for some professions, including accountants and investment bankers, whom they said in part caused the 2008 crisis because they were too greedy and could not stand up to management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everywhere you look this problem has been caused by high-IQ asininity" perpetrated by "high-IQ boobs," Munger said. "People who know the edge of their own competency are safe, and those who don't, aren't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munger added: "Investment banking will behave more responsibly if we as citizens force it to behave more responsibly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Berkshire wants to make non-U.S. acquisitions, Buffett admitted its size rules out most countries, where the businesses or financial markets are too small. Berkshire's market value is about $190 billion, Reuters data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Business opportunities, we can stretch out to 30 or 40 countries," Buffett said. "Our problem is finding them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

and entertainment marketing, The Coca-Cola Company. "The `Longest Celebration`
is the most ambitious attempt to connect fans across all continents together
online to celebrate the vibrancy and rhythm of Africa and the FIFA World Cup
even if they are not in the stadium -- although some lucky fans will win that
experience." 

Football fans visiting the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola during its
current global tour of more than 80 nations were able to join in the Longest
Celebration by recording their joyous celebration moves and have them uploaded

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, May 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
www.EnergyStockAlerts.com is a premier source for microcap and blue chip
research and commentary. 

    The scale and carnage of BP's recent oil spill disaster continues to grow
on a daily basis. The Wall Street Journal, citing industry experts, on
Friday estimated the size of the continuing oil leak at 25,000 barrels a
day (up from the U.S. government's Thursday estimate of 5,000 barrels a
day). BP shares have fallen 12% since the disaster.

    The accident has forced President Barack Obama to put on hold politically
sensitive plans to expand offshore U.S. oil drilling. In March, President
Obama unveiled plans for a limited expansion, in part to try to win
Republican support for climate change legislation. The White House
announced Saturday morning the President will travel to the gulf coast
today to get an update on efforts to contain the massive spill.

    Weekend news reports that several banks (including Goldman Sachs, GS and
Citigroup, C), recommended buying BP shares. They argue investors are
over reacting since the April 20 explosion. 

    Yesterday oil giant BP (BP) released news that it has tested the
dispersants (manufactured by Nalco Holding Co. (HAL)), on Friday night
and authorized it's use on a larger scale. BP also added, it is looking
for additional suppliers to begin manufacturing the material in mass
quantities. 

    Investors should note that shares of companies that provided services or
operated the sunken Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, including Halliburton
(HAL) fell sharply as worries deepened about liability from spill.

    Oil Prices Expectations in 2010 and 2011

    Barclays recently stated oil prices are likely to stay in the range of
$80-$90, while other Barclays' analysts state, If Asian demand can
grow at such rapid rates when prices are in the $70 to $80 range, then
prices cannot stay in that range for much longer. 

    Considering the Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI) is quoted as saying
Asian demand for oil will increase by more than 2 million barrels per
day, what is the logical conclusion? What most people don't realize is
the depth of industries and products that rely on oil and gas. 

    Oil is involved in nearly every aspect of manufacturing - from the
production of chemicals, plastics and detergents to medicines, building
materials and even clothing. Petroleum-based products make up a
significant portion of the materials Americans use every day.

    Why do the wealthiest people in the world invest in oil and gas?

    It comes down to the basic economics of supply and demand. Energy is in
high demand throughout the world. The global economy is growing. And
domestic consumption is growing.

    What does this means for the average American investor?

    Take a look at microcap companies like Paradigm Oil and Gas, Inc., PDGO.
Less than a month ago PDGO was sitting at $0.40 per share. We've watched
this domestic diva steadily rise with the release of great news,
including their 100% property acquisition with over 10 million barrels of
probable reserves. PDGO closed last Friday at $1.29. That's a solid ROI
of over 300%!

    How does the normal investor see a 100% return on oil?

    In our opinion, it looks like (PDGO - OTCBB) is heading there in a hurry.
But they are not the only domestic, oil and gas company that is showing
some great investment opportunity in the OTCBB energy sector. With more
good news expected, PDGO will continue to generate significant investor
interest in the company. Our recommendation is to keep PDGO on your radar
and watch this week's reactions across the web as the stock continues to
move north.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats April 30 story for wider readership)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Emails reveal pressure to sell CDOs in early 2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Cactus Raazi emerges as a star Goldman salesman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Emails reveal another side to Goldman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Matthew Goldstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - Brass-knuckle sales tactics,
worthless assets and clueless investors: the vignettes that
emerge from hundreds of pages of three-year-old emails from
members of Goldman Sachs Group's (GS.N) mortgage securities
trading desk would not be out of place in a David Mamet play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In "Glengarry Glen Ross," Mamet depicted the aggressive and
desperate sales tactics employed by a group of salesmen to push
worthless Florida real estate on unsuspecting buyers. The play
helped popularize that age-old mantra of salesmen everywhere:
"ABC or Always be Closing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while there may be no memorable catchphrase in the
Goldman emails released this week by a U.S. Senate panel
probing the firm, there is some similarity in tenor and tone of
the bank's drive to unload subprime mortgage-linked securities
in spring 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sprinkled throughout the 900-page document dump by the
Senate panel are emails in which Goldman executives applaud
underlings for their "success in grinding out retained
positions" and doing an "excellent job pushing to closure these
deals in a period of extreme difficulty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the emails introduce us to a new sales star at Goldman
named Cactus Raazi, who wins heaps of praise from his
colleagues for moving subprime-backed debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The picture that emerges from the many emails is one of a
Goldman sales force working under the gun to sell securities,
as the window on the market for collateralized debt obligations
is rapidly closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A salesman in South Korea is encouraged to get a group of
investors to buy more mortgage-backed securities with email
messages like "Get 'er done" and "Yes - go for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the collection of emails, it is clear that in the
waning days of the U.S. housing bubble, one of the main
missions of Goldman's structured products sales force was to
find institutional buyers for the last round of CDOs Goldman
was bringing to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INTRIGUING CHARACTERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman needed not only to unload some of its inventory of
mortgage-backed securities, but take steps to set up short
positions against some of those very same securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former Goldman mortgage executive Daniel Sparks gave those
marching orders in a Feb. 27, 2007, email, in which he directed
his crew "to reduce CDO pipeline risk," "cover more single name
shorts" and "allocate short positions more explicitly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sparks' email may not be as direct or as profane as the
"always be closing" speech delivered by Alec Baldwin's
character Blake in the movie version of "Glengarry Glen Ross,"
but it gets the point across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If nothing else, the investigations and allegations now
engulfing Goldman's mortgage-backed securities operation have
opened a window into a side of the investment firm that is
rarely seen in public. Once-private emails are revealing some
of the more colorful and intriguing characters the firm relies
on to sell its more esoteric and complex products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, for instance, brought a level of fame to Goldman
bond salesman Fabrice Tourre, whom regulators claim misled
institutional investors about a subprime mortgage-linked deal
called Abacus 2007-AC1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the 31-year-old, French-born Goldman vice president may
be just as well-known for the love notes he sent his
girlfriend, including one email in which he boastfully referred
to himself as "Fabulous Fab."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Raazi, another Goldman fixed-income salesman and vice
president, is receiving his 15 minutes of unwanted fame, thanks
to emails released by the Senate panel, which held a marathon
11-hour hearing on Tuesday on Goldman's role in the subprime
mortgage mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raazi, whose full name is Mehra Cactus Raazi, has been a
Goldman bond salesman since 1998. Before coming to Goldman he
was an ad salesman for "Rolling Stone" magazine and other
Wenner Media publications. A 1997 story in The Los Angeles
Times listed an "M. Cactus Raazi" as the business manager for
"URB" magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If there is any champion for the Goldman side of things in
the mass of emails, it is Raazi, who is singled out for his
selling prowess a number of times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most notable is an email sent by Goldman mortgage executive
Tom Montag, now with Bank of America (BAC.N), to Goldman Chief
Executive Lloyd Blankfein on March 14, 2007, with the subject
line "Cactus Delivers." Montag praises Raazi for helping
Goldman cover "another $1.2 billion in shorts in mortgages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The email thread praising Raazi begins with Sparks writing
to Montag and telling him "Cactus Raazi did a fantastic job for
the desk." Sparks added, "Please recognize Cactus when you get
a chance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two weeks later, Raazi's feats of selling are lauded again
in a memo sent around to the entire "GS Syndicate" for CDOs and
other mortgage-backed securities. That memo begins: "Great job
Cactus Raazi trading us out of our entire Timberwolf Single-A
Position--$16 mm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Timberwolf is a $1 billion hybrid CDO Goldman brought to
market in March 2007 and which quickly lost all of its value.
The CDO liquidated in June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the CDO market long dead, it is not clear what Raazi
is selling now for Goldman. He did not return an email seeking
comment. A Goldman spokesman also declined to comment.

enables transparency to users and supporting IT departments, as ICS appears and
behaves as part of the core IBM Cognos product suite. Above and beyond version

workflow and audit controls throughout the lifecycle of business intelligence
artifacts. The added capabilities in this comprehensive release are the product

have driven the ICS solution out of their need for tight controls over every
aspect from development to deployment," said BSP Software`s President and
co-founder Andrew Rachmiel. 

ICS was designed to allow organizations to better manage the development
lifecycle of content within a performance management environment. Tightly
coupled inside an IBM Cognos environment, ICS benefits users at every level
within an enterprise from the added features and much needed functionality
offered. 

"We are tremendously excited about the Integrated Control Suite architecture and
its vast capabilities," said Andrew Weiss, Senior Vice President of Product
Research and Development. ICS unites the proven reporting and analysis
capabilities of IBM Cognos 8 with the accountability and tight controls required
by most organizations. "Leveraging the foundation of our Integrated Version
Control architecture and functionality, this comprehensive release adds content
management, workflow, expanded compliance reporting, and support for validated
environments that require tight governance." 

With customer verticals including Life Sciences, Manufacturing, Banking, and
more, ICS is clearly demonstrating its ability to lower an organizations total
cost of ownership for performance management deployments by automating the
process of governance and compliance.

&lt;p&gt; * Refinery malfunction boosts West Coast prices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Breakdown triggers refinery safety flares&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, updates with company statement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, May 4 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said an
undisclosed malfunction on Tuesday at its 279,000
barrel-per-day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in El Segundo,
California, would not prevent it from supplying its customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company declined to describe the nature of the
malfunction, but told pollution regulators in regulatory filing
on Tuesday that a breakdown at the refinery triggered the
plant's safety flare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; West Coast refined products traders attributed a 4-cent
jump in wholesale gasoline prices in the Los Angeles market to
the breakdown at the Chevron refinery. Several major refiners
and brokers were seen buying heavily, common behavior when a
major has a breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The notice did not say which unit or units might be
involved in the flaring, which is used to burn off hydrocarbons
that cannot be processed normally.

&lt;p&gt;In one way, the global recession "felt like more of the same" for Microsoft CIO Tony Scott. "The boss comes in and says, 'We want to cut costs.'"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, as the economy shows signs that a recovery is under way, "How many of us know how to grow?" Scott said during an event held in Boston on Tuesday by the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The economy has flushed out the weak players. The strong have survived and picked up market share," he said. "We're talking big growth -- right around the corner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott already has an ample IT environment to maintain for Microsoft's roughly 93,000 employees. The company has 7,000 production servers and 11 production data centers, according to a slide Scott showed the crowd. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save for a single instance of SAP, Microsoft has few packaged applications, Scott said. "What we prefer to do is act as a place where we can run our tier-one apps with Microsoft technology." Microsoft is also famous for serving as a beta tester on its own products before making them generally available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, "We're taking all of our tier-one apps and moving them all to the cloud," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud-style deployment allows applications to be provisioned dynamically in accordance with demand, versus dedicating a set of servers to a particular application all the time. Therefore, it is also distinct from traditional application hosting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is still shaking off that traditional style of IT and its inefficiencies, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We in the software industry have trained you to buy from us at the end of a quarter or at the end of the year," Scott said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means Microsoft's sales systems often sit idle only to explode into "mayhem" at quarter- or year-end, he said. Virtualization has helped, but only so much, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a brief interview following his talk, Scott said he is also interested in moving Microsoft's SAP instance to a cloud-based delivery system. "Right now I'm hard-provisioning app servers and scaling that for peak demand." But there is nothing to announce as of yet, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott spends about 30 percent of his time on the road, talking to customers, and the topic of cloud computing comes up frequently, he said. Cloud-based services, especially for basic applications like e-mail, will be widely adopted not long from now, Scott predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In five years, I'm not sure there'll be anyone saying that it's really important that they run their own e-mail system," he said. "It's going to be like someone saying I want to run my own electric plant because I want reliable electricity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIOs have three other broad transitions to make as the economy rebounds, said Andrew McAfee, a principal research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Center for Digital Business, during a panel discussion later at the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, organizations are becoming more "scientific," driven by insights into hard data, said McAfee, who is known for his association with the Enterprise 2.0 movement. "That's in contrast to the way decisions get made now, which is basically, 'Trust me, I'm a smart guy.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies should also use technology to more effectively orchestrate how they do business, McAfee said. But at the same time, company leaders "need to get out of the way," to let their employees "self-organize" using social-networking tools and related technologies, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIOs who don't acknowledge the rise of cloud computing are in jeopardy, McAfee said. "The cloud is about as inevitable as the electrification of factories. It took a long time, but it was just flat-out the answer. If the CIO sees their role as maintaining some kind of physical plant, that will be more and more peripheral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his part, Scott warned that "the enemy of the future is creeping incrementalism, laying a little more glue on top of what we already have."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 4 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co is expected
in coming weeks to sell the largest new commercial
mortgage-backed security since issuance in the CMBS market
began to recover late last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank has cobbled together loans to create an $840
million bond for sale to both senior investors and an equity
"B-piece" buyer, according to one investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal, first reported in Commercial Mortgage Alert,
would be just the second so-called conduit issue to hit the
recovering market that provides credit for office, retail and
apartment buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, RBS priced a $309.7 million CMBS backed by
multiple loans, the first sale of its kind in nearly two years
and a benchmark for the recovering CMBS market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The conduit deal was seen as a key gauge of risk appetite
for securities tied to the troubled commercial real estate
market, where billions of dollars in maturing loans are in need
of refinancing through 2012. A lack of credit for properties
whose value and revenue have fallen has exacerbated defaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The RBS sale followed three single-borrower CMBS deals that
were sold in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Al Yoon and Nancy Leinfuss; Editing by Dan

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) as the Bull of
the Day and France Telecom (NYSE: FTE) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on UAL Corp. (Nasdaq: UAUA), Continental
Airlines (NYSE: CAL) and Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We are reaffirming our Outperform recommendation on General Electric Co. (NYSE:
GE) with a $23 target price. 

GE Capital's losses will be lower in 2010. The North American Retail Finance
business earned $293 million, up 70% driven by lower credit losses. Real Estate
losses were lower in the quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. Commercial
Lending and Leasing, GECAS and Energy Financial Services had a great quarter. 

Credit losses came down sequentially in the quarter. Global banking
delinquencies were flat while reserve coverage went up in the most recent
quarter. For commercial lending and leasing, the company continues to see
improving portfolio quality metrics. 

Bear of the Day: 

We reiterate our Underperform recommendation for France Telecom (NYSE: FTE)
based on the carrier's lackluster operating results and lack of visibility for
operational improvements in the near-term. The company remains significantly
challenged by the weak economic conditions and unfavorable regulatory measures
across its key European markets which continue to weigh on the top-line. 

France Telecom's wireline voice business is shrinking at a greater pace than its
major European peers as recession-hit customers discontinue landline phones.
Moreover, the company has suspended all restructuring actions due to significant
pressure from workers unions. 

Moving forward, revenue is expected to remain under pressure due to the
prevailing economic, competitive and regulatory factors. Our price target of $20
is based on 8.3x our 2010 EPADS estimate.

United-Continental Merger Takes Off

U.S. air carriers United Airlines -- a wholly owned subsidiary of UAL Corp.
(NASDAQ: UAUA) -- and Continental Airlines (NYSE: CAL) declared a merger of
their operations. 

This merger would give birth to the world`s largest airline by size, pushing
Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL) back. The deal, which was announced today, will still
have to gain approval from shareholders and clear an anti-trust review by the
Department of Justice. The airlines resumed merger talks last month after
negotiations collapsed in 2008. 

The merger is reported to cost a whopping $3.2 billion (based on the current
stock price) to United, which would involve compensating each Continental
shareholder with 1.05 shares of the former company. This exchange will leave
United owning 53% of the newly formed company, which will be christened as
United Continental Holdings, with the rest owned by Continental. The airline
will however retain the old name -- United Airlines -- but will carry
Continental`s logo and will be headquartered in Chicago. 

The board of directors of the newly formed company will seat 16 members and will
comprise an equal number of members from both the combining companies. Though
Glenn Tilton and Jeff Smisek the chairman, president and chief executive officer
of United and Continental, respectively, will serve as non-executive chairman
and executive chairman, respectively, along with being on the board of
directors, the remaining names have yet to be finalized. 

The deal will have no significant impact on the workforce of either United or
Continental, which currently have 48,000 and 42,210 employees, respectively. The
new company is expected to have a combined workforce of approximately 90,000
employees with a combined fleet of 693 planes.

No More Reason to Be Long in the Market, SELL SHORT!

The SP500 has reached a major resistance level and falling down. 

If you look at the COT on the miniSP you have a picture of what is going on:
DISTRIBUTION! Non commercial are getting out of the boat and speculators jumping
in... 

Together with the Goldman Sachs' (NYSE: GS) shameful behavior, probably just the
tip of the iceberg...., the Euro zone crisis and the end of the forced
government stimulus to the economies we have a pretty clear idea of what could
be ahead, a strong correction! 

I had underestimated in the last months the power of politics and wall street
lobbies tied to them but the fact that Goldman is under attack is telling to me
that politicians are done with them and trying to restore confidence into people
is more urgent than everything else....especially with deficit ballooning... 

Something big is going on! 

Time to lock in profit for the smart guys that were riding the bull, time to be
big short if you have the stomach!

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc shares held their own on one of Wall Street's worst days in months after a report that it would soon enter talks to settle fraud charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman officials declined to comment on a report by Fox Business Network's Charlie Gasparino that Wall Street's dominant firm was not interested in battling with regulators. The report cited sources that included an unidentified senior executive at the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With investors betting that Goldman will settle with the SEC, shares ended down 5 cents at $149.45. The Dow dropped 2.02 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are hoping they will put it behind them," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Bahl and Gaynor. "They will have an actionable event. The costs will be defined. The risks will be quantified, and then they can go back to making money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Goldman has maintained that the SEC's case is without merit, a settlement could result in regulators backing off civil fraud charges and agreeing to lesser charges and a fine, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But people close to the SEC said the commission may be reluctant to agree to a lenient settlement, Gasparino reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Goldman Sachs spokesman Samuel Robinson nor SEC spokesman John Heine would comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BLANKFEIN'S STANDING OVATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman executives remain upbeat about how the company has handled the recent scrutiny and say it has "seen no degradation of business" as a result of the SEC's charges, according to a research note by Sanford C Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Assignments that Goldman had anticipated winning have been won and trade flows remain in line with expectations," Hintz wrote.

&lt;p&gt;Announcement Emphasizes the Value of ViryaNet Workforce Management Solutions for
GE`s Smart Grid initiatives 
SOUTHBOROUGH, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
ViryaNet Limited (VRYAF.OB), a leading provider of software solutions that
optimize the full cycle of scheduling and dispatch processes for field service
management announced today that General Electric`s Field Force Automation (FFA)
product, based upon ViryaNet`s G4 Workforce Management Platform, has achieved
"ecomagination status". 

According to GE, "To earn ecomagination approval, a product is evaluated for its
ability to significantly and measurably improve a customer's environmental and
operating performance. The rigorous, multi-tiered review process is concluded
with an independent, third-party audit to ensure accuracy and thorough
documentation of technological performance." 

GE reported that, "Utilities using FFA report their crews fix problems faster,
perform maintenance that prevents problems before they happen and are more
efficient on the job thanks to more accurate, immediate status information and
direction. At the same time, FFA achieves these performance improvements while
reducing the travel, personnel requirements and time spent in the field." 

GE also reported that "FFA earned its ecomagination status by delivering
performance improvements in three areas."

* Significant Reduction of service crew times

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's market-making unit has been censured and fined $450,000 after U.S. regulators found hundreds of violations in its processing of customer trades involving equity securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYSE Regulation, a unit of NYSE Euronext, imposed the penalty. It said half the penalty will be paid to the U.S. Treasury in connection with related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to NYSE Regulation, between December 9, 2008, and January 22, 2009, Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP roughly 385 times accepted orders to "short" equity securities in which it had open "fail-to-deliver" positions, without first borrowing or arranging the borrow the securities as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchange's in-house regulator also said the Goldman unit failed about 68 times over that period to timely close out "fail-to-deliver" positions in equity securities or notify customers about such lapses. NYSE Regulation also found supervisory violations from September 24, 2008 to January 22, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's fine was announced Tuesday, less than three weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud lawsuit against the investment bank in an unrelated case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short sale occurs when a customer borrows a security, sells it in a bet the price will go down, and then buys it back later to replenish the security's lender. A "fail-to-deliver" occurs when a clearing firm fails to satisfy its obligation to deliver a particular security on a particular date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman consented to the censure and penalty without admitting wrongdoing, NYSE Regulation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman said the violations resulted from a processing error, and had no financial effect on clients. He also said the unit has improved its automated processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NYSE Regulation decision will become final on May 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds SEC statement, additional Goldman comment, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's
(GS.N) market-making unit has been censured and fined $450,000
after U.S. regulators found hundreds of violations over how it
processed customer trades involving short sales of stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and NYSE
Regulation said Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LLP violated
emergency requirements adopted in September 2008, two days
after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK went bankrupt, to
limit naked short selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A short sale occurs when a customer borrows a security,
sells it in a bet the price will go down, and then buys it back
later to replenish the lender. A naked short sale occurs when
the customer has no intention to borrow the security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Half the penalty will go to NYSE Regulation, a unit of NYSE
Euronext NYX.N, and the rest to the federal government.
Goldman agreed to settle without admitting wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fine was announced Tuesday, less than three weeks after
the SEC filed a civil fraud lawsuit against Goldman in an
unrelated case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators said that because of a bookkeeping error, the
Goldman unit between Dec. 9, 2008, and Jan. 22, 2009, accepted
about 385 orders to short stocks where it had not first
borrowed or arranged to borrow the securities as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also said the Goldman unit failed about 68 times over
that period to timely close out market-making positions in
stocks or notify customers about such lapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the SEC, the unit's procedures were
"inadequate in that they relied too heavily on individuals to
perform manual tasks and calculations, without sufficient
oversight or verification of accuracy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYSE Regulation also found supervisory violations at the
Goldman unit from Sept. 24, 2008, to Jan. 22, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman said the violations resulted from a
processing error, and had no financial effect on clients. He
also said the unit clears about 3 million trades a day, and has
improved its automated processes.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drugmakers Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck  Co Inc (MRK.N) posted better-than-expected quarterly results, helped by cost savings from their respective mega-mergers that could boost results for several more years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies also stood by their long-term forecasts. Their shares rose about 2 percent, even as the broader market sank and Merck gave a 2010 earnings forecast that could fall short of Wall Street's target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It wasn't a wow quarter, but the fundamentals of both companies look reasonably attractive," said Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler. He said both drugmakers may have issued conservative forecasts for this year, due in part to uncertainty how the dollar will affect overseas sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in October paid $67 billion for Wyeth, acquiring its biotech drugs and technology for making new biotech products. The following month Merck bought Schering-Plough for $41 billion, gaining its promising drugs in late-stage testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like both companies are already getting leverage from merger-related cost savings, and it's going right to the bottom line," said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Tuesday, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.O (TEVA.TA) of Israel, the world's biggest generic drugmaker, said strong sales of its Copaxone multiple sclerosis drug and U.S. sales of generic products gave it a forecast-beating profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But disappointing generic sales in Europe marred results for Teva, whose shares fell about 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugmaker results in the quarter have been pinched by the new U.S. reform law, which requires companies to provide heftier price rebates to patients in the government Medicaid insurance program for the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results for Merck and Pfizer also complete that theme we've seen for other drugmakers this quarter, that largely good results are offsetting the costs of healthcare reform," Conover said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MERCK PROFIT, SALES BEAT EXPECTATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck earned $299 million, or 9 cents per share, for the first quarter, amid special charges and a tax expense related to the healthcare reform law. That compared with $1.43 billion, or 67 cents per share in the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Merck earned 83 cents per share. Analysts had on average expected 75 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck sales more than doubled to $11.4 billion on the strength of the Schering deal. Analysts had looked for $11.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of the Januvia diabetes franchise jumped 32 percent to $712 million, including explosive growth outside the United States, well ahead of the consensus estimate of $622 million of six analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of the Singulair asthma pill rose 10 percent to $1.17 billion, just ahead of the consensus estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck said quarterly results were helped by a $75 million to $100 million inventory buildup of its vaccines in the United States, and lower-than-expected research spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company expects 2010 earnings of $3.27 per share to $3.41 per share, excluding special items. Analysts were expecting $3.41 per share. The forecast would amount to flat earnings to a decline of 4.2 percent, largely due to plunging sales of its Cozaar blood pressure drug that began facing generic rivals last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck continues to target high single-digit compound annual earnings growth for the newly combined company from 2009 to 2013, when compared with Merck's 2009 earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, said it remains on track to achieve annual cost savings of $3.5 billion from the merger in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck is hosting a highly anticipated meeting for analysts next week to showcase its research pipeline for the first time since its takeover of Schering-Plough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFIZER AFTER LIPITOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer earned $2.03 billion, or 25 cents per share, in the quarter. That compares with $2.73 billion, or 40 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 60 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 53 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer posted revenue of about $16.75 billion, a bit better than analysts' expectations of $16.58 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of its Lipitor cholesterol fighter edged 1 percent higher to $2.76 billion, above the consensus estimate of $2.64 billion of eight analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lyrica, for neuropathic pain, rose 6 percent to $723 million, roughly in line with the consensus estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer backed its 2010 profit forecast of $2.10 per share to $2.20 per share, excluding items, despite costs of health reform. The forecast would amount to growth of 4 percent to 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based drugmaker affirmed its 2012 profit forecast of $2.25 per share to $2.35 per share, excluding items.

$723 million, roughly in line with the consensus estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer backed its 2010 profit forecast of $2.10 per share
to $2.20 per share, excluding items, despite costs of health
reform. The forecast would amount to growth of 4 percent to 9
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based drugmaker affirmed its 2012 profit
forecast of $2.25 per share to $2.35 per share, excluding
items. The outlook suggests the Wyeth merger will prevent
Pfizer earnings from plunging once Lipitor goes generic as soon
as late 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will be growing our earnings through the expiration of
Lipitor, clearly one of the many benefits the merger is helping
us address," Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said
in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; D'Amelio said Pfizer still aims to achieve annual cost
reductions of about $4 billion to $5 billion by the end of
2012, compared with 2008 combined costs of Pfizer and Wyeth.

&lt;p&gt;$50 Million in Grants Crucial Amidst Challenging Credit Markets 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase announced today a $325 million initiative to support the growth
of high-performing U.S. charter schools in today`s challenging credit
environment. 

"Many charter schools have expanded access to academic opportunities for
students in all types of communities, so we shouldn`t let tough economic times
bring them down," said JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. "Improving
educational opportunities is a cornerstone of JPMorgan Chase`s philanthropic
giving." 

The bank will provide $50 million in grants to community development financial
institutions (CDFIs) focused on funding charter schools. In turn, these
institutions will use these grants as permanent equity, which they will leverage
to fund top-performing charter schools. 

Additionally, JPMorgan Chase will work with the CDFIs to provide about $175
million in debt and approximately $100 million in New Markets Tax Credit equity
to support the development of charter school facilities. This will allow the
CDFIs to access Obama Administration financing programs designed to help charter
schools meet facility needs. 

JPMorgan Chase estimates that this initiative will help underwrite about 40
charter schools, which will serve more than 50,000 students throughout the term
of the loan. 

Initial CDFI partners include The Reinvestment Fund of Philadelphia, The Low
Income Investment Fund of San Francisco, and NCB Capital Impact of Arlington,
Va. Additional partners will be announced later in the year. 

"The Low Income Investment Fund (LIIF) is proud to be one of the partners with
JPMorgan Chase on this initiative. Through this financing initiative, JPMorgan
Chase and LIIF will invest in exceptional educational opportunities for
thousands of low income students," noted Nancy O. Andrews, President and CEO of
LIIF. "A key constraint to growth for many high performing public charter
schools is their ability to finance facility development or enhancement. By
providing an equity investment, JPMorgan Chase and LIIF will give schools access
to affordable capital in a difficult credit environment." 

The grants to help charter schools are part of JPMorgan Chase`s larger $100
million grant initiative for CDFIs that also support small businesses, community
healthcare centers, green initiatives and affordable housing. Details on the
rest of the initiative will be announced later this year. 

"JPMorgan Chase has been a committed partner to the CDFI industry by providing
critical access to capital where it otherwise might not exist," said Terry
Simonette, President and CEO of NCB Capital Impact. "This new initiative
continues that commitment by providing the critical capital that is required for
charter schools to meet the need for access to quality education in low income
and underserved communities." 

Despite the increasing demand by families across the country for charter
schools, they have found it difficult to arrange financing for expanded and new
facilities. 

While public school districts can access the municipal bond market for long-term
funding, charter schools almost always pay more for financing because lenders
require higher interest rates from the relatively new industry. 

"In these next seven years, this new investment by JPMorgan Chase in The
Reinvestment Fund projects will allow us to create school opportunities for
thousands of students," said Jeremy Nowak, President and CEO of The Reinvestment
Fund. "This major investment certainly positions the bank as a national leader
supporting charter schools and meeting their significant unmet financial needs."


JPMorgan Chase sees high potential for improving childhood education and
community development through charter schools, and is committed to their
development. The bank has been an active supporter of public school education,
donating $181 million in education grants over the last five years.
Additionally, the bank provided nearly $12 billion in financing to education
institutions and school districts through lending and bond underwriting in 2009
alone. 

Community development financial institutions that fund charter schools and are
interested in applying for a grant through this new program should contact
JPMorgan Chase at CharterSchools.CDFI@jpmchase.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Mobile wireless operators will continue to utilize backhaul solutions from cable
operators at an ever-increasing pace during the oncoming years, a new Visant
Strategies study finds. As mobile wireless operators in the United States
continue to upgrade to 3.5G and 4G systems the need for increasing backhaul
capacity at the edge of the network and between middle network elements is a
perfect match for the fiber plant many cable operators have deployed in urban
and dense suburban areas. 

"A strong mix of fiber, copper and microwave technologies are now being used for
backhaul," said Andy Fuertes of Visant Strategies. "But mobile wireless
operators have to look for more means to obtain higher backhaul capacities and
quickly in some cases. Cable operators can offer needed backhaul at both the
edge of the network, where the need is now, and in the middle network, where the
need is in the very near future." 

"US Mobile Wireless Backhaul 2011: Cable joins Copper, Fiber and Microwave to
Meet Edge and Middle Network Needs" finds the cable operator share of the mobile
wireless backhaul market will grow by more than five-fold by 2016. By 2015, the
report states, cable operators will be receiving over $ 3 billion in annual
backhaul service revenues. 

"US mobile wireless operators are in the midst of serving a data-hungry
audience," said Larry Swasey of Visant Strategies. "With 3.5G and 4G being
deployed, wireless devices employing more capacity crunching apps and voice
minutes going up, backhaul capacity in all areas of the network is a concern.
Cable operators like microwave, fiber and copper vendors, will benefit from this
concern." 

Report figures include subscribers, 3.5G and 4G subscribers, base stations per
tower and base station, middle network element and tower deployments through
2015. Also 3.5G and 4G base station deployments, cable operator mobile backhaul
service revenues, base stations and middle network elements connected to
backhaul by cable operators and backhaul capacities needed for base stations and
middle network elements are detailed through 2015.

&lt;p&gt;YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's military government will offer visas on arrival to boost the country's nascent tourism sector, a travel industry official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tourist visas, which are normally arranged days in advance at an embassy abroad, will be now be available at international airports in Mandalay and the biggest city, Yangon, said Tin Tun Aung, secretary of the Myanmar Travel Entrepreneurs Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We heartily welcome it," Tin Tun Aung told Reuters. "I'm sure it will have a strong impact on tourist arrivals to our country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of the visa will be $30 and would be valid for 28 days, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Myanmar is rich in jungles, beaches and mountains and is dotted with hundreds of golden Buddhist temples, its tourism industry remains largely undeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total tourist arrivals in Myanmar during for the fiscal year 2009-2010 stood at 300,000, compared with 255,288 for the same period a year earlier. Some 315,536 people traveled to Myanmar in the 2005-2006 period, official data showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those figures are dwarfed by neighboring Thailand, which drew 14.1 million tourists last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many potential visitors are deterred by the poor reputation of the country and its hardline military rulers, who are accused of corruption, stifling democratic freedoms and presiding over decades of human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myanmar's government plans to hold its first election in two decades some time this year and is on a drive to privatize numerous industries, including shipping and air travel, to attract more foreign investment, which has been restricted by Western sanctions on the regime.

&lt;p&gt;Leading SharePoint Killer Bridges Gap Between Office and the Cloud with
Co-Authoring Functionality
PASADENA, Calif. &amp; SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Central Desktop, a leading Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) collaboration platform
provider, today unveiled Central Desktop for Office, a new cloud-enabled
document collaboration tool for Microsoft Office users, at the Web 2.0 Expo in
San Francisco. Central Desktop for Office radically improves the way people
collaborate on files by allowing users to simultaneously co-author Word, Excel
and PowerPoint documents in real time, as well as open and save files directly
into the cloud. The new Central Desktop for Office strengthens Central Desktop`s
position as the only SharePoint alternative for the mid-market that provides
enterprise-level functionality at an affordable price. 

Central Desktop for Office leverages technology from OffiSync and is compatible
with any version of Microsoft Office including 2003, 2007 and 2010. Once
installed, Central Desktop for Office adds a new toolbar in Microsoft Word,
Excel and PowerPoint that enables users to open, save, edit and co-author files
stored in the cloud - directly from within Office. The new tool also brings
additional collaboration capabilities into Office including the ability to
comment on files, manage subscribers and track version history. Central
Desktop`s co-authoring feature enables multiple users to edit Office files
simultaneously, by conveniently tracking and syncing all changes made by
collaborators and merging them correctly into one updated version -
functionality that Microsoft is touting as an incentive for users to upgrade to
its new Office 2010 suite. 

"Central Desktop is a powerful collaboration platform that changes the way teams
and organizations collaborate," said Oudi Antebi, CEO of OffiSync. "We are
honored to have contributed to this new offering that will significantly improve
the way Central Desktop users collaborate without changing the way they work
today." 

Central Desktop for Office`s co-authoring capabilities are particularly powerful
for business teams that need to create and collaborate on documents such as
project plans, budget forecasts and sales presentations. Rather than waiting for
each person to edit the document in a sequence, Central Desktop for Office
allows users to simultaneously make changes and each version is automatically
merged. This eliminates time-consuming review cycles, boosts team productivity
and drives faster, more efficient document collaboration. 

"Central Desktop for Office revolutionizes document collaboration by bridging
the gap between Microsoft Office and the cloud," said Isaac Garcia, CEO and
co-founder of Central Desktop. "While Microsoft is offering co-authoring
capabilities in the upcoming release of Office 2010, Central Desktop is
providing the same feature without requiring the costly upgrade to both
SharePoint and Office 2010. For mid-market businesses, Central Desktop is the
best SharePoint alternative and the most comprehensive online collaboration
solution available today." 

Central Desktop for Office will be available in June. For more information,
please visit http://www.centraldesktop.com/office.

&lt;p&gt;New IBM i Web services adapter for nuBridges Protect simplifies tokenization of
highly sensitive data in business-critical IBM i applications, boosting security
and removing IBM i apps from PCI DSS audit scope
ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
nuBridges announced today that it has enhanced its support for IBM i-reliant
organizations to further simplify adoption and implementation of tokenization as
a data-centric information security strategy. nuBridges Protect, nuBridges`
award-winning encryption, tokenization and key management solution, now offers a
native IBM i adapter to handle Web services-based communication with nuBridges
Protect Token Manager, which runs on distributed platforms. This allows
enterprises to reduce breach risk for IBM i applications that use confidential
and sensitive information, and take IBM i systems out of scope for Payment Card
Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance and audits. 

Tokenization is a rising data security model that substitutes meaningless
surrogate values - tokens - for sensitive and confidential information. It can
be used alone or to augment strong encryption to help companies comply with
industry data security mandates and privacy laws. The nuBridges Protect Adapter
for IBM i enables companies to extend tokenization to IBM i applications without
Web services programming in order to protect inbound sensitive data in
applications such as online shopping carts, order management, billing systems
and payroll. 

"We recognized the challenges many heterogeneous organizations are facing in
leveraging tokenization on their business-critical IBM i systems," said Gary
Palgon, nuBridges vice president of Product Management. "There are a lot of
moving parts when it comes to taking advantage of Web services on the IBM i. We
developed the nuBridges Protect Adapter for IBM i to simplify Web services calls
for tokenization so that companies can reduce risk and PCI DSS audit scope
throughout their enterprises more easily." 

The nuBridges Protect Adapter for IBM i handles all of the front-end Web
services communications between IBM i applications and nuBridges Protect Token
Manager for all Token Manager functions; and exposes back-end callable RPG,
COBOL and C APIs so it is easy for IT to connect IBM i applications to the
adapter via familiar technologies. 

nuBridges Protect for IBM i enables rapid tokenization adoption by:

* Simplifying tokenization calls to and from IBM i; 
* Speeding up integration of IBM i applications with nuBridges Protect Token
Manager; 
* Enabling COBOL and RPG calling of tokenization services to remove the
dependency on SOAP and XML knowledge; 
* Taking advantage of native IBM i capabilities (e.g., logging, user authority);
and 
* Simplifying software installation.

nuBridges has also added support for alternate character sets to make it easier
for the global enterprises to implement nuBridges Protect for data security. 

nuBridges Protect Token Manager is part of nuBridges Protect, the industry`s
first data security software solution to combine a new variation of tokenization
- Format Preserving Tokenization - with strong local encryption, centralized
encryption key management and logging in one platform-agnostic package.
nuBridges Protect is designed for organizations that need to protect payment
card numbers as well as volumes of personally identifiable information (PII) and
personal health information (PHI) from theft and accidental loss, while reducing
complexity and simplifying compliance management for data security standards and
privacy laws. 

nuBridges Protect Adapter for IBM i is available immediately. For more
information, please visit www.nubridges.com.

&lt;p&gt;Company Offers Industry-First Solution for Automating .NET Application
Deployment and Configuration

* Microsoft Windows represents 74 percent of data center server market
* 47 percent of IT operating expense is related to deployment-related activities
* rPath will automate packaging, deployment and configuration of .NET and
Windows applications

RALEIGH, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
rPath, an innovator in automating system deployment and maintenance, today
announced that it will support the Microsoft Windows operating system with a new
solution for automated deployment of applications built using the Microsoft .NET
Framework. This announcement extends the reach of rPath`s next-generation system
automation solutions beyond the enterprise Linux market. 

"Managing .NET application deployment and configuration is often a wholly manual
process, and due to increasing change activity it`s likely going to get worse,"
said Ronni Colville, VP, distinguished analyst at Gartner, Inc. "Tools that help
automate provisioning and configuration of .NET applications can improve
efficiency and effectiveness significantly." 

Jake Sorofman, chief marketing officer for rPath, said, "Our success with Linux
is driving demand for a solution that automates deployment and maintenance of
Windows-based software systems. Today, the absence of automation solutions for
Windows and the complexity of .NET application deployments make this one of the
thorniest challenges in enterprise IT." 

rPath Does Windows

IT operations staff charged with deploying, configuring, maintaining and
troubleshooting .NET applications have few tools to choose from and very little
automation. Real-world .NET production environments are diverse assemblies of
scripts and manual processes cobbled together by harried operations engineers
trying to cope with unstable, rapidly changing applications and exploding scale.
This is why 47 percent of enterprise IT operating expense is related to
deployment management and incident management activities, according to
Microsoft. 

Today, IT organizations are under heightened pressure to reduce costs, while
improving agility and responsiveness. This is driving a need for automation
solutions. 

rPath is recognized as a leader and innovator in next-generation system
automation technologies. Some of the world`s largest enterprises and ISVs use
rPath to take the time, cost and risk out of packaging, deployment and
maintenance of complex software systems across physical, virtual and cloud-based
environments. Now, rPath is extending its release automation platform to the
Windows environment. 

For Windows customers, rPath enables:

* Automated packaging and deployment of .NET and Windows applications:
Dependencies are automatically discovered and resolved, and policies define how
applications should be packaged. The result is a complete, self-contained system
that`s ready to deploy to any physical, virtual or cloud environment. 
* Scalable, predictable, conflict-free update: rPath`s deep system modeling can
be used to control the flow of change into deployed systems. Updates can be
applied incrementally, to only the components that require change, eliminating
unnecessary changes that often lead to downtime. Also, deep version control
provides a solid foundation for easy reproducibility, rollback and
troubleshooting. 
* Unified automation of software and configuration: rPath is the first vendor to
bring CIM-based configuration management under system version control. By
storing CIM data under the same version control umbrella as software, rPath
makes it easy to deploy and update consistent systems by simultaneously
deploying applications and their supporting configurations over WMI (the Windows
management API). rPath is delivering the first complete system model, and the
first real configuration management system, for Windows. 
* Release lifecycle management: rPath dramatically accelerates and improves the
quality of release processes and is delivering the industry`s first version
controlled system for managing the complete lifecycle of .NET and Windows
applications. This includes a shared repository of version-controlled system
artifacts to drive consistent reuse across the release lifecycle, consistent
handoffs across the release lifecycle to eliminate the risk of configuration
drift, and automated dependency discovery and resolution to minimize the risk of
deployment failures and outages.

rPath support for automated deployment and configuration of applications built
using the Microsoft .NET Framework will be commercially available in Q3 2010.

&lt;p&gt;At IBM Impact 2010, Rocket Customers from the Banking and Automotive Industries
Will Present Their Solutions Which Are Built With LegaSuite and IBM CICS and
WebSphere. 
NEWTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Rocket Software (www.rocketsoftware.com), a developer of enterprise
infrastructure products, today announced an enhancement to its LegaSuite
service-oriented architecture (SOA) integration technology by offering the IBM
CICS Transaction Gateway. The combination of LegaSuite and the CICS Transaction
Gateway simplifies and expedites composing complex CICS and IMS business
services for deployment to the IBM WebSphere platform. 

CICS Transaction Gateway is IBM's market leading connector technology,
delivering enterprise connectivity and modernization for CICS assets. IBM
continues to invest in this product to deliver maximum flexibility for customers
wishing to extend their applications into environments such as J2EE and .NET,
with minimal and often no changes required to existing CICS applications. 

"By working together, IBM and Rocket Software are able to deliver an optimized
solution for our customers, combining the value of IBM middleware with the
industry expertise of our partner channel," said Dave Andrews, product director
IBM CICS. 

"We have decades of experience working with IBM mainframe projects, and
enhancing our LegaSuite products with IBM`s CICS Transaction Gateway is key to
helping organizations integrate critical information in complex, multi-platform
IT infrastructures," said Andy Youniss, President and CEO of Rocket Software.
"By offering integration and modernization tools that complement CICS, IMS and
WebSphere, we are enabling organizations to accelerate business integration
projects by providing a foundation for business agility with a low cost of
entry." 

LegaSuite complements the WebSphere portfolio by delivering development tools
that leverage CICS Transaction Gateway for distributed deployments, including
Linux on System z. LegaSuite, coupled with the CICS Transaction Gateway,
delivers a number of business advantages that save time and money when customers
deploy WebSphere solutions that require integration with CICS and IMS. These
include: accelerating time-to-market by creating business services from complex
transactional orchestrations of CICS and IMS applications using point-and-click
development tools; using existing IT staff to create business services, thus
avoiding the requirement for expert knowledge of WSDL and data transformation
algorithms; and reducing risk by non-invasively leveraging the transactional
integrity of CICS and IMS applications without any changes to existing
applications, business logic and data.

PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) today reported net income of $27
million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2010,
compared to $31 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the three months ended
March 31, 2009. 

Operating results for the first quarter of 2010 were impacted by warmer weather,
the continued effects of a weak economy and unfavorable hydro conditions
relative to the first quarter of 2009. Revenues decreased $36 million, or 7%,
and primarily consisted of $25 million related to a decline in retail energy
deliveries and $15 million related to a 4% decline in average retail price.
Average temperature for the first quarter of 2010 was the third warmest on
record, resulting in a 13% decrease in residential energy deliveries. The weak
economy contributed to a 5% decrease in energy deliveries to commercial and
industrial customers in the first quarter of 2010. 

The average variable power cost in the first quarter of 2010 decreased 6%
compared to the first quarter of 2009 and was driven by an overall decrease in
the cost of thermal production, combined with a reduction in load requirements
and a shift in mix of sources of energy. A key driver in the decreased cost of
thermal production was an 11% decrease in the average cost of natural gas-fired
production. The decrease in the average variable power cost was offset by a 17%
decrease in energy received from hydro resources. Hydro conditions are expected
to remain below normal for 2010. 

"Strong operations, specifically efficiencies in thermal production, helped
balance the continued impacts of warmer weather, a weak economy and unfavorable
hydro conditions during the first quarter," said Jim Piro, President and Chief
Executive Officer. "Regulatory review of both our general rate case and
Integrated Resource Plan is underway. We`re working hard to build a
collaborative process in both of these proceedings that will produce positive
outcomes for our customers and shareholders." 

First Quarter Highlights

* Filed a general rate case in February 2010 with the Public Utility Commission
of Oregon (OPUC) to align prices with costs necessary to deliver safe, reliable
power and high-quality customer service. PGE is requesting a $125 million, or
7.4%, overall increase in rates, which is based on a 2011 test year. Among other
things, the Company is proposing a capital structure of 50% debt and 50% equity,
a return on equity of 10.5%, a cost of capital of 8.3%, and an average rate base
of approximately $3.2 billion. Regulatory review of this general rate case is
continuing, with a final order from the OPUC expected before the end of 2010.
New rates are expected to be effective January 1, 2011. 
* Submitted a Renewable Adjustment Clause filing on April 1, 2010 requesting $17
million for 2010 related primarily to the recovery of costs for Biglow Canyon
Phase III. Effective January 1, 2011, the revenue requirements related to Biglow
Canyon Phase III are expected to be reflected in retail prices, an increase of
approximately 1.9%, through the Company`s 2011 General Rate Case. 
* Filed an addendum in April 2010 to PGE`s proposed Integrated Resource Plan
(IRP) originally filed in November 2009 with the OPUC. The addendum recommends
ceasing coal-fired operations at Boardman by 2020, which is contingent upon,
among other events, Oregon Environmental Quality Commission`s modification of
the current Regional Haze rule. Accordingly, in April 2010, the Company
submitted a petition asking for revisions to the Regional Haze rule, which would
allow the operation of Boardman to comply with the rule by installing certain
emissions controls, using lower sulfur coal and ceasing coal-fired operations by
the end of 2020. In the event the existing Regional Haze rule is not modified,
PGE has requested acknowledgment of the operating plan as presented in the
original IRP. The original IRP provides for the installation of extensive
emissions controls to comply with the existing Regional Haze rule and continued
operation of the plant through at least 2040. 
* Issued $70 million of 3.46% First Mortgage Bonds due January 2015. 
* Remarketed $121 million of Pollution Control Bonds at 5% due May 2033. 
* Repaid $149 million of maturing 7.875% unsecured notes.

First Quarter Operating Results

* Revenues decreased $36 million, or 7%, in the first quarter of 2010 compared
to the first quarter of 2009 primarily due to:

* A $25 million decrease related to a 9% decrease in retail energy deliveries
consisting of:

* A 13% decrease in residential energy deliveries, driven by warmer than normal
weather in the first quarter of 2010 compared to colder than normal weather in
the first quarter of 2009, despite an increase in residential customers of
2,100; and 
* A 5% decrease in commercial and industrial deliveries, driven by the
continuation of a weak economy;

* A $15 million decrease related to a 4% decrease in average retail price, which
primarily reflects lower power costs; 
* A $5 million increase primarily due to the collection from customers recorded
in the first quarter of 2010 related to the decoupling mechanism, as weather
adjusted energy use per residential and certain commercial customers, was less
than that approved in PGE`s 2009 General Rate Case.

* Purchased power and fuel expense decreased $31 million, or 12%, in the first
quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009, with $17 million related
to a 6% decrease in total system load and $14 million related to a 6% decrease
in average variable power cost. The average variable power cost decreased to
$41.65 per MWh in the first quarter of 2010, from $44.42 per MWh in the first
quarter of 2009, primarily due to a decrease in the cost of fuel used in natural
gas-fired production combined with a shift in the mix of sources of energy,
partially offset by a 17% decrease in energy received from hydroelectric
resources. 
* Production and distribution expense decreased by $3 million, or 7%, as
compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to a reduction in repair and
restoration activities primarily related to wind storms in the first quarter of
2009. 
* Other income increased $6 million related primarily to a $5 million change in
the fair value of non-qualified benefit plan assets. In the first quarter of
2010, PGE recorded a $2 million gain, compared to a $3 million loss recorded in
the first quarter of 2009.

2010 Earnings Guidance

PGE reaffirms 2010 earnings guidance of $1.30 to $1.45 earnings per diluted
share. 

Capital Expenditures and Funding

The Company estimates capital expenditures to be $495 million in 2010, the
majority of which relate to Biglow Canyon Phase III ($175 million), the smart
meter project ($40 million) and upgrades to and replacement of generation,
transmission and distribution infrastructure ($255 million). PGE plans to issue
approximately $250 million of debt in 2010 to finance its capital expenditures,
of which $191 million was issued during the first quarter of 2010.

&lt;p&gt;A company focused on R, the open-source language for statistical analysis, relaunched under a new name Tuesday and gave a preview of its technology roadmap for 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revolution Analytics, formerly known as Revolution Computing, is headed by CEO Norman Nie, co-founder of predictive analytics vendor SPSS, and R co-creator Robert Gentleman sits on its board. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the startup has offered an R development environment called Revolution R Enterprise, as well as commercial training and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;R was initially created by Ross Ihaka and Gentleman at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. It now boasts a thriving community, and a large body of add-on packages have been created for the core toolset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoping to gain a stronger foothold at the grassroots level, the company is now offering a single workstation license of Revolution R Enterprise at no cost to academic users, although costs would kick in if they desire support. It is also launching a portal, inside-R.org, for R advocates and users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its product releases for the remainder of 2010 will include technology for processing very large data sets; an easier-to-use, Web-based user interface aimed at business analysts, not programmers; and new services and products for helping customers migrate over to R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also planning to form many partnerships with BI (business intelligence) and database vendors, according to chief operating officer Jeff Erhardt. Also, "everything we're building is in a cloud-ready form," he added. "As we move forward, [customers] will be able to do cloud implementations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and SAS have both moved to support R in their own statistical-analysis platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a validation of R more than a threat, according to Revolution Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's software is priced "aggressively" versus IBM and SAS. A single supported workstation costs $2,000 for an annual subscription. Pricing for server-based licenses varies depending on the implementation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Revolution Analytics faces a tough challenge from those larger vendors, as well as the likes of XLSolutions, which offers R training and a competing software package, R-Plus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration of SAS Institute's technology with various MPP (massively parallel processing) databases, for example, "promises to be very powerful, scalable, and functional, once it is fully available," said analyst Curt Monash of Monash Research. "It's hard to see how a startup -- even an R-based one -- could offer better technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not to say it has no chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's easy to see how an alternative could be much less expensive, yet still get the work done," Monash added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, May 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SOA Software, a leading SOA and Cloud Services Governance provider,
announced today a new SOA Planning Governance product that augments the
SOA Governance capabilities of IBM WebSphere Service Registry and
Repository (WSRR). 

    Portfolio Manager for WSRR helps to maximize the efficiency of investment
in SOA initiatives by automatically provisioning into IBM WSRR services
that have been planned and prioritized according to strategic business
and IT objectives. It helps management identify candidate services and
build an SOA roadmap through SOA Modeling, Asset Identification, and a
Portfolio Management process. To achieve these goals Portfolio Manager
functions as part of a unified SOA Governance automation product family
for IBM WSRR with seamless integration with IBM WSRR and SOA Software's
Policy Manager for IBM WSRR. 

    "SOA Software's Portfolio Manager for IBM WSRR will complement our strong
service lifecycle management capabilities helping our customers identify
candidate enterprise services built with and running on any heterogeneous
platforms," said Dr. Angel Luis Diaz, Vice President, Product Management
of Business Process Management and Connectivity at IBM Corporation. "By
combining this solution with IBM's comprehensive service visibility and
governance solutions, customers are better able to broadly, flexibly and
continuously automate and govern their business processes. Especially in
today's economic and hyper-competitive environment, this optimizes
productivity and resources needed to achieve business agility."

    "Planning Governance helps enterprises achieve a quicker return on
investment in SOA, making sure that they build to plan and build to
priority," said Brent Carlson, senior vice president of technology at SOA
Software. "Unplanned SOA Programs will fail because project-specific
services will not be flexible enough to support generalized reuse, and
without early success, application development teams won't see the
potential value in working to move to SOA and the organizational culture
will not evolve as needed to support a successful SOA program."

    Business/IT Alignment and Collaboration is paramount to achieve the
benefits of SOA such as Agility and increased ROI. Planning Governance
involves the appropriate stakeholders in business and IT to prioritize
and approve new service and service enablement requests. Furthermore,
Portfolio Manager for IBM WSRR, with its tight integration with IBM WSRR
and Policy Manager for IBM WSRR, will provide enhanced visibility of
where services are in their service lifecycle to all practitioners
including business stakeholders. By using Portfolio manager for IBM
WSRR(TM), customers can trace services in any part of the service
lifecycle in IBM WSRR(TM) back to the business capabilities that they
sustain. Portfolio Manager for IBM WSRR(TM) provides unprecedented
visibility and traceability supporting Business/IT Alignment and
collaboration.

    Portfolio Manager for WSRR will help existing IBM WSRR users better
understand the current state of the portfolio of services, identify the
gaps, plan and prioritize services to maximize return on investment and
reduce risk to their SOA initiatives by aligning them with their business
goals. 

    Key capabilities for Portfolio Manager for WSRR include: 


--  Delivers packaged SOA planning governance methods and governance
    automation meta-models
--  Dynamically represents current and future architecture models based on
    industry standards and internal definitions
--  Leverages APQC business process frameworks to promote compliance with
    industry best practices
--  Provides existing system capability discovery and candidate service
    identification
--  Provisions planned and prioritized services into IBM WSRR
--  Changes in service state in IBM WSRR are automatically propagated back
    to Portfolio Manager for IBM WSRR providing unprecedented visibility
--  Ensures that SOA portfolio management remains a continuous dynamic
    process

    

Pricing and Availability
 Available in Q2 2010, Portfolio Manager
for IBM WSRR starts at $50k USD.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) have been served a subpoena to testify or provide information in a closely watched case of illegal insider trading allegations, according to a court document made public on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subpoena to Goldman Sachs  Co and Goldman Sachs Execution and Clearing LP on April 15, requests "all trading records and monthly account statements associated with account number UF703881" of Michael Kimelman, a former trader at Quad Capital LLC and Incremental Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimelman is charged in a case running parallel with the one U.S. prosecutors are pursuing against Galleon hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam. U.S. prosecutors described the probe as the biggest hedge fund insider trading case ever in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimelman was arrested and charged last November 5 along with Zvi Goffer, a onetime Galleon employee who later started the Incremental Capital trading firm, and five other traders or lawyers. They have all pleaded not guilty to an indictment and are free on bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subpoena, signed by presiding Manhattan federal court Judge Richard Sullivan, was submitted by Kimelman's lawyer Morris Fodeman. It asks representatives of the investment bank's legal department to appear before the judge at a hearing in the case on May 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other details were provided, other than that Goldman acknowledged receipt on April 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Goldman Sachs could not immediately be reached to comment. Lawyers for Kimelman could not immediately be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors have accused Rajaratnam of obtaining confidential information on Goldman, but have not formally included those in the charges, according to court documents. Prosecutors said Rajaratnam sought information on Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKa.N) purchase of preferred shares in Goldman before the transaction became public on September 23, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also said he conspired to obtain confidential information about the quarterly earnings of Goldman before public announcements on or about June 17, 2008, and December 16, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sri Lankan-born Rajaratnam, a U.S. citizen, has pleaded not guilty and is free on bail. His co-defendant, former New Castle Funds LLC trader Danielle Chiesi, has also pleaded not guilty. Their trial is scheduled to start on October 25 before Judge Richard Holwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven defendants have pleaded guilty out of 21 charged. Eight people, some of them Rajaratnam's former friends and business associates or onetime Galleon employees, have signed cooperation agreements with prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are USA v. Goffer et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 10-056 and USA v Raj Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi, No. 09-01184.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGLES (Reuters) - "Iron Man 2," the first big Marvel superhero film to open since Walt Disney Co's $4 billion purchase of the studio, should pack a $200 million to $300 million profit punch for Disney, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Viacom Inc's Paramount Pictures distributes "Iron Man 2," giving it a fee of 8 to 10 percent of box office revenue under a deal made before last year's acquisition, Disney unit Marvel Studios gets a share of the profits and benefits from some merchandising and product tie-ins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial analysts, many of whom believe Disney paid a full price for Marvel, are tracking the movie's success closely to see how the acquisition of Marvel comic characters might benefit the company in the long term and unlock value for its other businesses, such as its theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest benefits will come when existing agreements for consumer licensing and distribution expire, but I think Disney will make close to $300 million on this over the life of the film," said David Bank, analyst with RBC Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Wible, analyst with Janney Capital Markets sees Disney earning about $200 million in profits from the box office and merchandising, net of licensing fees, and from other sources like movie plug-in product placements by companies like Oracle and Burger King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The logic behind this acquisition is to build the brand upon a global scale. We expect this film to be highly profitable given that Marvel generally runs a very lean budget," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Box office watchers expect "Iron Man 2," which opens in the United States and Canada on Friday, to rake-in over $600 million around the world by the end of its run, which could prove conservative, given last summer's big hit, "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" earned $836 million worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first "Iron Man," which stars Robert Downey, Jr. as a weapons maker who manufactures a high-powered and lethal suit of armor, made $585 million worldwide in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, "Iron Man 2" got off to a flying start with an international debut of $100 million. Paul Dergarabedian of tracking firm Hollywood.com Box Office expects it to make more than $120 million on its U.S. and Canadian debut weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts forecast Disney making as much as a $40 million in profit by as early as the third quarter, but given the company's size and annual revenues of over $36 billion, they see only a limited impact on overall corporate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even "if the movie bombs, it could have a modest impact and we'd ask if there was a write-off," said Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While various analysts believe Disney, which reports second quarter earnings on Tuesday, paid a full price for Marvel, most expect the deal to pay off longer term after the Paramount and other agreements Marvel inked for merchandising and theme parks expire. Marvel, for one, has a toy licensing deal with Hasbro Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney paid a full price on Marvel. But if they can create one more character half the size of an 'Iron Man' the deal makes sense," said Alan Gould, analyst with Soleil Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bob Tourtellotte)&lt;/p&gt;

Wells Notice that it received in September regarding trader
Fabrice Tourre, a person familiar with the matter said on

&lt;p&gt;Televisa (TLVACPO.MX)(TV.N) announced in February it would buy 30 percent of NII's NIHD.O Nextel Mexico wireless operator for $1.44 billion as long as their joint bid for new wireless capacity succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies are set to tender in a government auction, starting later this month, for chunks of frequency in the 1.7 GHz and 1.9 GHz bands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are (both) working now on marketing partnerships that allow us to offer integrated services ... regardless of the closing of the auction or when we deploy the 3G network," Nextel Mexico's Vice President Gustavo Cantu told the Reuters Latin American Investment Summit in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of Nextel and Televisa's bid is the nationwide deployment of a broader and faster network to carry phone, video and data services, which could take 12 to 24 months once the auction finishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 3G, or third-generation, network would mean a departure from NII Holdings' iDen technology, which works well for walkie-talkie types of communications but is not optimal for data transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cantu stressed that even if their joint tender did not succeed, the companies would not part ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that we have found business opportunities with Grupo Televisa so we won't wait until the auction finishes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final deal with Televisa would not only give Nextel access to the broadcaster's three fast-growing cable companies but also to SKY, a direct-to-home satellite service, and potential new markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico makes up the bulk of SKY's revenues, but Televisa recently expanded into the Caribbean and Central America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We and Televisa see in our future that this agreement could certainly be the path to new markets for either of us," Cantu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NII Holdings currently operates in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Peru.

&lt;p&gt;Angling to get in on the social networking craze, Microsoft yesterday showed off an early technical preview of a new tool that would aggregate social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company pulled the wraps off the Spindex tool yesterday at the Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco. The tool is designed to pull together a user's social streams from multiple social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter to let users more easily peruse information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's social networks are powerful and compelling, but they're just the beginning of a broader transformation that will likely change every aspect of the Web," wrote Lili Cheng, general manager of Microsoft FUSE Labs, in a blog post. "One area we've been focused on lately is the personalization of social computing. As you increasingly tweet, post to Facebook, and capture ideas with tools like Evernote, we want to help you get the most out of your social activity by exposing the right information, at the right time, in a way that's meaningful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheng noted that Spindex should make it easier for users to find out what's new, see personalized trending topics, and generally make the most of the time they're spending on social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheng did not say when Spindex is expected to move beyond the early technical preview, or when it's likely to be broadly released. Microsoft did say that updates on Spindex' progress will be made available via the company's new Spindexme Twitter page .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social networking phenomenon has grown beyond the borders of pioneers like Facebook, Myspace and Twitter to established major firms like Google, which earlier this year launched Google Buzz , a set of tools that can be used to add social networking capabilities to the Gmail e-mail service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now Microsoft looks to take its place in the social networking world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While it's early days for Spindex, and our learning has just begun, one thing is certain: what we discover will help inform Microsoft's approach to how we work and play in the years to come," wrote Cheng. "While my kids have a hard time appreciating this fact, it's still 'covered wagon' days for the Web. There's still much territory to be surveyed, and we look forward to sharing our explorations with you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Gaudin covers the Internet and Web 2.0, emerging technologies, and desktop and laptop chips for Computerworld .

Inc (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein took responsibility
for the bank's conduct during the financial crisis on a call

broadcast on CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We not only have to deal with the doubts, we have to
analyze what we did and how we performed that got us into this

charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which
has accused the bank of failing to tell investors that the
securities underlying a so-called synthetic collateralized debt
obligation were chosen by a short-seller, John Paulson, whose
fund was betting the CDO would lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately on Wednesday, Jon Corzine, a one-time Goldman
CEO, downplayed the charges, saying it is "hard to see" how
Goldman could have broken the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Goldman has also drawn the attention of a Senate
subcommittee and is facing a Justice Department criminal
investigation and shareholder lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch Ratings changed its outlook on Goldman to "negative"
from "stable" on Wednesday, saying regulatory probes could hurt
the bank's reputation and ability to generate revenue.

light of the scrutiny of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems to be that because Goldman Sachs has been as
successful as it is has been, it has ended up being the overall
proxy for problems in the mortgage market," Corzine said.

&lt;p&gt; * "Iron Man 2" seen yielding $200-$300 mln Disney profit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Global box office may surpass $600 mln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Wall Street watches closely to measure Marvel purchase&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sue Zeidler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGLES, May 5 (Reuters) - "Iron Man 2," the first big
Marvel superhero film to open since Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) $4
billion purchase of the studio, should pack a $200 million to
$300 million profit punch for Disney, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Viacom Inc's VIAb.N Paramount Pictures distributes
"Iron Man 2," giving it a fee of 8 to 10 percent of box office
revenue under a deal made before last year's acquisition,
Disney unit Marvel Studios gets a share of the profits and
benefits from some merchandising and product tie-ins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial analysts, many of whom believe Disney paid a full
price for Marvel, are tracking the movie's success closely to
see how the acquisition of Marvel comic characters might
benefit the company in the long term and unlock value for its
other businesses, such as its theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The biggest benefits will come when existing agreements
for consumer licensing and distribution expire, but I think
Disney will make close to $300 million on this over the life of
the film," said David Bank, analyst with RBC Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tony Wible, analyst with Janney Capital Markets sees Disney
earning about $200 million in profits from the box office and
merchandising, net of licensing fees, and from other sources
like movie plug-in product placements by companies like Oracle
ORCL.O and Burger King BKC.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The logic behind this acquisition is to build the brand
upon a global scale. We expect this film to be highly
profitable given that Marvel generally runs a very lean
budget," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Box office watchers expect "Iron Man 2," which opens in the
United States and Canada on Friday, to rake-in over $600
million around the world by the end of its run, which could
prove conservative, given last summer's big hit, "Transformers:
Revenge of the Fallen" earned $836 million worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first "Iron Man," which stars Robert Downey, Jr. as a
weapons maker who manufactures a high-powered and lethal suit
of armor, made $585 million worldwide in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last weekend, "Iron Man 2" got off to a flying start with
an international debut of $100 million. Paul Dergarabedian of
tracking firm Hollywood.com Box Office expects it to make more
than $120 million on its U.S. and Canadian debut weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts forecast Disney making as much as a $40
million in profit by as early as the third quarter, but given
the company's size and annual revenues of over $36 billion,
they see only a limited impact on overall corporate earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even "if the movie bombs, it could have a modest impact and
we'd ask if there was a write-off," said Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While various analysts believe Disney, which reports second
quarter earnings on Tuesday, paid a full price for Marvel, most
expect the deal to pay off longer term after the Paramount and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 5 (Reuters) - The owners of the
bigdough.com.inc institutional investor database sued Goldman
Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) on Wednesday, accusing the company of 
theft of information and copyright infringement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in New York by
Ipreo Holdings LLC, accused Goldman employees of 264 incidents
of unauthorized access to the computer database in 2008 and
2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This unauthorized access was done by defendants with the
intention to steal, copy, use and/or solicit contacts and

Goldman to account for all profits and advantages from the
infringement it claims in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the complaint, at least two Goldman employees
"repeatedly used an Ipreo login name and password from multiple
computers registered to Goldman's offices." Ipreo wants Goldman
to identify any employees or others affiliated with Goldman who
obtained unauthorized access to Ipreo's computer servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs spokesman Ed Canaday said in an emailed

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Depomed (Nasdaq: DEPO) as the Bull of the Day
and King Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: KG) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), MasterCard Inc.
(NYSE: MA) and Baker Hughes Inc. (NYSE: BHI). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We have been bullish on Depomed (Nasdaq: DEPO) in the past, and we remain
enthusiastic about the development pipeline. 

PHN candidate DM-1796 is currently under review at the U.S. FDA. Acceptance of
the filing triggers a $10 million milestone payment from partner Abbott Labs to
Depomed. In the meantime, Depomed is looking to begin a confirmatory phase III
program with Serada any day now. 

Over the long-run, we think it would be wise to average down or establish a
position at this level. Our target is $7 based on discounted future EPS. 

Bear of the Day: 

King Pharmaceuticals' (NYSE: KG) fourth quarter earnings of $0.23 were a penny
shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although revenues increased 26.1% from the
year-ago period, we remain concerned about the declining prescription trends for
key products over the past few quarters. 

Moreover, products like Skelaxin, Avinza and EpiPen are all facing patent
challenges. Chances are high that Skelaxin will start facing generics from 2010
unless King settles with the generic companies that are seeking to launch their
products. 

While the recent approval and launch of Embeda was a major positive for King, we
remain concerned about pipeline setbacks, increasing competition, generic
threats and declining prescription trends. We are, therefore, downgrading the
stock to Underperform with an $8.75 target price. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Pfizer Results Boosted by Wyeth

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) reported first quarter adjusted earnings of 60 cents per
share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents and 11% above the year-ago
earnings of 54 cents. 

Performance was boosted by the Wyeth acquisition. This was partially offset by
increased expenses, primarily due to the addition of the legacy Wyeth
operations, and higher net interest expense. 

Revenues were up 54%, mainly due to the favorable impact of the Wyeth
acquisition ($5.3 billion). Foreign exchange boosted revenues by $733 million,
or 7%. This was partially offset by $137 million, or 1%, due to legacy Pfizer
products. The US healthcare reform also affected revenues by $56 million. First
quarter revenues came in at $16.8 billion. 

MasterCard Outshines Estimates

MasterCard Inc.`s (NYSE: MA) first quarter operating earnings per share of $3.46
came in substantially ahead the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14 and $2.80 in
the year-ago quarter. Net income for the reported quarter was $455 million, up
24% from $367 million in the prior-year quarter. 

Results for the reported quarter improved over the prior-year quarter due
primarily to better pricing, an increased number of processed transactions and
higher operating margin. However, higher operating expenses as a result of
increased fixed costs were on the downside. 

Total revenue increased 13.1% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, primarily due to
5% favorable pricing changes, 4.6% growth in the number of processed
transactions to 5.4 billion and a 10.9% increase in cross-border volumes. GDV
[gross dollar volume] increased 8.3% to $631 billion during the reported
quarter. As of Mar 31, 2010, MasterCard issued 1.6 billion MasterCard and
Maestro-branded cards. 

Baker Hughes Beats Estimates

Baker Hughes Inc. (NYSE: BHI) reported first-quarter 2010 earnings of 41 cents
per share, compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents and year-ago
earnings of 81 cents. 

Though the results came in above our expectations, it was down year over year,
due primarily to price deterioration in international businesses. However, with
the improvement in pricing and customer spending, the company is expecting a
better margin environment ahead. In addition, Baker Hughes will also benefit
from the recently completed merger with BJ Services. 

Revenue from Baker Hughes` oilfield operations was $2.54 billion, down nearly 5%
year over year but up 4.6% sequentially. Pre-tax operating profits decreased 27%
year over year but increased more than 14% sequentially to $277 million. Pre-tax
operating margin for the quarter was 11%, compared with 14% in the year-ago
quarter and 10% in the previous quarter.

&lt;p&gt; * Says Goldman must recognize doubters - reports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says must analyze how firm got into this position-CNBC &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Corzine says "hard to see" how Goldman broke law
 (Updates with comments from Corzine, new headline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Steve Eder and Ross Kerber&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK/WASHINGSTON, May 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein took responsibility
for the bank's conduct during the financial crisis on a call
with wealthy clients on Wednesday, according to media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein said in the call that Goldman must "recognize
that we put ourselves in a position where people can raise
those types of doubts." according to a recording of the call
broadcast on CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We not only have to deal with the doubts, we have to
analyze what we did and how we performed that got us into this
place," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, Wall Street's dominant firm, is facing fraud
charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which
has accused the bank of failing to tell investors that the
securities underlying a so-called synthetic collateralized debt
obligation were chosen by a short-seller, John Paulson, whose
fund was betting the CDO would lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately on Wednesday, Jon Corzine, a one-time Goldman
CEO, downplayed the charges, saying it is "hard to see" how
Goldman could have broken the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Goldman has also drawn the attention of a Senate
subcommittee and is facing a Justice Department criminal
investigation and shareholder lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein has done a number of media interviews over the
past week, and top Goldman executives have been meeting more
frequently with clients and investors as the firm confronts
accusations that it has conflicts of interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein, on the call with private wealth management
clients, said the increased communication with clients is the
silver lining of the scrutiny facing the firm and that he
should have done more calls earlier, according to The Wall
Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein said it is very hard to avoid the appearance of
conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We shouldn't shy away from the fact that there are
conflicts in this business and the potential for conflicts and
that what we do is manage conflicts," Blankfein said, according
to the CNBC broadcast. "...it's not the conflicts, but how you
manage the conflicts that shows your quality and your
character."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "SELF-CORRECT"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corzine, a former New Jersey governor and Senator, told a
conference in Washington that he questions the merits of the
case against Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's hard to see where the law was broken and I question
whether there were choices on ethics that were breached,"
Corzine said. "It's very hard to understand how you turn that
into a legal case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corzine said he expects that Goldman will "self-correct" in
light of the scrutiny on the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems to be that because Goldman Sachs has been as
successful as it is has been, it has ended up being the overall
proxy for problems in the mortgage market," Corzine said.

Los Angeles-area refinery in Torrance, California, a company

the refinery, said Exxon spokeswoman Aarti Ramachandran. The
overhaul began on March 5.

&lt;p&gt;Handheld-giant Nokia and Microsoft, the world's largest software company, on Tuesday announced the first fruit of their recent mobile-productivity pact: Microsoft Communicator Mobile for Nokia handhelds and the Symbian platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Communicator Mobile for Nokia, which is initially available free of charge in English for Nokia's E52 and E72 devices via the Nokia Ovi mobile software store, is an enterprise collaboration tool that connects directly with Microsoft Exchange corporate systems. More specifically, the new app lets users view colleagues' status and availability and then click to contact them via various methods including IM, e-mail, text and voice. Colleagues' names and statuses are listed in users' contact applications, so they can update their own presence, initiate or join in on existing IM sessions, and place new calls from that central location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement is aimed directly at BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion (RIM) and its enterprise users. RIM currently offers a variety of comparable collaboration tools for BlackBerry deployments in Microsoft Exchange environments, such as its BlackBerry client for Microsoft's Office Communications Server (OCS). And the new Microsoft Communicator Mobile for Nokia brings much of the same functionality to Nokia smartphone users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This application really provides a much more efficient way to work with others, as you can see if someone is busy or available and the best way to start a conversation with them," said Ukko Lappalainen, vice president at Nokia, in a press release. "It also meets all of the requirements for the enterprise: cost-effective to implement, secure, familiar and reliable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nokia/Microsoft pact was first announced last August, and Microsoft Communicator Mobile for Nokia is just the first product the companies plan to release for the enterprise market in the coming months and years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional device support for handhelds including Nokia's new E5 device is expected in the near future. And Nokia plans to pre-install the client on select handhelds, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit Microsoft's website for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a href="http://www.cio.com/topic/3061/Mobile_Wireless"Read more about mobile/wireless/a] in CIO's Mobile/Wireless Drilldown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.cio.com/article/592712&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW May 5 (Reuters) - Rajat Gupta, a former director at
Goldman Sachs (GS.N), is set to remain the highest-paid director
on the board of Russia's Sberbank with a 429,000 euro paycheck
for 2009 despite controversy around him in the U.S. media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Gupta hit the public eye last month after the Wall Street
Journal said he told hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam about
Berkshire Hathaway's $5 billion investment in Goldman, before
the deal became public. Gupta said he had done nothing improper.
[ID:nN23198525]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State-controlled Sberbank has submitted Gupta's remuneration
to its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday for approval,
Sberbank said in information it sent to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remuneration for the other directors on the supervisory
board ranged from 1 million roubles to 3.5 million roubles
($117,800).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gupta, Worldwide Managing Director at McKinseyCompany was
first elected to Sberbank's supervisory board in 2008 and his
remuneration for 2008 was also around 430,000 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gupta's departure from Goldman's board of directors was
announced in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dmitry Sergeyev; editing by Elaine Hardcastle)

&lt;p&gt;Company Addresses Security and WAN Performance Issues With Cloud Storage
SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
StorSimple today announced integration with Amazon, EMC, Iron Mountain, and
Microsoft to enable customers to seamlessly and securely use these cloud storage
services with their existing data-center applications. By providing an easy
on-ramp to cloud storage for application-specific requirements, StorSimple aims
to change the game by bringing the operational benefits of the cloud to
applications such as SharePoint, Exchange, Windows User Files and Virtual
Machines. 

"With the upcoming launch of SharePoint 2010, customers will increasingly look
to extend their deployments with cloud-based services," said Ed English, group
product manager, Microsoft SharePoint. "The hybrid storage solution from
StorSimple is a good example of this; it shows how SharePoint customers can
realize cost and scale benefits by using the Windows Azure Platform." 

"Iron Mountain`s Archive Services platform is a natural fit for enterprises
looking for simple but secure cloud storage," said Jaimin Patel, director of
developer programs, Iron Mountain Digital. "By combining StorSimple`s robust
solution with Iron Mountain`s proven cloud storage solutions, companies can now
integrate secure cloud storage into their environments with the confidence that
their data is protected by one of the leading information management services
brands in the industry." 

"EMC believes there is an opportunity and approach to cloud storage that
delivers financial and functional benefits to both our partners and the
customers they serve," said Mike Feinberg, senior vice president of EMC Cloud
Infrastructure Group. "By making our cloud infrastructure accessible and
allowing easy API integration, we enable our partners to respond to customers'
fast-growing demand for cloud-based solutions with greater scalability,
elasticity, and lower costs. We are pleased to work with StorSimple to embrace
and deliver these benefits to our joint customers." 

"Our relationships with Amazon, EMC, Iron Mountain, and Microsoft allow us to
deliver the integrated support and operational experience of enterprise storage
with the business and operational benefits of cloud storage," said Ursheet
Parikh, co-founder and CEO of StorSimple. "Enterprise cloud storage service
providers have chosen to partner with StorSimple, because of our differentiated
technology that optimizes for application-specific data-access patterns to
ensure primary storage performance for target applications." 

The StorSimple Armada Storage Appliance is a hybrid storage solution that makes
cloud storage appear like local data center storage that integrates into
customers` existing storage and data management tools. Armada identifies and
stores all the hotspot and bottleneck data on a tier of high-performance Solid
State Drives (SSD), enabling the use of lower-cost SATA storage and/or cloud
storage as primary storage. StorSimple also performs real-time data
de-duplication to minimize the footprint of the data stored and provides the WAN
optimization functions for cloud storage. All data that is stored in the cloud
is encrypted. 

About StorSimple

StorSimple has developed an application-optimized hybrid storage controller for
SharePoint, Exchange, Windows User Files and Virtual Machines that delivers
consistent storage performance at scale, significantly simplifies data
protection, and reduces cost by up to 90 percent compared to traditional
enterprise storage used with these applications. StorSimple is based in the
Silicon Valley and is funded by Redpoint Ventures and Index Ventures.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Wednesday changed its outlook on Goldman Sachs to negative from stable, saying regulatory probes could hurt the bank's reputation and ability to generate revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A negative outlook indicates that Fitch may cut Goldman's rating from A-plus, the fifth highest investment grade, over the coming one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman's franchise and market position are potentially vulnerable to scrutiny by stakeholders, and like peers, may be affected by the industry's regulatory evolution," Fitch said in a statement.

companies that depend on the capital markets, Fitch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has ample financial resources to address potential
fines of settlements from the SEC suit, though the bank would
be at greater risk if it is subject to a formal criminal
indictment, Fitch said. The rating agency added though, that it
does not view this outcome as likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Karen Brettell; Additional reporting by Dan

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 5 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Wednesday
changed its outlook on Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to negative from
stable, saying that the bank's reputation and ability to
generate revenue could be hurt by regulatory probes into the
bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A negative outlook indicates that Fitch may cut Goldman's
rating from A-plus, the fifth highest investment grade, over
the coming one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has come under pressure since the bank on April 16
was charged with fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over its marketing of a subprime mortgage product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a rare move, the bank on Monday disclosed information
about the many lawsuits and shareholder challenges facing it.

&lt;p&gt; (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

 May 5 - Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A+/F1+' long- and short-term Issuer
Default Ratings (IDRs) for The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS.N) (Goldman).
Fitch has also revised Goldman's Rating Outlook to Negative from Stable.

 A complete list of ratings follows this release. The rating affirmation is
indicative of Goldman's de-levered balance sheet, proven earnings power, and
its prominence and demonstrated success in global capital markets and sales 
trading.

 Additionally, Goldman continues to exhibit strong liquidity management,
maintaining significant global core excess balances. Since the economic crisis
began, Goldman has consistently outperformed its global banking peers; those
favorable trends have continued through first-quarter 2010 (1Q'10). The Rating
Outlook revision to Negative incorporates recent legal developments and ongoing
regulatory challenges that could adversely impact Goldman's reputation and
revenue generating capacity.

 Goldman's franchise and market position are potentially vulnerable to
scrutiny by stakeholders, and like peers, may be affected by the industry's
regulatory evolution.

 Subsequent to civil fraud charges filed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) last month, it appears that the U.S. Attorney's Office in
Manhattan is initiating a criminal probe in connection with Goldman's mortgage
trading activity. Given the level of recent public scrutiny, it is not
surprising that other authorities outside of the U.S. have also expressed
intentions to investigate select mortgage-related transactions conducted by
Goldman.

 At a minimum, Fitch believes the civil charges to date and the pending
criminal investigation, coupled with a highly public hearing by the U.S.
Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, generate adverse publicity
that tarnishes Goldman's reputation. And for financial services companies,
particularly those dependent on the capital markets, reputation is critically
important. Moreover, expected follow-on shareholder and investor claims are
likely to invariably consume management time and financial resources as well.
Fitch believes Goldman has ample financial resources to address any potential
monetary fine or settlement (including full restitution to impacted parties)
that may arise from the SEC civil suit, as well as any assessments that may
materialize at the conclusion of the pending investigation.

 The level of any fines or assessments by any agencies outside of the U.S.
could not be accurately estimated at this time, but Fitch acknowledges that
these have generally not proven to be debilitating. While not expected, Fitch
believes Goldman's franchise is at greater risk in the event the company was to
be the recipient of a formal criminal indictment. However, Fitch does not
foresee such an extreme outcome for Goldman. Additionally, regulatory reform
currently under consideration may curtail some of Goldman's core business
activities.

 Higher capital requirements, central clearing of derivatives, restricted
proprietary trading and investment activity are key legislative items currently
being contemplated that would challenge Goldman's current business model. These
reforms may favorably influence the risk profile, but potentially reduce
revenues, increase costs or reduce profitability in select businesses.

 It is not certain at this time how extensive final legislation will
ultimately be in the government's efforts to contain systemic risk. Fitch
believes the probability is high, though some limitation on Goldman's current
business activities, along with those of the company's peers, will occur.
Despite any necessary business adaptations, Fitch expects Goldman will position
itself to compete successfully in its key business segments. Fitch believes
there are a variety of outcomes that may materialize with respect to Goldman's
future ratings. The most pessimistic downgrade scenarios entail adverse
decisions in the pending suits and investigations, coupled with highly
restrictive financial reform.

 The extent of any downgrade would depend on the ultimate legal decisions
and financial outlays, with adverse conclusions in the criminal investigation
resulting in more severe downgrades of both the IDRs and Individual rating.
Absent serious negative legal results, Fitch does not envision any adverse
outcome that would precipitate a downgrade to Goldman's IDR below the 'A'
rating category. Fitch continues to have regular dialogue with management with
regard to the aforementioned circumstances, as well as pending regulatory
reforms. If the legal issues and regulatory reforms turn out to be minor events
for Goldman, Fitch would view these as positive credit developments with
corresponding implications for our perspective on risk, and the Outlook would
likely be revised to Stable.

&lt;p&gt;* Invested $144 million in community initiatives around the world
* Adopted a Human Rights Policy
* Completed major energy efficiency projects and reduced GHG emissions

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) invested $144 million in communities around the
world, adopted a human rights policy and completed major energy efficiency
projects, according to the company's 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report, The
Value of Partnership, which was issued today. 

"Global economic prosperity and quality of life depend on secure supplies of
reliable, affordable energy," said John Watson, Chevron chairman and CEO. "Every
day, Chevron employees produce and deliver energy in a safe, environmentally
sound and socially responsible manner, creating enduring economic and social
value." 

Chevron's eighth annual Corporate Responsibility Report provides descriptions,
data and perspectives on community and stakeholder engagement, environmental
management, energy efficiency, health and safety, human rights, and renewable
energy and biofuels. Highlights include: 

Community Engagement &amp; Economic Development

Chevron`s community engagement projects and partnerships contribute to social
progress, economic growth and the well-being of communities where the company
operates. In 2009, Chevron invested $144 million in communities around the world
to promote basic human needs, provide education and training, and stimulate
local business development. Through Chevron Humankind, the company`s U.S.
employee community involvement program, employees volunteered more than 40,000
hours in their communities and participant contributions and company matches
resulted in more than $25 million to support the work of nonprofits. 

Chevron purchased approximately $40 billion in goods and services from suppliers
and contractors, including $2.7 billion with small and medium-size businesses in
the United States in 2009. Chevron also spent an additional $319 million with
minority-owned business and $433 million with women-owned businesses in the
United States. The report explains how Chevron`s community investments are
designed to strengthen communities, support the development of women and
encourage greater economic and social stability. 

In its effort to continue to address global health issues, Chevron made a
three-year, $30 million investment with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2008. In 2009, the company worked with Global Fund
grant recipients in Angola, Nigeria, South Africa, Indonesia, Thailand and the
Philippines to stem the spread of these diseases. Chevron partnered with Program
for Applied Technology, an international non-government organization, to
increase HIV/AIDS awareness among youth and public transportation drivers in
Thailand. The company also worked with Nigeria`s National Agency for the Control
of AIDS to deploy a Small/Medium Enterprise Workplace Wellness program to
improve management of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the workplace. 

Human Rights

In 2009, Chevron adopted a human rights policy to further the company`s
commitment to respecting human rights in the countries and communities where it
operates. The policy addresses four human rights areas relevant to the company`s
business: employees, security providers, community engagement and suppliers. 

Environmental Management

In 2009, Chevron sanctioned the US$37 billion Gorgon natural gas project off the
northwest coast of Australia - the largest energy project in the company`s
history. The project is expected to generate thousands of jobs, produce energy
for millions of homes and businesses, and integrate environmental, economic and
social benefits. To reduce carbon emissions, the project plans to capture and
reinject carbon dioxide (CO2) from natural gas production. This will be the
largest project of its kind in the world, injecting four times more CO2 than any
other project. Chevron also expects to sustain the environmental integrity of
Barrow Island, a Class A nature reserve and the location for Gorgon. Barrow
Island has been a model for coexistence of energy development and biodiversity
since Chevron began oil operations there in 1964. 

Energy Efficiency and Climate Change

In 2009, Chevron reduced its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately 2.2
million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. From 2008 to 2009, Chevron reduced GHG
emissions from flaring by eight percent and advanced significant projects that
will continue to reduce GHG emissions from flaring in Angola, Kazakhstan and
Nigeria. 

Chevron Energy Solutions (CES), a subsidiary, undertook several projects in the
United States to improve energy efficiency and install renewable power
technologies at schools, federal facilities and Chevron facilities. In 2009, CES
completed the nation`s largest energy efficiency and solar electric system at a
transit facility for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority. Along with other energy-efficient improvements, the project is
expected to cut the facility`s annual $1.1 million energy bill in half and
reduce its purchase of utility power, which is anticipated to reduce carbon
emissions by more than 3,700 metric tons. Since 1992, Chevron has increased its
own energy efficiency by 30 percent. 

Health and Safety

For the eighth consecutive year, Chevron has improved its safety performance. In
2009, the company posted its safest year on record. 

Chevron`s workforce has increased its awareness of road safety, reducing the
company`s most severe motor vehicle incidents by 73 percent since 2007. 

Renewable Energy and Biofuels

As the world`s largest producer of clean, renewable geothermal power, Chevron`s
operations in Indonesia and the Philippines provide energy to meet the needs of
16 million people in the region. 

In 2009, Chevron built two renewable energy projects on former refinery sites: a
wind farm in Casper, Wyoming, and a solar test facility in Bakersfield,
California. In 2010, Chevron Technology Ventures plans to have completed what
may be the largest concentrating solar photovoltaic power plant in the United
States, located at Chevron Mining Inc.`s Questa mine in New Mexico. 

Stakeholder Engagement

Chevron's Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessment (ESHIA) process is
designed to identify, analyze and develop measures that enhance benefits and
avoid or mitigate potential environmental, social and health impacts of new
capital projects. By the end of 2009, ESHIA was being applied to more than 690
capital projects worldwide. A goal of ESHIA is to establish and maintain
dialogue with stakeholders throughout the lifetime of a project and solicit
their views on potential benefits and impacts and consider their ideas in the
company`s assessments and planning.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Wireless will start to sell Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Kin phones on Thursday as both companies look to do battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) by catering to savvy young phone users who are obsessed with following what their friends are doing online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. wireless operator will start online sales on Thursday for the two phones, the companies said today, which were announced on April 13, and it plans to start selling them in stores one week later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kin One -- a small phone with a touchscreen, a slide-out keyboard and a square shape that resembles a cosmetics compact -- will sell for $49.99 to consumers who sign a service contract with Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kin Two -- a bigger rectangular-shaped phone with a slide-out keyboard and touchscreen controls -- will sell for $99.99 to contract customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both phones have very similar functionality, but the Kin Two has a much bigger screen and an eight-megapixel camera while the Kin One's camera takes five-megapixel photographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both devices which are to be manufactured by Sharp Corp (6753.T) are exclusive to Verizon Wireless and represent a big step for Microsoft, which has mostly stuck to selling its mobile software to other phone makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kin devices are landing just months before Microsoft unveils its latest software Windows Phone 7, which the company says will target a broader cellphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new phones should help Microsoft compete with Apple and rivals Google Inc (GOOG.O), whose Android phone software has gained a lot of ground in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Kin will also put it into direct competition with its phone software customers, which include HTC Corp (2498.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sinead Carew, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Kin One to retail for $49.99, Kin Two for $99.99&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Online sales start Thurs May 6, in stores May 13&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 5 (Reuters) - Verizon Wireless will start to
sell Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Kin phones on Thursday as both
companies look to do battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) by catering
to savvy young phone users who are obsessed with following what
their friends are doing online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The biggest U.S. wireless operator will start online sales
on Thursday for the two phones, the companies said today, which
were announced on April 13, and it plans to start selling them
in stores one week later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Kin One -- a small phone with a touchscreen, a
slide-out keyboard and a square shape that resembles a
cosmetics compact -- will sell for $49.99 to consumers who sign
a service contract with Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon
Communications (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Kin Two -- a bigger rectangular-shaped phone with a
slide-out keyboard and touchscreen controls -- will sell for
$99.99 to contract customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both phones have very similar functionality, but the Kin
Two has a much bigger screen and an eight-megapixel camera
while the Kin One's camera takes five-megapixel photographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both devices which are to be manufactured by Sharp Corp
(6753.T) are exclusive to Verizon Wireless and represent a big
step for Microsoft, which has mostly stuck to selling its
mobile software to other phone makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Kin devices are landing just months before Microsoft
unveils its latest software Windows Phone 7, which the company
says will target a broader cellphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new phones should help Microsoft compete with Apple and
rivals Google Inc (GOOG.O), whose Android phone software has
gained a lot of ground in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the Kin will also put it into direct competition
with its phone software customers, which include HTC Corp
(2498.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS).

&lt;p&gt;Nokia and Microsoft on Wednesday announced the availability of Microsoft Communicator Mobile for Nokia, a unified communications client for Nokia's Eseries smartphones. The software is the first result of the partnership they announced in August last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Communicator Mobile client connects with Microsoft's Office Communications Server 2007 R2, and let users see their colleagues' availability and communicate with them using instant messaging, e-mail, SMS (Short Message Service) or a call from the phone's address book, according to Nokia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to see when and how colleagues are available -- commonly referred to as presence -- and send instant messages are the key features, a Nokia spokesman said via e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voice calls will be made via the phone network, but a future version will also be able to make calls over IP, he added, without providing any details. Today, voice-over-IP calls can instead be made using Microsoft's PC client, Office Communicator, which also integrates with Office Communications Server. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, Microsoft Communicator Mobile will be available on the Nokia E72 and the E52 handsets, and owners of those devices can download the English version of the software from Nokia's Ovi Store. Nokia plans to ship the software on certain smartphones in future, and to support additional devices, including the recently announced Nokia E5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, Microsoft has only offered its enterprise customers a Windows Mobile-based mobile client, something that has held Office Communications Server back, according to Steve Blood, vice president and agenda manager at Gartner. Companies have instead been turning to PBX and third-party software vendors that offer a wider support for different mobile operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition of support for Symbian is a step in the right direction, but now Microsoft has to "dance with the devil" and also add support for the iPhone, Android-based smartphones and Research In Motion's BlackBerry phones, according to Blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the announcement in August, Nokia and Microsoft have been collaborating on the design and development of "new solutions". However, they have not yet said what that will lead to beyond Communicator Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

in the first quarter alone. We Believe BP needs to be watched extremely
closely while facing negative press, and presidential blame due to the
recent spill in the Gulf. Ford Motor Company is delivering on its 2006
pledge to double the number of flexible-fuel vehicles produced in the
U.S. by the end of 2010. Pfizer posted better than-expected first quarter

portfolio to benefit in the small cap market, many investors are
searching for credible micro and small cap investments due to the
enormous gains potential. While it's hard to find a $30.00 stock that
goes to $120.00, finding a micro or small cap stock that goes from $0.30
to $1.20 can be a weekly occurrence.

&lt;p&gt;SandForce Brings Affordable, Reliable Solid State Drive Technology to Enterprise
Customers
SARATOGA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
SandForce  Inc., the pioneer of SSD (Solid State Drive) Processors that enable
standard NAND Flash deployment in enterprise and client computing applications,
today announced a record performance benchmark of IBM (NYSE:IBM) POWER7 systems
with SandForce-based SSDs. The benchmark results showed dramatic improvements in
processing efficiency and price/performance, using "multi-level cell" (MLC)
flash technology. 

MLC flash is a solid state technology traditionally used in consumer devices
because it is dramatically more affordable than single level cell (SLC) flash.
Many enterprise clients have found the cost of SLC flash to be prohibitive,
while the reliability of the more affordable MLC flash was an issue for the
enterprise. Unique DuraClass technology integrated in SandForce SSD Processors
brings enterprise-class reliability to MLC flash so enterprises can now take
advantage of the speed of SSDs at an affordable price. 

An IBM POWER7 system with MLC SSDs based on SandForce Processors recently
achieved an unprecedented 150,000 transactions per minute per CPU core running
the TPC-C Online Transaction Processing benchmark -- nearly a 50% improvement in
processing efficiency per core as compared to the next leading system. In
addition, the benchmark delivers a 36% advantage in price/performance compared
to the next leading system with the same number of CPU cores. This record
setting performance showcases the ability of IBM Power Systemsto deliver
leadership performance for transactional workloads like smart utility grids. 

IBM POWER7 is the first enterprise server in the industry to use SandForce SSD
Processor technology. By bringing lower cost flash technology to the enterprise,
POWER7 provides enterprise clients fast access to data so it can be more quickly
analyzed for insight to provide competitive advantage. 

"The record IBM TPC-C benchmark results demonstrate that SandForce and IBM are
transforming enterprise server data storage with the enablement of
cost-effective MLC flash as the storage media workhorse for highly scalable
compute platforms," said Thad Omura, Vice President of Marketing for SandForce.
"By dramatically lowering the cost structure and power envelope of enterprise
server storage media while maintaining breakthrough performance and reliability,
data centers worldwide are ultimately empowered to do more with less." 

SandForce SSD Processors address the inherent endurance, reliability, and data
retention issues associated with MLC flash memory, making it possible to build
SSDs that deliver unprecedented performance and reliability over the life of the
drive while reducing the cost compared to SLC. 

Key Facts Behind the IBM POWER7 TPC-C Benchmark

TPC-C is an OLTP (online transaction processing) benchmark developed by the
Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC). The TPC-C benchmark defines a
rigorous standard for calculating performance and price/performance measured by
transactions per minute (tpmC) and $/tpmC, respectively. More information is
available at http://www.tpc.org/.

* 10.5TB of SSD capacity (total of fifty-six 177GB MLC SSDs that use SandForce
SF-1500 SSD Processors) 
* IBM Power 780, Eight-core, two-socket system with POWER7 technology, 4.14GHz
per core 
* Highest total performance of any eight-core system: 1,200,011 tpmC which is
81% higher than the next leading system (661,475 tpmC) 
* Best price/performance of any eight-core system: $0.69 per tpmC, which is 36%
lower than the next leading system ($1.08/tpmC) 
* Highest performance per CPU core of all systems benchmarked: 150,000 tpmC/CPU
core which is nearly 50% higher than then next highest score (101,116 tpmC/CPU
core)

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's FUSE Labs--the cutting edge, innovative research group behind the recent Docs.com announcement--unveiled yet another new project today at the Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco. Spindex is a new FUSE Labs project to help aggregate and streamline social streams to help you interact more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lili Cheng, general manager of Microsoft FUSE Labs, wrote in a blog post on The Official Microsoft Blog "One area we've been focused on lately is the personalization of social computing. As you increasingly tweet, post to Facebook, and capture ideas with tools like Evernote, we want to help you get the most out of your social activity by exposing the right information, at the right time, in a way that's meaningful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As social networking has grown it has also become unwieldy and cumbersome. What began as a small clique of friends or family has spiraled out of control into hundreds or thousands of connections spanning multiple social network services. Spindex will enable you to connect to and consolidate information streams from Facebook, Twitter, Evernote, RSS feeds, and Bing--for starters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Microsoft is not the first to attempt such an aggregation of social networking. Tweetdeck, which is my default tool on my Windows 7 notebook, my iPhone, and my iPad for working with Twitter is also capable of connecting with and posting to Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn--providing a fairly comprehensive interface for managing social networks. Lifestream, from AOL, also provides one-stop shopping for social networks including all of the ones from Tweetdeck, as well as Digg, YouTube, Flickr, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spindex puts a unique spin on the concept, though, by providing personalized trending topics. The keywords and hot topics among your personal social network are much more relevant to you than what the world at large is following. In addition, Spindex proactively seeks out articles and information via Bing and provides you with links to dig deeper and learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spindex site describes it "Make sense of your social overload, open your personalized Spindex page, and find out at a glance what topics are hot in your social world. You can also keep track of the things you are remembering via Evernote--right inside of your Spindex page. Spindex is not just a social reader--as you browse your friends' updates, Spindex continually suggests related content from Bing--giving you better insight into the topics and trends spinning around you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FUSE Labs has also been behind some other recent Microsoft innovations such as Bing Twitter Maps, Docs.com, and Outlook Social Connectors. The Outlook Social Connectors concept is also aimed at engaging social networks more efficiently, but from an opposite perspective from Spindex. Where Spindex consolidates social streams into a single console, Outlook Social Connectors enable you to separate social streams by contact and quickly find message threads and status updates affiliated with a specific individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spindex is currently available only as a CTP (community technology preview) for attendees of the Web 2.0 Expo. Stay tuned to FUSE Labs to find out when it will be available to the general public. I will be keeping my eyes open for an opportunity to play with this new tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can follow Tony on his Facebook page , or contact him by email at tony_bradley@pcworld.com .

&lt;p&gt;Denny Thomas and Narayanan Somasundaram&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ.AX) has hired Goldman Sachs JBWere and JP Morgan (JPM.N) to advise on its bid for a majority stake in Korea Exchange Bank 004940.KS, sources said on Wednesday, in what is expected to be a more than $4 billion deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources told Reuters last month that ANZ, Australia's No.4 lender, was preparing to bid for the KEB stake, currently owned by U.S. private equity firm Lone Star Funds. The auction, also expected to attract large South Korean banks, is the largest banking deal to date in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANZ, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) declined to comment. Goldman Sachs JBWere is Goldman's joint venture partner in Australia. The sources declined to be identified as the news of the mandate is not public yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANZ's hiring of two big bulge Wall Street investment banks for the deal underscores the seriousness with which it wants to pursue the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first round bids are due in mid May. Foreign bank interest in the sale is seen as limited, with HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) (0005.HK) already deciding to stay out of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top South Korean lender KB Financial had been considered one of the strongest candidates to buy KEB, but banking sources said the group was now considering a deal with Woori Finance Holdings (053000.KS) instead as the government planned to privatize state-owned Woori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller rival Hana Financial Group (086790.KS) was also interested in KEB but did not have enough cash in hand, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lone Star bought into KEB for $1.2 billion and sold down part of its stake in 2007. Its previous attempts to sell KEB -- to Kookmin Bank for $7.3 billion in 2006 and HSBC for $6.3 billion in 2008 -- failed as a result of pricing and legal disputes over the U.S. fund's South Korean activities. Most of legal issues have since been resolved in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) is advising Lone Star.&lt;/p&gt;

unveils its latest software Windows Phone 7, which the company
says will target a broader cellphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new phones should help Microsoft compete with Apple and
rivals Google Inc (GOOG.O), whose Android phone software has
gained a lot of ground in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the Kin will also put it into direct competition
with its phone software customers, which include HTC Corp
(2498.TW) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS).

&lt;p&gt;Recently Signed Alliance Accelerates Innovation with Global Financing, Cloud
Computing, Combined Industry Solutions and Services
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Dassault Syst&#232;mes (DS)(Paris:DSY)(Euronext Paris: #13065, DSY.PA), a world
leader in 3D and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions, and IBM (NYSE:
IBM) today announced an expansion of their long-standing partnership and
highlighted at IBM`s IMPACT 2010 event the early deliverables of their Global
Alliance, including financing solutions from IBM Global Financing, a joint
competency center, and work on a PLM cloud computing proof of concept. 

"Bentley has a long-term relationship with Dassault Syst&#232;mes and IBM built up
around software, systems and services. This relationship has helped us
accelerate and improve our Engineering Design and Manufacturing PLM processes as
we developed the Bentley Mulsanne, moving it through to the start of production
in 2010," said John Unsworth, CAD strategy manager, Bentley Motors Limited.
"Integration, teaming and access to industry best practices have been critical
to our success with knowledge and skills transfer leading us closer to self
sufficiency. Bentley strives for continuous improvement throughout all of its
activities and we are always keen to exploit the next level of process
concurrency. Dassault Syst&#232;mes and IBM solutions and best practices will be a
factor in helping us get there." 

The two companies, which represent the PLM industry`s longest running alliance,
continue to invest in developing, deploying and supporting client PLM
environments. Further results from the alliance signed last month include a DS
PLM V6 software cloud computing technical proof of concept presented at the IBM
IMPACT 2010 conference this week. The concept illustrates how clients can take
advantage of DS software via a range of delivery options, from on-premise
solutions, to a cloud powered by IBM software, hardware and services that can
help reduce IT complexity and minimize operational costs. 

This latest expansion includes a dedicated team of IBM and DS personnel focused
on enabling, marketing, and delivering PLM solutions necessary for clients to
transform their business. To this end, the companies established an
industry-first joint PLM competency center focused on optimizing DS PLM V6
solutions for performance, reliability, and scalability on an IBM
infrastructure. 

"Our global alliance is focused directly on our customers` success. It covers
flexible financing options, PLM-on-the-cloud, combined infrastructure, software
and services solutions, as well as a one-of-a-kind competency center for
industrialization of V6 solutions on IBM infrastructure," said Philippe
Forestier, executive vice president, Global Affairs, Dassault Syst&#232;mes. "These
are all a means to a single end: our customers` innovation and business
transformation strategies. Strategies such as these are significant and our
customers deserve the best solutions and services in the industry to ensure a
successful implementation and genuine return on investment." 

The IBM Global Financing portfolio is designed to help fuel innovation for
clients using the combination of DS and IBM technology, providing payment
options that meet their budget, return on investment and project payback
criteria. From simple loans to custom leases and terms as long as 60 months, IBM
can finance the total PLM solution - including hardware, software and services -
by providing affordable monthly rates and flexible payment structures. 

IBM and DS`s collaboration pre-dates the PLM industry, as the two companies
collaborated first in 1981 and later jointly created and marketed the concept of
Product Lifecycle Management. DS's PLM solutions leverage IBM WebSphere, Tivoli,
Information Management, Lotus and Rational software and IBM systems to provide
clients with a 3D vision of the entire lifecycle of their products. The combined
solutions help clients to develop products from conception to maintenance and
recycling. 

"The alliance focuses on delivering end-to-end solutions by industry, starting
from transformation services to globally restructure product development," said
Chuck Masur, vice president, DS Global Alliance, IBM. "It is about a long-shared
and well-understood vision of how customers can advance their businesses with
PLM, cutting cycle times and costs, while achieving breakthrough product
innovation with Dassault Syst&#232;mes and IBM combined solutions."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 6 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. public pension
fund has voted in favor of several shareholder proposals up for
a vote at Goldman Sachs Group's (GS.N) annual meeting on
Friday, against the investment bank's recommendations in each
case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as
CalPERS, which voted 1.8 million shares, supported such
proposals as requiring Goldman to fully report political
contributions and to require its chairman of the board to be
independent, in each case saying the proposals would not harm
Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has about 527 million shares outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CalPERS also voted in favor of such proposals as
maintaining collateral for over-the-counter derivatives trading
in segregated accounts, and a proposed requirement that senior
Goldman executive hold on to stocks acquired through the bank's
compensation plans for at least three years after they leave
Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CalPERS had $201.6 billion of assets as of Feb. 28.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's decision to abandon Windows XP with its next browser is a business move meant to push people off the aged operating system, an analyst said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also gives rivals like Mozilla an opportunity to make further inroads into Internet Explorer's market share, said Sheri McLeish of Forrester Research. "XP is in that same world as Office 2003 and IE6," said McLeish. "Microsoft doesn't want to prolong the life of those products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLeish was reacting to Microsoft's stated plans not to support its next-generation browser, Internet Explorer 9 (IE9), in Windows XP. Google, which creates Chrome, criticized that decision yesterday during a panel discussion at Web 2.0 on the future of browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not in [Microsoft's] interest to support XP," McLeish added. "They have a vision of moving people ahead on operating systems. That's their business intent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will not craft a version of IE9 for XP because it's adding graphics processor-based acceleration to the browser. That acceleration relies on APIs (applications programming interfaces) that are built into Windows 7 and were added to Vista in October 2009, but that are not available in the older OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that Microsoft will meet, and in fact exceed, its usual 10-year support policy for XP -- the operating system is slated for final retirement in April 2014, nearly 13 years after its release -- McLeish said IE9's non-support for the old OS was a business decision by Microsoft. "As time goes on, XP will get less attention paid to it by Microsoft," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also thought that the noise about XP's inability to run IE9 is a moot point for enterprises. "There are few large customers that don't have an upgrade plan [from XP] in place," she said. "Most firms now running XP are planning to upgrade to Windows 7." IE9 runs on Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a window of opportunity exists for browser rivals, particularly Mozilla, over the next several years as small businesses and consumers continue to run Windows XP. Both Google and Mozilla are working on boosting their Chrome and Firefox browsers' by tapping into hardware acceleration, even on XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an opportunity for them," said McLeish, referring to Mozilla. More enterprise administrators are telling her that they've either allowed Firefox on their networks, or are considering the idea. "As they're moving off IE6, they're looking at Mozilla and Firefox."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrome, on the other hand, has little traction in corporations, although Google's browser continues to outpace all other browsers in usage share gains . Google's browser will get little respect from IT administrators, partly because of the battles between Microsoft and Google in the fight over online applications, said McLeish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it will not officially support Chrome or Opera Software's Opera for the online versions of its Office 2010 applications, for example, which means enterprises committed to Office 2010, and that offer workers the Web-based versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint, have little reason to allow Chrome into their environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some pundits worry that IE9's exclusion of XP leaves millions of users out in the cold when it comes to HTML5, the still-under-consideration specification for the next version of the Web's primary development framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been hammering on the benefits of HTML5, and its support within IE9, with the company's IE chief Dean Hachamovitch at the forefront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLeish didn't see any reason for XP users to immediately panic; there's plenty of time before HTML5 supplants Flash, if it ever does. "There's a real tension between Adobe and Apple on Flash versus HTLM5," she said, talking about the public mud-slinging going on between those two firms. "But Microsoft would like to play in both worlds, Flash and HTML5."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Hachamovitch said as much earlier this week on the IE blog . "Of course, IE9 will continue to support Flash and other plug-ins," he said. "We fully expect to support plug-ins (of all types, including video) along with HTML5."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE9 is currently in what Microsoft's called "Platform Preview," a pre-alpha stage that lacks a user interface wrapper around the technology. Microsoft hasn't revealed a schedule for releasing a public beta, much less a final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Microsoft's past IE development cycles, McLeish believes IE9 could be as far away as a year. "I think they're ahead of schedule, but there's a lot that's unclear," she said. "I'm thinking a year from now we'll see a final [of IE9]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;CORDOVA, Alaska/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - More than half an inch of oil covered the sea when Dennis Kelso's boat, piled with a few newly dead birds, nudged up against the side of the Exxon Valdez on Friday, March 24, 1989.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rope ladder hung down the side of one of the biggest vessels on earth, which had run aground near midnight on a reef in pristine Prince William Sound, a haven for birds, whales and otters, brimming with fish that supplied a multimillion dollar industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also next to the end of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, and the Exxon Valdez had picked up millions of gallons of crude piped from the top of the frosty state to bring to gas-thirsty consumers in Long Beach, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring was breaking, migrations were starting -- and Kelso was gagging at the rush of chemicals from the liberated oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the beginning oil was literally boiling out of the tanker," said Kelso, the head of Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation at the time. The crude began changing as it hit the water, releasing benzene and other pungent chemicals into the air, the start of a months-long process of transforming from a light liquid to a tarry gunk that would cling to more than a thousand miles of beaches in southern Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close examination of studies of the Exxon Valdez disaster and interviews with many people who took part in the cleanup offers a possible peek into what lies ahead for the Gulf Coast in the coming weeks, months, years -- and perhaps decades. Indeed, by one estimate, about 21,000 gallons of oil still linger on some of Alaska's beaches, often in the form of dark brown globs just beneath the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, there are still some experts who argue that the aggressive cleanup following the Exxon Valdez spill proved more harmful than the oil itself. That continuing debate points to another potential cautionary tale about how conflicts among various groups looking to make things right can end up hampering cleanup efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GRAY LITERATURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Valdez was an unrivaled environmental disaster which forced the United States to set a new standard for response to oil spills. Nothing in the United States had come close -- until now. As oil spreads across the Gulf of Mexico, a continent away, from the remnants of a British Petroleum well, the debates over how to contain the crude and what to do when it hits shore are similar to the arguments in Alaska two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, not much has changed in the technology of cleaning up oil spills, and research on what to do is dominated by "gray literature" funded by either oil companies or environmental organizations that makes some experts wary. It's clear, though, that the warm Gulf waters lapping marshes in Louisiana and the white sand beaches stretching from Mississippi to northern Florida are a world of difference from Alaska's chilly, craggy, rocky southern coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two mercurial forces -- weather and people -- are key for any cleanup. In many ways both acted against Exxon, beset by storms of nature and among warring scientists and politicians, and have played to BP's advantage. Prevailing winds have largely kept the giant Gulf oil slick offshore for two weeks since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig accident triggered the breach, and the coast guard is firmly in charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day two decades ago in Alaska, the question of who was in charge was open. The day was calm and the sea was smooth -- perfect conditions for containing a slick of crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the view from the bridge, abandoned by the captain after his crew drove the Valdez out of shipping lanes and onto a well known reef, was eerily clear. Exxon had a plan to respond to spills, but the 'designated responder' it had hired wasn't responding. In fact, the boat that was supposed to be in the water, ready to launch at the first word of an accident, had been in dry dock covered with snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Valdez ran into the reef at four minutes after midnight. The captain wasn't on the bridge and had been drinking alcohol earlier in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven of the ship's cargo holds were punctured, and the first of 11 million gallons started filling Prince William Sound. The Valdez, roughly three American football fields long, eventually lost 20 percent of its cargo, although the exact figure was never known, since seawater flowing into the ship made it difficult to measure how much was left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uncapped well in the Gulf has been spewing out around 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons/795,000 liters) a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OCEAN MOUSSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleaning up oil is tough at the beginning and gets harder every day. The first job is to contain a spill, a nearly impossible task in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the water, booms which absorb and contain spills on relatively calm seas can be used to herd it into big pools that can be sucked up or burned. Burning needs perfect conditions, and one engineer compared a siphon to a toothpick in the Gulf. Chemical dispersants which separate crude into fine droplets can be sprayed from ships and planes. Rusty-colored oil 'mousse' can be seen in the Gulf of Mexico where dispersants mixed into the water by waves are breaking down the oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, the oil needs to be kept off shore, which over time is the most difficult thing to do. When oil hits land it's often for a short visit -- dropping off a sheen and then moving with the tides up or down the shoreline. Eventually though, the oil ages, becoming a tar -- like a blob that gloms onto a surface and won't let go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's fine on a hard-packed sandy beach, which is the best place for an oil spill, since a careful lift of a thin layer of sand can get rid of most of the problem. But in marshes, new and old oil can spread thin and deep with a ferocity that makes any cleanup counterproductive -- boots kill more than the oil. Alaska's rocky coast is somewhere in between the two extremes, and just where the risks lay, and what the risks involved, is still debated today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threats to wildlife are legion. Fish eggs in water and turtle eggs on land can be fouled by oil. Growing fish mutate, otters and whales swimming through oil can get sick or suffocate from the fumes or oil coating their breathing passages. Petroleum fouls feathers, and small sea creatures can ingest chemicals and die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How that affects the environment is still being studied. Do tiny sea creatures eat the tiny droplets of oil, creating a food chain timebomb in the way that mercury levels concentrate in bigger fish? Researchers say they don't know or disagree. The Southern Shrimp Alliance in the Gulf Coast fears just such long term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts converging on Alaska had seen hundreds of spills. Two decades later, they agree on one thing with regard to Exxon Valdez: the first three days were lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al Maki, Exxon's chief scientist at the time, flew in early and knew what to do: break up the oil with chemical dispersants. The chemicals, which are being used widely in the current Gulf spill crisis, break oil into fine droplets so that it can be absorbed into the water and degrade naturally. Warm water and wave action speed the mixing and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we had a chance to use dispersants earlier in the game, it would have reduced the landing impact substantially," said Maki. Exxon, which was in charge of the cleanup, wasn't allowed to use dispersants for three critical, calm days, after the early Friday crash, he said. "The storm that came through on Sunday night moved the oil way out beyond our reaches and the use of dispersants was canceled," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelso remembers the early days differently, though his conclusion is the same. "The window of opportunity to move as much oil out of the water as possible was squandered," he said. Exxon, which had relied on an unreliable contractor to prepare for the spill, was scrambling in the first few days. Dispersants weren't at hand, and a trial of them was a flop in the cold, still water, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflicts over dispersants were one of the first between the main players in the cleanup -- state authorities like Kelso, Exxon leaders like Maki, and the federal government, including John Robinson, the chief scientist at the spill for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson remembers two years of animosity and contention, a management problem that contributed to the oil spill issue -- and which was dealt with directly by legislation the following year that gave the federal government clear authority to step in and take charge of a spill response, as it has done on the Gulf Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state was so unhappy, "it was difficult for them to agree to almost anything in terms of the approach to cleanup," Robinson, now retired, said by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PANIC AT EXXON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The storm which swept through three days after the crash totally changed the game, making it a desperate attempt to keep oil away from sensitive areas and muster resources. A state report compared the work to "guerrilla warfare."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An obvious solution to too much oil is to send it up in flames. "People think you just light a match," said Stan Jones, spokesman for the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council, a commission that monitors tanker and marine safety operations in Prince William Sound and was established by Congress in response to the Exxon Valdez. "Burning's just not that easy," he said. Some 15,000 gallons burned in about 75 minutes in one attempt the day after the spill. But others proved futile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little seemed to be happening the day after the spill, and Exxon panicked at the lack of clear action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kick ass and get stuff out there. I don't care what it is. I don't care if it picks up two gallons (of oil) a week. Get that shit out there and stand it around where people can see it," executive Don Cornett said, according to a transcript of an audio tape of Cornett gathered for a 1994 trial on the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frustrated fishermen took to the seas, marshaling what they called the "mosquito fleet" of skiffs and small boats loaded with buckets and hand-skimmers that launched off a state ferry press-ganged into service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no incident command system, the standard hierarchy that is used for responses to natural disasters and is now automatically activated to respond to oil spills. "Early in the oil spill, no one was in charge and everyone was in charge," said R.J. Kopchak, a longtime Cordova commercial fisherman and development director for the Prince William Sound Science Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was sort of a spontaneous, grass-roots response where people saw that the oil-company response wasn't working," said Rick Steiner, a marine scientist and former Cordova fishermen who was part of the effort. "Some boats got booms. Some just got buckets." A salmon fishery was saved and a good 100,000 gallons of oil picked up in the home-made effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon coordinated with the group, and Kelso says it shamed the oil giant into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil kept spreading. In four days it was 37 miles from the spill site. In two weeks it was 150 miles. By day 56, a sheen of crude stretched 470 miles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two months in, guerrilla warfare had turned into a corporate campaign. Exxon had mobilized in full. Some 11,000 workers were washing rocks, first with rags and then with power hoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main plan was to float the oil off the beaches. Since oil floats, flooded beaches would shed the oil, which could be caught at the waterline. The main problem was that by this time the oil was tar, stuck to rock, and wasn't going to move that easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This stuff became much more difficult to deal with plastered on the rocks than it was the first few days. and that is what led us to deal with it with the hot water," NOAA's Robinson remembers, describing the decision to rely heavily on high pressure hot water to wash the rocky beaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cleanup in Alaska didn't get started for a couple of months, started in a serious way," he said. "We eventually had to have about 10,000 people and several ships and support facilities and all the wherewithal to make hot water and deliver it to the coast. And that was a couple of months before that arrived, at least," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was more than a big effort though. It was a big mistake, Robinson said. "The aggressiveness of the cleanup in the end contributed to more damage than the oil did," he believes. Nine strips of beach were left untouched as an experiment, and those nine beaches look better today than the swept ones, where whatever was alive was cooked to death in superhot water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maki, the Exxon scientist, disagrees. Beach denizens -- mussels, clams, worms -- indeed were killed off by the washes, but birds could nest, seals could raise pups on the cleared beaches, sea otters' chances of survival rose. "When you look at the hot water or warm water wash from a net environmental standpoint for all the species, it was a benefit," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon also put fertilizer on beaches far and wide, calculating that naturally existing microbes that eat naturally seeping hydrocarbons would multiply with the fertilizer and munch up the oil, which many said was indeed the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEAST OF EVILS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maki is in the Gulf today, so far as an observer and potentially as a consultant. The differences are stark, he believes. Dispersants are breaking up the oil far from land, weather has been good, keeping the oil at sea up to now, and the land oil may come to is a different world -- marshes and stretches of white, packed sand that lets oil rest on the surface, not rocks that oil slips down between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not to say a white sand beach is easy to clean. The key to such an effort is to wait until all the oil has arrived, skim it and a little sand off with a shovel, and be done. But oil moves with tides, so the perfect time to clean is a moving target. Volunteers can easily dig too deep, or not deep enough. Heavy equipment works faster but can damage the beach. And so a simple one-two exercise can become a seemingly endless process that is repeated until there is no beach left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 20 years after Valdez, there is hardly any difference in the tools available for cleanup, and very little research has been done to solve the question that divides Robinson and Maki -- what is the least of the evils?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers are mostly in studies that Environmental Scientist Nancy Kinner of University of New Hampshire calls 'gray literature' -- funded by either the oil industry or environmental groups, and thus suspect. Take the case of dispersants. There is broad agreement that they can be used in the warm waters of the Gulf, she said, but Alaska?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know and I'm pretty sure from looking at the literature that other people don't know either. They may they claim they do but again it's a matter of the quality of these studies," said Kinner, who is co-director the Coastal Response Research Center, a joint effort between the university and NOAA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for a great new generation of inquiry, studies that would answer, for instance, whether dispersed droplets of oil disappeared or collected in tummies of microbes eaten by shrimp, never happened. Congress authorized studies in the 1990 law which followed on the Exxon Valdez disaster, but it never approved the funds to carry out them out, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil still lingers on some Alaska beaches, in surprisingly fresh condition. NOAA estimates that about 21,000 gallons of oil are buried in beaches. "There's more oil out there, in larger quantities and in a more toxic state, than we thought there would be," said Craig Tillery, Deputy Attorney General of Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon spent billions on the cleanup, which Erich Gundlach, an engineer who consulted on the Valdez spill, still marvels at. "The line was -- we didn't tell Exxon but -- thank God it was Exxon. The state couldn't do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude from Alaska's north still comes down the pipeline, and Royal Dutch Shell is on the cusp of drilling exploratory wells in pristine, remote territory of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, a small beach at the end of a narrow cove on Prince William Sound's Eleanor Island, a site hit heavily by Exxon oil in 1989, presents an iconic Alaska scene of natural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a recent visit, a bald eagle flew overhead. The air was scented with kelp, clinging to beach cobbles, and fresh water rushed from a stream in the spruce forest down into the sound. Snowy peaks glitter nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Janka has been searching beaches like this for oil since the cleanup was declared officially complete in 1992. His oldest daughter, who was 3 years old at the time of the spill, wound up riding along while Janka took scientists and others around the sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He remembers her playing with a toy rod and toy fish. "She'd bring it up onto the boat and say, 'Oh, it's dead, it got oil on it,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two decades of his samples rest in jars on display at the Prince William Sound Science Center, headquartered in a cozy building at the end of a pier in Cordova Harbor, where the local fishing fleet is based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the recent visit, Janka plunged a shovel into the beach surface. Globs of dark brown oil surrounded by reflective sheen emerged, emitting a headache-inducing odor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Looks like oil. Smells like oil," said Janka. "Right from the start of the spill, you didn't want to see it, and then to be here 21 years later and still be seeing it...." He paused. "It gets old. It really does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jim Impoco and Claudia Parsons)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today said it would patch two critical vulnerabilities with two updates to Windows and Office next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's the predictable off month for Microsoft," said Andrew Storms, the director of security operations with nCircle Security. "That's all within the predictable pattern they've created."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms was referring to Microsoft's habit of alternating large- and small-sized updates. In April, the company issued 11 security updates that fixed a total of 25 flaws , including nine tagged as "critical," the highest threat ranking in its four-step scoring system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its monthly advance notification , Microsoft spelled out next week's single-digit Patch Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-patch Windows update is labeled critical for Windows 2000, XP, Vista, Server 2003 and Server 2008, and as "important" for Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2. According to Microsoft, the newest operating systems -- Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 -- will be patched even though they're not vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 customers will be offered the Windows-related update but they are not vulnerable in their default configurations," said Jerry Bryant, a security program manager, in an entry on the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did the same last month when it patched the VBScript scripting engine in Windows; although Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 were not vulnerable, Microsoft updated the code just in case. The company slaps a "defense-in-depth" label on such fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What they're saying is the vulnerable code exists in Windows 7 and 2008 R2," said Storms, "but that they also don't know what people might figure out in the future as a way to exploit it. The bug exists, but they're making the distinction that at the moment no one can think of a way to use it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could change down the road, Storms said, pointing out Microsoft's DEP (data execution prevention) and ASLR (address space layout randomization) defenses as examples. "They were viewed as a giant leap forward [when they were introduced], but that leap is starting to erode, and fast," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on ways to bypass DEP and ASLR has stepped up of late. In March, two researchers sidestepped both defenses to win $10,000 each at the high-profile Pwn2Own hacking contest . Microsoft quickly stood up for the features, saying that although DEP and ASLR weren't "designed to prevent every attack forever," they remained effective in raising the attack bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's second update will patch Office XP, Office 2003 and Office 2007, as well as the Visual Basic for Applications and Visual Basic for Applications SDK (software developers kit) tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm betting that the vulnerability will be in the Office 2007 converter tool," said Storms, talking about the file conversion utility Microsoft offers that lets users open documents in the newer Office 2007 formats in older editions of the suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will not issue fixes next week for flaws it has publicly acknowledged in both SharePoint 2007 and Internet Explorer. "We will not be releasing an update for [our recent Security Advisory for SharePoint] with the May bulletins," confirmed Microsoft's Bryant. "Our teams are still working on an update for that issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SharePoint zero-day bug, which was disclosed last week by a Swiss security consultancy, could be used by attackers to steal confidential information from companies' SharePoint servers. Microsoft has recommended that administrators apply a workaround in lieu of a patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unpatched vulnerability in IE was confirmed by Microsoft in early February after a researcher with Core Security Technologies showed how the bug could be exploited to remotely read files on a PC's local drive. The vulnerability affects all versions of the company's browser, including IE8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a low-risk bug," argued Storms, when asked why Microsoft had not yet patched it. "It's kind of an odd situation, and probably doesn't represent a big risk at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release the two updates at approximately 1 p.m. ET on May 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is said to be in
the market to buy a cargo of liquefied natural gas for delivery
in June, sources said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Trade sources said Goldman was looking to buy two cargoes

&lt;p&gt;Three Iconic Seattle Organizations Have Teamed up to Recognize Swedish Medical
Center-Born Babies at Three Local Nordstrom Stores via a Custom Microsoft
Surface Experience Application Developed by POP 
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
Swedish, one of the region`s largest and most comprehensive non-profit
health-care providers, today announced that Microsoft Corp. and Nordstrom have
joined them in celebration of Swedish`s 100th anniversary this year. All three
Seattle brands have teamed up to expand the `I`m a Swedish Baby` Photo Contest
in an effort to recognize some of the many babies born in Swedish`s health-care
system over the past 100 years. 

"Swedish delivers more babies than any other hospital in the state," said
Melissa Tizon, Swedish`s communications director. "People in the community often
tell us how proud they are to have been born at Swedish, so we wanted to
celebrate all of our Swedish babies as part of our 100th anniversary. We are
very excited to work with Microsoft to create an interactive photo album using
the latest multi-touch computing platform. And given the historical ties, it`s a
natural connection to put these Surface tables on display in the Kids` Shoes
departments at local Nordstrom stores." 

This week, Microsoft Surface units were installed in three Nordstrom locations
including Downtown Seattle on May 3, Bellevue Square on May 4 and Alderwood Mall
in Lynnwood on May 5. They will be on display throughout the month. Microsoft
Surface will provide an interface for Nordstrom shoppers to learn more about the
`I`m a Swedish Baby` Photo Contest, browse submitted photos, search for Swedish
babies and read their personal stories. Using stamps, children will also be able
to create virtual art work of stars, dogs and hearts on Surface as a fun
activity while shopping. POP, a Seattle-based digital agency, developed the
interactive Surface application for Swedish. 

Microsoft Surface is an innovative computing platform that responds to touch,
natural hand gestures and real-world objects placed on the display, providing
effortless interaction with information and digital content in a simple and
intuitive way. With a large, 360-degree, horizontal user interface, Surface
offers a unique gathering place where multiple users can collaboratively and
simultaneously interact with content and each other. In addition, Surface
provides businesses with unique value in delivering information and services in
a more friendly way allowing better engagement with their customers. 

"Microsoft Surface provides an ideal forum for showcasing Swedish contest
entries with its multi-user, multi-touch capabilities and massive touch screen,"
said Panos Panay, general manager of Microsoft Surface. "The custom application
from POP enables regular content updates and takes advantage of the
collaborative, intuitive and social nature of Surface ensuring Nordstrom
shoppers stay apprised of what`s happening with the photo contest and have some
fun at the same time." 

Swedish and Nordstrom have a longstanding connection since the medical center
opened its doors in 1910. Katharine J. `Kitty` Nordstrom was the daughter of Dr.
Nils Johanson - the surgeon and Swedish immigrant who founded Swedish. Kitty
Nordstrom was married to Elmer Nordstrom, former co-chairman of Nordstrom and
son of John W. Nordstrom, founder of the store. 

Third-generation family member and former co-chairman, John N. Nordstrom, the
son of Elmer Nordstrom, is also a member of the medical center`s Board of
Trustees. 

"With our local roots in the community and our historic connection with Swedish,
partnering to celebrate all the babies born at the hospital since its inception
was a natural fit for us," said Kendall Ault, spokesperson for Nordstrom. 

How to Enter the `I`m a Swedish Baby` Photo Contest

Entries for the baby photo contest will be accepted online through June 1, 2010
in six categories including craziest hair, biggest sports fan, trick-or-treat,
my first birthday, most adorable and I love my pet. 

Each contest category will have a grand-prize, second-prize and third-prize
winner. Grand-prize winners will receive a two-night stay for four people to
Great Wolf Lodge and a $300 gift card to spend at the lodge during their stay
(approximate retail value of prize is $1,000). Second-place prize winners will
receive a $500 Nordstrom gift card and third-place winners will receive a $250
Amazon.com gift card. Winners will be notified on or about June 21, 2010.

design and create the commemorative site.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Goldman Sachs prepares for its annual shareholder meeting on Friday, it has more to worry about than anti-corporate gadflies like Evelyn Y Davis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Davis, a frequent critic of corporate America's pay and business practices, is expected to be on hand. But her concerns could be drowned out by other small shareholders likely to question Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) executives about fraud charges, a criminal investigation and other shareholder challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm sure there will be some protesters outside and all of that good stuff," said Walter Todd, a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital, which owns Goldman debt. "I'm sure it'll be good theater. But as far as inside the meeting, I would image there will be some folks asking tough questions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the scrutiny that Goldman faces, this year is not like the others -- apart from the likelihood major shareholders are likely to sit out the annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Goldman executives are more likely to be dodging headlines then any corporate reform efforts with teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are looking for headlines coming out of this thing," Todd said. "It doesn't matter if it is a mom and pop who owns five shares going in and raising a stink, or if it is Calpers -- the headline is still going to be what it is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has faced a headline assault of late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman of failing to tell investors the securities underlying a so-called synthetic collateralized debt obligation were chosen by a short-seller, John Paulson, whose fund was betting the CDO would lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also drew the attention of a Senate and is facing a Justice Department criminal investigation, according to sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein has been engaging in a public relations offensive since he was questioned last week by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about the firm's role in the subprime mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein's fate is not on the agenda of Friday's meeting, but some are speculating he will not survive the scrutiny facing the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You almost need a guy to hang. Blankfein is probably going to get hung," said one investor, who did not want to be named because he did not want to jeopardize business relationships. "Everybody is feeling this. I don't know if the people inside are upset with Lloyd, but outside, he is not a sympathetic figure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to questions about whether Blankfein is fit to lead the firm, Goldman executives are likely to face questions about the merits of the SEC's lawsuit and the associated risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd like to know what they think the true probabilities are of being found guilty in the ABACUS deal," said Michael Vogelzang, president of investment firm Boston Advisors, which owns a small stake in Goldman. "I'd like to ask them: 'Did they really think they weren't doing anything wrong? Would you have bought the paper personally?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most shareholders, Vogelzang is not planning to attend the meeting, which will be held in Downtown Manhattan at a building near Goldman's new headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders in attendance will be able to vote on proposals relating to compensation issues, political contributions and even an item by The Maryknoll Sisters of St. Dominic relating to the use of collateral in derivatives trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will also consider a proposal urging the company to separate the role of chairman and CEO. Goldman's board, however, has recommended a vote against that proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

BMC Eyes Cloud Computing Space

Following the trend of the IT majors, another leading software company BMC
Software Inc. (NYSE: BMC) is taking aggressive measures to cash in on
opportunities available in the cloud computing space. 

The company recently rolled out two new IT service management solutions, BMC
Remedy OnDemand and BMC ServiceDesk, on Force.com. These products are based on
the cloud computing platform and are expected to provide cost effective
solutions to the customer. The new solutions offer "IT Service Management" by
BMC and are capable of resolving critical IT problems quickly, without incurring
additional cost on hardware, software or additional manpower. 

This apart, as per another study conducted by technology research firm IDC in
its 2009 cloud computing conference, the IT cloud services segment is expected
to grow three times its current size, to a $42.0 billion industry by 2012. The
firm also believes that cloud computing will grow throughout this period, taking
care of around 25.0% of IT spending growth in 2012 and one third of it the next
year. 

Cloud computing enjoys strong demand and is being increasingly adopted by
businesses. However, managing the way it is used will be very important. Another
study conducted by Market Research Media predicts that the U.S. government's
spending on cloud computing is entering a phase of explosive growth. The segment
is expected to grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 40.0% from 2010
to 2015, crossing $7.0 billion in 2015. 

Apart from cloud computing, acquisition has been another growth driver for BMC.
This strategy has helped the company expand the product portfolio, leading to
more comprehensive solutions. Growth prospects in the SaaS segment, position in
the government vertical and strong cash generation abilities are other
positives. However, we are a bit apprehensive about the intense competition from
big players like International Business Machine (NYSE: IBM), Hewlett-Packard
Company (NYSE: HPQ), EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC) and CA Inc. (NYSE: CA), which
bundle hardware and software offerings.

&lt;p&gt;  MONTEREY, CA, May 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA) today presented its
2010 Excellence in Water Leadership Award to Walter J. Bishop, general
manager of Contra Costa Water District. 

    Bishop, who steps down from his post this month after 17 years, was
recognized for his significant contributions to California water,
including overseeing design and construction of Los Vaqueros Reservoir,
participating in key negotiations on Delta policies and founding a center
for water and wastewater that has educated dozens of California water
leaders.

    "This award is ACWA's way of recognizing leadership and contributions
that make a lasting difference in California water," ACWA President Paul
Kelley said. "Wally Bishop truly embodies the spirit of building a world
of difference. Over the course of his 35-year career in California water,
he has built coalitions, advanced solutions in the Delta, trained new
leaders in water management, and fought tirelessly for statewide water
solutions.

    "Wally's contributions to California water will be remembered for years
to come, and we are pleased to present this award to such a deserving
recipient," Kelley said.

    The Excellence in Water Leadership Award -- Building a World of
Difference(R) recognizes groups or individuals that have made a
remarkable and visible contribution to California water. The award,
sponsored by Black &amp; Veatch Corporation, was presented at the ACWA 2010
Spring Conference &amp; Exhibition, which continues through Friday at the

responsible for about 90% of the water delivered in California. For more

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, May 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Simba Technologies Inc., industry's choice for standards-based relational
and multi-dimensional data connectivity, announced today that Oracle's
Technology Network has released an Oracle By Example (OBE) tutorial
covering how to use Microsoft Excel 2007 with Oracle 11g OLAP data for
easy and powerful ad hoc query, analysis and reporting. The direct Excel
to Oracle connectivity is made possible by Simba's MDX Provider for
Oracle OLAP data connectivity product.

    Tutorial Overview

    Simba's MDX Provider for Oracle OLAP allows users to use the powerful and
popular ad hoc query and analysis capabilities of Microsoft Excel
PivotTables and PivotCharts with their Oracle OLAP business intelligence
data. PivotTables provide cross-tab functionality to comprehensively
present data in order to answer complex analytical questions. PivotCharts
provide visual insight and reporting in a powerful, dashboard-like manner.

    Simba's MDX Provider for Oracle OLAP is a client-side driver that
leverages Excel's strengths for ad hoc query and analysis, as well as new
Excel 2007 functionality based upon the latest advances in the
multi-dimensional (MDX) query language data standard.

    Simba's MDX Provider for Oracle OLAP natively connects Microsoft Excel
with Oracle 11g OLAP Option. It works seamlessly to parse and process
multi-dimensional queries from Excel and integrate with Oracle OLAP via
SQL/ODBC.

    Tutorial Scenario

    Using the Oracle11g OLAP sample data schema, participants will create an
Excel 2007 report to analyze year-end Sales for calendar year 2009, with
the objective of finding product dimension members that are
underperforming, as compared to the prior year.

    To achieve this objective, participants will:


--  View stored, calculated and custom OLAP measures broken out by the
appropriate dimension members,
--  Use hierarchical navigation to drill through the data,
--  Apply basic report formatting options to enhance the clarity of the
report, and
--  Apply visualization tools to the data using conditional formatting to
reveal important information that otherwise may not be readily obvious.


    Participants will further analyze the data using interactive ad hoc
query techniques to discover trends in the data from a regional
perspective. Finally, participants will create a simple business
intelligence dashboard by adding a chart to the report.

&lt;p&gt;NORCROSS, Ga. &amp; LYNCHBURG, Va.--(Business Wire)--
I.B.I.S., Inc., Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, and Delta Star, Inc. announce
the selection of Microsoft Dynamics AX for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
functions at Delta Star. Delta Star is a top tier, multi-site manufacturer of
medium powered transformers and substations; and has been in business for over
100 years, providing customers quality products and service. 

Delta Star carefully evaluated three enterprise business solutions - Microsoft
Dynamics AX, SAP and Epicor. Their goal was to:

* Choose the best solution as an engineer to order (ETO) equipment manufacturer 
* Select a solution that will support them for many, many years to come 
* Drive best practices and improved performance across their multi-site
operations 
* Support continued profitable growth through even tighter integration of their
East and West coast operations on a single, integrated ERP solution.

addresses the major challenges and will best meet the organization`s needs.
I.B.I.S. specializes in implementing large-scale installations, and will
implement the new solution. 

"We reviewed three impressive, leading mid-tier ERP solutions. Each company had
obvious key strengths, but Dynamics AX rose to the top in terms of scope,
flexibility and ease of use. The I.B.I.S. / Microsoft implementation approach
mixes well with Delta Star`s improvement methodology and pace. On both fronts,
software and partner, we are confident in our choice," stated Randall Robinson,
Director of Improvement Initiatives. 

"Delta Star recognized the Manufacturing strength of Microsoft Dynamics AX,
which is available to users in a familiar and easy to use format, from the world
leader in technology. They were also aware of I.B.I.S.` expertise in the
Manufacturing industry and realized we would be a key partner in the success of
the project. Delta Star is investing in its future by utilizing best practices
to set a foundation for continued profitable growth," stated Andy Vabulas, Chief
Executive Officer at I.B.I.S.

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
iTKO, the leading provider of virtualization and validation solutions for
enterprise cloud applications, today announced it is teaming with IBM (NYSE:
IBM) on a new service to help businesses more easily develop, test and deploy
applications either on-premise or in a cloud. The new service combines iTKO LISA
Virtualize, Test, Validate and Pathfinder application software with IBM Global
Business Services consulting to speed up application deployment, without tapping
into critical computing resources. 

IBM Application Virtualization Services&#8482; is available today for on-premise
deployment, and will be available later this year on an IBM Cloud. Using the new
service, clients can for the first time:

* Run applications in a virtual environment to reduce operational costs 
* Simulate a production environment to effectively test new applications without
creating new workloads on existing systems 
* Deploy multiple test environments for each development and test team to boost
productivity

"Clients today are looking for new ways to streamline their IT infrastructure,
reduce application costs, and drive more value out of their information assets,"
said IBM executive Steven Kagan, vice president, application management
services, IBM Global Business Services. "The combination of iTKO software and
IBM technologies and services can help our joint clients meet these business
goals." 

iTKO`s LISA product suite eliminates application development constraints using
virtual service environments, optimizes discovery and resolution of coding
defects, and improves test automation and validation for complex enterprise
applications. LISA virtualization and validation solutions also support cloud
application development to remove accessibility and capacity constraints in
elastic cloud development and test environments. 

A major utility company used LISA software to virtualize smart meter devices and
EDI Gateway interfaces, improving productivity by 87 percent and time-to-market
by 67 percent. 

"IBM Global Services is a market leader in helping enterprise IT organizations
deliver software faster and more efficiently," said Shridhar Mittal, CEO of
iTKO. "iTKO and IBM will take the joint offering to customers in the Financial
services, Telecommunication, Energy, Retail, and Travel industries leveraging
the IBM Cloud." 

iTKO is showcasing new solutions at IBM`s IMPACT 2010 conference, May 2-7, 2010
in Las Vegas. For more information on the IMPACT event, please visit

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft silently patched three vulnerabilities last month, two of them affecting enterprise mission-critical Exchange mail servers, without calling out the bugs in the accompanying advisories, a security expert said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the three unannounced vulnerabilities, and the most serious of the trio, were packaged with MS10-024 , an update to Exchange and Windows SMTP Service that Microsoft issued April 13 and tagged as "important," its second-highest threat ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ivan Arce, the chief technology officer of Core Security Technologies, Microsoft patched the bugs, but failed to disclose that it had done so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're more important than the [two vulnerabilities] that Microsoft did disclose," said Arce. "That means [system] administrators may end up making the wrong decisions about applying the update. They need that information to assess the risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core Labs researcher Nicolas Economou discovered the two unspoken bugs while digging into the update, part of his jobs as an exploit writer for Core, which is best known for its Core Impact penetration testing framework, a system for probing computers and networks for potential vulnerabilities by attacking them with real-world exploits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An attacker may leverage the two previously undisclosed vulnerabilities fixed by MS10-024 to spoof responses to any DNS query sent by the Windows SMTP service trivially," said Core in its own advisory on Economou's discovery. "DNS response spoofing and cache poisoning attacks are well known to have a variety of security implications with impact beyond just Denial of Service and Information Disclosure as originally stated in MS10-024."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNS cache poisoning is a long-standing attack tactic -- it goes back nearly two decades -- but is probably best known for the critical vulnerability in the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) software found by Dan Kaminsky in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secret patches are neither new or rare. "This has been going on for many years and the action in and of itself is not a huge conspiracy," said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is unusual is that Core took Microsoft's silent updates public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying that Microsoft "misrepresented" and "underestimated" the criticality of MS10-024 because it didn't reveal the two bugs, Core urged company administrators to "consider re-assessing patch deployment priorities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core found a third unstated April 13 fix in another update, MS10-028 . That patch addressed two identified bugs in Microsoft Visio, the company's project diagramming software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acknowledged it had fixed flaws without telling customers, but defended the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When a security vulnerability is discovered, Microsoft conducts a thorough investigation of that vulnerability, addresses any other issues found in the code as a result of that investigation and subjects the security updates to extensive testing for quality assurance," said Jerry Bryant, a security program manager, in an e-mail. "This helps reduce the number of updates customers have to deploy, since updating can be disruptive to customer environments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an internally-discovered flaw requires separate action or guidance not already covered by other vulnerabilities in the bulletin, "we would definitely document and address that vulnerability separately," Bryant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that it's business as usual for not just Microsoft, but for most software makers, said Storms. "Vendors commonly find bugs themselves in released code and will distribute the fixes inside a bundle of other patches," he noted. "Many times there simply is no benefit to anyone to disclose the bug."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Microsoft's policy is to not assign CVEs -- the bug identifiers logged into the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database -- to flaws found by its own researchers, said Storms. "There is no requirement for a vendor to request a CVE for internal bugs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Storms also echoed Arce's concern about possible misuse of the practice, which could result in a false sense of security among users. "What's in question here is if the vendor misrepresents the risk and thus creates a false sense of lethargy with respect to the priority of patch distribution," he said. "For example, if an IE8 patch rated 'moderate' by Microsoft actually also contained a critical internally-found bug, would the lower rating put customers at risk because they may feel they could delay patch distribution, all along having no idea there was a hidden critical patch?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arce argued that that was exactly what Microsoft did in the case of MS10-024. "They fixed a very similar vulnerability in MS08-037 two years ago," he said, talking about the critical 2008 patch to plug the DNS vulnerabilities Kaminsky discovered . "If it wasn't a vulnerability then, why did they issue a vulnerability bulletin?" asked Arce. "There's no reasonable way for them to say this isn't a security problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no easy answer for the vendor or customer," Storms said. "If the vendor distributed a critical patch, but with little information, like Adobe for example, we would all be hammering on the vendor for more information. On the other hand, given the workload on enterprise security teams we need to trust the vendor's rating to help determine priority."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core's advisories on the silent patching of MS10-024 and MS10-028 are available on its Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

    Lawmakers may re-write telecom rules in long-term, AT fears

executives from General Electric being dragged before congress about the
role they played in the financial crisis, we feel they need to be watched
closely for panic. With Apple possibly losing it's cool
Microsoft could end up being the beneficiary. Though Apples sales haven't
suffered, their image seems to be cooling down. Wipro and Oracle

&lt;p&gt;New Improvements to SocialPoint, Which Connects Socialtext's Enterprise Social
Software Platform to Microsoft SharePoint 
PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Socialtext announced today a major upgrade to SocialPoint, its connector that
enables customers to integrate its enterprise social software platform with
Microsoft SharePoint. This new release of SocialPoint helps customers take
advantage of the real-time messaging and people profiles of Socialtext when they
are working in SharePoint. 

The SocialPoint upgrade, which will work in both SharePoint 2010 and 2007,
includes:

* Enterprise microblogging in SharePoint -- Socialtext customers count on
Socialtext Signals, a secure enterprise microblogging application, as a way to
keep colleagues and teams highly synchronized by sharing short messages about
projects and strategy. Now, people can post and view Socialtext Signals from
right inside SharePoint.

* Search the people directory from within SharePoint -- Customers use Socialtext
People as their social directory, with rich profiles that show a person's photo,
skills, and latest activities, in addition to contact information. Now, people
can search their Socialtext People directory from right inside SharePoint.

Socialtext was the first enterprise social software company to integrate its
platform with SharePoint, with the release of SocialPoint in 2006, which enables
customers to use Socialtext online workspaces (wikis) from the SharePoint
interface. 

"This SocialPoint upgrade was a direct response to our enterprise customers who
rely on Socialtext to connect their people and drive new business opportunities,
but also depend on SharePoint for existing workflows and document management
processes," says Eugene Lee, Socialtext's CEO. "We want to make sure it's easy
for people to get the most from both platforms to maximize their productivity
and serve their customers better." 

About Socialtext

Socialtext addresses the critical issues organizations face as their people and
teams struggle for better ways to share knowledge, ideas and expertise. With
Socialtext's enterprise social software platform, people and teams are
synchronized, highly engaged and able to move fast. The Socialtext collaboration
platform employs a broad set of social software technologies including
microblogging, social networking, filtered activity streams, widget-based
dashboards, blogs and wikis. Socialtext offers both the convenience of SaaS and
the security of an on-site appliance, for the fastest time to value. More than
6,500 businesses world-wide have accelerated their business performance with
Socialtext, including Mayo Clinic, McGraw-Hill, Oxford University Press,
Meredith Corporation, OSIsoft, Symantec, The Washington Post, and Epitaph
Records. Learn more about Socialtext at www.socialtext.com.

Corporate Profile's newest financial website, www.CPreports.com announces
an update. Goldman Small Cap Research, a stock market research firm
focused on the small cap and micro cap sectors, has issued a research
update on Implant Sciences Corporation, (OTCBB: IMSC), a provider of
explosive trace detection Systems in use by law enforcement and public
safety agencies around the world. See update at www.CPreports.com or
http://www.cpreports.com/?p=224 

    In the Goldman Opportunity Research updated report on the Company,
analyst Rob Goldman notes that the recent spate of news is additional
validation of example of Company's overall positioning. 

    According to Goldman Small Cap Research analyst Rob Goldman, "IMSC's
senior secured investor has agreed to restructure IMSC's debt agreement
in IMSC's favor. Plus, the launch of an air cargo screening at Logan
International Airport, facilitated with the Port Authority of
Massachusetts, augers well for Quantum Sniffer air cargo screening
approval by TSA. In addition, it could lead to unit orders from Massport
and other ports around the U.S. since TSA approval is not required for
these orders."

    "The failed car bomb attempt in New York's Times Square by a foreign
terrorist is yet another event that only raises the company's profile,
and with it the likelihood of future procurement and implementation."

&lt;p&gt;ALISO VIEJO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Quest Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: QSFT) today announced that Brent Ozar, one of its
SQL Server experts, has achieved SQL Server 2008 Master status. Ozar is only the
fifth person in the United States outside of Microsoft to achieve this highest
level of certification. With this insight into Microsoft and SQL Server
development that only a select few outside Redmond have, Ozar provides Quest
customers with technically advanced solutions to their issues while providing
content for a wider audience on SQLServerPedia, the company`s SQL Server online
community at www.sqlserverpedia.com, and other customer forums. 

"The SQL MCM program was founded in 2006, and, as of today, only 71 individuals
hold the SQL MCM certification in the world," said Joe Sack, Microsoft MCM
program manager. "Brent`s achievement of the SQL Server 2008 Microsoft Certified
Master certification is remarkable for two reasons. First, the United States SQL
MCM 2008 community has only 5 individuals working outside of Microsoft. Second,
even very talented candidates don`t always achieve certification on the first
attempt. Brent is part of a very small group of individuals who was able to pass
three written exams and a six-hour hands-on qualification lab all on the first
try." 

"Brent was an active member of the training rotation, and will now be an
integral participant and leader in our SQL MCM community," Sack continued. "The
fact that Brent also works for Quest Software, a valued Microsoft Global ISV
Partner, lends an additional opportunity for Brent and the MCM community to help
customers get the most out of their SQL Server investments." 

The SQL Microsoft Master program represents the highest level of technical
training and certification that Microsoft offers. The certification is designed
to recognize, develop and validate an individual`s ability to implement, design
and troubleshoot solutions built with SQL Server. During the SQL MCM training,
candidates are expected to demonstrate an ability to use their skills, knowledge
and experience to successfully address the most complex customer requirements. 

"The best part of earning the MCM is pushing myself further with the latest
techniques from the best instructors, giving me another level of expertise to
work with customers and help advance the SQL Server community," Ozar said. "For
me, SQL Server is a passion, and sharing the deeper insight with our customers
is something I`m proud to be able to do." 

Quest Software`s award-winning products are developed by some of the industry`s
top experts, recognized by their industry peers and the IT community. Quest`s
products embody decades of its experts` collective experience, and they also
share what they know via a wide variety of blogs, podcasts, books, and articles.


"The MCM brings additional credibility to the advice and direction Brent gives
in that he`s been taught and certified by the best and brightest, right at
Microsoft," said Jeremiah Peschka, senior DBA, Cass Information Systems.
"Further, on those occasions where we need even deeper information, the MCM
designation means Brent knows where to get it and, more importantly, has the
connections at Microsoft to actually get it. That`s a huge benefit when we`re
working on time-sensitive and mission-critical projects."

&lt;p&gt;ROCHESTER, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Employees at the Procter &amp; Gamble Company (P) will soon be able to print
emails, presentations and other business documents directly from their
Smartphones. At the company`s Goldmine event today, P unveiled Xerox
Corporation`s (NYSE: XRX) new mobile print solution to its leadership team as
part of its Enterprise Print Services (EPS) strategy, further strengthening its
commitment to keeping the workforce mobile, sustainable and productive. 

"We have more than 20,000 employees using mobile devices, so taking the hassle
out of working on the road is also going to boost employee satisfaction and
efficiency," said Filippo Passerini, president, Global Business Services and
chief information officer, P "Xerox`s mobile print capability keeps printing
easy and secure - maintaining our agile global workforce and protecting P`s
brand and intellectual property at the same time." 

Through EPS, P simplified and digitized its global printing infrastructure by
consolidating devices and controlling how and when documents are printed. The
mobile print solution builds on the EPS platform, allowing employees to print
without downloading software, mapping to a printer or booting up their laptops. 

Using any Smartphone device, employees will simply send documents to a secure
server or "cloud." Documents are held in the cloud until the employee walks up
to any printer in the network and enters a code to release the prints. The
mobile print solution is the first result of the Xerox and P Innovation
Council, created to explore future work and technology trends, and design
solutions that will benefit the P business. Mobile print supports P`s "Give
Back 500 Million Minutes" program by reducing time employees spend on print and
out-put related issues. 

"The mobile print capability is an example of how Xerox is extending the value
of managed print services for our clients and empowering them with innovative
services that benefit their core business," said Stephen Cronin, president,
Xerox Global Services. "Our comprehensive approach delivers the future of
printing - cost-effective, productive, environmentally sustainable and mobile." 

Developed closely with customers like P, mobile print is the newest addition
to Xerox EPS, the only platform to address an organization`s entire print
infrastructure - from the networked office to the in-house print center to the
virtual worker. Xerox was positioned by Gartner, Inc., in the Leaders Quadrant
in the "Magic Quadrant for Managed Print Services Worldwide"1 for 2009 and the
company was recognized as a leader in IDC`s 2010 MPS MarketScape report2.

&lt;p&gt;TROY, Mich.--(Business Wire)--
CJPS Enterprises, LLC a global healthcare consulting firm, known for its focus
on execution and quick results, announces its new offering to European medical
devicecompanies to leverage its network and experience to grow their business in
North America.

After spending 30 years in the United States, with most of that time creating
and growing companies in the healthcare industry, Christophe Sevrain, born in
Paris, sees his successful consulting firm assist European companies in
developing their healthcare business in the United States of America. 

Unlike many other consulting firms, his firm does not develop and implement such
strategies and tactics with a consultative mindset, but rather with an
experienced, hands-on approach with a team that has the experience of creating
and running companies -- specifically, medical devices companies. 

So, why are they so successful at creating and growing such businesses? Mainly,
they are execution-oriented, have actually built companies, and have some of the
most powerful connections in the industry with a track record that demonstrates
it. 

Whether European companies are looking to enter the U.S. market for the first
time and are looking for assistance with regulatory compliance and distribution
channels, or whether such companies already have a business unit located in
North America, but need help in growing more rapidly, Mr. Sevrain`s firm can
help develop and execute breakthrough growth plans flawlessly, and goals become
realities, fast. 

"Time-to-revenues is more than money", Sevrain says. "It is market share and
market superiority, and the opportunity to set standards", he continues. 

Sevrain`s firm has been so successful helping U.S. companies grow in the medical
device industry in the US, that it is creating a new office in Paris to provide
even greater value to European companies that want to enter the lucrative U.S.
market.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft came under fire from some of its rivals on Wednesday for its decision not to offer Internet Explorer 9 -- and hence support for the upcoming HTML 5 standard -- to users of its older Windows XP operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said at its MIX developer conference in March that IE 9 won't be offered for XP. The reason, technical evangelist Giorgio Sardo said at the Web 2.0 Expo on Wednesday, is that IE 9 is a "modern browser," and getting the benefits of the hardware acceleration and other performance gains that it will offer requires a "modern OS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That didn't sit well with Alex Russell, a member of Google's Chrome browser development team. "Opera and Mozilla are also hardware-accelerating their browsers, and all of us are doing it on XP," said Russell, who joined Sardo and representatives from Mozilla, Opera and Yahoo for a panel discussion on the future of Web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You describe a world where users are getting left behind," Russell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I reckon this is a problem," agreed Doug Crockford, a senior JavaScript architect at Yahoo. "I recommend all users of XP migrate to another browser that's not IE."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At issue is the adoption of HTML 5, an upcoming revamp of the Web's markup language that will add significant new capabilities, including standard ways to implement video, animation, audio and offline storage, that are not included in the current HTML standard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important partly because it should help to reduce fragmentation on the Web, which forces developers to build and test applications for multiple browsers or use proprietary technologies such as Flash and Silverlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if IE 9, which will be Microsoft's first browser to fully support HTML 5, isn't available for XP, then those users will be outside of that HTML 5 compatibility sphere. And IE 6 still has more users than the Opera, Chrome and Safari browsers combined, according to Crockford. In some countries it accounts for as much as 40 percent of browser usage, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panelists were largely complementary of IE 6. When it appeared in 2001, Russell said, "IE 6 was fantastic. It set the pace for JavaScript, DOM, the component model, things we're still making use of today." One reason it is still hanging around, said Mozilla's Brendan Eich, is that many enterprises created macros and other extensions on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dion Almaer of Palm, who moderated the panel, said it has become "an anchor around our necks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Crockford sees it, the W3C "abandoned its role as the stewards of the Web" at the start of the decade, allowing incompatible technologies to flourish. There is now a fresh burst of standards activity around HTML 5. "Which is great," Crockford said, "but it's all irrelevant if we don't solve the IE 6 problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft believes HTML 5 is "the future," Sardo said. It has implemented parts of the standard -- which is not yet complete -- in IE 8, and will fully support it with IE 9. Microsoft released its second developer preview of IE 9 on Wednesday morning, he said, though he didn't say when the final product will ship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said Microsoft tries hard to keep people's browser software up to date. For example, it allows PCs to download browser updates even if the copy of Windows is unlicensed. This is especially important in China, where a lot of software in use is pirated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the main challenges at Microsoft is the complexity of adopting a new spec," Sardo said. HTML 5 is "a great spec and it will lead to a great future for developers, but it's still a work in progress." Ensuring the implementation is the same across all browsers involves "a lot of work to test and validate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eich said Mozilla has "got a lot of HTML 5 already implemented, even though it's a moving target."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crockford proposed a radical solution to get all the Web's users onto a current browser: On an agreed-upon day, all developers would deny access to their Web sites unless the visitor's browser is up to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On one day, all of us will say, you have to download one of these five or six browsers," he said. "I propose that day is 30 days after all the major browser vendors have implemented HTML 5. On that day, IE 6 dies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may not have been a very practical idea, but it earned him a round of applause from the developers watching the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - The Gulf of Mexico oil spill may already be bigger than the massive Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 and could have dumped as much as 13 million gallons (49 million liters) of crude into waters off the U.S. coastline, a Florida oceanographer said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian MacDonald, a biological oceanographer at Florida State University, said official estimates that 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons/795,000 liters) have poured into the Gulf each day since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded two weeks ago were much too conservative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real flow rate from the undersea well, based on aerial images of the oil slick and estimates of the thickness of the oil itself, is probably closer to 25,000 barrels (1,050,000 gallons) per day, MacDonald said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been looking at ... data and we see that the area of the Gulf which is covered by oil has been increasing rapidly, at a rate well in excess of a 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) a day," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see in excess of 10,000 (3,860 square miles) perhaps as much as 16,000 square kilometers (6,178 square miles) of oil-covered water, or water which has some indication that there's oil there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think that to get that much oil coverage we would to have to have flow rates well in excess of the 5,000 barrel per day rate and we're putting this out as a high-end estimate," MacDonald said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has been monitoring the oil spill, said no one was immediately available to comment on possible revisions of the oil spill's size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacDonald said the official estimate, used by NOAA, BP and the U.S. Coast Guard, had never been explained in detail and appeared to be little more than a guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Valdez tanker ship spilled about 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound, in one of the world's worst environmental disasters ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If his own estimate is accurate, MacDonald said BP's oil spill was already bigger than its 1989 rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our belief is that the overall amount of oil out there well exceeds the 5,000 barrel per day rate," MacDonald said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm providing a thorough documentation of the methods that we've used," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacDonald acknowledged that any estimate of the size of the spill, based on the surface area of the oil slick, could be flawed by a failure to correctly gauge the oil's average thickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said he had worked together with NASA, and used some estimates provided by BP itself, to calculate the flow rate from the offshore oil well, almost 1 mile below the Gulf of Mexico surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Pascal Fletcher and Xavier Briand)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - A British tax on bank executives' bonuses will cost two of the biggest U.S. banks a combined $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the largest American consumer bank, expects a $465 million compensation and benefits charge from the UK tax on its British bonus payments, the bank said in a first-quarter report filed with U.S. securities regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) expects to pay more than $600 million for the UK tax, according to accounts filed last week by its London arm, Goldman Sachs International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so-called UK banker bonus tax, announced in December, assesses a 50 percent charge on bonuses above 25,000 pounds ($40,250) paid between Dec 9, 2009, and April 5, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the tax was announced, estimates indicate top global banks may pay more than 2 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) in total for bonus payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK banks took charges for the tax in their 2009 accounts, but most European and U.S. banks will account for the tax in their 2010 accounts, as the tax was not fully enacted until this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other major U.S. banks, like JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), have yet to disclose specific figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.6816 pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joe Rauch; additional reporting by Steve Slater in London; editing by John Wallace.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc held its longest-ever annual investor meeting on Friday, but Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein faced few questions about civil fraud charges against the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, addressing a friendlier audience than the U.S. Senate panel before which he testified on April 27, told well-known shareholder gadfly Evelyn Davis that he was staying in his job after she asked him to resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other queries focused on more typical issues like compensation, global warming, and board appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein began the 3-hour meeting saying that Goldman would undertake a "rigorous self-examination" after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no bigger priority for our board of directors and management than to undertake a comprehensive review of all of our business practices," he told shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Goldman would create a business standards committee that would offer guidance to management regarding standards and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's meeting at a building in lower Manhattan near Goldman's new headquarters was longer than any other annual shareholder gathering since Goldman went public 11 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares, which have lost 22 percent since the SEC complaint was filed in mid-April, rose 0.47 percent to $142.99 on Friday. They were the top performer in the Amex Securities Broker/Dealer Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADDRESSING PUBLIC CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein mentioned the business standards committee during the Senate hearing. On Friday, he said it was a way for Goldman to address concerns about the company that have been expressed by regulators and the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC has accused the bank of failing to tell investors who bought risky debt tied to subprime mortgages that hedge fund manager John Paulson helped select the underlying portfolio for a mortgage-linked security and was shorting the deal. Goldman is also facing related shareholder lawsuits and, according to a source last week, a Justice Department criminal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Goldman has begun settlement discussions with the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past year, Goldman has been scrutinized for having accepted government bailout funds and rebounding from the financial crisis so quickly that it was able set aside more than $16 billion last year for bonuses, salaries and other compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Friday's meeting, former presidential candidate and activist Rev. Jesse Jackson addressed the disconnect between Goldman's out-sized profits and high unemployment and home foreclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who said late last year he was "doing God's work," told Jackson, "There is no future for Goldman, certainly no success for Goldman Sachs, unless the economy as a whole grows, and the economy grows in a way in which it doesn't create a wider divergence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there is a silver lining, it certainly affords us an opportunity to be introspective," Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that the negative attention on the company had put a "strain" on clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has engaged in a public relations campaign, including media interviews, and said he would do more to help the public understand what Goldman does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have very little contact with the consuming public or the retail investor," Blankfein told the shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STAYING PUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been speculation that Blankfein would resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Evelyn Davis kicked off a question and answer session by calling for Blankfein's voluntary resignation by Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have no current plan to step down on Monday," answered Blankfein, cracking a smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis persisted, later asking Blankfein, "If you won't resign by Monday, how about by the end of the month?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein retorted, "I have no intention of doing that right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry Korba, a shareholder from Yonkers, New York, was applauded for expressing support for Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders backed Goldman's nominations for directors and a proposal for an advisory vote on pay. They defeated a proposal by The Maryknoll Sisters of St. Dominic relating to the use of collateral in derivatives trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders also followed the lead of Goldman's board in defeating a proposal urging the company to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder; additional reporting and writing by Maria Aspan.

PHOENIX, Ariz.--(Business Wire)--
Former U.S. Astronaut Bernard Harris gave students and teachers in Phoenix a
first-hand experience with the wonders of science, technology, engineering and
mathematics when "The Dream Tour, presented by ExxonMobil" made its fourth stop
of 2010 on May 7 speaking to 700 students from Bethune, Dunbar, Edison, Faith
North, Lowell and University Public School in Phoenix Elementary School District
#1. 

The tour is designed to encourage today`s middle school students to realize
their potential and strive to acquire strong math and science skills. The
program included an interactive and inspirational program by Harris, a
demonstration on space and engaging dialogue about achieving goals. 

"It is critical that American students are prepared with the problem-solving
skills and tools to tackle challenges they may face in the future. Providing
them with a strong foundation in math and science education is imperative, and
with The Dream Tour, I hope to inspire students to pursue studies and careers in
these fields," said Dr. Harris. 

From humble beginnings in San Antonio to making history as the first African
American to walk in space, Dr. Harris is a living example of achieving high
aspirations. His story provides a powerful backdrop to bring his message to
students in cities across America. Since 2008, Dr. Harris has encouraged almost
35,000 middle school students in more than 20 cities nationwide. This year, The
Dream Tour will visit Anchorage, Baton Rouge, Billings, Cleveland, Denver,
Nashville, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco as Dr. Harris
continues to motivate and inspire students to pursue math and science. 

"ExxonMobil is focused on the need to attract more of America`s students to
higher level math and science courses in secondary school. The classes they
choose today can make or break their options for the future, and `The Dream
Tour, presented by ExxonMobil,` is one way to expose them to the possibilities,"
said Gerald McElvy, President, ExxonMobil Foundation.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/35d09b/financial_analysis) has
announced the addition of the "Financial Analysis - General Electric Company"
company profile to their offering. 

Business scenario in today's context - niche opportunities, limited time
periods, ever increasing risk and the need for precise decision making, which if
not done correctly would run the costs in million even before brakes are
exercised. That is the speed of business in today's high octane economies which
are constantly metamorphosing into global empires of influence. 

Even the best decision makers have made mistakes which have wiped out entire
reserves built over a period of hard work by the company's stakeholders
including the employees. The responsibility imposed on the shoulders of senior
management is immense and does not leave much room for mistakes to be absorbed
by the interest holders in the company. 

In this scenario, the management needs a good, strong and logic driven decision
making tool which and can serve as easily referable, is common in language, can
be applied globally with standard parameters as also is accepted by various
independent assessors. 

A tool as useful as this which is numerically driven and with accepted logic is
Aruvian's R'searchs Financial Analysis. 

Aruvian's R'searchs Financial Analysis report also provides a future perspective
of the company and its growth prospects. 

This Financial Analysis is a complete power researched capsule of the real
strengths of a company and provides the numerical decision making tool for the
investor which is objective as well as globally accepted. The report is a
critical interface which helps investors sift through opportunities and pick the
correct one as per their risk appetites and financial acumen. 

In the ever increasing haze of globalization wherein it is imperative for
organizations to expand their global footprint either by investing or by mergers
&amp; acquisitions, This Financial Analysis helps them steer the right business
direction to islands of profit mining and greater returns on their invested
capital. 

The report will be updated at the time of delivery.

* A. Executive Summary

&lt;p&gt;While a virtualized desktop infrastructure (VDI) may promise some advantages for the enterprise, the approach is still more expensive and less responsive than standard desktop PC deployments, contends a Microsoft executive in a blog entry Monday. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Overall, when compared in a well managed office worker environment, VDI is generally 9 -11 percent more expensive than the corresponding PC environment," wrote Gavriella Schuster, senior director of the Windows commercial product management group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schuster also noted that VDI users complain of a "diminished ... experience," due to the fact that "application performance is directly dependent on network connectivity." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post is an attempt to help customers determine when they should use VDI, client virtualization or application virtualization, Schuster said in an interview. Microsoft will get the operating-system licensing fees no matter how the OS is deployed, so the company is "agnostic" as to the approach customers use to deliver the OS to the user, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our enterprise customers have complex environments, and they have many different kinds of users. So there are times when VDI makes sense," she said. "Every customer will have a VDI, and we're trying to help them understand what it is good for, and what it is not good for." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost estimations came from a survey of about 100 enterprise customers who had spoken with Microsoft about their VDI deployments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone has reached the same conclusions, however. Computer Sciences Corp. compared the costs of running 5,000 desktop computers with 5,000 VDI instances and found that VDI cost, on the whole, 20 percent less, said Phil Grove, CSC's global director of end user services on desktop virtualization, in a recent interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CSC manages about 1.2 million desktops for its customers, including some VDI instances. In some cases VDI can even be faster than desktops, depending on the network and the data center, Grove said. In other cases, due to bandwidth and processing needs, there will be some users who "will always require a workstation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recently partnered with Citrix to offer VDI solutions. But Schuster's post advised only to use VDI in "specific scenarios." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, VDI makes sense in those cases in which workers have to maintain two desktop computers in two different locations. It also makes sense for shift work, when a single PC is shared by multiple employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog post deflates some of the commonly held assumptions about VDI's benefits for general enterprise use: It is true that VDI reduces hardware costs. But it also increases software costs. It reduces help desk costs, but increases desktop engineering costs as well, the company argued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Schuster also mentioned that Windows 7 "alleviates a lot of the reasons" that may spur organizations to consider moving to VDI, especially doing so with their copies of Windows XP or Vista. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason managers state for considering VDI is how it may reduce the number of different operating system instances that have to be supported. One OS can be used for multiple clients. But Windows 7 image management has been streamlined so that administrators do not have to build a core image for each unique machine. This reduces the total number of images that must be maintained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 also has new features that aid in power management and remote assistance, two other strengths attributed to VDI. Her assessment seems to fall in line with some other appraisals of VDI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the business battle to rule the enterprise office suite of the future, Microsoft and Google both must overcome significant problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Google's side, despite the Google Apps price advantage and Google's announcement that 2 million companies are now using Google Apps, various research data still shows Google is losing out in the enterprise. Google Apps adoption not only lags way behind Microsoft but also trails behind OpenOffice and even IBM's Lotus Symphony. Estimated revenue for Google Apps in 2009 is $50 million, a tiny portion of the company's $22 billion war chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, meanwhile, must be competitive with Web apps -- but not too competitive, since these apps will presumably drive much less revenue than its longtime cash cow, the traditional Microsoft Office suite. In fiscal year 2009, Microsoft's business division (of which Office is a major component) generated a healthy $18.9 billion in revenue. Microsoft must also convince customers that it "gets" cloud computing the way that Google does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone has the cash and the consumer branding power to take on Microsoft, it's Google, analysts say. But there's still plenty of explaining to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web Apps By the Numbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enterprise today is offered a plethora of productivity tools: There is the big horse, Microsoft Office, followed by lower-cost or free alternatives such as IBM's Lotus Symphony and Web-only products Google Apps and Zoho's Office Suite, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet although the Web browser may be the most prevalent computing platform for both consumers and businesses, enterprise use of cloud-based alternatives compared to Microsoft Office remains low, according to recent data from Forrester Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage of the Cloud App Wars -- including a complete guide to the business war, the competing products including Google Docs and Office 2010, the implications for users and IT, and more -- see CIO.com's Cloud App Wars Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a March survey of 115 North American and European enterprise and SMB technology decision-makers, Forrester cites that 81 percent are currently supporting Office 2007 -- while only 4 percent are using Google Apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, despite Office 2010's higher price than current alternatives, one-third of survey respondents plan to upgrade to Office 2010 in the next year and one-quarter plan to upgrade in the next two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So does Google Apps stand a chance against Microsoft Office in the enterprise? Maybe not right away, but Google is in a good position to advance as the enterprise shifts to the Web, say industry analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google is a Web company and it has the most resources to bring the enterprise to the Web," says Sheri McLeish, analyst at Forrester Research, adding that "mixed environments where Google complements Microsoft are the wave of the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's SharePoint collaboration software -- including enterprise and cloud adoption trends and previews of SharePoint 2010 -- see CIO.com's SharePoint Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, McLeish is not convinced yet that Google is fully committed to the enterprise, saying that while Google's clean and simple user interface caught on with consumers, it may be too limited for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For instance, Google Wave seemed like a good idea, but it needed a critical mass and didn't get it," says McLeish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Apps and Office 2010: Prices and Features&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Apps has a price tag of $50 per user per year that includes Gmail with 25GB of storage, Google Docs (word processing, spreadsheets and presentation creating tools) and other apps such as Google Sites and Google Talk. Google's Postini virus and spam protection also comes with the suite. There is an extra fee for message archiving of $13 or $33, depending on the duration of archiving needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Google revamped its Google Docs editing tool to improve speed and real-time collaboration, an area where Google Apps trumps Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Thinking about switching to Google Apps? Here's everything you need to know, from the tools it includes to security and privacy features: Google Apps FAQ.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Microsoft Office side, price for the full suite range from $150 to $680 depending which of its many versions you are looking for. With Office 2010, Microsoft will be offering Office Web Apps, free but not fully-featured online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be three versions of Web Apps: One for consumers supported by ads; a hosted version for businesses that pay for hosted accounts on Microsoft Online Services, which is powered by SharePoint; and a corporate in-house version for enterprises with volume licenses for Microsoft Office and a SharePoint server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010 will launch for businesses on May 12, but Office Web Apps are not scheduled to launch until mid-June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also has BPOS (business productivity online suite) in its arsenal, a part of Microsoft Online services that includes online versions of SharePoint, Exchange, Office Communications Server and Live Meeting for $10 per user per month for all four apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built for Enterprise vs. Built for Cloud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the cost advantage of Google Apps -- an advantage perhaps even more attractive at a time of economic recession and a time when consumers are used to Web apps for home computing -- Forrester's research is not the only data showing Google trailing by a mile in the adoption race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey of 800 IT managers worldwide in January 2010 by ITIC (Information Technology Intelligence Corp.) shows that 4 percent of businesses are using Google Apps for their main e-mail and productivity software. The survey also shows that Google Apps is most widely adopted at small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barrier to entry for Google, says McLeish, is Microsoft's vast experience serving and supporting enterprises. "The foundation has been laid for Microsoft in the enterprise," she says. "It says a lot that it can still demand high prices for the full versions of Office when Google Apps are free or much cheaper."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is quick to call out that it is a company built for businesses, while Google was built for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll ask customers: Are any of these new entrants really committed to online productivity services for the enterprise?" says Ron Markezich, Corporate VP of Microsoft Online Services. "Are they making investments in the enterprise for the long haul? It's taken Microsoft 15 years to prove that we are committed to serving enterprises and now of course that's a large part of our business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Fear: Cannibalize Office, Fail to Kill Google&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with Google's tiny presence in the enterprise, it is still a giant brand name with deep pockets and products that most consumers (who also work at enterprises) are familiar with, particularly Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may not be a true threat to Microsoft's enterprise customers now, but Google's cloud-based productivity apps have forced Microsoft to change its business model. Microsoft has created online versions of its software products, dropped prices and must justify to enterprise customers why they should pay top dollar for Office and Exchange when they could "Go Google" and save money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new dynamic has created a difficult conflict for Microsoft where it has to promote cloud-based apps to the detriment of its franchise desktop software products, says veteran tech analyst Roger Kay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft needs to be successful with Web apps, but not too successful," says Kay. "They're not getting full revenue from its cloud apps so they need to make them lightweight enough that people will upgrade to the full paid product, which is Microsoft's cash cow. Microsoft will be reluctant to give up on anything that makes them money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This conundrum is not an easy one for Microsoft resolve, says Kay, adding that the worst case scenario for Microsoft is that Office Web Apps and Exchange and SharePoint Online take off and cannibalize Microsoft's client software, yet still fail to kill off Google Apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google itself concedes that any overnight success in the enterprise is unrealistic, yet remains fully committed to the enterprise, citing rapid growth in Google Apps' short three-year life span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google Apps have only been in the market since 2007 and we've gone from zero to two million business customers," says Rajen Sheth, Google's senior product manager for Google Apps. "There's so much potential here and we're in it for the long haul."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where Microsoft is trying to migrate its products into a cloud environment, Google is fundamentally a cloud company, says Sheth, and has gone to great pains to build extremely large data centers designed specifically for nimble Web-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will be tough to build up the cloud expertise that's been built into Google's DNA since day one," Sheth says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would Microsoft Be All In for Cloud if Not for Google?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the reality of today's enterprise is that Google Apps are simply not a wholesale replacement technology for Microsoft Office, says Ted Schadler, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You may see enterprises move to Google for e-mail, but rarely will you see them replacing Microsoft Office with Google Docs," says Schadler, adding that Google Apps collaboration features such as Google Sites and Google Talk will likely be used only to enhance Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google Apps will continue to have success with its collaboration and mobile features that augment Office in the enterprise. But I don't see it displacing Microsoft Office in any meaningful way," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing is for sure though -- Google is heavily invested in its enterprise cloud play and although it may not have a critical mass behind it yet, it has forced Microsoft to adjust its entire business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth asking: Would Microsoft be "All In" for cloud computing if there were no Google?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt;Academies Will Launch at East Bay Middle and High Schools This Summer
HAYWARD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
California State University, East Bay (CSUEB) today announced a $1.5 million
investment from Chevron Corporation to significantly expand CSUEB`s Mathematics
Achievement Academies for aspiring college students in the Bay Area. The
academies support underserved students in middle and high schools in the East
Bay to help strengthen their mathematical skills and prepare them for academic
success. 

"We are exceptionally pleased to be partnering with Chevron in this critical
endeavor," said Mohammed H. Qayoumi, president of CSUEB. "Both the university
and Chevron are committed to ensuring the long-term social and economic vibrancy
of our region. By providing new opportunities and new pathways for aspiring
young students to prepare for college and career success, we`re not only helping
to create a better-prepared workforce, but also stronger communities." 

The investment is through Chevron`s California Partnership, an initiative to
invest in economic development and education in its home state through
innovative partnerships. The program focuses specifically on supporting science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education programs to provide the
skills needed for students to succeed in the global economy and increase college
and career readiness. 

Twelve Chevron Mathematics Achievement Academies, serving 350 students primarily
from underserved communities in Richmond, Oakland, Dublin, Livermore and
Concord, will be run jointly by CSUEB and partners in the Alameda County Office
of Education (ACOE) and the Alameda County Collaborative for Learning and
Instruction in Mathematics (ACCLAIM). Each academy will enroll at least 25
students. 

Mathematics is key to predicting college entrance and success; 80 percent of
students who pass Algebra I and Geometry by the 10th grade successfully go on to
college, as documented by the College Board in 2002. Through innovative teaching
methods, mentoring and field trips, the academies emphasize the importance of
mathematics to college and career readiness. 

"Our mission at CSUEB is providing access to higher education and success.
Helping underserved students achieve in math opens new opportunities and creates
possibilities for their future, which is what we`re all about," said Stan
Hebert, associate vice president of Student Affairs at CSUEB, whose office
coordinates the financing and overall administration of the academies. 

Chevron`s commitment to sponsoring the academies will continue in 2011 and 2012,
allowing students to pursue a three-year college preparatory sequence of Algebra
I, Geometry and Algebra II. 

"Cultivating student interest in math and science is at the heart of our
investment with CSUEB, recognizing that our sustained commitment is vital to
ensure that high school students graduate college-ready and career bound," said
Matt Lonner, manager of Global Partnerships and Programs at Chevron. "This
innovative collaboration to expand the Mathematics Achievement Academies will
help at-risk students build math proficiency, inspire the pursuit of STEM
knowledge and ultimately better prepare them for a lifetime of success." 

In addition to providing financial support for the Chevron Mathematics
Achievement Academies, Chevron employees will also donate time through a
mentorship program for the students. Mentors will provide tutoring support to
help students with specific assignments and stay current with homework and other
program assignments as well as attend program events. 

This year, a total of 19 summer academies will be held at middle and high
schools in nine districts in Alameda, Dublin, Fremont, Hayward, Oakland,
Livermore, and the Rodeo, Concord and Richmond areas. Teachers for the five-week
summer academies will come from ACCLAIM, a professional development partnership
between the university, ACOE, Chabot College and school districts throughout the
region that has provided professional development for more than 6,000 teachers
since 2000. ACCLAIM will also provide day-to-day site facilitation, under the
leadership of executive director Philip Gonsalves. 

"Historically, students who struggle in mathematics often end up with `more of
the same.` But it's not about teaching kids how to do math, it's about teaching
kids mathematics that makes sense," said Gonsalves, a mathematics lecturer at
CSUEB and a mathematics coordinator at ACOE. 

"The Alameda County Office of Education is thrilled to have such strong support
from Chevron in our area, and we are excited to step up to the plate to
facilitate districts` participation," said Drew Kravin, a mathematics
coordinator at the ACOE and co-director of ACCLAIM. 

Eric Suess, professor and department chair of statistics and biostatistics at
CSUEB, will coordinate the program evaluation and assessment. Suess is also a
co-director of ACCLAIM. 

CSUEB has identified college pathway programs, including these academies, as a
key element of its University of Possibilities fundraising campaign. The
campaign also seeks to raise funds for student access and improvements to STEM
education. Chevron`s grant is the largest contribution to the campaign to date,
which began its leadership phase in 2009. 

In addition to Chevron`s investment, further support for Mathematics Achievement
Academies will come from AT, Bank of America, Union Bank of California, Lam
Research, the CSU Chancellor`s Office and school districts in Alameda County.

&lt;p&gt; * Wealth manager says fired for blowing whistle on client&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * 20-year client brought in $600,000/year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan declines to comment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - A former JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) private wealth management executive who said she was
one of her department's top producers on Monday sued the bank,
saying she was fired for being a whistleblower against a
longtime client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court,
Jennifer Sharkey alleged she was fired last August after urging
the second-largest U.S. bank to break ties with an Israeli
customer who had been a bank client for 20 years and generated
some $600,000 of business annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The customer was not identified in Monday's complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sharkey said she was fired from her vice president position
because of her role in an internal probe into the client's
alleged involvement in mail fraud, bank fraud and money
laundering, and was let go six days after submitting a report
urging the bank to drop the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She contended that prior to her removal, her activities
resulted in her being removed from some client accounts and
excluded from client meetings. She also said she was deprived
of her 2009 bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment. Sharkey's
lawyer did not immediately return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the complaint, Sharkey joined JPMorgan in 2006
and managed accounts for more than 75 high net worth clients
with in excess of $500 million of assets. She was the
second-highest producer in her department, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sharkey is seeking possible reinstatement, back pay and
other money damages, expungement of the firing from her record,
and other remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Sharkey v. JPMorgan Chase  Co, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03824.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Hilltop Beats Zacks Estimate

Recently, Hilltop Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HTH) filed its 10-Q to report the first
quarter results of 2010. Net loss attributable to common stockholders increased
71.3% to $2.09 million or 4 cents per share from a net loss of $1.22 million or
2 cents per share in the year-ago period. However, this came in line with the
Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents per share. 

Results benefited from marginal growth in direct and net premiums written due to
the development of additional insurance products and new agency relationships
along with net realized gain and other income. However, this growth was offset
by higher operating expenses and decline in premiums earned that led to a
deteriorating bottom-line and a negative operating cash flow. 

As of Mar 31, 2010, Hilltop had investments of approximately $733 million in
overnight deposits at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM), Bank of America Corp.
(NYSE: BAC) and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE: WFC). These investments are in excess
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limit. 

American Medical Outperforms

American Medical Systems Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMMD) reported fiscal
first-quarter earnings per share of 29 cents, outperforming both the Zacks
Consensus Estimate and the year-ago earnings of 25 cents. EPS results came in
higher than the company`s own expectations of 23 to 26 cents. 

Total revenues in the first quarter increased 9.1% year over year to $134.9
million. Excluding a favorable foreign currency translation, net sales increased
7.1% year over year.

Teri Hatcher

Teri Hatcher has delivered memorable performances in movies, television and on
stage, since 1990. Having starred as Lois in the ABC series "Lois and Clark",
Teri often finds herself a role model to young women in journalism and carries a
Superman fan base that is nothing short of global. Her first movie role in
Christopher Guest`s "The Big Picture" remains one of her career highlights along
with movie roles in "Soapdish", "Spy Kids", "Tomorrow Never Dies" and most
recently, when Teri voiced ALL THREE mothers in Henry Selick`s Oscar nominated
animated film "Coraline". 

Her fearless desire to challenge herself and experience the world led her to
star as Sally Bowles in the Sam Mendes directed touring company of "Caberet" in
1999, receiving critical acclaim and standing ovations from Los Angeles to
Boston. Her comedic expertise was wildly noted when she hosted SNL in 1995,
landing at least 2 of her sketches in the Best of SNL highlights series. In 2005
she was awarded a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award for Best Actress
in a Comedy for her legendary portrayal of Susan Mayer on "Desperate
Housewives". 

In 2006 she wrote her first book, a funny and inspirational look at a woman
finding balance between family, career and self, titled "Burnt Toast and Other
Philosophies of Life." It remained on the New York Times best seller list for 4
weeks. Teri currently is in the 6th season of filming "Desperate Housewives",
which she still has fun at every day. She has been writing and blogging articles
for Glamour UK magazine, Newsweek and Modernmom.com. She is raising her twelve
year old daughter, who is still her highest priority, and 7 rescued animals,
participating in triathlons and charitable fundraisers, and with the left over
minutes, looking for love. She has traveled to 5 of the 7 continents, both for
personal and philanthropic ventures, and looks forward to conquering the other 2
soon.

&lt;p&gt;  ARVADA, CO, May 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Demartek announces its evaluation of IBM and QLogic FCoE Server and
Storage Solution. This solution shows the combined use of Fibre Channel
over Ethernet (FCoE) and native Fibre Channel (FC) working together in an
end-to-end solution. This evaluation included installing and deploying an
IBM server with a QLogic Converged Network Adapter (CNA) connected to a
10-Gigabit FCoE infrastructure that was connected to an IBM DS4700 Fibre
Channel storage system

    "We found that a server with an FCoE CNA connected to a DCB/FCoE switch
works as expected when connected to existing native Fibre Channel storage
infrastructure," said Dennis Martin, Demartek President. "From a storage
management viewpoint, managing the FCoE components was equivalent to
managing traditional FC components."

solution is available at:

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. television host and journalist Barbara Walters said on Monday that she will undergo surgery to replace a heart valve later this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walters, 80, made the announcement on her daytime talk show "The View," saying the operation had been planned for some time. Walters said she expects to return to the show in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have known of this condition for a while now and my doctors and I have decided that this is the best time to do the surgery," Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC News president David Westin told ABC News staff in an internal email on Monday, seen by Reuters, that "there's no denying that this is serious surgery," but added "It is not urgent; she is feeling great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters, who is one of the best-known television personalities in the United States, became the first female U.S. network news co-anchor more than 30 years ago. She then served as co-host of ABC newsmagazine 20/20 and carved out a reputation for various TV specials interviewing high-profile personalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Christine Kearney, editing by Michelle Nichols)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Monday showed how its trading operations are stronger than ever, but warned that more litigation and investigations loom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, in a quarterly regulatory filing, said it made it through the first quarter without a single day of trading losses, the first time it had accomplished such a feat. The firm reported trading revenue of more than $100 million on 35 days in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same filing, Goldman said it still faces a number of probes and reviews, which could be damaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said it anticipates additional shareholder actions and other investigations related to its offerings of collateralized debt obligations, which are at the heart of charges against the firm filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares have tumbled more than 20 percent since the SEC accused the bank on April 16 of failing to tell investors who bought risky debt tied to subprime mortgages that hedge fund manager John Paulson helped select the underlying portfolio for the security and was shorting the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares were up 2.1 percent to $145.99 in morning trading but lagged behind others in the Amex Securities Broker/Dealer Index. Equities were rallying after tumbling last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, in its filing, said the SEC case "could result in collateral consequences to us that may materially adversely affect the manner in which we conduct our businesses." It said certain outcomes could impact the firm's ability to act as broker-dealer or provide certain advisory and other services to U.S.-registered mutual funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Goldman had begun settlement talks with the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts and investors have speculated that scrutiny surrounding Goldman would lead to the resignation of Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein. But at the bank's annual shareholder meeting on Friday, Blankfein said he had no plans to resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE INVESTIGATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past year, Goldman has faced a backlash over its quick rebound from the financial crisis, while benefiting from various government bailout programs, and its bonus pool, which topped $16 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which reported record profit in 2009, has been trying to live down a Rolling Stone article last year that labeled the firm a "giant vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its blockbuster trading performance in the first quarter, coupled with the SEC charges, could heighten the public furor surrounding the firm, which has been cast as profiting from the subprime mortgage meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, criticized for not disclosing it had received notice last year of the likelihood of SEC charges, discussed several investigations on Monday, including probes by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the UK's Financial Services Authority related to CDO offerings and related matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it is cooperating with a number of investigations and reviews into its sales and trading operations related to corporate and government securities and other financial products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm also said it is facing investigations and reviews relating to the 2008 financial crisis, including the establishment and unwinding of credit default swaps with American International Group Inc.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 6.4 percent drop in the Standard  Poor's 500 stock index last week was only about half as bad as it could have been, according to Goldman Sachs credit analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Goldman report on Monday said that stock investors appear "complacent" and taken by surprise in recent weeks by sovereign debt risk. Goldman Sachs is the most profitable Wall Street firm and is facing a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman would have expected a 10 percent SP 500 stock decline last week, judged by credit and options markets. Financial stocks also could have fallen as much as 12 percent last week, according to credit and options market metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the benchmark SP 500 index fell 6.4 percent, the SP financials sector index fell 6.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a rally in stock markets on Monday sparked by a $1 trillion European aid package may only be temporary, Goldman's report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock market investors should hedge in sectors where credit markets showed the most risk, said the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman recommends buying put spreads in financials such as Capital One, American Express, Citigroup, Prudential and Hartford Financial Services Group, and for industrial companies, such as Dover, CSX Corp, Honeywell and FedEx Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investor typically uses a put spread as a lower cost method to express a bearish view rather than buying an outright put option, which gives the right to sell the underlying stock or asset at the strike price by a certain date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Credit investors had an unwavering focus on the potential fallout from a European debt crisis, while many equity investors seemed determined to look past these risks," said John Marshall, lead author of the report. "The European debt issue was in focus last week. Credit analysts were focused on this beforehand and last week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main index of investment-grade credit default swaps narrowed about 10 basis points on Monday to 100 basis points after global policymakers devised the emergency rescue plan to prevent Greece's debt crisis from expanding through Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent credit market moves reflect a more bearish view than stock markets, Goldman said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
McCormack Baron Salazar and The Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group ("Goldman
Sachs") are pleased to announce their strategic partnership and shared vision
for the future of rebuilding distressed communities across the country. This
partnership combines the vast experience of an urban-inner city developer with a
firm known for its financial expertise and commitment to community development.
When combined, the strength of these two national firms will have the ability to
significantly impact the revitalization of low-to-moderate income urban
communities. 

McCormack Baron Salazar Chairman and CEO, Richard D. Baron, announced the
investment by Goldman Sachs of a minority interest in the nationally recognized
development firm. Mr. Baron said, "Building upon the strength and experience of
McCormack Baron Salazar`s 35 years of development success, Goldman Sachs saw
this as an opportunity to expand their focus on investing in urban America. This
was a natural progression for both firms to continue their missions." 

"We are proud to partner with McCormack Baron Salazar. They are thought-leaders
in comprehensive neighborhood development, using innovative approaches to
transform previously neglected communities. This partnership is a unique
opportunity to expand our commitment to the revitalization of urban
neighborhoods on a national scale," said Alicia Glen, Managing Director and head
of the Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group. 

Goldman Sachs` partnership interests began with its equity investment in
McCormack Baron Salazar`s revitalization of Harmony Oaks, (formerly C.J. Peete)
a HOPE VI development in New Orleans, Louisiana. This former public housing site
was the home to nearly 150 families when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 29,
2005. Currently under construction, the $172 million, 460-unit redevelopment,
was designed to replicate the traditional Central City neighborhood. In February
2010, both firms welcomed the first returning residents to Harmony Oaks. 

Goldman Sachs is also the equity investor in the most recent MBS project,
MacArthur Park, which celebrated its groundbreaking April 12, 2010. MacArthur
Park Apartments will be located on land adjacent to the METRO Westlake/MacArthur
Park Station in Los Angeles, California. MacArthur Park Apartments Phase A will
have 90 units and approximately 15,000 square feet of ground floor retail on
1.62 acres of land. The project design includes a public plaza that is meant to
link pedestrians to Phases A &amp; B, MacArthur Park, the Metro station portal,
public commuter garage, and neighboring local bus lines.

&lt;p&gt; *Financial stocks could have fallen by 12 pct, report says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *Goldman recommends buying put spreads of financials&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Walden Siew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - The 6.4 percent drop in the
Standard  Poor's 500 stock index last week was only about half
as bad as it could have been, according to Goldman Sachs credit
analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman report on Monday said that stock investors appear
"complacent" and taken by surprise in recent weeks by sovereign
debt risk. Goldman Sachs is the most profitable Wall Street
firm and is facing a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman would have expected a 10 percent SP 500 stock
decline last week, judged by credit and options markets.
Financial stocks also could have fallen as much as 12 percent
last week, according to credit and options market metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the benchmark SP 500 index fell 6.4 percent, the SP
financials sector index .GSPF fell 6.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, a rally in stock markets on Monday sparked by a
$1 trillion European aid package may only be temporary,
Goldman's report said. For details, click [ID:nSGE6490HH].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stock market investors should hedge in sectors where credit
markets showed the most risk, said the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman recommends buying put spreads in financials such as
Capital One (COF.N), American Express (AXP.N), Citigroup (C.N),
Prudential (PRU.N) and Hartford Financial Services Group
(HIG.N), and for industrial companies, such as Dover (DOV.N),
CSX Corp (CSX.N), Honeywell (HON.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An investor typically uses a put spread as a lower cost
method to express a bearish view rather than buying an outright
put option, which gives the right to sell the underlying stock
or asset at the strike price by a certain date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Credit investors had an unwavering focus on the potential
fallout from a European debt crisis, while many equity
investors seemed determined to look past these risks," said
John Marshall, lead author of the report. "The European debt
issue was in focus last week. Credit analysts were focused on
this beforehand and last week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main index of investment-grade credit default swaps
narrowed about 10 basis points on Monday to 100 basis points
after global policymakers devised the emergency rescue plan to
prevent Greece's debt crisis from expanding through Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recent credit market moves reflect a more bearish view than
stock markets, Goldman said. Credit default swap spreads have
widened about 25 percent in recent weeks, and implied
volatility rose 60 percent since a pullback began on April 22,
Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, by some measures in credit markets, even credit
yield spreads haven't made a clear judgment on the impact of
sovereign credit risks emanating from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A widely followed credit default swap index saw spreads
narrow about 9 basis points on Friday, while corporate bond
spreads widened 8 basis points, according to benchmark
indexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When things get ugly, corporate debt is going to
underperform," said one Morgan Stanley analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One reason for the disparity was money managers who held
corporate bonds could not sell them amid extremely volatile
trading last week, traders said. So as a hedge, some investors
bought credit protection to hedge against corporate bond
declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our analysis makes no judgment as to which market is
correct," referring to stock markets versus credit, according
to the Goldman Sachs credit report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, we see several reasons to believe the credit
market potentially has an advantage in analyzing risks from the
European debt situation that is driving the market," the report
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Greece and possibly other countries will need to implement
fiscal tightening and structural reforms without derailing
economic growth -- a tricky balancing act," the report said.

&lt;p&gt;Exclusive Agreement Targets 180nm UltraCMOS Process as Part of Long-Term SOS
Roadmap
SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Peregrine Semiconductor Corporation, a leading supplier of high-performance RF
CMOS integrated circuits (ICs), today announced an exclusive joint development
agreement with IBM for the development and manufacture of future generations of
Peregrine`s patented UltraCMOS silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) process technology, the
industry`s highest-performance radio frequency complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (RF CMOS) process. When fully qualified, the next-generation
UltraCMOS RF ICs will be manufactured by IBM for Peregrine in the
jointly-developed 180-nanometer process at IBM`s 200mm semiconductor
manufacturing facility in Burlington, Vermont. 

Peregrine`s UltraCMOS technology delivers unmatched levels of RF performance and
monolithic integration for high-growth applications such as the RF front-end of
mobile phones and multi-mode, multi-band mobile wireless devices; broadband
communications including 4G LTE equipment and base stations; mobile DTV/CATV RF
signal conditioning; and space satellite systems. 

IBM, a global leader in microelectronics, adds Peregrine`s UltraCMOS technology
to its advanced semiconductor processing capability. This development marks the
first commercial use of 200mm (8-inch) wafer processing for silicon-on-sapphire
process -- a patented variation of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology that
incorporates an ultra-thin layer of silicon on a highly insulating sapphire
substrate -- a milestone which will drive the next decade of UltraCMOS
engineering. 

"We are pleased to be working with Peregrine to enable the next generation of RF
circuits on sapphire and extend our leadership in insulating substrates by
adding the 180nm UltraCMOS process to our world-class portfolio of RFSOI
technologies," said Regina Darmoni, director of IBM's Analog/Mixed-Signal and
Digital Foundry business. 

Migration to 200mm wafers facilitates the evolution of the process to advanced
180nm, 130nm and 90nm nodes. It also provides access to advanced manufacturing
toolsets and enables significantly expanded digital integration capability.
Further, the agreement with IBM provides, through its world-class Technology
Alliance partners, unprecedented levels of manufacturing capacity and a robust
supply chain. 

"We are extremely proud to be developing future generations of UltraCMOS with
one of the global leaders in semiconductor process technology," stated Jim
Cable, president and C.E.O. of Peregrine Semiconductor. "Our company has long
been committed to driving technological change in RF by bringing our
silicon-on-sapphire RF process into the global mainstream. By combining the
strengths of our two companies, we are continuing to deliver the promise of
Moore`s Law for high-performance RF CMOS." 

Collaboration between the two companies began in 2008 as the ability to use CMOS
for RF designs emerged as a viable alternative to compound semiconductor
processes such as gallium arsenide (GaAs). The benefits of CMOS include
reliability, cost-effectiveness, high yields, portability, scalability and
integration, all of which UltraCMOS demonstrates. Further, Peregrine is known
for its pursuit of engineering inventions and intellectual property which
advance UltraCMOS technology. One of the earliest innovations is the HaRP design
methodology, which brought about unprecedented levels of harmonic performance.
More recently, Peregrine introduced DuNE technology, which produced innovative
digitally tunable capacitors that solve longstanding industry design challenges
in RF tuning. 

"The realization of our 180nm UltraCMOS process on 200mm sapphire wafers is a
very important phase of our long-term process development strategy," commented
Mark Miscione, vice-president and chief strategist for technology solutions at
Peregrine Semiconductor. "Throughout the last several years, we have invested
significant capital and effort with our partners to strengthen the overall SOS
supply chain and improve the economics of the base sapphire substrate material.
This has been accomplished by the global acceptance of SOS technology, as
evidenced by the more than 600 million UltraCMOS RF ICs shipped from our
foundries within the past few years. These improvements have also been fueled by
the tremendous volume of sapphire now being used by the rapidly expanding LED
lighting industry." 

The first 180nm UltraCMOS RFICs have sampled to a key customer and commercial
production release is expected in 2011. Initial product roadmaps include
configurable RF cellular front ends in the form of high-power RF switches,
tunable components, and power amplifiers.

&lt;p&gt;   * Adds Boeing to conviction list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cuts General Dynamics to neutral&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised Boeing (BA.N) to
"buy" from "neutral" and added the stock to its Americas

themes that are driving outperformance in stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company rose more than 6 percent at $70.82
Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.
 "We believe the key to what we missed, and why the stock can
continue to outperform, is its breadth of leverage to positive
global themes in the market today," said analyst Noah Poponak,
who is bullish on the aerospace segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst cited Boeing's exposure to the BRIC nations,
credit normalization and the consumer recovery among other
reasons for the stock upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poponak downgraded General Dynamics (GD.N) to "neutral"
from "buy," saying it preferred other aerospace names, but said
the stock remained its favorite large-cap defense name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He removed Goodrich Corp GR.N from Americas Conviction
Buy List to make room for Boeing.

Jon Peddie Research Announces the Release of the CAD Report for 2010 to 2014
TIBURON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Right along with the rest of the world, the Computer Aided Design (CAD) industry
suffered severe setbacks in the recession of 2008-2009. Fortunately, in 2010
world economies are recovering and so are parts of the CAD industry. Because CAD
tools are used in architecture, manufacture, plant design, assembly, tool
design, mapping and Geographical Information Systems (GIS), recovery is
decidedly uneven. For example the architecture industry was the first to feel
the recession and it will take the longest to recover. On the other hand, the
automotive industry, which saw a spectacular meltdown in 2009, is coming back
more quickly. As with all recessions there are benefits to be realized in a
slowdown and in some cases those benefits are already showing up in 2010. 

Jon Peddie Research (JPR) estimates the CAD software market to be $5 billion in
2009. This is a 23% decrease compared to 2008 when the market reached a high of
$6.7 billion. All industries in all geographies felt the effects of the
recession. The market will grow in 2009 but it will not recover to the high
levels seen in 2008, which was unnaturally fueled by financial bubbles. As
difficult as the recession in 2009 has been and will continue to be for many
companies, it will serve as a jump start for long term growth as many companies
take the time afforded by a slow down to move to advanced technologies and
retrain workers. 

Inevitably, this same process is driving many workers out of the CAD industry.
The contraction is tightest at the bottom rungs of the CAD work force where CAD
operators or CAD drafters move on to find new opportunities. JPR estimates that
at least 200,000 workers have left the CAD industry worldwide. In the coming
years there will be increased opportunities for CAD workers who can take
advantage of new software capabilities to increase their companies'
efficiencies. In the architecture related fields, these opportunities will come
to people who can help their companies move to a Building Information Management
(BIM) workflow. In manufacture, we are seeing new opportunities appear in
improving Product Data Management/Product Life Management/Customer Relationship
Management (PDM/PLM/CRM) workflows, and analysis. In all segments of the CAD
industry, rendering is become a mainstream capability across the board as
workers become interested in creating their own visualizations. 

In 2010, the CAD market will grow to $5.4 billion, a modest increase of 5%. We
expect the CAD market to fully recover by 2013/2014.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Lower ratings and ad revenues, and higher costs at Walt Disney Co's ABC television network upstaged a turnaround at its film division fueled by "Alice in Wonderland", and its shares fell 3.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Disney posted better-than-expected second quarter earnings but analysts said results at its media network division, the largest in terms of earnings and revenue, were disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues in the media networks division, home to cable networks like ESPN and broadcaster ABC, rose 6 percent to $3.8 billion, but operating income was flat at $1.3 billion, versus expectations of $1.43 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the division, operating income at Disney's broadcasting networks fell $39 million to $123 million primarily due to decreased primetime and news ad revenues at ABC TV network and higher programing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts like Imran Khan of J.P. Morgan had hoped for operating income of $170.1 million at the division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The movie studio was the real surprise and factor behind the beat, whereas the media networks were disappointing," said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also were disappointed with ESPN, where higher affiliate revenue and ad revenue were offset by higher costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disappointing media network results contrasted with improved results at rivals like CBS Corp and News Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue at Disney's revamped film studio rose 7 percent to $1.5 billion and segment operating income rose $210 million to $223 million. Some analysts had expected operating income of about $103 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers were overall ahead of expectations, but the Street typically pays higher multiples on media network earnings than they will on film earnings, which are less predictable," said Alan Gould, analyst with Soleil Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call with analysts, Disney executives cited more positive trends with payments for last-minute commercials pacing 30 percent above last year's upfronts levels, when advertisers bought commercial time in advance for the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parks and resorts revenues rose slightly to $1.5 billion from $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on the call that third quarter hotel bookings were running 10 percent below year-ago levels, but said Disney had been cutting discounts since the beginning of the year and planned to return to "normalized" pricing in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's fiscal second-quarter net income rose 55 percent to $953 million, or 48 cents per share, from $613 million, or 33 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected the company to post earnings of 45 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 6 percent to $8.58 billion, also surpassing Wall Street's forecast of nearly $8.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's shares traded $34.50 in extended trade, after a 1.3 percent gain during the regular session on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sue Zeidler; editing by Carol Bishopric, additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you choose an emoticon to spice up a comment about a company, product or service online, know this: There's a chance that a software program is capturing the sentiment expressed by your smiley or frowny for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capability is part of a new release of IBM's SPSS Modeler text mining and analytics software, which also allows customers to parse information from social media sites and feeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emoticons' meaning tend to be obvious, but written comments aren't always so, due to industry-specific jargon and slang. To that end, the new release includes 180 "semantic networks" with taxonomies for verticals like life sciences or consumer tech. For example, in a banking context, the software would recognize that a "variable rate mortgage" and an "adjustable rate mortgage" are the same thing, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many companies already use demographic information, sales data and other structured sources to build predictive models in an effort to understand customer behavior and connect with new ones. IBM contends that integrating information from the social Web will add further insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPSS customer Money Mailer, a direct marketing services provider, definitely sees the potential of social media in its business, but is still in the early stages of figuring out how to use it, said John Gramata, vice president of marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, Money Mailer has used SPSS tools for purposes like creating "look-like" customer models, he said. He cited a regional garden center that had a dedicated customer base but was looking to add more. Money Mailer took a sample of information from the company's "loyalty club" database and developed a model for spotting likely targets aggregated from other contact databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money Mailer has an in-house statistician that works with SPSS, but the software's interface has proven easy for some business analysts to work with, Gramata said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While generally happy with the software overall, Gramata is looking forward to expected speed improvements in the new release, as very large data sets tended to result in a performance hit. "It's always been a fast tool but ... any kind of improvements in speed is definitely a welcome enhancement."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today patched two critical vulnerabilities in Office, the Visual Basic for Applications development tool and its Windows e-mail clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of the two security updates Microsoft released today really grabbed researchers. "It's the month of insignificant patches," said Tyler Reguly, a lead security research engineer at nCircle Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sort of the bottom of the barrel," added Jason Miller, data and security team manager for Shavlik Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the two updates, Reguly put MS10-030 at the top of his to-patch list. According to Microsoft, a bug in Outlook Express, the free e-mail program bundled with Windows XP; Windows Mail, which was included with Vista; and its follow-on, the optional download Windows Live Mail, could be used by attackers to compromise a PC by tricking users into visiting a malicious mail server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More likely, said Reguly, was a classic "man-in-the-middle" attack at a public WiFi hotspot, like those operated by McDonalds or Starbucks, where a hacker intercepts traffic, including mail, and could shunt it to his own malware-spewing server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said much the same in a post to its "Security Research  Defense" blog when it noted that users face a "significant risk" when checking mail at a public hotspot if they haven't enabled SSL (Secure Socket Layer), the Web's default security protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfgang Kandek, the chief technology officer of Qualys, disagreed with Reguly. "I think MS10-031 is the more interesting of the two. MS10-030 is pretty difficult to exploit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kandek's top pick affects Office XP, Office 2003 and Office 2007, as well as Visual Basic for Applications and that product's SDK (software developers toolkit). Hackers can exploit the vulnerability -- rated "important" for Office but "critical" for Visual Basic -- by duping users into opening rigged Office documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the key to Kandek's decision to put MS10-031 ahead of its rival. "The attack vector through Office makes this much more likely," he said. "It's a normal attack vector these days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers thought both updates were interesting. "There may be some third-party vendors whose code is going to be vulnerable," said Shavlik's Miller, referring to MS10-031. "If they wrote their applications using the Visual Basic SDK, they may have to recompile their programs. I'd expect to see some non-Microsoft updates on this from third-parties."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Visual Basic bug reminded Miller of Microsoft's emergency patch last summer that fixed a flaw in Active Template Library (ATL), a code library used by both Microsoft and third-party developers to build software. After Microsoft admitted that the ATL bug had been caused by an extraneous "" character introduced by one of its engineers, several vendors were forced to release updates of their software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller also called attention to MS10-030, saying that man-in-the-middle attacks were possible at universities and public places, such as libraries, as well as at coffee shops, restaurants and airports. What struck him about the update, however, was that it was another instance where Microsoft patched systems that are not actually vulnerable to attack. "They're calling that 'defense-in-depth,' but what they're doing is closing all the doors, just in case," said Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even those Windows 7 users who haven't downloaded and installed Windows Live Mail -- that operating system doesn't include a bundled mail client -- will be offered MS10-030, Microsoft said in its accompanying advisory. As a precaution, Microsoft is patching the vulnerable .dll file -- inetcomm.dll -- on Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I applaud that," said Miller. "Better safer than sorry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's practice of alternating large- and small-sized Patch Tuesdays continued this month, all the researchers interviewed today noted. Last month, for instance, Microsoft issued 11 updates that patched 25 vulnerabilities . "This is what we expect now," said Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That means we should expect another big month next month," added Reguly. Microsoft's next scheduled patch day is June 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As promised last week , Microsoft did not patch a cross-site scripting vulnerability in SharePoint 2007. It did leave open the option of issuing a rush fix if attacks were spotted, then surged. "We are not aware of any active attacks at this time and we will continue to monitor the threat landscape and post an updated security advisory should it be needed," said Jerry Bryant, a group security manager in an entry on the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) blog today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month's Microsoft security update can be downloaded and installed via the Windows Update and Microsoft Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is upgrading its popular Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint applications, and rolling out its own online versions to keep up with the new class of mobile, web-connected users that have emerged since the last upgrade in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most are expecting the Office franchise -- which Microsoft says has 500 million users -- to retain its dominance in the business world. But Office could be facing the beginning of an erosion of its "must-have" status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every time Microsoft releases a new version of Office, they get a bump up in revenue," said Toan Tran, an analyst at Morningstar. "But how big of an upgrade is this? They might have a harder time getting people to update."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is expected to trumpet a list of improvements on Wednesday, such as editing photos in Word, using video in PowerPoint, collaborating on documents and managing e-mail conversations in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the most interesting facet is Microsoft's move into the "cloud" -- allowing users to manipulate documents stored on remote servers from anywhere -- where Google has been setting the pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're coming into our playing field," said Dave Girouard, the Google executive leading the company's charge into business applications. "They (Microsoft) have conceded that this is the future and now we think our products and services will get a lot more consideration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Docs -- stripped down versions of Microsoft's core programs -- are available over the Internet with no need to download software. They are free for personal users and $50-per-user per year for companies. Google says it has picked up 25 million users since launching almost four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is only a fraction of Microsoft's 500 million, but is growing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Word and Excel are pretty secure -- Excel is embedded in an uncountable number of business processes, so that would be pretty hard to rip out," said Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft faces more pressure in email and calendar programs, the areas most amenable to online and mobile use, where Google already has a strong foothold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google has made a lot of inroads there. Microsoft is going to face pressure there over time. They are probably going to have to cut prices to some extent," said Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could put the brakes on one of Microsoft's most formidable profit engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's business division -- which gets 90 percent of its sales from Office -- averages around $2.8 billion profit per quarter. That is 47 percent of Microsoft's total profit so far this fiscal year, second only to Microsoft's core Windows franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses account for the vast majority of that. According to the latest data from tech research firm Forrester, 81 percent of companies are running Office 2007, compared with only 4 percent using Google's online equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Forrester poll indicates almost a third of existing Office users plan to upgrade to Office 2010 -- which will be available to them from Wednesday -- within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordinary consumers get the chance to buy Office 2010 next month, at prices ranging from $119 to $499, depending on the level of sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take at least a year before it is clear whether Microsoft has a winner and the extent to which customers are migrating to online versions and lessening reliance on installed software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google is not the threat that it will be once the 'virtual desktop' becomes a no-brainer," said Richard Williams, an analyst at Cross Research, referring to the practice of accessing software over the Web. "That's the time Microsoft really has to worry about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby and Alexei Oreskovic; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office confirmed a patent held by i4i that has been at the heart of a dispute with Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already had to remove a feature from Word 2007 and has been ordered to pay more than US$240 million in damages due to the ongoing battle over the technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I4i said on Tuesday that in late April the patent office issued a Notice of Intent to Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate regarding the decision on the patent. That means the patent office will soon issue a Reexamination Certificate "which will formally conclude the reexamination proceeding favorably for i4i," the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I4i's patent covers technology that lets people create custom XML documents. Last year the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ruled that Microsoft had to stop selling products that used i4i's technology. Since then the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has twice refused Microsoft's requests to reconsider the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should Microsoft decide to continue to pursue the case, its next stop would be the U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are disappointed, but there still remain important matters of patent law at stake, and we are considering our options to get them addressed, including a petition to the Supreme Court," said Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP ("Robbins Geller")
(http://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases/pfizerinc/) today announced that a class action
has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York on behalf of purchasers of Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer") (NYSE:PFE)
publicly traded securities during the period between July 20, 2005 and January
23, 2009 (the "Class Period"). 

If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than 60
days from today. If you wish to discuss this action or have any questions
concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff`s
counsel, Darren Robbins of Robbins Geller at 800/449-4900 or 619/231-1058, or
via e-mail at djr@rgrdlaw.com. If you are a member of this class, you can view a
copy of the complaint as filed or join this class action online at
http://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases/pfizerinc/. Any member of the putative class may
move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or
may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. 

The complaint charges Pfizer and certain of its officers and directors with
violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Pfizer is a pharmaceutical
company engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and marketing of
prescription medicines for humans and animals worldwide. 

The complaint alleges that at various times during the Class Period, Pfizer
manufactured, marketed, and sold many types of drugs, including Bextra, an
anti-inflammatory, Geodon, an anti-psychotic, Zyvox, an antibiotic, and Lyrica,
an anti-epileptic drug. During the Class Period, defendants misled investors by
failing to disclose that they were engaged in an ongoing course of conduct
designed to illegally promote the sale of Pfizer drugs, including Bextra,
Geodon, Zyvox and Lyrica. By such conduct, Pfizer caused hundreds of millions of
dollars in false or fraudulent claims to be submitted to several federal
healthcare programs, thus exposing the Company to untold legal liability. 

On January 26, 2009, Pfizer announced that it was paying $2.3 billion to resolve
several ongoing investigations. These investigations included the improper
promotion of and kickbacks involving Bextra, Geodon, Zyvox and Lyrica. After the
cost of resolving these investigations became public, the price of Pfizer common
stock declined from $17.45 at the previous trading day`s close to $15.65 on
January 26, 2009. 

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of Pfizer
publicly traded securities during the Class Period (the "Class"). The plaintiff
is represented by Robbins Geller, which has expertise in prosecuting investor
class actions and extensive experience in actions involving financial fraud. 

Robbins Geller, a 180-lawyer firm with offices in San Diego, San Francisco, New
York, Boca Raton, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Atlanta, is active in major
litigations pending in federal and state courts throughout the United States and
has taken a leading role in many important actions on behalf of defrauded
investors, consumers, and companies, as well as victims of human rights
violations. The Robbins Geller Web site (http://www.rgrdlaw.com) has more
information about the firm.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Mortgages Still Flooded

Theoretically, there should never be a foreclosure on a house that has negative
equity. Regardless of how bad the homeowner's cash flow situation is, they would
come out better off by selling than they would by letting the bank take over the
house. They can`t live there anymore, in either case, but if they sell they
might still have enough cash to pay for the first month`s rent and the security
deposit when they go to rent a new place. They get nothing if the bank takes it
over. For those who are just a little bit underwater, they still have reasons to
keep paying their mortgages, but as the depth increases, the reasons become
increasingly non-economic. 

Yes, the hit to your credit rating is an economic cost, but the main factors are
a sense of shame in losing your house. Funny, the major players in the
commercial real estate market are utterly shameless in this regard. Blackstone
(NYSE: BLK), for example, is one of the biggest money management firms in the
world, and is highly profitable, but they had no trouble mailing in the keys on
a $4.4 billion mortgage on the Stuyvesant Town apartment complex in New York.
Donald Trump has defaulted on mortgages more times than I can remember, yet he
gets to be the one saying, "You're fired," not people saying it to him. 

At What Point Does Defaulting Become an Option?

Other non-economic factors are that people might really love the house they are
in, the neighborhood, the kids' schools, etc. Those things can be important, and
might be a good reason to keep paying on your house if it is five or ten grand
under water...but what if you are $100,000 grand under water? 

Well $100,000 under water is not that much if the house is worth $1.5 million,
and the mortgage is for $1.6 billion. On the other hand, $10,000 is a lot if we
are talking a house that is worth $40,000 and a mortgage of $50,000. The person
living in that $40,000 house probably makes a lot less than the person in the
$1.5 million home, so that $10,000 could be 25% of their income for a year. 

Really it is the percentage you are under water as much as the absolute amount
that determines when it makes sense to simply walk away. Keep in mind that banks
don`t really foreclose right away, and right now they have been much slower than
they have been historically in foreclosing due to the huge backlog. Thus it is
possible to live for months and months, often well over a year, rent and
mortgage free before the sheriff shows up at the door. 

Most economic theory is based on the idea of Homo Economus, the idea that all
people will make economically rational decisions. Yet if you own a home, you can
effectively sell if for whatever the value of the mortgage is, simply by not
paying your mortgage. There are few other things that people regularly continue
to pay for when they are worth far less than what people are paying. 

However, if people really started to act in an economically rational way, they
would probably sink the whole economic system. There is no way that Bank of
America (NYSE: BAC) or JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) could really survive if
everyone who was underwater on their mortgage defaulted. 

Yes, they have raised a lot of capital, and by keeping their dividends low and
not buying back stock, the steep yield curve is allowing them to replenish their
capital quickly. But if people in mass woke up and started to act in an
economically rational manner, that capital would be depleted quickly. 

People walking away are also a big part of the reason that the losses at Fannie
Mae (NYSE: FNM) and Freddie Mac (NYSE: FRE) are going to remain in the
multibillion a quarter level for the foreseeable future. Since we as taxpayers
own 80% of both of them, that is a problem for all of us.

BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today reported earnings for its second
fiscal quarter and six months ended April 3, 2010. Diluted earnings per share
(EPS) for the second quarter increased 45% to $0.48 from $0.33 in the prior-year
quarter. EPS for the current and prior-year quarter include the items discussed
in the following paragraph. Excluding these items, EPS increased 12% to $0.48
from $0.43 in the prior-year quarter. 

The current quarter included restructuring and impairment charges, a gain on the
sale of an investment in a pay television service in Central Europe, and an
accounting gain related to the acquisition of the Disney Stores in Japan, which
collectively had no net impact on EPS. The prior-year quarter included
restructuring and impairment charges which had a $0.10 per share impact on EPS. 

For the six month period, diluted EPS was $0.93 compared to $0.78 in the
prior-year period. In addition to the items discussed above, EPS for the current
six months included restructuring and impairment charges and a gain on the sale
of an investment in a television service in Europe which were recorded in the
first quarter of the current year while the prior-year period included a gain on
the sale of our investment in two pay television services in Latin America.
Excluding these items, EPS increased 12% to $0.95 from $0.85 in the prior-year
six months. 

"The incredible box office performance of Disney`s Alice in Wonderland and
acquisition of Marvel, whose Iron Man 2 has grossed $334 million in global box
office in its first two weeks, clearly show the benefits of investing in high
quality branded content," said Robert A. Iger, President and CEO, The Walt
Disney Company. "With the economy showing signs of improvement, we`re confident
our strategy is the right one to provide consumers the best in entertainment
while building long-term value for our shareholders."

Cable Networks

Operating income at Cable Networks increased $39 million to $1.2 billion for the
quarter driven by an increase at ESPN due to higher affiliate revenue and, to a
lesser extent, advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming
costs. The increase in affiliate revenue was due to higher contractual rates and
subscriber growth, which was driven by the launch of a new network in the United
Kingdom, while higher advertising revenue was due to an increase in sold
inventory, partially offset by lower ratings. Higher programming and production
costs reflected costs for soccer programming rights for the new network in the
United Kingdom and higher contractual costs for college basketball and NBA
programming. At the worldwide Disney Channels higher affiliate and advertising
revenues were offset by higher programming costs and sales and distribution
expenses. 

Broadcasting

Operating income at Broadcasting decreased $39 million to $123 million for the
quarter primarily due to decreased primetime and news advertising revenues at
the ABC Television Network, higher production cost amortization related to sales
of ABC Studios productions and higher primetime programming costs. These
decreases were partially offset by higher advertising revenues at the owned
television stations and lower bad debt expense driven by recoveries of
previously reserved syndication customer receivables. The decrease in
advertising revenues at the ABC Television Network was driven by lower ratings,
partially offset by higher rates and sold inventory. 

Parks and Resorts

Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $2.4 billion and
segment operating income decreased 12% to $150 million. Results for the quarter
were driven by a decrease at Disney Cruise Line due to higher fuel costs and
promotional activity. 

Operating income at our domestic parks was essentially flat as higher guest
spending was offset by decreased attendance and occupied room nights and higher
costs. Higher guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices.
Increased costs reflected labor and other cost inflation and higher pension and
postretirement medical costs, partially offset by lower volume-related costs and
savings from cost mitigation activities. Decreased attendance in part reflected
an unfavorable net impact due to a shift in the timing of the New Year`s and
Easter holiday periods relative to our fiscal periods. 

Results at our international operations were essentially flat as increased
attendance and hotel occupancy at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was offset by
decreased attendance and lower hotel occupancy at Disneyland Paris. 

Studio Entertainment

Studio Entertainment revenues for the quarter increased 7% to $1.5 billion and
segment operating income increased $210 million to $223 million. Higher
operating income was primarily due to an increase in worldwide theatrical
distribution. 

The increase in worldwide theatrical distribution was primarily due to the
strong performance of Alice in Wonderland in the current quarter, compared to
Confessions of a Shopaholic and Race to Witch Mountain in the prior-year
quarter, and lower distribution expense for future releases in the domestic
market. 

Consumer Products

Consumer Products revenues for the quarter increased 20% to $596 million and
segment operating income increased 37% to $133 million. 

The increase in segment operating income reflected growth at Merchandise
Licensing, an increase at Publishing driven by Marvel titles, and improvement at
our retail business driven by higher comparable store sales at the Disney Stores
North America. The increase at Merchandise Licensing was driven by higher earned
revenue led by the strong performance of Toy Story and Marvelmerchandise,
partially offset by amortization of Marvel acquisition intangible assets. 

Interactive Media

Interactive Media revenues for the quarter increased 20% to $155 million and
operating results improved from a loss of $61 million in the prior-year quarter
to a loss of $55 million in the current quarter. 

Improved operating results reflected higher Club Penguin subscription revenues
and lower video game inventory costs, partially offset by higher internet
product development and sales and marketing costs. 

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

The Company recorded $71 million of restructuring and impairment charges in the
current quarter primarily related to the closure of a Studio production
facility.

The decrease in interest expense for the quarter was primarily due to lower
effective interest rates, partially offset by expense related to the early
redemption of a film financing borrowing. 

The decrease in interest and investment income was primarily due to lower
effective interest rates. 

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rate for the current quarter was 35.0% compared to
34.8% in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter included a charge to
reflect the loss of a tax benefit related to Medicare Part D subsidies as a
result of the recently enacted healthcare reform legislation and a benefit from
the favorable resolution of certain prior-year tax matters.

 (1) Free cash flow is not a financial measure defined by GAAP. See the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows below. 


The increase in cash provided by operations was driven by higher segment
operating results. 

The increase in capital expenditures reflected the expansion at Disney's
California Adventure and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, the construction of a
Disney Vacation Club Resort in Hawaii and higher construction progress payments
on two new cruise ships. These increases were partially offset by decreased
spending on broadcast and production facilities.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding the impact of
certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating
income, all of which are important financial measures for the Company but are
not financial measures defined by GAAP. 

These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP
financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of earnings per
share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with
GAAP. Net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income as
we have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
reported by other companies. 

Earnings per share excluding certain items - The Company uses earnings per share
excluding certain items to evaluate the performance of the Company`s operations
exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period
to period. In the current quarter, these items included restructuring and
impairment charges, a gain on the sale of an investment in a pay television
service in Central Europe, and an accounting gain related to the acquisition of
the Disney Stores in Japan. In the prior-year quarter, we excluded restructuring
and impairment charges. The Company believes that information about earnings per
share exclusive of these impacts is useful to investors, particularly where the
impact of the excluded items is significant in relation to reported earnings,
because the measure allows for comparability between periods of the operating
performance of the Company`s business and allows investors to evaluate the
impact of these items separately from the impact of the operations of the
business. The following table reconciles reported earnings per share to earnings
per share excluding certain items:

Net borrowings - The Company believes that information about net borrowings
provides investors with a useful perspective on our financial condition. Net
borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total
borrowings. Since we earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a
portion of the interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be
used as a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our
cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness when
the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. However, we may not
immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the reduction of debt, nor do we
expect that we would use all of our available cash and cash equivalents to repay
debt in the ordinary course of business. 

Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by operations
less investments in parks, resorts and other property), among other measures, to
evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash that is available for
purposes other than capital expenditures. Management believes that information
about free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the
cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and
pay dividends or repurchase shares. 

Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the performance of
its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses
aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating
businesses separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that
information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by
allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company`s
portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net
income, thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other
factors that affect reported results. 

A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows (in

&lt;p&gt;Despite the unrelenting hype around cloud computing, it's just one aspect of several that will shape the next generation of enterprise IT, according to Barry Briggs, CTO of Microsoft IT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased government regulation, the complexities introduced by globalization and explosive growth in data are major issues, Briggs said at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Monday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recently completed a project that encapsulates those three factors -- a master customer database, containing records for 100 million corporate customers and some 2 billion identities, Briggs said. "That's a big deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside factors like legal compliance spanning many countries globally make such efforts even more complex. In an effort to keep in line with the rules, Microsoft has a chief privacy officer for every line of its business, Briggs said. "We're fanatical about the privacy of our customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globalization and Microsoft's drive for new business is affecting IT's role in the supply chain as well. Some emerging countries gain 25 percent or 30 percent of their overall revenue from import duties, he said. "You better get the paperwork right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, those new markets mean Microsoft's IT strategy has to change, Briggs said. "What is the profile of our next billion customers? If they're in emerging and developing countries ...  they probably won't buy in the traditional way. That has significant implications for how we build our systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Briggs has a substantial workload running Microsoft's sprawling internal systems. The company has some 228,000 SharePoint sites in its corporate intranet, according to Briggs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SharePoint is in our DNA. We use it for everything," he said. The company has made it easy for employees to spin up a SharePoint site as needed. "It takes for minimum case, not any more than five minutes. We've made it a utility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft.com will be running entirely on SharePoint in the near future, "just to prove out the scale," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond giving employees broad access to collaboration tools like SharePoint, it also wants to enable self-service, well-governed BI (business intelligence) through tools like the recently unveiled PowerPivot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, "we see a lot of people doing ad-hoc BI," Briggs said. "So and so knows so and so who knows a connection string to that database. 'Let's pull it out and run some reports, and maybe change that data and then write it back, corrupting the [main data store]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're empowering our end-users to do the sorts of analyses they should be able to do," Briggs added. Internally, PowerPivot is referred to as Microsoft's "safe needle program for BI," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Briggs also discussed Microsoft's cloud-computing strategy, including its Azure utility computing and development platform, which competes with the likes of Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about security in the cloud persist heavily among the people Briggs speaks to, he said. It's less of a technical hurdle than "a psychological thing," he said. "Where's my data? Who controls my data?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been forced to mold its Azure strategy in response to customer concerns. "We have a separate instance of Azure specifically for the U.S. government," Briggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Kanaracus can be reached at Chris_Kanaracus@idg.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent research analyst Craig LeClair will explore the SharePoint
interactive platform and its compatibility with the FormFast enterprise workflow
solution


ST. LOUIS--(Business Wire)--
FormFast, a leading provider of enterprise workflow solutions, today announced a
Webinar focusing on the benefits that Microsoft SharePoint 2010 offers to
hospitals. The hour-long session, titled "An Analyst`s Perspective: SharePoint
2010 - What Value Does It Bring to Hospitals," will be held at 11 a.m. (CDT)
Tuesday, May 25. 

Microsoft SharePoint has become a powerful tool for information sharing and
collaboration across an enterprise. The push towards Electronic Medical Records
will require a host of solutions to streamline and improve processes, which must
take hospitals through the evolution from paper- and people-driven models to
automated evidence-based, results-driven practices. Microsoft has been committed
to engineering the finest products to enable healthcare collaboration and
SharePoint, which has the ability to seamlessly connect the numerous departments
within hospitals, is no exception. 

Guest speaker Craig LeClair, a leading expert on information management and
enterprise content management, as well as a principal analyst at Forrester
Research, Inc., will lead the Webinar by discussing how Microsoft has offered
value to the healthcare IT market with products such as SharePoint, and is
offering solutions that support an emerging collaborative nature throughout the
healthcare enterprise. In addition, LeClair will provide an analyst`s
perspective on the upcoming launch of Microsoft`s HealthVault Community Connect
product, widely anticipated to improve coordination of care, introduced during
the 2010 HIMSS conference. The features and functionality of FormFast`s workflow
automation solutions, and their compatibility with SharePoint for encouraging
collaborative and efficient processes, will also be discussed. 

"Because innovative methods for information exchange and collaboration are
critical in meeting HITECH Act requirements, SharePoint is valuable in its
ability to connect departments across the enterprise," says Rob Harding,
president and CEO of FormFast. "We are pleased facilitate efforts towards
process improvement by operating FormFast workflow automation solutions on a
SharePoint platform."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Balanced U.S. financial reform will likely prevail, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) investment bank Chief Executive Jes Staley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers are working on a broad overhaul of financial regulation aimed at preventing a repeat of the massive taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has the largest derivatives exposure of the U.S. banks and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has been outspoken in his concern about some plans to force exchange trading of over-the-counter derivatives instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon told bank analysts last month that forcing dealers to trade derivatives on exchanges could cost his firm up to a couple of billion dollars in revenue annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley, speaking at a conference in New York on Tuesday, said he remains concerned about regulations that might prohibit some instruments, although he noted that exchange trading of certain standardized derivatives contracts could lead to a pickup in trading volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the second-largest U.S. bank is comfortable with its exposure to Southern Europe, Staley said. In response to an audience member's question, Staley said JPMorgan is also comfortable with U.S. municipalities' credit and wants to remain an active player in this business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay)&lt;/p&gt;

banks and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has been outspoken in his
concern about some plans to force exchange trading of
over-the-counter derivatives instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon told bank analysts last month that forcing dealers to
trade derivatives on exchanges could cost his firm up to a
couple of billion dollars in revenue annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staley, speaking at a conference in New York on Tuesday,
said he remains concerned about regulations that might prohibit
some instruments, although he noted that exchange trading of
certain standardized derivatives contracts could lead to a
pickup in trading volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, the second-largest U.S. bank is comfortable
with its exposure to Southern Europe, Staley said. In response
to an audience member's question, Staley said JPMorgan is also
comfortable with U.S. municipalities' credit and wants to
remain an active player in this business.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc could not function as a market maker if it was a fiduciary, President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executives from the bank, which is facing civil fraud charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, faced questions two weeks ago from a Senate panel in Washington about Goldman's role in the subprime mortgage crisis. That panel discussed whether Goldman Sachs was conflicted in selling securities to clients and then shorting those securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohn, Goldman's second-in-command, did not testify before the Senate panel, but at the conference on Tuesday in New York he defended Goldman Sachs' role as a market maker. He said the bank needs to be able to offset risks related to market making, in which it offers prices for sometimes illiquid securities that may not have both buyers and sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets would not work if market-makers were fiduciaries, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares have tumbled more than 20 percent since the SEC accused the bank on April 16 of failing to tell investors who bought risky debt tied to subprime mortgages that hedge fund manager John Paulson helped select the underlying portfolio for the security and was shorting the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm is also being investigated by the Justice Department, according to a source and is facing shareholder lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Cohn said Goldman Sachs is seeing the beginnings of a slow pickup in mergers and acquisitions activity, even as the economic environment remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets are likely to remain volatile in the short term as investors digest the significance of the Greek bailout. Expected reform of the U.S. banking system is also contributing to uncertainty, Cohn added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is broadly in favor of efforts to reform the financial system, he said, noting the bank supports plans to increase exchange trading and clearing of derivatives, among other measures being discussed by lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is aiming to adapt quickly to regulatory changes, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said on Monday it continued its trading momentum in the first quarter of 2010, reporting zero days of trading losses, the first time it had an entire quarter with no losing days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had 35 days in which its traders posted revenues of more than $100 million in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay and Steve Eder; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, May 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SharePoint360, the premier provider of business productivity consulting
and hosting solutions, today announced that it has teamed with Microsoft
to deliver Microsoft Business Productivity Online Services (BPOS), an
enterprise-class software, hosted by Microsoft in the cloud. BPOS
streamlines worker communication and collaboration for greater
productivity, simplifies technology management and upfront spend, and
offers business-class computer security and reliability.

    The Microsoft Online Services Suite capitalizes on cloud computing's
benefits to extend Microsoft's enterprise software to any company via a
monthly subscription model. This eliminates upfront costs of technology
deployments and the burden of managing business computing systems.
Additional key benefits include:


--  Anywhere access to data -- desktop, mobile, Web
--  Seamless user experience across workloads
--  Team collaboration and conferencing
--  Real-time communications
--  Always up-to-date technology

    

The Business Productivity Online Standard Suite consists of Exchange
Online, SharePoint Online, Office Live Meeting and Office Communications
Online, making it easy for organizations to leverage and rapidly deploy
familiar Microsoft server products as flexible services. 

    "Microsoft's BPOS is truly cloud computing for the masses, particularly
small businesses," said Paul West, co-founder and principal at
SharePoint360. "SharePoint360 is deploying Online Services to enable
customers to further grow their business via better, enterprise-class
technology that saves money from predictable spending and more
streamlined IT."

    SharePoint Online, the Web version of Microsoft's most popular business
application, provides a single, integrated location where employees can
efficiently share documents, contacts, calendars and tasks in a single
location. Leveraging redundant and geographically dispersed data centers,
SharePoint Online helps simplify IT management by removing a company's
need to deploy, configure, monitor and update/upgrade a collaboration
solution on premises. 

    In addition, Exchange Online provides employees access to e-mail,
calendar and contacts virtually while protecting against malware and
spam. Exchange Online can be rapidly deployed, flexibly expanded and is
designed to be securely administered using a powerful yet easy-to-use
Web-based console.

    SharePoint360 recently co-hosted a webinar with Microsoft discussing the
business value of adopting the cloud-based Business Productivity Online
Suite. To listen to the full conversation, go to:

&lt;p&gt;Study uncovers the source of happiness in 16 countries and reveals that
sometimes all we need to make us happy is a hug!
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
A study undertaken by Coca-Cola has uncovered the leading sources of happiness.
The global study which covers 16 countries and four continents identifies what
happiness means to different nationalities and reveals that, despite the rapid
pace of growth in the virtual world, human contact wins hands down when it comes
to happiness. People in all 16 countries agree real world contact with family
and partners is a greater source of joy (77%) than virtual world alternatives. 

Supporting this notion that human, rather than virtual interaction, is a greater
source of pleasure; the biggest highlights of the day include catching up with
loved ones in the evening (39%), eating with the family (22%) and chatting to
friends or colleagues (17%). Modern alternatives such as watching TV (14%),
connecting with others online (5%) and receiving the day`s first text message
(2%) paled in comparison. 

"The results of the Coca-Cola Happiness Barometer show that staying connected
with friends and family remains an important source of happiness for people
around the world, and that this holds true across all continents and
nationalities, including here in the U.S.," said Bill Kelly, Senior Vice
President, Coca-Cola Trademark Brands, Coca-Cola North America. "Despite the
online social networking phenomenon, nothing beats quality time with loved ones
or simple pleasures such as sharing a Coke with our nearest and dearest to bring
happiness in our lives." 

The results also show that, despite the global economic woes, overall global
happiness levels are high, with more than two thirds of people (67%) declaring
they are satisfied with their lives. 

When we do need cheering up, 38% of us turn to a night out with friends and more
than one in five (22%) will give or receive a big, warm hug! 

In the U.S., the study found that females are more likely than males to hug when
they need cheering up (23% of females versus 15% of males). Females are also
more than three times more likely than males to shop when they need some form of
happiness (14% of females versus 4% of males, respectively). For teens in the
U.S., music is important, with 18% saying it is a source of happiness and 22%
saying listening to music is one of the happiest moments of the day. 

To help interpret the results, Coca-Cola invited Dr. Richard Stevens, M.A., Ph.
D., a social psychologist and author of Personal Worlds and Understanding the
Self, who specializes in happiness and wellbeing, to provide his perspective on
the findings. In his analysis, he noted, "While it is important to have enough
money to live, income is a fairly irrelevant contributor to happiness. Without
relationships, love, family or friendship, most people will not be content and
no amount of money can fill this void." 

Striving for celebrity did not come out as a popular source of happiness in the
study. The results showed that, globally, people wouldn`t choose fame and
fortune to bring happiness, instead citing travelling around the world (37%),
volunteering to help others (26%) and meeting the love of their life (12%) as
being the key contributors to happiness. 

"Despite our celebrity-driven culture, fame is not likely in itself to be a
primary source of happiness," added Dr. Stevens. "Our real happiness depends
much more on our basic sense of self, and connecting with other people,
especially through love, care and kindness." 

The study also found that drinking a Coke really does contribute to making
people happy! More than half of the people surveyed (56%) cited the taste of
Coca-Cola as something that makes them smile. 

"Coca-Cola provides simple moments of pleasure throughout the day. Through this
study we wanted to understand what else our consumers reach for in their quest
for happiness," said Cristina Bondolowski, Senior Global Brand Director,
Coca-Cola, The Coca-Cola Company. "We were especially pleased to see that it`s
the great taste of Coke that is still putting a smile on faces around the world,
as it has done for nearly 125 years."

&lt;p&gt;Metalogix StoragePoint is Certified for Use with EMC Centera
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Metalogix Software, the leading provider of solutions for Microsoft&#174; SharePoint&#174;
migration, BLOB management and archiving, today announced the release of their
EMC&#174;-certified Centera&#174; Storage Adapter for its StoragePoint product. 

Winner of Microsoft`s&#174; SharePoint&#174; 2010 Innovation award, Metalogix StoragePoint
enables organizations to keep unstructured content, also known as Binary Large
Objects (BLOBs), out of Microsoft SharePoint Server content databases and stores
them on EMC Centera. The combined Centera/StoragePoint solution enables
organizations that must comply with strict government and industry content
storage regulations to take full advantage of their SharePoint investment.
Installed and configured in minutes, StoragePoint also improves SharePoint
performance, scalability, manageability and security without sacrificing
functionality or affecting user productivity. 

"Our customers have been looking for an out-of-the-box solution to easily
connect EMC Centera storage to their SharePoint environments that`s simple to
administer and doesn`t impact system performance or functionality," said Mark
McLaughlin, EMC Director of ISV Alliances and Business Development. "With EMC
Centera and StoragePoint, customers can depend on safely storing and managing
all of their content to unprecedented levels with an integrated, highly-scalable
and cost-effective SharePoint storage solution." 

"Our certified EMC Centera adapter further extends our integration with the rest
of EMC`s storage platforms," said Chris Risley, Metalogix CEO. "With
StoragePoint, customers can utilize multiple levels or tiers of EMC Storage,
with virtually any mix of Centera, Atmos, or Celerra products leveraging the
most appropriate storage based on their particular performance, compliance or
budgetary requirements. StoragePoint`s integration with the full line of EMC
storage products also enables customers to leverage StoragePoint`s Archiving and
Hierarchical Storage Management capabilities that automatically move SharePoint
content to various EMC platforms based on its age, version or even changes in
metadata." 

StoragePoint software reduces the size of SharePoint content databases 90
percent or more by keeping Content (BLOBs) out of the database while retaining
only the metadata and BLOB reference in SQL Server. Compressed, encrypted or
both, the content is stored onto virtually any EMC storage platform.
StoragePoint adapters for EMC storage platforms are available through Metalogix.

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, May 11 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
www.ExplicitPennyPicks.com is a premier source for microcap research -
providing a wide range of due diligence and investment insight on stocks
all over the market. ExplicitPennyPicks.com's primary focus is to alert
our valued subscribers to small cap and microcap companies poised for
explosive movement in the market. As every investor knows, timing in the
market is critical! To receive our FREE comprehensive newsletter, please

    Today Explicit Penny Picks announces four stocks that we're watching
closely: Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), General Electric Company (GE), Microsoft
Corporation (MSFT), Sprint Nextel Corp. (S).

    After moving lower last week, Comcast and many other cable companies
appear rather cheap, but new government regulations could impact
long-term growth, according to some analysts. Energy Transfer Equity L.P.
said it would purchase 100% interest in Regency's general partner from an
affiliate of General Electric Financial Services. While Google has
sharpened up its look with a new interface, Microsoft has beefed up their
search offerings with content, including some traffic-generated
slideshows. Sprint Nextel Corp. confirmed monday that it's backing away
from making Google's Nexus One handset available on its network.

    At ExplicitPennyPicks.com we know that nothing speaks louder than the
success of our subscribers. In today's markets knowledge is more than
power, its money. This is why our team at ExplicitPennyPicks scours the
markets to keep our subscribers tuned in to undervalued stocks with
explosive potential. We focus mainly on microcap, small cap and penny
stock companies - companies that allow our investors to bring home big
profits. We work diligently and provide all investors - large or small -
an opportunity to track stocks with the potential to make big gains.

    We feel small cap companies have learned from the mistakes of large
wasteful companies. Small cap is responsible for new industries and
entrepreneurship's. They are nimble enough to not get caught up in long
term excessive spending.

    Join our FREE newsletter at www.ExplicitPennyPicks today and receive our
upcoming penny stock newsletter.

    ExplicitPennyPicks alerts investors to promising small cap companies,
most of which are overlooked by your run of the mill Wall Street
investment advisors. Since you do not need to have a million dollar
portfolio to benefit in the small cap market, many investors are
searching for credible micro and small cap investments due to the
enormous gains potential. While it's hard to find a $30.00 stock that
goes to $120.00, finding a micro or small cap stock that goes from $0.30
to $1.20 can be a weekly occurrence.

    While many of the other investment newsletters talk a big game, at
ExplicitPennyPicks we let our research do the talking! We invite you to

 It has been more than 10 years since the first Linux clusters arrived in the HPC market. The goal for early adopters was "just get it to work."

and technologies. The Israel Conference brings this into focus by featuring

financiers, venture capitalists, and industry innovators, to learn about the
technologies and applications of the most innovative Israeli companies. It`s a

companies.Familiar comments in the past have been 'I didn`t know that' about the
technology that has been invented and designed in Israel from chips to consumer
electronics.We are changing this refrain to be 'I know the founder.'This
familiarity will promote more interaction between business leaders and decision
makers, and that is the energy behind good deals," commented Sharona Justman,

&lt;p&gt;Site Celebrates "National Women`s Health Week,"

Helping Moms Make Their Own Health a Top Priority
NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In honor of National Women`s Health Week (May 9-15, 2010), Disney Family.com
announced today "Simple Steps to Healthy Families: Mom`s Health," a new resource
to empower women to put their health on the top of their "To Do" list.
Partnering with the American Heart Association`s Go Red For Women and City of
Hope, the site is filled with tips and advice to encourage everyone to make May
the "Month of Mom." Moms everywhere are invited to visit the site and learn
simple steps they can take to live a longer and healthier life. 

According to a recent online survey from Disney Family.com, moms shoulder the
burden of the health of their families with 77 percent of respondents reporting
they are charged with scheduling the family medical appointments and keeping the
family medical records. This often leads to women ignoring their own health
needs to care for those of their family. Seventy-two percent of women know it is
important to get a pap smear every year, but only 59 percent receive one.
Additionally, 68 percent of women are aware that they should receive a yearly
mammogram or a breast examination if they are under 40-years-old however, only
50 percent actually get the examination. In addition, only 56 percent of women
reported having their cholesterol checked and only 46 percent having their blood
sugar checked, two major risk factors for developing heart disease. 

"Many moms are aware of the tests they should be receiving annually, but this
knowledge doesn`t always correlate with what examinations they actually receive
every year," said Emily Smith, Vice President of the Disney Online Mom and
Family Portfolio. "We are pleased to offer a range of content with simple tips
and advice to help moms take care of their health." 

Additionally, in honor of "Month of Mom," Disney Family.com has partnered with
the American Heart Association`s Go Red For Women movement to aid moms in the
fight against women`s No. 1 and 3 killers - heart disease and stroke, and City
of Hope, one of the nation`s leading research and treatment centers in the fight
against the No. 2 killer - cancer. City of Hope maintains a specialized
multidisciplinary women`s cancer program to improve outcomes for women battling
breast and gynecological cancers. The Disney Family.com site features quick and
easy tips moms can do to decrease their risks of these top health threats. 

"Mothers are usually so focused on their families that they often forget about
themselves," said Emily Smith, Vice President of the Disney Online Mom and
Family Portfolio. "We are delighted to help women make their health a top
priority." 

Disney Family.com will include a list of necessary health screenings women need
annually and encourages moms to give back to their families during the month of
May by scheduling appointments such as:

* Gynecological Exam - Including a pap smear every year 
* Mammogram - It is recommended for women to have a mammogram every one to two
years starting at age 40 
* Dermatologist Visit - Know your family history and perform self examinations
for any mark in the skin for change or growth on a regular basis 
* Heart Health Check - Ask your healthcare professional to check your
cholesterol levels, blood pressure, glucose and body mass index beginning at age
20 
* Colorectal Cancer - Colonoscopy every 10 years, beginning at age 50

&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan`s Continued Leadership in Global Trade Helps China-Based Clients
Mitigate Foreign Exchange Risk and Streamline Cross-Border Payments
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--

&lt;p&gt;Go Fans Social Media Extension Aims to Enhance Fan`s FIFA World CupTM Experience
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), a FIFA partner and the exclusive card of the 2010 FIFA
World Cup&#8482;, today announced the launch of the Visa Match Planner, a social media
application that allows users to create customizable, dynamic FIFA World Cup&#8482;
viewing schedules to share with friends via social networking channels such as
Facebook (US - www.visagofans.com). The Visa Match Planner is the latest
extension of Visa`s first-ever global FIFA-themed marketing campaign, Go Fans,
which also includes print, television and out-of-home advertising, host market
merchant activation programs and usage promotions. 

The Visa Match Planner will be available in English, Japanese, Spanish and
Portuguese, and will be customized for each of the 32 qualified countries. In
addition to building a customized FIFA World Cup&#8482; match viewing schedule, the
application also lets users organize match viewing parties, chat with friends,
track scores and standings, and obtain exclusive offers from merchants such as
the "FIFA Official Store" on FIFA.com. 

"Football fans are undeniably passionate about the FIFA World Cup&#8482; and the teams
they follow and social media provides a unique platform to help them express
their views and connect with friends from around the world," said Antonio Lucio,
Chief Marketing Officer of Visa Inc. "Through dynamic social media extensions of
the Go Fans campaign, like the Visa Match Planner, Visa is able to strengthen
our connection to the FIFA World Cup&#8482; and enhance every fan`s World Cup
experience with engaging content." 

First debuted in Latin America in 2009 and later introduced globally in February
2010, the Go Fans campaign celebrates the common love that all fans have for
football with creative executions, featuring the colors of the national flags of
each of the 32 qualified countries, symbolizing the expression of each fan`s
true colors and love of country. The campaign reinforces the ways that Visa
enables fans to express their true colors in support of their teams by offering
an easier way to pay, their Visa card. 

Go Fans was developed to connect with football fans worldwide to drive
preference for and usage of Visa products, promote Visa`s association with the
2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa&#8482; and reinforce the ways in which Visa enhances
the fan`s FIFA World Cup&#8482; experience. Today, more than 90 markets throughout the
world are activating Visa FIFA-themed marketing programs with more than 500
financial institutions and merchants via advertising, customized promotions and
the development of marketing collateral (POS, signage and direct mail). 

FIFA World Cup Sponsorship Activation

In the lead up to the FIFA World Cup, Visa provides financial institutions and
merchant partners throughout the world with FIFA-themed creative and marketing
materials to enhance their card-marketing efforts, help drive business and
achieve corporate brand objectives. 

Visa is one of six global FIFA partners with exclusive global category rights
through 2014, and is the exclusive card for the 2010 FIFA World Cup&#8482;. In
recognition of Visa`s sponsorship of the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa&#8482;, Visa
credit, debit and prepaid cards are the only payment cards accepted, along with
cash, at all FIFA stadiums and the Onsite Stadium Merchandise Booths. The
partnership provides Visa with global rights in the Financial Services product
category to all FIFA World Cup&#8482; activities, many of which may be activated by
financial institution clients and merchant partners. Visa`s FIFA sponsorship
includes the rights to the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa&#8482;, the FIFA Women`s
World Cup Germany 2011&#8482; and the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil&#8482;. 

Visa cardholders are reminded to contact their issuing banks before leaving for
South Africa to alert them of their travel plans and purchases in another
country. This will ensure their banks will not temporarily freeze their accounts
as an anti-fraud measure. Cardholders should also ask about daily withdrawal
limits, ATM fees and emergency phone numbers. Travelers to the 2010 FIFA World
Cup South Africa&#8482; who do not have a Visa card should contact their banks or go
to www.visa.com/globalgateway for additional information on how to obtain a Visa
card in their country.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, May 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Recommind, the leader in search-powered information risk management,
today announced the availability of MindServer Search(TM) 7.0, the latest
version of its flagship enterprise search product. By enhancing the
reach, accuracy and overall functionality of the industry's most powerful
enterprise search platform, Recommind is enabling enterprises to deliver
more relevant search results to their information workers and maximize
investments in tools such as Microsoft SharePoint. 

    Built on Recommind's powerful CORE(TM) platform (Context Optimized
Relevancy Engine), MindServer Search 7.0 adds powerful new Web 2.0
collaborative features such as social tagging, delivery of content via
RSS, a brand new Web-based administration client designed to simplify
maintenance and accelerate deployments and an intuitive and more easily
customizable user interface. MindServer Search 7.0 supports search for
content in SharePoint 2003, 2007 and 2010, enabling greater ROI out of
current and planned SharePoint investments. 

    As adoption and usage of SharePoint increases globally, the need to
augment the platform with powerful search technology is paramount. When
implemented independently of each other, both SharePoint and MindServer
Search provide enormous benefits to the enterprise from a collaboration
and information-access perspective. When the solutions are combined --
MindServer Search integrates seamlessly with every leading content
management system -- enterprises can make all their data sources,
regardless of location, language or file type, searchable and shareable
from one central location. 

    "Many search platforms oversimplify our information-access challenge.
What sets Recommind's CORE Platform apart is its ability to respect the
relationship between the multiple dimensions of our information: the
text, the people involved and the related project or matter -- which sets
the context around the information," said Oz Benamram, Chief Knowledge
Officer, White &amp; Case LLP. "The latest version of MindServer Search shows
Recommind's commitment to delivering an enterprise search product that
evolves along with our growing information access needs. Not only has
Recommind increased the overall functionality of the core platform, but
they will enable us to drive more value out of our investment in tools
like SharePoint and our knowledge repositories." 

    In addition to improving the overall reach of SharePoint, MindServer
Search 7.0 provides customers with several next-generation features.
Shared tagging allows comments on results to be made available to other
search users. Users can set their RSS aggregator clients to regularly
send queries to MindServer Search and receive results back in RSS format.
A newly redesigned search UI provides a more intuitive navigation
experience for users and a restructured framework so that MindServer
Search can be completely rebranded and customized as needed. Additional
enhancements include a new administration console and a relevancy console
with enhanced tuning and reporting capabilities. 

    "More and more organizations are switching to Recommind because they see
the value of adding advanced search technology to the applications they
use every day," said Robert Tennant, CEO, Recommind. "Recommind's
innovative search-powered solutions help users find content in context,
whether they're managing millions of transactions a day in a B2B online
retail environment or analyzing documents under urgent eDiscovery
deadlines. Our deep search experience is built into the core of all our
products. It's what keeps Recommind customers ahead of the competition." 

    MindServer Search 7.0 is built on Recommind's CORE platform, a fully
automated information management layer which seamlessly and securely
integrates structured and unstructured data inside and outside of
enterprise networks. The CORE platform dramatically improves access to a
wide variety of information across large, distributed enterprises and
returns results in context for more accurate understanding and
"actionability" of the information. CORE uses powerful concept-based
search technology to connect relevant information in document management,
records management, portal and e-mail systems and myriad other
applications and databases with the users who need it.

Corporation in the US and other countries.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has launched the newest versions of its Microsoft Office and Microsoft SharePoint software packages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Business Division president Stephen Elop spoke before a packed studio at the famed NBC Studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York, the room where "Saturday Night Live" is broadcast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a moment of fundamental change and there are a lot of reasons for this," Elop said, noting that organizations have tighter budgets and a more mobile workforce. Office 2010 and SharePoint 2010 have been designed to meet these challenges, he said. "The 2010 products represent an epic release for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NBC location seemed fitting and not just because the weather was cloudy outside: As mass media kingpin NBC finds itself both battling with and trying to adopt new forms of media, so too must Microsoft position its software packages as an essential part of office life while buzz steadily builds around new-fangled cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft itself plans to offer hosted online versions of Office 2010, called Office Web Apps, later on this summer. The stand-alone software versions are available to businesses today. Elop noted that the software can be run either in-house or from the cloud and mobile versions for the Windows 6.5 and Windows 7 platforms will be available as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview following the launch, Kurt DelBene, senior vice president of the office business productivity group of the Microsoft Business Division, further clarified Microsoft's approach to bringing Office 2010 to the cloud. The new version of SharePoint features the Web versions of the Office suite. When Office 2010 is released to consumers next month, Windows Live will run Web-based versions of the office software, as part of the company's SkyDive service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft does not see these cloud offerings as a replacement for the PC software. "We anticipate people will use a combination of the rich clients and the Web clients," DelBene said. The online versions will be geared toward tasks best done online, such as collaborative editing, but the PC software will be where people will continue to go to create documents, spreadsheets, and PowerPoint decks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, a bulk of the day's launch focused on new features, the kind that online offerings, such as Google Docs, can't yet match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And these new features with Office 2010 and SharePoint 2010 are more than fancy trim, Elop argued. They will also help organizations save valuable time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working on behalf of Microsoft, IT analyst firm Forrester estimated that a 7,000 employee knowledge-worker focused business would save US$7 million a year upgrading to Microsoft Office 2010. The savings would come from the many time-saving features the suite has, explained Rob Koplowitz, principal analyst, Forrester Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, one new feature, co-authoring, would save this large organization $3 million alone, with its ability to allow multiple people to work on the same document at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop said the new software will make workers so much more productive that it would pay for itself within a year. The software would offer the equivalent of two extra work weeks of work per employee per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft 2010 certainly has a bevy of new features, all aimed at greater efficiency and productivity. Perhaps most notably, the Outlook e-mail client has been revamped with more powerful management capabilities, such as the ability to handle threaded conversations. It also has what is called a Social Connector, or the ability to fuse social data from LinkedIn and Facebook. PowerPoint can now be used to make presentations viewable on the Internet. The ribbon interface has been streamlined and has been applied to all applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suite also includes, for the first time, Microsoft's note-taking program, OneNote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this package, Microsoft has clearly taken a strong look at usability. Office now has something called "Paste Preview" which, as the name states, shows the user what the document would look like with the newly pasted item. It came about because Microsoft noticed that the feature most used after paste is undo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a collaboration platform, SharePoint 2010 has been upgraded to provide more robust enterprise deployments. Site editing has been made easier. Data can be tagged and aggregated. A new set of community features allows users to share data as they do on Twitter and Facebook. And the software features better integration both with the company's Fast search engine as well as PerformancePoint, which is Microsoft's business intelligence software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop noted that 8.6 million people have already tried the Office 2010 beta versions, which is more than three times the number of users who tried the Office 2007 beta. The company expects that Office 2010 will eventually have over 90 million business customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One aspect in the presentation that wasn't discussed in detail, however, was discussion of putting Office online, as a hosted service. That will happen later this year. The company plans to offer virtually all the features of the products as a cloud offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one company, namely Google, has been making the most with Microsoft's seeming tardiness in providing Microsoft Office applications as a cloud offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the days leading up to Wednesday's launch, Google executives have been talking extensively with the press about its online office offering, Google Docs, as well as how Microsoft is behind Google in terms of offering office productivity functionality in the cloud.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Google's online offerings do not have the richness of features of Office -- admitted Google product manager Jonathan Rochelle in an interview with IDG -- the advantage of using cloud-based software comes with its own benefits, such as faster updates, deeper integration and better collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Docs really is a single app that acts as a series of apps, which is very different from what Office is," Rochelle said, explaining that Office is a set of applications, each with rich functionality, but not really designed to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rochelle said that Google Docs offers many of the features, such as multiperson editing, that Office 2010 provides, eliminating the need for current Office users to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't want customers to think they have to go to Office 2010, because they can use Docs for collaboration," Rochelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Google Sites can be used as a low-cost, easy-to-deploy, alternative to SharePoint, Rochelle said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Office still holds the lion's share of the market for office productivity suites. A July 2009 survey from IT research firm IDC found that approximately 97 percent of the respondents said that at least one version of Microsoft Office is used in their organizations. But Google is gaining ground, the same survey found that 19.5 percent of respondents were in organizations that used Google Docs in some form, up from 5.8 percent a year prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDC principal analyst Melinda-Carol Ballou, who attended the event, said that these releases are significant ones, though she felt the presentations did not divulge enough detail about how developers could extend the functionality of these programs, particularly through tools such as Microsoft Project 2010 and Visual Studio 2010. "Software innovation underlies business innovation. New integration across Project portfolio and life cycle across those products and with SharePoint is key and was not discussed as part of the launch event," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joab Jackson can be reached at joab_jackson@idg.com, or via Twitter at @joab_jackson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has gone on the counterattack against Google, saying that its rival's online applications don't cut it as supplements to Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a lengthy blog post late yesterday, Alex Payne, director of Microsoft's online product management team, took on a recent Google sales pitch, which urged Office users to put off upgrading to the new Office 2010, and instead add Google Docs as an online complement to older editions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier Tuesday, Matthew Glotzbach, Google's enterprise product management director, made a direct appeal to the millions of corporate workers who rely on Microsoft's Office. "If you're considering upgrading Office with Office, we'd encourage you to consider an alternative: upgrading Office with Google Docs," said Glotzbach. "You probably already own Office 2003 or 2007 (or maybe Office 2000), and there's no need to uninstall them. Fortunately, Google Docs also makes Office 2003 and 2007 better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had a problem with that pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are claiming that an organization can use both [Office and Google Docs] seamlessly," said Payne. "This just isn't the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payne claimed that file conversions between Office documents and Google Docs were far from flawless. "Charts, styles, watermarks, fonts, tracked changes, SmartArt, etc. (can be a pretty long list) might be gone or manipulated in a way resulting in something that doesn't look like it did before conversion," Payne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving between Office's document formats and Google Docs' formats means that users will lose components and formatting, Payne continued. "When that file was originally converted from Office to Google Docs, you lost those components," he said. "They aren't coming back just because you are in Office again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payne said Microsoft's cloud-based versions of Office programs -- dubbed Office Web Apps -- provide "higher fidelity" that insures elements that don't appear online aren't lost when they return to the desktop. "We call this 'round-tripping' and we think it's important," Payne said. "Google Docs simply doesn't do this when you use it with Office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's original pitch, as well as Microsoft's rebuttal, were coordinated with the official launch today of Office 2010 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheri McLeish, an analyst with Forrester Research, said her survey of more than 100 large enterprises showed that companies will be unlikely to bite on Google's plug for Docs. "It was pretty evident that businesses are much more comfortable using Microsoft Office," she said today. "Most are just not willing to take the risk involving a significant change, like going with an alternate tool such as Google's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean companies aren't evaluating Office alternatives, ranging from OpenOffice.org to Google Docs, or in some cases even supporting them for limited numbers of users. "But at the end of the day, they're deciding to re-up with Microsoft [Office 2010]," McLeish said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, Google sees it differently. In a recent interview with Computerworld, Dave Girouard, president of Google's enterprise division, acknowledged that some will stick with Microsoft. "But those people will fall further and further behind," he argued. "Microsoft will have to drag the past along with them. They have an enormous economic model to deal with, and that will hurt them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the downsides to Google Docs, McLeish noted, is an inability to work offline, a feature that Google pulled when it began a transition from the now-defunct Google Gears -- the technology that powered offline access -- to browser-based technologies like HTML5. Google has said it will restore offline access at some point, put hasn't set a timetable for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People still need offline access to their documents," McLeish said. "You can't always be at a [Internet] connection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The spandex-clad "Power Rangers" are returning to the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Haim Saban's Saban Capital Group said on Wednesday it has bought back the "Power Rangers" children's franchise from Walt Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers" became a ratings success when Saban developed and launched the show in 1993. Disney bought the franchise in 2001 as part of its acquisition of Fox Family Worldwide, a company Saban co-owned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saban Capital Group declined to say how much it paid for the "Power Rangers," but said the franchise's licensed toys and other products and promotions have generated more than $5 billion worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saban Capital Group's acquisition of the "Power Rangers" marks its first purchase since its announcement last week that it formed a new unit called Saban Brands LLC, with more than $500 million to buy brands that resonate with consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saban Brands will manage and license "Power Rangers" and it has reached a deal with children's cable network, Nickelodeon, to air reruns of the series later this year. Under the deal, a new season will be created to air next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elie Dekel, managing director and head of Saban Brands, told Reuters the unit still has plenty of capital left for future acquisitions, which he said could be in the same vein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say that we would certainly be open to other brands in the children's area. It's a strong suit for us," Dekel added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Analysts cite strength in studio and weakness at ABC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Disney shares fall 1.76 pct day after earnings report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alex Dobuzinskis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, May 12 (Reuters) - Shares in Walt Disney Co
(DIS.N), which is coming off a better-than-expected quarter,
may have room to climb further on the back of blockbuster films
and a steady recovery in theme park spending, but some analysts
warn that weakness in TV may hurt in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many analysts on Wednesday maintained positive outlooks for
Disney a day after the company reported a 55 percent rise in
net income, beating Wall Street expectations. [nN11225225]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STUNNING FILM PIPELINE...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's hit movies helped drive results, and some analysts
expect that trend to continue with several films from proven
franchises -- "Toy Story 3" and "Prince of Persia" among them
-- set to bolster its coming quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The studio pipeline is just absolutely outstanding," said
David Miller, analyst with Caris  Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's upcoming films also include "TRON: Legacy" in
December and "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" in
summer 2011, and analysts view all those releases as having
strong box office potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is already riding high with "Iron Man 2," which
has made nearly $333 million at worldwide box offices since it
opened two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miller, who rates Disney "above average" with a share price
target of $39, also singled out the company's ESPN sports cable
television unit as driving growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Live sports is largely immune from viewers taping a
telecast on their DVR devices and skipping through
advertisements -- known as zipping -- a phenomenon other
broadcasters struggle to avoid, he argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Barclays Capital, rates
Disney "overweight" and expects the company's theme parks and
resorts division to post 15 percent growth in operating income
next fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ...BUT WILTING TV BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, shares in Disney slid more than 3 percent in
after hours trade as investors were wary about
lower-than-expected revenue at ABC due to slipping ratings and
ad revenue. The media division, which includes ESPN, is the
largest in terms of revenue and profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While revenue in the TV and broadcasting division rose 6
percent in the fiscal second quarter, operating income was flat
at $1.3 billion -- lagging expectations for about $1.43
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In terms of broadcasting alone -- which excludes cable
businesses such as ESPN -- operating income fell $39 million to
$123 million as costs at ABC whittled down margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hamilton Faber, an analyst with Atlantic Equities, rates
Disney as underweight. He said that with cable subscribers
paying a hefty $4 a month for ESPN, that solidly performing
unit nonetheless has little room for more subscriber price
increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other analysts say the figure is closer to $3 a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They're having to find a new stable of hits to replace the
ones that are beginning to mature like 'Grey's Anatomy,'
'Desperate Housewives' and 'Lost,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares closed down 1.8 percent at $35.13 on
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;While Google Apps may not be a knockout threat to Microsoft's enterprise business this year, a cloud apps battle continues to brew between the two companies. Google and Microsoft are the forerunners in this competition, but other rivalsare nipping on their heels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick look at IBM's Lotus Symphony and Lotus Live, Zoho's suite of cloud apps and OpenOffice.org's offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lotus Symphony&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lotus Symphony, a set of free productivity tools, includes documents, spreadsheets and presentations. Because it is based on the Open Document Format standard, you're not locked into proprietary file formats, software licensing agreements and upgrades. Unlike Google Docs, however, your files are saved on your desktop--not in the cloud--thus they're only available to you from your computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[For more, check out CIO.com's cloud app bible:"Cloud App Wars: Microsoft vs. Google."]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lotus Symphony's Documents, Spreadsheets and Presentations tools each include many features similar to what you'd see in Google Docs or Microsoft Office. It also supports a variety of file formats and has the ability to export documents to PDFs for sharing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LotusLive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LotusLive is IBM's suite of online collaboration and social networking services--similar to the Google Apps suite--for your business, hosted in the cloud. Of the six tools included in the suite, you can pick and choose which ones you'd like to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LotusLive Meetings lets you give presentations to up to 1,000 guests via the Web. Pricing ranges from $6 to $39 per month, per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LotusLive Events helps you manage events registrations; host your event and follow up with post-event analysis; e-mail reminders generate automatically. Pricing starts at $79 per month, per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LotusLive Connections is part address book, part real-time collaboration tool. You can store and share documents, presentations, bookmarks and content collections; track a meeting to-do list; brainstorm ideas; and talk with business contacts and colleagues via instant messaging. LotusLive Connections starts at $6 per month, per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lotus Engage, is an integrated suite of collaboration tools, that combines your social network with Web conferencing and collaboration capabilities (storing and sharing, instant messaging and activity management). Pricing ranges from $8 to $46 per month, per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LotusLive Notes,a hosted e-mail solution for businesses, includes customizable widgets that can recognize specific patterns of text in Lotus Notes documents and security features. Web-based e-mail starts at $9 per month, per user. Note that there is a 1,000 user purchase requirement per company for the initial purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LotusLive iNotes is a Web-based version of Notes. Pricing starts at $3 per month, per user. You can also choose to bundle LotusLive Connections and LotusLive iNotes for $7 per month, per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoho has an extensive suite of productivity and business applications--more than 20 in total. Some of these apps are free for public use, while others charge a subscription fee for businesses. When you use a Zoho application, your documents and data are stored online on Zoho's servers. These servers, Zoho says, are located in secure data centers with multiple levels of restrictions for access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Zoho's tools include: e-mail, a word processor, spreadsheets, a presentation tool, a note-taker tool, wiki, instant messenger, a CRM solution, project management software, an invoicing tool, an online reporting and business intelligence tool, a meeting scheduler and Zoho Marketplace, which is similar to the Google Apps Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can pick and choose the apps you want to use; they range in price for businesses from $3 per month to $175 per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoho also offers a platform called Zoho Business. This online platform aggregates a number of Zoho applications into one dashboard, so users can manage the services to which they have subscribed, as well view all documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenOffice.org is a free, cloud-based open-source project sponsored by Oracle. Because it is open-source, anyone can suggest improvements, fix bugs, report problems or request enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenOffice.org has a similar feel to Microsoft Office, and can read most file formats. It has six tools: Writer, its word processor; Calc, a spreadsheet tool; Impress, its presentation tool; Draw; Base, which lets you manipulate databases; and Math, which lets you create mathematical equations with a graphic user interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot pick and choose which tools you want to download individually; they are all installed in one operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff Writer Kristin Burnham covers consumer Web and social technologies for CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - In the movie "Ironman 2," Larry Ellison makes a cameo appearance as a billionaire, playboy software magnate. It is a role he knows well. He is playing himself -- chief executive of Oracle Corp, one of Silicon Valley's most enduring, successful and flamboyant figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 65, he is undertaking one of the biggest challenges of his career, and it's not playing Hamlet on Broadway. Oracle, the company Ellison founded three decades ago and built into dominant force in the software industry, is making a go at hardware with the acquisition of money-losing Sun Microsystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not entirely unlike MIT deciding to field a competitive football team, but Ellison being Ellison, he could not be less worried. "We have a wealth of technology to package into systems," said Ellison, who won the America's Cup in February. "I see no reason why we can't get this to where Sun under Oracle should be larger than Sun ever was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rare interview he discussed his turnaround efforts at Sun so far, revealed plans to purchase additional hardware companies and detailed new products that will launch in the near future. And he did so with his usual in-your-face style -- heaping all manner of abuse, for example, on Sun's previous managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 1990s, Sun prospered by selling high-end computers at top dollar to large corporations and dot-com start-ups. Its business peaked in 2001, then slid with the collapse of the Internet boom and never recovered, though the company is still widely respected for its technological prowess and the brain power of its engineering staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun came into play in November 2008 after IBM CEO Sam Palmisano made an overture to buy it. Oracle, which had been strictly a software maker, unexpectedly jumped in to outbid IBM by just 10 cents a share, paying a total of $5.6 billion in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Ellison says he is going to rebuild Sun's hardware business by using a strategy that helped IBM prosper in the 1960s: Selling computer systems built with standardized bundles of hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of skeptics doubt Ellison can pull it off. Sun lost $2.2 billion in its last fiscal year as an independent company. Conventional wisdom holds that he will end up divesting the company's hardware business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison has a pretty good track record when it comes to predicting where the industry is headed. Besides innovating the wildly lucrative relational database that bears Oracle's name, Ellison was quicker than most in creating software that works with both Internet technology and the widely used Linux operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also started buying up smaller software makers in 2003 when critics said his consolidation strategy was doomed to fail. It hasn't. "People have lost a lot of money second guessing Larry about IT strategy," said Dave Roux, co-founder of Silver Lake, the world's biggest private equity firm focused on technology, in which Ellison was an original investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's a very thoughtful and reasoned observer of the big tectonic forces that kind of go rippling through the industry," said Roux, who worked for Oracle before setting up Silver Lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison has maintained his status as the leader of a powerhouse in the topsy-turvy, protean technology world. IBM, which pioneered business computers, nearly collapsed in the 1990s, but then recovered as it aggressively expanded in services and software. Ellison's close friend Apple's Steve Jobs, was forced out of Apple, only to return a decade later to resurrect his company with the iPod. Meanwhile, Google has replaced Microsoft as the 'ubertech company' and occasional villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although his products are used by businesses only and not nearly as recognizable as Apple's Macs or Google's search engine, they've made Ellison the world's sixth-richest man, worth an estimated $28 billion, according to Forbes. Oracle counts the bulk of the world's major corporations as customers, and the company's market value now tops that of Hewlett-Packard, the world's top maker of personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STARING AT SUN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison says he has already stopped the carnage at Sun, less than four months after the sale closed in January. "Their management made some very bad decisions that damaged their business and allowed us to buy them for a bargain price," he told Reuters. He added that he expects profit from Sun's operations to boost Oracle's earnings in the current quarter, which ends May 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration has proceeded swiftly, says Ellison, because a protracted antitrust review in Europe gave Oracle time to draw up an exhaustive plan for resuscitating Sun. In typical Ellison fashion, he took a hands-on approach to the integration, choosing to meet directly with technical managers at Sun as often as four days a week to diagnose its problems, rather than delegating the work to underlings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Barrenechea, a former Oracle executive who used to sit in on weekly engineering meetings with Ellison and is now CEO of specialty computer maker Silicon Graphics International Corp., says this is what Ellison does best. "He doesn't write the code. He doesn't solder resisters onto motherboards. But he understands how all the pieces fit together and how he wants the building to look," said Barrenechea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ellison started scrutinizing Sun, he says he found plenty wrong: lots of waste among the billions of dollars that had gone into RD in recent years. The hardware maker had cut back the sales staff that sold its most profitable products, including its business computers and storage equipment, causing sales and earnings to decline. It operated an antiquated manufacturing and distribution system. It regularly sold hardware and software at a loss, sometimes losing more than $1 million on a single deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oracle is much more disciplined on the financial side. Much more detail oriented," said John Fowler, head of Oracle's new hardware division and the most senior Sun manager to survive the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison says he learned that Sun's pony-tailed chief executive, Jonathan Schwartz, ignored problems as they escalated, made poor strategic decisions and spent too much time working on his blog, which Sun translated into 11 languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The underlying engineering teams are so good, but the direction they got was so astonishingly bad that even they couldn't succeed," said Ellison. "Really great blogs do not take the place of great microprocessors. Great blogs do not replace great software. Lots and lots of blogs does not replace lots and lots of sales."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz declined comment as did Sun co-founder and former Chairman Scott McNealy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start, Ellison shut down one of Schwartz's pet projects -- development of the "Rock" microprocessor for Sun's high-end SPARC server line, a semiconductor that had struggled in development for five years as engineers sought to overcome a string of technical problems. "This processor had two incredible virtues: It was incredibly slow and it consumed vast amounts of energy. It was so hot that they had to put about 12 inches of cooling fans on top of it to cool the processor," said Ellison. "It was just madness to continue that project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More infuriating, says Ellison, is that Sun routinely sold equipment at a loss because it was more focused on boosting revenue than generating profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sales staff was compensated based on deal size, not profit. So the commission on a $1 million sale that generated $500,000 in profit was the same as one that cost the company $100,000, he said. "The sales force could care less if they sold things that lost money because the commission was the same in either case," he said. Ellison added that Sun also lost money when it resold high-end storage equipment from Hitachi Ltd, storage software from Symantec Corp and consulting services from other companies. Oracle is ending those deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison has been pruning Sun's line of low-end servers, an area where it lost money as it tried to compete in volume with market leaders Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Corp. Sun never gained enough share to make it price competitive, but Ellison says that Sun became so desperate to goose the unit's revenue the company would pay a fortune to charter planes during the last two days of a quarter so that it could book extra sales for the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REORG OF A SALES FORCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Sun outsourced much of its sales, counting on resellers to promote its products. That's anathema at Oracle, which employs 22,000 salespeople and 11,000 software consultants who work directly with its largest customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One casualty of that strategy was StorageTek, a maker of tape storage systems for mainframe computers, which Sun bought for $4 billion in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Astonishingly they laid off all the sales people and they laid off all the field service people. They just got rid of them all," he said. "Guess what? Sales dropped. It's breathtaking!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result: Sun went from being tied with IBM as the market leader in 2005 to No. 2 in 2009, when its $474 million in sales were about half those of IBM, according to data from IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day the acquisition closed, Oracle advertised openings for some 2,000 hardware sales reps, which would almost double Sun's previous sales force of 3,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have their work cut out. Sun's share of the server and storage markets slipped last year as the company's pending sale raised uncertainty about its future. It slid from second to third place last year in the $13 billion UNIX server market behind IBM and HP, while sales of its storage gear plunged 27 percent, according to IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Ellison is looking to win back customers by boosting investment in Sun's key technologies -- including the SPARC microprocessor chip, the brain of its elite server line; the Solaris operating system that runs those computers, and the MySQL database as well as the widely used Java computer language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's picking the Sun technologies that are commercializable and focusing on those, and ignoring those that are not. They are just science projects," said Ellison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LESSONS LEARNED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he enters the hardware business, Ellison is looking to repeat the success he had with his last big strategy shift -- an acquisition spree that began in June 2003 with a hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft, a maker of programs for managing human resources. Prior to that, Ellison was known to mock advisers who recommended that he consider acquisitions, saying "we write software, we don't write checks." But he changed gears after more than a decade of unsuccessful attempts to design his own business management software, an area where Germany's SAP AG was rapidly consolidating its lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time there were few examples of successful acquisitions in the software industry, let alone hostile deals, but the purchase proved a winner, and Oracle has since spent more than $35 billion buying some five dozen software makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said it's going to get harder and harder to build on our business because we have such a large market share. When everybody else was standing on the sidelines, he went deep and he went long," said Howard Anderson, a lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle quickly cuts duplicate costs and waste at a newly acquired company, boosting its margins and absorbing its technologies. Meanwhile it cross sells its vast line of business software to an acquired firm's existing customers while generating revenue from maintenance services for the programs they already use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders have benefited. Oracle's stock price has nearly doubled since Ellison began his shopping spree, compared with a 21 percent gain in the SP 500 Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEAL TIME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison said he will expand further in hardware, adding providers of semiconductor, storage and server technologies to his list of acquisition targets. "We'll buy in all areas of our business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is looking for technologies he can incorporate into what Oracle is betting will be its next line of blockbuster products: gigantic appliances made up of servers, storage equipment, networking gear and software working together to handle specialized tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything is tweaked at the factory for optimal performance in the data center. "We don't want customers making those decisions. They never quite tune it the way we would," said Oracle President Charles Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach traces back to Ellison's strategy for building his software business. He has spent two decades telling customers that they should buy pre-integrated software business management suites from Oracle, rather than dealing with myriad vendors. His mantra: best of breed is good for dog shows, but not software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where we think we'll make our money -- where we think we're able to differentiate ourselves from IBM and everybody else -- is by building complete and integrated systems from silicon all the way up through the software, all prepackaged together," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His first appliance was developed as engineers found that hardware bottlenecks slowed the pace at which computers could process information stored in Oracle's database software. So the company forged a deal with Hewlett-Packard to jointly develop an appliance known as the Exadata database machine, whose chief components were Oracle's database software and an HP x86 server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison introduced that first appliance in 2008 with the intention of developing other machines with HP. But when Oracle had a chance to buy Sun, Ellison ditched HP and entered the hardware business on his own. Last year he unveiled Exadata, version 2, based on Sun technology, which he says initially has nearly $1 billion in potential sales and will likely have annual sales measured in the billions of dollars within a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine costs more than $1 million, stands over 6 feet tall, is two feet wide and weighs a full ton. It is capable of storing vast quantities of data, allowing businesses to analyze information at lightening fast speeds or instantly process commercial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rivals remain unimpressed. They say that Exadata does not provide customers enough flexibility to customize the systems to meet their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's got a very narrow band of applicability. It's a one trick pony that has no ability to integrate," said Dave Gelardi, vice president of systems strategy at IBM, which sells more than 20 types of computer systems optimized for specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also has the world's largest technology services organization, which generates billions of dollars a year in fees by helping companies build customized systems. "We don't say 'The answer is Exadata. What's the question?' We operate from the perspective 'What is the business problem you are trying to solve?'" says Gelardi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard and Dell followed IBM's example of building a large services organization over the past two years with their acquisitions of EDS and Perot Systems. Ellison says he's not going down that path. While Oracle will maintain a relatively small force of consultants, his strategy is to do most of the integration work in the factory, based on the Exadata model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE NEXT STEP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He plans to unveil at least two new appliances in September, when the company holds its annual Oracle World customer conference in San Francisco, a gathering that had some 40,000 attendees last year, making it the world's biggest tech users conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine that will likely get the most attention is one that will run Oracle's yet-to-be-released next-generation suite of business management programs, dubbed Fusion Apps, which will compete with SAP's existing software line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That appliance will include servers, networking equipment and storage gear along with a database, middleware and the Fusion Apps programs. Oracle has spent five years and billions of dollars developing the software, which helps businesses manage accounting, human resources, sales and marketing as well as more specialized tasks for companies in industries including financial services, telecommunications, healthcare and retailing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison says he will also show off an appliance that runs Oracle's so-called middleware -- the plumbing of a data center's software network, performing tasks such as helping various computer systems communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His key rival in this area, too, is IBM. And that fight won't be easy -- or short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ellison says he expects to see it through and has no plans to leave Oracle any time soon. "They may kick me out, but I have no plans to retire," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Jim Impoco, Ted Kerr and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban folk singer Silvio Rodriguez, considered the voice of the Cuban revolution, has received a U.S. visa and is to perform a concert at New York's Carnegie Hall on June 4, his American attorney said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyer Bill Martinez told Reuters in a telephone interview from San Franciso, California the visa was approved by U.S. officials on Tuesday and is long enough to permit Rodriguez to play concerts in other U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez, 63, is the latest Cuban performer to be allowed into United States, which had routinely denied such visas under former President George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of Rodriguez's songs extol the Cuban revolution that brought Fidel Castro in power in 1959, but others also lightly criticize the communist-led society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez recently told reporters in Havana that Cuba is "crying out for a revision of many things ... from concepts to institutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Cuba relations have improved slightly under President Barack Obama, who eased the 48-year-old U.S. embargo against the island by lifting restrictions on visits by Cuban Americans to their homeland and permitting more cultural exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuban ballet legend Alicia Alonso, 89, is scheduled to be honored next month at the American Ballet Theater in New York where she performed early in her career. U.S. group Kool and the Gang put on a concert in Havana in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez, who has not performed in the United States for three decades, sought a visa a year ago to join in a New York concert for the 90th birthday of folk singer Pete Seeger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the visa was not approved in time for him to make the trip, which prompted an angry letter from Rodriguez published in Cuba's state-run media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I continue feeling so blocked and discriminated against, just like by other (U.S.) governments," he said. "I hope this really changes some day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez said U.S. officials in Havana had extended a helping hand to Rodriguez this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cultural exchanges are only a small step forward in relations between the United States and Cuba, "it will have to do for now," Martinez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Chris Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Disney Beats Despite ABC Losses

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) kept its string of moderate positive
surprises intact today when it reported fiscal 2nd quarter 2010 earnings after
the bell. The household-name media conglomerate brought in net income of $953
million, or 48 cents per share -- 6.67% higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate
of 45 cents. Year over year, Disney improved from 43 cents per share. 

Disney posted 7% growth in its Studio Entertainment business, citing impressive
box office with its big opening of Alice in Wonderland and recently released
Iron Man 2's strong showing (a direct product of Disney's acquisition of Marvel
Entertainment). But while Cable Networks, Parks and Resorts, Consumer Products
and Interactive Media all posted gains, its Broadcasting wing, notably ABC
Television and ABC Studios, fell 31.7% in the quarter. Drops in primetime and
news advertising revenue were to blame, along with rising production costs. 

Analysts had been modestly optimistic leading up to the 2Q10 report. Five of 24
analysts covering Disney had raised earnings estimates for the quarter in the
past 30 days, though 2 analysts also revised downward. The 45 cents per share
expectation had effectively been unchanged for the entire quarter. 

Looking out to fiscal 2010 and 2011 (ending September), analysts are apparently
a bit more positive. Five analysts had upwardly revised fiscal 2010 numbers in
the past month, and 6 analysts have done so for fiscal 2011 over the same time
period. 

It has been a mixed bag for media conglomerates this earnings season. While
Disney rival Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) beat EPS expectations by 27% last week,
Viacom (NYSE: VIA.B) came up 30% short when it posted earnings in late April. 

AIG, Prudential to Revise Deal?

According to the Financial Times, American International Group Inc. (NYSE: AIG)
and Prudential Plc. (NYSE: PUK) are discussing a restructuring of their $35.5
billion deal for AIG`s Asian life insurance unit, American International
Assurance ("AIA"). 

This revision could lead to a $2 billion cut in the cash consideration. The
discussion takes place following U.K. regulators' concerns over the capital
position of Prudential, post acquisition. 

As per the original deal announced in early March this year, AIG agreed to sell
AIA to Prudential for about $35.5 billion. This included approximately $25
billion in cash, $8.5 billion in face value of equity and equity-linked
securities, and $2.0 billion in face value of preferred stock of Prudential,
subject to closing adjustments. The cash proceeds would be used to repay the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which rescued AIG from collapsing in 2008. 

However, last week, Prudential postponed its $21 billion rights issue offering
for financing the AIA deal over concerns of its capital position by the
regulators, which fell short of their requirements. 

Prudential initially planned for a $5 billion senior debt offering for this
deal. However, following the regulators` concern, the company is considering a
restructuring of the debt offering. The company is now planning to issue a part
of this amount as hybrid securities, which would be considered for calculating
its capital base. 

The restructuring of the AIA deal that AIG and Prudential are now considering
would end in AIG receiving around $2 billion less in cash and a subscription for
the hybrid securities of Prudential.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has launched the newest versions of its Microsoft Office and Microsoft SharePoint software packages. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Business Division president Stephen Elop spoke before a packed studio at the famed NBC Studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York, the room where "Saturday Night Live" is broadcast. It was one of many launches the company is holding worldwide for the new products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a moment of fundamental change and there are a lot of reasons for this," Elop said, noting that organizations have tighter budgets and a more mobile workforce. Office 2010 and SharePoint 2010 have been designed to meet these challenges, he said. "The 2010 products represent an epic release for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NBC location seemed fitting and not just because the weather was cloudy outside: As mass media kingpin NBC finds itself both battling with and trying to adopt new forms of media, so too must Microsoft position its software packages as an essential part of office life while buzz steadily builds around new-fangled cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft itself plans to offer hosted online versions of Office 2010, called Office Web Apps, later on this summer. The stand-alone software versions are available to businesses today. Elop noted that the software can be run either in-house or from the cloud and mobile versions for the Windows 6.5 and Windows 7 platforms will be available as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such features are more than fancy trim, Elop argued. They will also help organizations save valuable time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working on behalf of Microsoft, IT analyst firm Forrester estimated that a 7,000 employee knowledge-worker focused business would save US$7 million a year upgrading to Microsoft Office 2010. The savings would come from the many time-saving features the suite has, explained Rob Koplowitz, principal analyst, Forrester Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, one new feature, co-authoring, would save this large organization $3 million alone, with its ability to allow multiple people to work on the same document at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop said the new software will make workers so much more productive that it would pay for itself within a year. The software would offer the equivalent of two extra work weeks of work per employee per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft 2010 certainly has a bevy of new features, all aimed at greater efficiency and productivity. Perhaps most notably, the Outlook e-mail client has been revamped with more powerful management capabilities, such as the ability to handle threaded conversations. It also has what is called a Social Connector, or the ability to fuse social data from LinkedIn and Facebook. PowerPoint can now be used to make presentations viewable on the Internet. The ribbon interface has been streamlined and has been applied to all applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suite also includes, for the first time, Microsoft's note-taking program, OneNote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this package, Microsoft has clearly taken a strong look at usability. Office now has something called "Paste Preview" which, as the name states, shows the user what the document would look like with the newly pasted item. It came about because Microsoft noticed that the feature most used after paste is undo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a collaboration platform, SharePoint 2010 has been upgraded to provide more robust enterprise deployments. Site editing has been made easier. Data can be tagged and aggregated. A new set of community features allows users to share data as they do on Twitter and Facebook. And the software features better integration both with the company's Fast search engine as well as PerformancePoint, which is Microsoft's business intelligence software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop noted that 8.6 million people have already tried the Office 2010 beta versions, which is more than three times the number of users who tried the Office 2007 beta. The company expects that Office 2010 will eventually have over 90 million business customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One aspect in the presentation that wasn't discussed in detail, however, was discussion of putting Office online, as a hosted service. That will happen later this year. The company plans to offer virtually all the features of the products as a cloud offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one company, namely Google, has been making the most with Microsoft's seeming tardiness in providing Microsoft Office applications as a cloud offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the days leading up to Wednesday's launch, Google executives have been talking extensively with the press about its online office offering, Google Docs, as well as how Microsoft is behind Google in terms of offering office productivity functionality in the cloud.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Google's online offerings do not have the richness of features of Office -- admitted, Google product manager Jonathan Rochelle in an interview with -- the advantage of using cloud-based software comes with its own benefits, such as faster updates, deeper integration and better collaboration, the company argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Docs really is a single app that acts as a series of apps, which is very different from what Office is," Rochelle said, explaining that Office is a set of applications, each with rich functionality, but not really designed to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rochelle said that Google Docs offers many of the features, such as multiperson editing, that Office 2010 provides, eliminating the need for current Office users to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't want customers to think they have to go to Office 2010, because they can use Docs for collaboration," Rochelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Google Sites can be used as a low-cost, easy-to-deploy, alternative to SharePoint, Rochelle said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Office still holds the lion's share of the market for office productivity suites. A July 2009 survey from IT research firm IDC, found that approximately 97 percent of the respondents said that at least one version of Microsoft Office is used in their organizations. But Google is gaining ground, the same survey found that 19.5 percent of respondents were in organizations that used Google Docs in some form, up from 5.8 percent a year prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joab Jackson can be reached at joab_jackson@idg.com, or via Twitter at @joab_jackson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM forecast roughly doubling its profit by 2015 as it pushes further into emerging markets and lucrative services and software businesses, sending its shares up over 4 percent and boosting investor confidence in the tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) Chief Executive Sam Palmisano told an annual investor briefing on Wednesday that the company expects earnings per share (EPS), excluding items, of "at least $20" for 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would be double its reported profit of $10.01 a share last year, and above some analysts' projections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At first glance, IBM's 5-year goal sounds lofty. It is considerably higher than our own 5-year forecast, updated earlier this year," said Annex Research analyst Bob Djurdjevic. "But the company's recent track record of meeting or exceeding expectations is also impressive. So Palmisano and his team have credibility in their corner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has over the past decade shifted its focus to high-margin software and services from commoditized hardware. It bought PwC Consulting from PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2002, and sold its personal computer business to Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK) in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has also been increasing investment in new technology services, including "business analytics" which helps clients plot trends, predict risk and cut costs by combining&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More and more of our profits will come from these higher profit segments," Palmisano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upbeat outlook helped IBM shares rise 4.45 percent to $132.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, and also helped lift other technology shares and the Dow Jones industrial average&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.DJI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins Stewart analyst Louis Miscioscia reiterated a "buy" rating and $160 price target on IBM, while Cowen  Co analyst Moshe Katri forecast that the company would outperform the market by 20 percent during the next six to 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACQUISITIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palmisano said IBM would benefit from expansion in fast-growing markets like China, where a burgeoning middle class means greater technology spending. He forecast that by 2015, around 25 percent of IBM revenue would come from growth markets compared with around 19 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO also said that IBM planned to spend around $20 billion in acquisitions from now through 2015. For all of 2009, IBM spent $1.5 billion on acquisitions, including a $1.2 billion cash deal for business analytics company SPSS Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's top rivals include Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), both of which have announced new services and acquisitions that have raised the stakes in the competition for corporate tech dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's recent acquisitions have been relatively small and focused on niche technologies rather than game-changing deals, and Palmisano's comments suggested that may continue to be the case. He said that despite the higher spending, IBM would remain disciplined and "very shareholder-friendly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company had earlier bid for computer server maker Sun Microsystems, but talks fell apart and Sun finally ended up in the hands of Oracle Corp ORCL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's 2015 outlook was an update to its long-term road map given in 2007, in which it targeted EPS of around $10-11 by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also reiterated its forecast for EPS of "at least $11.20" for 2010. Palmisano said the economy was showing positive signs although there were still some challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp launched an updated version of its Office software on Wednesday, aiming to keep its grip on the hugely profitable business application market while countering the challenge of free online alternatives from Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is upgrading its popular Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint applications and rolling out its own online versions to keep up with the new class of mobile, Web-connected users that has emerged since the last upgrade in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced several improvements on Wednesday, such as editing photos in Word, using video in PowerPoint, collaborating on documents and connecting email contacts to Facebook information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the biggest change is Microsoft's move into the "cloud" -- allowing users to manipulate documents stored on remote servers from anywhere -- where Google has been setting the pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate buyers of Office will have immediate access to Microsoft Office Web Apps -- online versions of Word, PowerPoint and Excel programs for Internet-connected phones and PCs -- but will pay more to use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordinary consumers will be able to use online versions free from next month through Microsoft's Windows Live service, which the company is hoping will entice customers to pay for the full software, which will cost between $100 and $500, depending on the level of features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online strategy marks a major shift for the Windows franchise -- with 500 million users according to Microsoft -- which has so far relied on software installed on PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It brings Microsoft into direct competition with Google Docs, stripped-down alternatives to Microsoft's core programs, which are available over the Internet with no need to download software. They are free for personal users and $50-per-user per year for companies. Google says it has picked up 25 million users since launching Docs almost four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts worry that the cost of offering online versions will put a dent in the profit of one of Microsoft's two great profit engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margins will fall, but overall revenue and profit will rise as Microsoft grabs a bigger slice of companies' tech budget, said Stephen Elop, head of Microsoft's Business Division, in an interview at an Office launch event in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Margins are lower as a percentage of revenue because we are purchasing hardware and providing services that involve people," said Elop. "But most importantly, the absolute profit is expected to go up as a result of cloud computing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's business division, which gets 90 percent of its sales from Office, averages around $2.8 billion profit per quarter. That is 47 percent of Microsoft's total profit so far this fiscal year, second only to Microsoft's core Windows operating system franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop said he hopes customer adoption for Office 2010 will be the quickest ever, as companies start to replace aging machines this year and may decide to upgrade to the new Windows 7 system and Office 2010 at the same time. He said 8.6 million people are already using Office 2010 in test versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the latest data from tech research firm Forrester, 81 percent of companies are running Office 2007, compared with only 4 percent using Google's online equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Forrester poll indicates almost a third of existing Office users plan to upgrade to Office 2010 within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft were up 2.0 percent to $29.45 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Gerald E.

 (Adds Microsoft executive comment on profit margins)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
launched an updated version of its Office software on
Wednesday, aiming to keep its grip on the hugely profitable
business application market while countering the challenge of
free online alternatives from Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company is upgrading its
popular Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint applications and
rolling out its own online versions to keep up with the new
class of mobile, Web-connected users that has emerged since the
last upgrade in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft announced several improvements on Wednesday, such
as editing photos in Word, using video in PowerPoint,
collaborating on documents and connecting email contacts to
Facebook information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the biggest change is Microsoft's move into the "cloud"
-- allowing users to manipulate documents stored on remote
servers from anywhere -- where Google has been setting the
pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corporate buyers of Office will have immediate access to
Microsoft Office Web Apps -- online versions of Word,
PowerPoint and Excel programs for Internet-connected phones and
PCs -- but will pay more to use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ordinary consumers will be able to use online versions free
from next month through Microsoft's Windows Live service, which
the company is hoping will entice customers to pay for the full
software, which will cost between $100 and $500, depending on
the level of features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The online strategy marks a major shift for the Windows
franchise -- with 500 million users according to Microsoft --
which has so far relied on software installed on PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It brings Microsoft into direct competition with Google

two great profit engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Margins will fall, but overall revenue and profit will    
rise as Microsoft grabs a bigger slice of companies' tech
budget, said Stephen Elop, head of Microsoft's Business
Division, in an interview at an Office launch event in New

&lt;p&gt;Hardware-based time stamping solution enables organizations to ensure long-term
validity of digitally signed Microsoft Office documents in their native formats
WESTON, Fla. &amp; CAMBRIDGE, England--(Business Wire)--
Thales (Paris: HO), leader in information systems and communications security
and a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, announces the industry`s first hardware
solution to enable time stamps for electronic document security in Microsoft
Office Professional 2010. Thales Time Stamp Server appliance, part of the
nCipher product line, is a network-attached, turn-key appliance that combines
the ability to act as a tamper-resistant source of trusted time with a high
speed and equally secure digital signing engine. This enables organizations to
sign documents or other electronic files such as application software in a
standards-based way, enabling verification long after the original signing
certificate and credentials have expired or been revoked. 

Utilizing the new Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC 3161 interface in
Office Professional 2010, Thales Time Stamp Server provides government agencies
and private sector enterprises with a secure, cost-effective solution for moving
workflows and archiving from paper to electronic documents without first having
to convert Office documents from their native formats. 

"Our new time stamping feature allows customers to continue to rely on the
digital signing capabilities of Microsoft Office Professional 2010 to ensure the
long-term validity of documents," said Giovanni Mezgec, General Manager, for
Office at Microsoft Corp. "It is important that leading providers of
time-stamping solutions support this functionality so customers can securely
move to electronic-based documentation processes and benefit from huge cost
savings. Thales Time Stamp Server is a technology that aligns with our goal of
providing cost-effective, easy-to-use, highly secure methods for ensuring the
authenticity of all Microsoft Office documents." 

Unlike software-based systems, in which administrators can easily manipulate
time, Time Stamp Server keeps accurate time that can be synchronized to external
trusted sources and protects time stamping keys within a secure hardware-based
security environment validated to FIPS 140-2 Level 3 and Common Criteria EAL 4+.
The newly announced Time Stamp Server version 5.0 also offers support for
4,096-bit RSA keys. 

"The use of digital signatures supported by a time stamp greatly enhances the
authenticity and integrity of electronic documents. We applaud Microsoft for
introducing time stamping interfaces to Microsoft Office Professional 2010 to
enable customers to ensure the long-term validity of electronically signed
documents," says Franck Greverie, Vice President, Managing Director for the
information systems security activities of Thales. "Microsoft`s selection of
Time Stamp Server as one of the first hardware solutions to support this new
feature clearly illustrates the leadership role Thales has established in this
space, and we look forward to working with Microsoft as it continues to help
customers take advantage of these added security features."

&lt;p&gt;  SUNNYVALE, CA, May 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
As Microsoft SharePoint Server adoption continues to grow, customers are
faced with the challenge of managing and storing increasing amounts of
data while maintaining the flexibility and scalability required for
smooth business operations. With the enhanced collaboration capabilities
that Microsoft(R) SharePoint(R) Server 2010 delivers, storage demands are
expected to continue to increase. NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP), the 2009
Microsoft Storage Solutions Partner of the year, today unveiled
comprehensive storage solutions to help customers make a smooth
transition to SharePoint 2010, including NetApp SnapManager 6.0 for
Microsoft SharePoint 2010. 

    "Microsoft is excited that valued partners like NetApp are supporting
SharePoint Server 2010," said Jared Spataro, director of Product
Management for SharePoint at Microsoft Corp. "NetApp storage and data
management solutions enable customers to easily transition data to
SharePoint Server 2010 to take advantage of the features and capabilities
that it provides. NetApp offers a flexible, efficient, and reliable
storage infrastructure to support large and growing SharePoint Server
2010 environments."

    NetApp SnapManager 6.0 provides SharePoint Server 2010 customers with
policy-based management of their data, allowing them to automatically
place data files based on location, size, or type in lower-cost SATA
storage. This enables customers to optimize their storage resources and
reduce storage costs. 

    SnapManager 6.0 also allows SharePoint Server 2010 customers to manage
their expanded data, which can include Server Message Block (SMB) shares
and Microsoft Exchange public folder data, on NetApp's unified storage
architecture for improved storage efficiencies. Management of this data
is transparent, enabling customers to leverage the same SharePoint Server
interface they are comfortable with to access, share, and utilize data
without regard to where it is physically stored.

    As the scope of content managed within SharePoint grows, SnapManager 6.0
is able to help customers manage storage requirements. SnapManager 6.0
supports Remote BLOB Storage (RBS), allowing customers to store and
manage content objects outside of Microsoft SQL Server for improved
scalability and flexibility. This support builds on SnapManager 5.0's
ability to manage External BLOB Storage (EBS) in SharePoint Server 2007
SP1 environments. 

    NetApp support for SharePoint Server 2010 also extends to Microsoft SQL
Server 2008 R2, the underlying database for SharePoint Server. NetApp
SnapManager for SQL Server provides customers with high-availability and
also helps database administrators backup and restore, as well as clone
production SQL Server databases in seconds, resulting in improved
application availability. 

    "We're seeing a continued explosion in the amount of data that customers
are storing in their Microsoft SharePoint Server environments," said
Patrick Rogers, vice president of Solutions and Alliances for NetApp.
"NetApp storage solutions for SharePoint Server 2010 provide customers
with the scalability required to meet their growing needs while at the
same time delivering industry-leading storage efficiencies. These
solutions also build on our longstanding commitment with Microsoft to
provide our mutual customers with solutions that deliver unmatched value,
outstanding performance and a superior customer experience."

    NetApp Professional Services and its service partners provide customers
with a comprehensive range of services to help enterprise customers
assess their current environment, and then plan, design, and deploy the
storage and data management solution they need to support their
SharePoint Server 2010 environments.

&lt;p&gt; * Office 2010 released for corporate customers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Includes first online versions of programs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Hits back at Google Docs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares up 1.5 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
launched an updated version of its Office software on
Wednesday, aiming to keep its grip on the hugely profitable
business application market while countering the challenge
of free online alternatives from Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company is upgrading its
popular Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint applications
and rolling out its own online versions to keep up with the
new class of mobile, Web-connected users that has emerged
since the last upgrade in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft announced several improvements on Wednesday,
such as editing photos in Word, using video in PowerPoint,
collaborating on documents and managing e-mail
conversations in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the biggest change is Microsoft's move into the
"cloud" -- allowing users to manipulate documents stored on
remote servers from anywhere -- where Google has been
setting the pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said on Wednesday that corporate buyers of
Office would have immediate access to Office Web Apps,
online versions of Word, PowerPoint and Excel programs
usable on Internet-connected phones and PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That marks a major shift for the Windows franchise --
which Microsoft says has 500 million users -- which has so
far relied on software installed on PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It brings Microsoft into direct competition with Google
Docs -- stripped down versions of Microsoft's core programs
-- which are available over the Internet with no need to
download software. They are free for personal users and
$50-per-user per year for companies. Google says it has
picked up 25 million users since launching Docs almost four
years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ordinary customers will be able to get the new Office
and access Office Web Apps from next month. Buying the
software off the shelf will cost $119 to $499, depending on
the level of features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft were up 1.5 percent at $29.32 in
morning trading.

America in search of prospective entry draft picks, can now post and
browse player files online, read detailed player statistics and respond
to comments left by colleagues. Our goal is to win a Stanley Cup,

&lt;p&gt;New Metalogix Solution is the Industry`s First SharePoint Migration Product to
Integrate PowerShell Scripting
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Metalogix Software, one of the leading providers of solutions for Microsoft
SharePoint migration, management, and archiving as well as Exchange migration
and archiving, today announced the release of SharePoint Site Manager 2010
(SSMM). Available today, Metalogix SSMM 2010 is the first solution to offer
unparalleled ease of use with the robust capabilities of Windows PowerShell.
SSMM 2010 with PowerShell scripting enables organizations to rapidly and
flexibly transition content from their existing Microsoft SharePoint Server 2003
and Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007 to SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint
Foundation. 

SharePoint Site Migration Manager 2010 offers gradual/granular migration support
with no service pack or hardware prerequisites. It allows SharePoint
administrators to define when specific content is migrated and they can use it
to re-organize and re-template SharePoint sites and lists easily as they
migrate. With the rich PowerShell integration in SharePoint Site Migration
Manager, administrators can easily script even the most complex migration
scenarios and fully automate migration jobs. Metalogix SSMM 2010 is the first
SharePoint migration solution to allow users to capture any migration or content
management task as a reusable script, which can then be customized using the
flexibility and richness of PowerShell. 

"The community is excited about SharePoint 2010 and Metalogix provides
organizations with an upgrade path that is easy to use and supported," said
Chris Risley, CEO Metalogix. "As the first SharePoint migration and management
solution to leverage SharePoint 2010 support for PowerShell scripting,
SharePoint Site Migration Manager 2010 enables administrators to tackle complex
migration and deployment scenarios in an efficient, repeatable and automated way
either through our familiar user interface or a command line. They can get up to
speed quickly and with no training." 

Metalogix gives organizations a comprehensive way to standardize on SharePoint
2010 by combining SharePoint Site Migration Manager with solutions for migrating
content from existing ECM and social computing systems (blogs and wikis) as well
as from websites, file systems and public folders. The company`s storage
management and content management solutions help customers to run SharePoint
efficiently by minimizing content database growth and content sprawl, maximizing
its benefits for both IT and business units while reducing their total cost of
ownership. 

"Metalogix is a trusted Microsoft Partner with proven expertise in supporting
complex migration scenarios," said Arpan Shah, Director for SharePoint at
Microsoft Corp. "We are pleased that they will be enabling our customers to more
easily take full advantage of the SharePoint 2010 platform." 

SharePoint Site Migration Manager-like all of Metalogix`s migration products-is
100% Microsoft compliant. It interacts with SharePoint only through supported
APIs-with no direct writes to the database-and supports SharePoint Online.
SharePoint Site Migration Manager 2010 is available today. For more information
please visit:
http://www.metalogix.net/Products/SharePoint-Site-Migration-Manager-2010. 

Metalogix is the innovation leader in solutions that migrate content into
SharePoint, keep SharePoint environments running smoothly, manage the content
throughout its lifecycle, and archive content for compliance and e-discovery.
Metalogix Migration Products move content into SharePoint from almost any source
system: from one SharePoint version to another (2003, 2007, 2010, WSSv2 or

&lt;p&gt;  ST. LOUIS, MO, May 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
KnowledgeLake, Inc., a leading provider of document imaging, capture, and
workflow solutions for the Microsoft SharePoint Server platform, has
announced the latest release of its product suite for Microsoft(R)
SharePoint(R) Server 2010. Microsoft Corp. launched SharePoint Server
2010 in a separate announcement today.

    KnowledgeLake provides an affordable, platform-based solution for
managing unstructured content directly within SharePoint Server 2010.
KnowledgeLake is an enterprise scalable and comprehensive SharePoint
Server 2010 Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solution for capturing,
indexing, searching, viewing, securing, routing, and annotating mission
critical electronic content. 

    "KnowledgeLake is an experienced partner for scanning and capture for
SharePoint Server 2010," said Ryan Duguid, senior product manager on the
Enterprise Content Management Team at Microsoft Corp. "They have built
their solution entirely on the SharePoint Server platform, providing a
consistent user experience and helping organizations drive value from
their existing technology investments. KnowledgeLake specializes in
scanning and capture, has a deep understanding of the SharePoint Server
platform, and has a rich heritage in the ECM industry."

    KnowledgeLake is Microsoft's 2009 partner of the year in two categories:
Enterprise Content Management and Forms Development, and Independent
Software Vendor/Software Solutions.

    KnowledgeLake Imaging for SharePoint Features Powerful New Search Center

    KnowledgeLake Imaging for SharePoint v4.0 is the cornerstone of the 2010
suite. It features the new KnowledgeLake Search Center that extends the
built-in SharePoint Server search capabilities, and uses the latest
Microsoft Silverlight technology. KnowledgeLake Imaging has an improved
user interface with a tabbed navigation, the ability to display multiple
queries in the tabs, and users can now search document text and metadata
within a single query.

    The KnowledgeLake Search Center also leverages the new SharePoint Server
2010 Business Connectivity Services (BCS) capability. BCS makes it
possible to access and use data in applications and databases outside
SharePoint Server. Search Center queries can search these sources in
addition to other SharePoint content. The KnowledgeLake Search Center
also introduces powerful new ways to display query results by grouping
and filtering columns, and by supporting the new SharePoint Server
document set content type.

    KnowledgeLake Document Viewer built with Silverlight 4

    The KnowledgeLake Document Viewer contains advanced features such as a
find similar search based off document properties and the ability to view
multiple documents at once. The viewer also provides the ability to
display Document Sets. 

    "Microsoft has given us a powerful new foundational ECM platform in
SharePoint Server 2010 and thanks to our close working relationship with
the SharePoint team, we've been able to leverage great new features such
as Business Connectivity Services, Document Sets and Robust Records
Management and Compliance in products we're announcing concurrently with
today's launch of SharePoint Server 2010," says Chris Caplinger, Chief
Technology Officer of KnowledgeLake, Inc. "Because our products are built
within the SharePoint Server platform, rather than as replacements or
external add-ons, everything looks, feels and works as a single,
reliable, scalable solution, whether you're a SharePoint user or
administrator."

    Deployment and Administration

    Since KnowledgeLake Imaging for SharePoint is built to be an integral
part of the SharePoint architecture, it installs as a SharePoint solution
deployment package. An administrator can install it on a single server
and configure it from SharePoint Central Administration. Then
configuration settings automatically replicate to all farm Web servers.

    KnowledgeLake Capture and Connect are SharePoint Server 2010 Ready

    The capture components of the KnowledgeLake product suite have been
updated to take advantage of the new features in SharePoint Server 2010,
such as Managed Metadata, Business Connectivity Services (BCS) and list
validations. However, all KnowledgeLake products will maintain their full
features and functionality whether installed within Microsoft SharePoint
Server 2007 or SharePoint Server 2010.

    A Comprehensive ECM Solution

    Since 2003, KnowledgeLake has been solely focused on helping companies
lower their operating costs by leveraging SharePoint Server, a platform
for ECM solutions. The new KnowledgeLake 2010 product suite continues
this focus. 

    "Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 will continue to dominate the ECM
industry," says Ron Cameron, President and co-founder of KnowledgeLake,
Inc. "And the KnowledgeLake SharePoint Server 2010 products will continue
to push the envelope on cost savings and benefits when compared to other
legacy ECM solutions. Our solution is very affordable, highly relevant,
and very capable of replacing many of the legacy ECM applications that
devour corporate IT budgets. We have deep experience and have learned the
best practices necessary to design and deploy large scale SharePoint ECM
solutions for any size organization and for many different business
applications."

    Availability

    The KnowledgeLake SharePoint Server 2010 Suite will ship in the second
quarter of 2010. For more information, visit www.knowledgelake.com.

    KnowledgeLake, Inc. develops document imaging related products and
solutions for Microsoft SharePoint Server. KnowledgeLake extends the ECM
capabilities of SharePoint, enabling businesses to reduce mailing costs,
streamline operations, and achieve regulatory compliance using familiar
Microsoft products that most businesses already own and use.

sectors including public sector, healthcare, financial services,

&lt;p&gt;Innovator in SharePoint Server Content Migration, Management and Archiving
Featured in 12 Cities During the Microsoft Launch Tour


WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Metalogix Software, one of the leading providers of solutions for Microsoft
SharePoint Server migration and management, today announced that Trevor
Hellebuyck, Senior Architect at Metalogix Development, will be a featured
presenter during the Dallas stop of Microsoft Corp.`s US `The Next Wave of
Productivity` Launch Tour on May 18. Hellebuyck will present "Improving
SharePoint Performance, Scalability and Manageability in Minutes," which
includes a customer case study. 

Metalogix is a Platinum event sponsor for six of Microsoft`s US Launch Tour
Events for Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010. As a Platinum sponsor, Metalogix
will demonstrate its StoragePoint solution, which improves SharePoint Server
storage performance and scalability. StoragePoint will also be included in the
Microsoft virtual live event video. Metalogix is a gold and silver sponsor for
six cities included in the Microsoft Launch Tour. 

"Our strong participation as a Platinum sponsor for `The Next Wave of
Productivity` launch event demonstrates our commitment to providing innovative
solutions to simplify and automate migration and management processes for users
moving to SharePoint Server 2010," said Chris Risley, CEO, Metalogix. "Metalogix
is a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner and our solutions can get organizations up
and running with SharePoint Server 2010 on day one. Metalogix delivers powerful
migration and management capabilities for organizations looking to quickly
embrace the value of this new platform. Our event participation, like our
products, enriches and enhances the value delivered by the new SharePoint Server
2010 platform." 

The Dallas presentation will feature a brief case study examining how customers
have improved SharePoint Server performance, scalability and manageability by
relocating their content (PDFs, TIFs, Microsoft Office documents, etc.) out of
the SharePoint Server content databases and onto a file-share. Highly
cost-effective tiered storage for SharePoint Server will also be discussed.
Tiered storage enables clients to use different levels or tiers of storage,
automatically reserving the fastest and most expensive storage devices for
actively used content, while leveraging slower, much less expensive storage
platforms for archiving, non-critical content or infrequent access. 

As a Platinum sponsor, Metalogix will also be prominently featured at future
Microsoft launch events in the following cities:

* New York on May 13 
* Dallas on May 18 
* Irvine on May 18

&lt;p&gt;Building on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 and Microsoft Visio 2010, Global
360 to Showcase Its Enterprise-Class Business Process Platform
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Global 360, one of the leading providers of Process and Document Management
solutions, announced today it has been selected by Microsoft Corp. as one of
only 12 Platinum Sponsors for the US `Next Wave of Productivity` launch events.
Global 360 is participating at Microsoft launch events in multiple cities across
the U.S., including Boston, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Houston, Detroit,
Minneapolis and Seattle. At the events, Global 360 will showcase its
Microsoft-based process and document management suite, Process360 for SharePoint
and analystView. 

At the May 27 Minneapolis event, Penson Financial Services Collaboration Systems
Manager, Brett Kovatch, will share how Penson is leveraging Microsoft SharePoint
Server 2010, Microsoft  Visio 2010 and Global 360`s BPM suite as an
enterprise-wide process platform. The platform will enable the company to more
efficiently process and execute millions of financial transactions per day.
Penson is leveraging SharePoint Server and BPM to eliminate paper and manual
processes, improve team collaboration, and aggregate metrics and performance
data across multiple departments into a single dashboard. 

Noted Kovatch, "In a highly regulated industry, accountability is a huge factor
in our success. We have many manual procedures that lend themselves to human
error and are time consuming, so process is key. With our business growing,
volumes are growing, so we need to be able to handle the influx of new business
as the economy makes a comeback. Leveraging SharePoint Server and Visio, Global
360 lets us scale as we grow and easily build, track, monitor and audit our
processes." 

"Global 360 has used SharePoint Server 2010 and Microsoft Visio 2010 as core
elements of its business process platform," said Jeff Teper, Corporate Vice
President of SharePoint at Microsoft. "The focus on the productivity of those
using the system is in line with Microsoft`s belief that the tool has to work
for the user and not the other way around. Global 360`s Persona-based approach
to BPM takes advantage of the wide adoption of Microsoft SharePoint Server, as
information workers can leverage the common, familiar Microsoft experience
already in use." 

"We are thrilled to have been chosen by Microsoft as a Platinum Sponsor for this
important launch," noted Global 360 president and CEO David Mitchell.
"Continuous, successful process improvement is about capturing documents,
automating, and continually improving key processes while gaining new visibility
using dashboards and reports - ultimately improving productivity and lowering
costs. Global 360 gives organizations the power to truly achieve the next wave
of productivity by leveraging their existing investments and making SharePoint
Server and Visio the place to do business." 

A free 60-day trial of Global 360`s analystView 3.0 is available at
www.global360.com/visiofreetrial. For business analysts using Microsoft Visio

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new Kin phones are not truly smartphones, but Verizon Wireless is charging users a minimum monthly $70 service fee -- $30 alone for data -- anyway, over a two-year contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Verizon representatives defended the fee on Tuesday, partly because of the Kins' automatic cloud-based backup of video, pictures and other data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither phone has the ability to download applications and games -- taking it out of the realm of most smartphones -- but Microsoft said it plans to allow app downloads in a future version as services are merged with upcoming Windows Phone 7 devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the longer term, we'll be merging [Kin and Windows Phone 7] platforms and having downloadable apps," said Greg Sullivan, senior product manager with Microsoft's mobile communications unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics have drubbed the new the new Kin phones for charging mostly younger users a $70 monthly minimum smartphone service fee over two years. Negative comments have flowed from bloggers and reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Verizon view the Kin Windows phones as a new category of social networking phone, somewhere between a smartphone and a high-end feature phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're introducing a new category that's not exactly a smartphone and certainly more than a high-end feature phone -- a social or cloud phone -- with a rich browsing experience and rich multimedia social networking where everything I do on the phone is automatically backed up in the Kin Studio [in the cloud]," Sullivan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman for Verizon, said that the Kin phones were "designed ... to be a full service device [for] the person whose life is about networking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she has seen the critics' comments about the service plan costing too much, but said Verizon has seen many users already paying the $70 monthly smartphone plan for different devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raney said the Kins' biggest feature is backing up video files, photos and other data in the Kin Studio cloud, which is accessible with a Microsoft Silverlight-capable PC or Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of backup will lead to plenty of Internet usage that Verizon is trying to cover with the $70 fee, some critics have pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan said customers will get used to that monthly charge. "Once they realize the value of this, they'll realize it's a great deal," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Kin One and Kin Two do not support downloadable applications, including games, there are built-in applications such as a variety of social networking apps like Facebook and Twitter , a Zune music player, and cameras, including an HD video camera in the $100 (after rebate) Kin Two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kin One, which costs $50 after rebate, puts both models at the lower end of the mobile phone hardware cost spectrum, but true smartphones such as the Palm Pre Plus can be purchased for $30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Kin One phone focuses on social networking. With a square shape, it has a five-megapixel camera and 4GB of memory. The Kin Two phone, the larger device, has a wider screen, 8 megapixel camera and shoots HD video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HTC Droid Incredible goes for $200 after rebates, and still can be purchased on a $70 smartphone plan, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan said Windows Phone 7 devices coming later in 2010 will allow downloading of apps, adding that Microsoft will eventually support downloadable apps on Kin devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, said in April that the two Windows Phone platforms were different. He said Kin devices will "amplify" the lives of users, while Windows Phone 7 phones will "simplify" users' lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft developed the two platform approaches based on research with 50,000 customers, mapping them to "distinct life stages" that obviously correlate to younger and older audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to amplify your life and are in searching mode, the Kin is for you and if want to simplify you life and manage things, then Windows Phone 7 is for you," Sullivan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In releasing Kin One and Kin Two, Microsoft worked closely with device maker Sharp Electronics and Verizon Wireless, Sullivan said. That's a clear departure from when Microsoft built the Windows Mobile OS and basically told manufactures to work with it on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two years of criticism from various quarters for its Windows Mobile OS problems, Sullivan said Microsoft engineers and designers have a "new approach that's focused on the consumer and we're taking more responsibility for the hardware and software integration with the carrier and manufacturer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that Apple 's iPhone is the hot phone to beat, and the related interest in the video chat feature expected in the next-genertaion Apple smartphone, Sullivan said Windows phones could incorporate video chat if users want it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the audience is really interested in that, we have the ability to update the platform," he said. But audience surveys showed that video chat was not a high priority for the first version, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the launch of Kin, Sullivan has been pleased by user adoption, pointing to 160,000 "fans of Kin" on Facebook, at www.facebook.com/kin only five days after the Kins' online launch. Twitter users are following Kin users as well at www.twitter.com/kin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a long period of Windows Mobile problems, Sullivan said that the mood at Microsoft is "really excited" following the Kin launch and with workers anticipating the Windows Phone 7 launch later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a realization that this market is nascent and there's a tremendous opportunity over the next many years in smartphones and we expect to be there," Sullivan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Hamblen covers mobile and wireless, smartphones and other handhelds, and wireless networking for Computerworld .

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) today announced it earned
$4.7 million, or basic net income per share of $.51, on net sales of $347.5
million for the first quarter of 2010, compared to net income of $8.5 million,
or basic net income per share of $.93, on net sales of $336.3 million for the
first quarter of 2009. The results for the first quarter of 2010 included $0.1
million of mark-to-market gains (both on a pre-tax and after-tax basis) due to
the Company`s fuel and aluminum hedging programs and a $0.5 million increase in
income tax expense due to the change in tax law eliminating the tax deduction
once available for Medicare Part D subsidies. The results for the first quarter
of 2009 included $1.3 million of after-tax gains ($2.1 million on a pre-tax
basis) due to the fuel and aluminum hedging programs and a $1.7 million decrease
in income tax expense due to the settlement of prior tax positions with a state
tax authority. 

On a comparable basis, the Company earned $5.0 million in the first quarter of
2010, or comparable basic net income per share of $.55, versus $5.7 million in
the first quarter of 2009, or comparable basic net income per share of $.63. The
following table reconciles reported GAAP net income and comparable net income

&lt;p&gt;  BEVERLY, MA, May 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Cellceutix Corporation (OTCBB: CTIX), a developer of small compounds for
the treatment of cancer, autism and inflammatory diseases, believes that
recent announcements by major pharmaceutical companies support its
strategy of developing a novel compound to treat autism spectrum
disorder. The New York Times published an article on April 29th to report
the results from a small, overseas study for the treatment of fragile X
syndrome by the Switzerland-based pharmaceutical giant Novartis. Fragile
X, a genetic disorder characterized by changes in part of the X
chromosome, is believed by Novartis to be a key aspect in attacking
developmental disorders such as autism and mental retardation. Pfizer has
also recently announced an effort to develop treatments for autism
spectrum disorder. 

    "These announcements indicate that Cellceutix is in a prime position in
the development of treatments for autism spectrum disorder," said Leo
Ehrlich, the Chief Financial Officer of Cellceutix. "We are developing a
novel compound for a disorder which has few treatment options. In an area
that people were once skeptical about pharmaceutical advancements being
possible, it is encouraging to see other companies showing significant
interest."

    Cellceutix acquired the rights to KM-391, its compound for the treatment
of autism spectrum disorder, last year and has been diligently developing
the compound since. Cellceutix has already completed an animal study that
shows very encouraging results. Details of the data from the study are
available at the Cellceutix website at www.cellceutix.com. 

    About Cellceutix 
 Cellceutix Corporation is a preclinical cancer and
anti-inflammatory drug developer. Cellceutix owns the rights to eight
drug compounds, including Kevetrin(TM), which it is developing as a
treatment for certain cancers, and KM-391, which it is developing for the
treatment of autism. More information is available on the Cellceutix web
site at www.cellceutix.com. 

    This Press Release contains forward-looking statements that are based on
our current expectations, beliefs and assumptions about the industry and
markets in which Cellceutix Corporation operates. Such forward-looking
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other
factors that may cause Cellceutix's actual results to be materially
different from any future results expressed or implied by these

in these statements, and no assurance can be given that Cellceutix can

    The factors that may cause Cellceutix's actual results to differ from its

for additional cash to sustain existing operations and meet ongoing
existing obligations and capital requirements; Cellceutix's ability to
implement its new product development and commercialization, enter into
clinical trials, expand the intellectual property portfolio, and receive
regulatory approvals in a timely and cost-effective manner. All
forward-looking statements are also expressly qualified in their entirety
by the cautionary statements included in Cellceutix's SEC filings,

Company's positive results in animal studies do not necessarily guarantee
success in humans, though they may form the basis for beginning Phase 1
trials.

&lt;p&gt;Worldwide Unveiling of New Design in Montebello, CA and European Premiere in
Madrid, Spain

PASADENA, Calif. &amp; LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Disney Store is poised to redefine children`s retail, launching a magical new
store design in major markets across the United States and Europe this summer.
The innovative Disney Store design will be unveiled for the first time in June
at The Shops at Montebello in Montebello, CA just outside of Los Angeles,
followed by the European premiere in early July in Madrid, Spain at La Vaguada.
A unique destination developed from a child`s perspective, the new store design
integrates the latest technology to create an enhanced shopping experience
inspired by Disney`s most popular characters and stories. 

"We have infused Disney magic into all elements of this one-of-a-kind retail
experience, and have selected prime retail centers to launch the Disney Store of
the future," said Jim Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide. "Special
features like the iconic Disney Princess castle with magic mirror and the Disney
Store Theater are just two of the amazing elements in the new store that will
enrich every child and family`s experience at the Disney Store." 

More than 20 new and remodeled Disney Store locations are slated to open this
year in premier retail centers throughout North America and Europe. North
American locations have been confirmed for Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City,
New York; Santa Monica Place in Santa Monica, California; International Plaza in
Tampa, Florida; Stockton St. in San Francisco, CA; and Fashion Valley in San
Diego, CA. European locations cover four markets with openings in Spain,
Portugal, Italy and the UK. These include NorteShopping in Oporto, Portugal;
Orio Center in Bergamo, Italy; and UK locations including Centre MK in Milton
Keynes, Bon Accord Centre in Aberdeen and Donegal Place in Belfast. 

Each new store has special significance and will be celebrated as an important
milestone in Disney Store`s growth and evolution.

* Roosevelt Field will be the first east coast newly-designed store to open in
the United States. 
* In August, Disney Store will join a group of exclusive retailers for the
re-opening of the new Santa Monica Place shopping center near the legendary
Santa Monica Pier in southern California. Santa Monica Place is a modern
shopping and dining destination that combines contemporary styles with
sustainable architecture, and Disney Store will offer a comprehensive assortment
of unique Disney products to the elite clientele. 
* Disney Store at International Plaza in Tampa, Florida will be nearest to Walt
Disney World Resort, allowing families to visit both this summer. 
* Fashion Valley brings together San Diego's finest collection of stores set in
a beautiful outdoor shopping center, and the newly-designed Disney Store will
launch there this summer. 
* Disney Store will join retailers in the historic Union Square of San
Francisco, one of the largest shopping areas in the United States. Union Square
became San Francisco's shopping epi-center in the early 1900s and today, upscale
stores and hotels surround Union Square, and shopping extends blocks from the
central plaza. 
* In Europe, Oporto will be the first Disney Store to open in the north of
Portugal and only the second to open in the country, following the successful
launch of the brand to the market in 2007.

With each new store opening in 2010, Disney Store will designate a day for 10
percent of the sales to be donated to the Make-A-Wish Foundation in the U.S.,
Spain, Italy and Portugal and to Great Ormond Street Hospital Children`s Charity
in the UK.

&lt;p&gt;Devon IT to develop low-cost Thin Client specifically designed to take advantage
of RemoteFX rich media
KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Devon IT, Inc., a provider of thin client hardware and software solutions, today
announced plans to develop and sell a new, low-cost zero client desktop device
specifically designed to support Microsoft RemoteFX. 

The Devon IT RemoteFX Zero Client - code named the TC Zero - will be among the
first devices specifically designed for Microsoft`s RemoteFX software. The
RemoteFX zero client will allow users to take advantage of rich media features
such as 3D user interface, video, animations, and portable graphics stacks like
Microsoft Silverlight and Flash, and a diverse array of client-side devices. 

Hardware accelerated RemoteFX decoding provides excellent performance while
allowing to keep power consumption to an extremely low level. Devon IT is
working to design a new thin client that implements this RemoteFX decoding in
hardware. Devon IT plans to release the Remote FZ TC Zero within 6 months after
SP1 ships and Devon IT also plans an aggressive low price point to make the cost
of acquisition and ultimately the total cost of ownership as low as possible. 

"Customers will be excited about Devon IT`s plans to develop and sell a low-cost
client desktop device designed to support Microsoft RemoteFX," said Dai Vu,
director of Virtualization Solutions Marketing at Microsoft Corp. "The
collaboration between Microsoft and Devon IT will help deliver innovative
RemoteFX solutions to enterprises looking to maximize their IT investment." 

"RemoteFX has no doubt raised the bar for delivering high-quality, PC-like
desktop experiences to users of all intensity levels," says Stephane Verdy, CTO
for Devon IT. "We have worked with innovators like the Microsoft RemoteFX team
for years, and we are ecstatic that we can once again provide customers with an
advanced thin client solution." 

"Devon IT has been a recognized innovator in developing cutting-edge alternative
desktop technologies for the last five years," explained Joe Makoid, President,
Devon IT. "When an iconic company like Microsoft, which has built the modern
desktop computer industry into what it is today , announces technology like
Microsoft RemoteFX it is a market setting and industry changing event.
RemoteFX-based products and technologies from Devon IT will fundamentally help
our customers increase their desktop computing productivity and reduce their
costs." 

Historically the end-user experience has been a factor limiting the usability in
some remote desktops. Microsoft RemoteFX gives an enhanced user experience
regardless of the type of application (3D, web based video streaming, etc).
Since RemoteFX relies on server-side rendering, it enables Devon IT to build
simplified thin clients that do not need to be upgraded as new multimedia
players or codecs are created. This allows customers to deploy low cost, highly
secure, highly reliable and centrally manageable thin clients even to their most
demanding users. 

About Devon IT

Devon IT, Inc, (www.devonit.com) is an information technology company offering
thin client hardware and software for alternative desktop solutions that provide
enterprise customers with greater security, enhanced manageability, improved
reliability, and lower costs. Devon IT is also the creator of VDI Blaster

&lt;p&gt;Runtime Intelligence Enables CodePlex to Become the First Open Source Hosting
Service to Offer Application and Feature Monitoring to All Site Visitors
CLEVELAND--(Business Wire)--
PreEmptive Solutions, a leading provider of solutions to measure, manage, and
protect applications, announced today that its Runtime Intelligence Service will
publish application and feature usage statistics for Microsoft`s CodePlex open
source hosting service. 

Developers use Runtime Intelligence to improve user experience, validate usage
assumptions, and improve the overall quality of their applications. Potential
users of these applications can use Runtime Intelligence to better identify
which applications are being used most often and even what features are most
popular. 

With the release of the latest version of the CodePlex site on May 6, 2010,
developers can inject application monitoring technology into their applications
using Dotfuscator (either the Community Edition included with Microsoft Visual
Studio 2010 or the commercial edition licensed by PreEmptive). The instrumented
applications stream usage data to PreEmptive Solutions Runtime Intelligence
Portal where it is then integrated into, and published by, the CodePlex website
at www.codeplex.com. 

"Developers always want reliable data on how their applications are performing
in the wild," said Jonathan Wanagel, senior development manager of Server and
Tools Online at Microsoft Corp. "The truly unique dimension that publishing this
kind of information to an open-source community brings is that now potential
users will have the same degree of visibility and that will help to drive
adoption of quality open-source applications." 

"The CodePlex team has truly raised the bar on what open source developers and
end users should expect from their hosting platforms," said Gabriel Torok,
president of PreEmptive Solutions. "We are proud that Dotfuscator and The
Runtime Intelligence Service are a part of this solution." 

Dotfuscator injects all of this functionality into compiled assemblies and that
means that both existing and future projects can take advantage of this service
immediately. In fact, within the first 48 hours that this service was available,
nine distinct development projects updated and distributed their applications
and are already publishing runtime intelligence data for all to see. 

Developers can learn more by visiting http://codeplex.com/runtimeintelligence
for documentation and a tutorial. Visitors to the CodePlex site can see the
resulting usage data alongside existing download and web page view statistics.
An example can be seen on the Application Runs chart at
http://rivisualizer.codeplex.com/stats. 

About PreEmptive Solutions
PreEmptive Solutions produces the Dotfuscator and DashO application protection,
monitoring and management product families and the Runtime Intelligence Service.
With more than 4,000 corporate clients, 40,000 registered installations in 100+
countries and inclusion with Microsoft`s 6,000,000+ Visual Studio seats,
PreEmptive Solutions is the clear choice for every organization serious about
protecting, measuring and managing their application investments. For more

$1.05 billion stake in Taikang Life, China's No.4 life insurer,
according to sources close to the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The auction pitted Goldman against private equity firms and
Singapore's Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AXA (AXAF.PA) and Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources would not confirm the final price of the deal.
The French insurer has valued its 15.6 percent holding in the
company at $1.05 billion.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY May 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) faces a
possible A$15 million lawsuit ($13 million) by former
Australian clients who say the bank misled them into
over-paying for stocks under derivatives deals, law firm Slater
 Gordon said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Slater  Gordon said it was investigating allegations of
misleading and deceptive conduct against Goldman Sachs JBWere,
a joint venture owned 45 percent by the Wall Street investment
bank, with a view to launching a possible law suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The suit is yet to be filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs JBWere declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slater  Gordon's practice group leader, Van Moulis, said
clients alleged Goldman had sold contracts as protection
against a sudden downturn in share prices, but they were
obliged to buy the stocks at above-market prices when the
crunch came.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On the basis of our investigation it appears the marketing
of the product was misleading and it seems the product was
inadequate to protect our clients against the market collapse,"
he said in a statement, referring to the global financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The contracts were sold in 2007, Moulis said, before global
stocks markets slumped dramatically in late 2008.

&lt;p&gt;The war of words between Microsoft and Google over Office 2010 and its entry into online, cloud-based applications heated up today as both companies again took shots at each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One analyst said Microsoft was publicly arguing with Google both to preserve its current position and its future in the enterprise application and collaboration markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, a Microsoft executive hammered Google for a Tuesday sales pitch that urged Office users to put off upgrading to Office 2010 and instead add Google Docs as an online complement to older versions of the suite leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling Google's claims "simply not true," Alex Payne, director of Microsoft's online product management team, countered a Google director's pitch that Google Docs, the search company's online application suite, "makes Office 2003 and 2007 better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the companies traded new blows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It says a lot about Microsoft's approach to customer lock-in that the company touts its proprietary document formats, which only Microsoft software can render with true fidelity, as the reason to avoid using other products," Google said in a statement e-mailed to Computerworld by a company spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google was talking about Payne's argument Tuesday that only Office 2010 and its accompanying Office Web Apps online components were able to handle so-called "round-tripping" -- a phrase that describes moving a document from Office on the desktop to an online app, then back again -- without losing important document formatting or content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've made a lot of progress with our new editors to improve the experience importing Office documents into Google Docs, and there's more to come soon," promised Google, referring to its plans to integrate technologies from DocVerse, a maker of Office plug-ins for online, real-time collaboration. Google acquired DocVerse in early March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft didn't take Google's counterpunch without swinging back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about how Google has chosen to implement features, not file formats," argued Payne in a e-mail today. "Microsoft supports multiple ISO standards for file formats, and they are fully and openly documented, [but] Google simply chooses not to implement certain features, which results in poor document fidelity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Payne said Microsoft's Office Web Apps have what he called "high fidelity" when documents are moved from the desktop to online, and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This underscores that they do not understand the needs of businesses and cannot deliver on their claim that Google Docs make Office better," Payne concluded today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's concerned that if an Office alternative like Google Docs could get a critical mass in some companies, then those companies would no longer license Office across the board for all workers," said Rob Helm, an analyst with research firm Directions on Microsoft. "Companies might be more likely to tactically deploy Office only to some users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more important than today's bottom line, Helm said, is Microsoft's future, which increasingly hinges on SharePoint, the server-based software that he called the company's "hub for its entire collaboration effort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SharePoint last quarter posted a 30% increase in revenues, climbing to account for $1.3 billion of Microsoft's sales, and is key to the future of Office, said Helm. "Microsoft's doing this to protect SharePoint's position," he said. "It wants to make it clear that it has the collaboration solution for the enterprise, not Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most analysts, Helm believes that Google has a hard row to hoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All I can say [to Google] is 'good luck,'" said Helm. "Google is just the latest pretender to the Office throne. IBM has been chasing Office for years with Lotus, OpenOffice has as well. Office is very hard nut to crack."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
In a ruling issued last night, the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California dismissed virtually all of Chevron Corporation`s legal
claims against an attorney who represented plaintiffs in an environmental
lawsuit against the company, handing Chevron a defeat in what the attorney
argued is Chevron`s ongoing campaign to avoid remediating the environmental
disaster and human suffering caused by oil drilling and dumping operations in
the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. 

Chevron filed a malicious prosecution suit against Cristobal Bonifaz, a
Massachusetts attorney and native of Ecuador who was one of the first persons to
bring the disaster to the attention of scientists and human rights and
environmental activists in the United States. Mr. Bonifaz brought suit against
Chevron (and its predecessor Texaco) on behalf of the indigenous people of the
rainforest whose water supply and lands have been contaminated by improper oil
production practices. 

On May 12, 2010, United States District Court Judge Claudia Wilken ruled that
Chevron`s lawsuit against Mr. Bonifaz is a SLAPP suit (Strategic Lawsuit Against
Public Participation). Pursuant to California`s anti-SLAPP statute, the court
dismissed almost all of Chevron`s claims, ruling that Chevron could not
substantiate those claims against Mr. Bonifaz. As a result of this ruling,
Chevron will be required to pay Mr. Bonifaz`s attorneys` fees incurred in
defending against Chevron`s meritless legal claims. The court deferred ruling on
one small, remaining claim pending limited and discrete discovery. 

Mr. Bonifaz is represented by Jacqueline Scott Corley of Kerr &amp; Wagstaffe LLP,
San Francisco, California.

Google: Earnings Scorecard

Following the first quarter earnings announcement on April 15, 2010, more than
half the analysts covering Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) have made upward revisions
to their estimates. The reason for the optimism may be traced to the strong
results that were helped by the return of several big spenders, as well as the
company`s growth prospects going forward. 

First Quarter Highlights

Google`s first quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus estimate by 24 cents on
revenues that exceeded by 36.8%. 

Revenue growth was broad-based across search, display, mobile and enterprise
segments, with particular strength in the retail, travel, technology and finance
verticals. Both Google-owned and partner sites performed well in the last
quarter. 

The company continued to see higher click rates and lower cost per click, which
dampened a bit by the Nexus One launch but continued to expand margins in the
last quarter. This led to another quarter of solid cash flows, which netted $2.6
billion in the last quarter. 

Agreement of Analysts

Of the 34 analysts covering the stock, 18 raised estimates for the upcoming
quarter and 19 for the following quarter. Additionally, 23 analysts raised
estimates for fiscal 2010, while 18 raised for fiscal 2011. 

Analysts, by and large, continue to believe in the company`s strong growth
prospects, driven by increasing broadband penetration and the transfer of
offline ad spending online, which is expanding the online marketplace. Although
Google`s market share could slip a bit, the company remains dominant in
practically all the countries it serves, which is a big point in its favor.
Additionally, Google is making headway with its mobile strategy and the
company`s Android OS is taking share. 

Despite Google`s strong growth prospects in the core markets, a few analysts
have made downward revisions. For example, 8 analysts lowered estimates for the
upcoming quarter, while 7 lowered for the following quarter. However, only 5
analysts lowered estimates for fiscal 2010, while 4 lowered for fiscal 2011. 

The most significant negatives as we see them at this point are the stronger
competition Google is seeing in its core search market, the fiercely competitive
mobile market where it is pitted against companies like Apple Inc. (Nasdaq:
AAPL), Research In Motion (Nasdaq: RIMM) and Microsoft Inc. (Nasdaq: MSFT),
challenges faced by Google News that resulted in its parting ways with News Corp
and Associated Press, and the company`s exit from China. 

Nordstrom Earnings Preview

The earnings outlook for Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE: JWN) remains strong; ahead of its
quarterly results on Thursday. While the prospects of many of its peers continue
to be weighed down by the challenging macroeconomic environment, the premium
fashion retailer has reported robust same-store sales in April 2010. Same-store
revenue increased 7.5% in April, well surpassing the Wall Street estimates of a
6.2% rise in monthly same-store sales. 

The improved sales result of Nordstrom indicates stabilization of the overall
market as shoppers are gradually opening up their wallets and unleashing the
discretionary spending. Industry experts further anticipate continued sales
improvement in the coming months with inventories remaining lean and sales of
high-margin accessories having improved recently. 

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2010 first quarter is $0.55,
which represents a year-over-year growth of 71.88%. Estimates are clearly going
up, with 10 of the 20 analysts covering the stock raising their quarterly EPS
estimates in the last seven days, while only 2 having moved in the opposite
direction. 

For fiscal 2010, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate is $2.60 per share, which
represents a 33.33% increase over fiscal 2009 earnings. About 8 of the 21
analysts covering the stock have raised their fiscal EPS estimates in the last
seven days, while only 2 have lowered the same.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Goldman Sachs: Earnings Scorecard

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) reported first quarter earnings of 2010 on
Apr 20th that were significantly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, led by
strong top-line growth though partially offset by higher-than-expected operating
expenses. However, investors` reactions on the better-than-expected results were
quite tepid on the Wall Street due to the ongoing litigation issues that drained
out the excitement. 

Consequently, the stock has continued to fall since its earnings release. Below
we will cover the results of the recent earnings announcement, subsequent
analyst estimate revisions and Zacks ratings for the short term and long term
outlook for the stock. 

Earnings Report Review

It`s always encouraging to outperform estimates, particularly when the
difference is substantial enough to gain optimism for a promising future. A
quick look on the top-line reveals that while trading operations remained
persistently strong, investment banking operations improved year-over-year.
However, asset management services remained weak on the backdrop of a sluggish
macro economic environment that resulted in significant money market outflows. 

Goldman tops the industry by acquiring the leading position in the world-wide
announced and completed M and public common stock offering year-to-date,
putting behind it top rivals such as Credit Suisse Group (NYSE: CS) (#2) and
Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) (#3). The company advised on a number of sizeable
transactions during the first quarter of 2010. 

Earnings Estimate Revisions - Overview

Estimates have witnessed modest movement for Goldman since the earnings release.
This is not bad news at all. In fact, it gives quite a valid reason to own a
stock that benefits from good news and provides a scope for rising in the
future. 

Teva Beats, Maintains Outlook

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries` (Nasdaq: TEVA) first quarter earnings of 91
cents per American Depository Share (ADS) was well above the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of 89 cents and the year-ago earnings of 71 cents. Teva`s top-line
performance remained strong with revenues increasing 16% to $3.7 billion. Strong
sales of Copaxone and generics helped drive revenues. 

Revenue performance across key business segments was mixed. While the
Pharmaceuticals segment performed well thanks to strong performances in the
North American, European and international segments, the Active Pharmaceutical
Ingredients (API) segment reported a 13.7% decline in growth with sales coming
in at $139 million. 

Pharmaceutical segment revenues were driven by strong performances in the North
American, European and international segments. The launch of a generic version
of Mirapex and continued strong sales from existing products like generic
versions of Pulmicort Respules, Adderall XR, Accutane, and Eloxatin helped North
American revenues grow 20% to $2,309 million. 

Meanwhile, key branded product, Copaxone, continued to impress with global
in-market sales increasing 28% to $796 million. While US in-market sales
increased 19% to $513 million, ex-US in-market sales totaled $283 million, up
48%. Unfortunately, Mylan (Nasdaq: MYL) is looking to launch a generic version
of Copaxone. 

Teva is currently seeking approval for a new formulation of Copaxone which could
hit the market early next year.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

A Modest Beat for Cisco

Tech giant Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) has just posted another positive
earnings surprise. Its fiscal third quarter (ended April) 2010 earnings per
share (EPS) of 37 cents, on revenues of $2.2 billion, topped the Zacks Consensus
Estimate by 3 cents per share. (Zacks accounts for employee stock-based
compensation, whereas other firms may not.) Revenue growth increased 63% year
over year. 

These results are at record levels for both revenues and EPS, as pointed out by
Cisco CEO John Chambers. "Our innovation and operational engines are exceeding
our expectations," he went on to say, and that the company's Q3 "was probably
the strongest quarter in our history." 

Relative to expectations, these are typical Cisco Systems' results. Its 8.1%
positive earnings surprise in Q3 follows an average earnings beat of 12.4% over
the prior four quarters. In last year's Q3, Cisco reported 23 cents per share,
for a 9.5% positive earnings surprise. 

Cisco's results also typify current earnings season regarding other tech giants.
In their March quarters, Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) and IBM
(NYSE: IBM) posted positive earnings surprises of 7.14%, 13.16% and 1.55%,
respectively. 

Analysts have generally been in agreement regarding the direction of estimate
revisions over the past month, though the magnitude of adjustments has been
quite mild. We have seen estimate revisions, but they have had limited, if any,
impact on the Zacks Consensus estimate for this year and next. 

This lack of directional momentum is reflected in the stock`s current Zacks #3
Rank (Hold), though the company does have a longer-term Outperform
recommendation from Zacks Equity Research. That said, the stock is down 3.5% (94
cents) in after-market trading Wednesday. 

Logitech Tops Zacks Consensus

Logitech International SA (Nasdaq: LOGI) announced fourth-quarter revenues of
$525 million, up 29% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share was 14 cents,
exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents. 

Gross margin was at 35.8%, up from 25% in the corresponding prior-year quarter
and by 1.9% from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in gross margin
was primarily due to the combination of the weaker US dollar compared with the
prior year, operational efficiencies across supply chain including lower product
costs as well as the benefits from higher inventory turns and faster inventory
in the channel and favorable product mixtures. 

Logitech`s retail sales for the fourth quarter grew by 27% year over year, with
sales up by 54% in the Americas, 15% in Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA),
and 10% in Asia. Sales generated by original equipment manufacturers grew by 1%.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Dillard's (NYSE: DDS) as the Bull of the Day
and Genzyme (Nasdaq: GENZ) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS), Credit Suisse
Group (NYSE: CS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Dillard's (NYSE: DDS) is large departmental store chain, featuring fashion
apparel and home furnishings. Management is undertaking restructuring
initiatives and inventory reduction efforts to save costs and boost
profitability, which augur well for future operating performance. 

Moreover, the company has a strong balance sheet. And for the fourth quarter of
2009, the company reported strong results with earnings of $1.03 which outpaced
the Zacks Consensus of $0.50. 

Our long-term recommendation on Dillard's is Outperform as we anticipate it to
perform well above the broader market. However, intense competition from other
established players and factors such as consumer preferences and spending
patterns undermines the company's future growth prospects and profitability. 

Bear of the Day: 

Genzyme (Nasdaq: GENZ) has been under a lot of pressure over the past few
quarters following the temporary shutdown of its Allston manufacturing facility
due to contamination problems. 

While we are pleased to see that Genzyme is taking steps to emerge from the
impact of the temporary shutdown of the Allston plant, we believe that the
company may face additional challenges before it is able to go back to a normal
production and supply schedule. Moreover, the FDA is looking to enforce a
consent decree on the company which would result in Genzyme incurring additional
costs. 

With the company yet to emerge fully from its manufacturing issues, we are
downgrading the stock to Underperform. Although Genzyme could receive some
positive news in the form of FDA approval of Lumizyme, we expect investor focus
to remain on the emerging pipeline, updates regarding the supply schedule of
Cerezyme and Fabrazyme, the FDA's enforcement action and updated guidance.

&lt;p&gt;NFPs Looking to Strengthen Membership Management, Donor Prospecting and
Relations, and Project and Grant Accounting to Meet at Summit on May 25 in
Manhattan
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The Not for Profit (NFP) Solution Center, a network of Microsoft Dynamics
partners, today announced that Microsoft Dynamics ERP and CRM continues to build
momentum as an industry standard for Financial Management, Fund Management,
Grant Management, Donor Management, Membership and Client Communications with
NFPs across the east coast, particularly in the New York and Washington DC Metro
regions. Many of these NFPs will be in attendance at the NGO Connection Day to
be held on May 25 at Microsoft`s Manhattan office. The event will feature a full
roster of keynotes from industry experts such as Dan McCormick, strategy
breakouts, and leading-edge technology demonstrations. 

Microsoft Dynamics solutions continue to receive affirmation that they are the
right solutions for NFPs. Two NFPs that have recently purchased Microsoft
Dynamics are The New Teacher Project and the National Fish and Wildlife
Foundation. 

The New Teacher Project (TNTP) (Brooklyn, NY) is the perfect example of a
fast-growing, high-energy NFP that relies on Microsoft Dynamics ERP solutions.
Founded by teachers, TNTP addresses the growing issues of teacher shortages and
teacher quality throughout the country. Wendy Chang, Chief Financial Officer,
recognized that TNTP needed full-featured ERP software to replace its numerous
manual processes, support its remarkable growth, and manage its workforce of
over 1,400 employees across the country. TNTP teamed with Microsoft partner Cole
Systems (New York, NY) to replace QuickBooks with Microsoft Dynamics AX. 

Ms. Chang said, "TNTP`s mission is to provide excellent teachers to the students
who need them most and to advance policies and practices that ensure effective
teaching in every classroom. The benefits we`ll receive from the new software
will be instrumental in helping TNTP achieve these goals. We expect to be able
to streamline our project tracking and billing processes, improve budget
tracking throughout the organization, automate financial reporting at both a
business unit and project level, and automate the budgeting and forecasting
processes." 

National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) (Washington, DC) is an NFP that
protects and restores the nation's wildlife species and habitats. Created by
Congress in 1984, NFWF works with a full complement of individuals, foundations,
government agencies, nonprofits, and corporations to identify and fund the
nation's most critical conservation challenges. With this challenge, NFWF has a
lengthy number of constituents it needs to track. The Foundation recently
implemented Microsoft Dynamics CRM with the assistance of Microsoft partner
BroadPoint Technologies (Bethesda, MD) in order to centralize this vast list. 

Joe Salerno, Director of Internet Services, said that there were many reasons
why NFWF selected Microsoft Dynamics CRM including the exceptional integration
with SharePoint which NFWF uses for intranet, extranet, and public-facing
websites. He also noted the wide range of third-party offerings for NFPs that
integrate well with Dynamics CRM. "We`re looking forward to using Dynamics CRM
as a complete, centralized contact database to manage and track every
relationship we have, ranging from vendors to donors." 

Lisa Malone has worked with many NFPs, including charities, foundations, social
welfare or advocacy organizations, and professional/trade associations over the
years in her role as a Microsoft Partner Account Manager. As the NFP Solution
Center manager, she has led the effort to develop strong ties between Microsoft,
the Microsoft partner community, and leaders at NFPs. She said that the NGO
Connection Day in Manhattan is designed to help NFP leadership meet with peers
to identify solutions to some of their pressing issues. 

Ms. Malone said, "As evidenced by the recent successes Microsoft Dynamics has
had with great organizations such as the TNTP and the NFWF, the Microsoft
partner community understands the needs of NFP executives and is poised to offer
valuable business and technology solutions to them. NFP executives in the New
York metro region will find great value at the event on May 25. The agenda is
full of peer presentations, case studies, examples, and ideas they can implement
immediately." 

The NGO Connection Day is complimentary for NFP professionals to attend however
pre-registration is required. The event will be held at the Microsoft Manhattan
office at 1290 Avenue of the Americas. The NGO Connection Day, held in
conjunction with the Microsoft Community Affairs organization, will bring top
NFP executive, IT and financial leadership together to learn about and discuss
the critical organizational issues facing them today.

&lt;p&gt; * Rajaratnam wants wiretap evidence removed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Hedge fund probe ensnared 21 defendants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Grant McCool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - Galleon hedge fund founder Raj
Rajaratnam wants evidence concerning Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) stock and a score of other stocks thrown out of a U.S.
government criminal case alleging insider trading, according to
court papers on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rajaratnam was arrested last October and charged along with
20 others in what prosecutors described as the biggest probe of
insider trading in hedge funds, and the first significant Wall
Street case to use secret telephone recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a filing on Thursday, Rajaratnam's lawyers said that of
21 stocks identified by the government in a March letter, 10
"were never mentioned in any of the government's applications
for authorization to wiretap Rajaratnam's telephone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The request to throw out this alleged evidence follows a
similar request on April 16 and a motion last Friday asking
U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell to suppress thousands of
recordings from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rajaratnam argued that an FBI agent's initial applications
to conduct wiretaps in the probe misled a judge because they
contained false statements. [ID:nN07201249]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government listed the stocks in letters to defense
lawyers dated March 22 and April 14, and also included ATT Inc
(T.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those stocks and others are not in the formal charges
against Rajaratnam that he illegally traded in 12 companies,
netting about $45 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The letters said he conspired to obtain material, nonpublic
information about the quarterly earnings of Goldman before
announcements in June and December 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said he also conspired to get confidential information
on the $5 billion purchase by Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) of Goldman preferred stock
before the September 2008 announcement of that transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal reported in April that former
Goldman director Rajat Gupta told Rajaratnam about Berkshire's
investment before it became public, citing an unidentified
source. Gupta's spokesman said he did nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government's applications to wiretap Mr. Rajaratnam's
telephone refer to 13 stocks which have never been identified
in any of the the government's letters or charging documents as
being at issue in this case," Thursday's brief by attorney John
Dowd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that the government "simply ignores the most
obvious question of all: Why, if it intended from the beginning
to prosecute Mr. Rajaratnam for trading or conspiring to trade
in all of the various stocks ... did it not simply identify
those in the criminal complaint or indictments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oral arguments on the wiretaps will be heard by Holwell on
June 17, according to court papers. His decision would be
published before the Oct. 25 start of the trial of Rajaratnam
and his principal co-defendant, Danielle Chiesi, a former
trader with New Castle Funds LLC in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cases are USA v Raj Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi,
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No.

    FEATURED PERFOMERS

    MITCHEL MUSSO
 Mitchel Musso, 18 years old, hails from Garland, Texas.
His big break into show business happened in 2002 when the then
12-year-old Mitchel and his younger brother Marc were cast as the nephews
of Michael Caine and Robert Duvall in the movie Secondhand Lions.
Numerous roles in films such as Monster House, as well as voice work on
the TV programs King of the Hill and Phineas and Ferb followed. But Musso
is arguably best known for his role as Oliver Oken on Disney Channel's
"Hannah Montana," and Hannah Montana, The Movie. 

    Musso is also an accomplished singer and songwriter. Playing piano,
guitar and drums, he has performed multiple times on "Hannah Montana,"
and also previously scored three Top 10 hits on Radio Disney. His remake
of the song "Lean On Me" was featured in the Disney film Snow Buddies and
on Radio Disney Jams Vol. 10. In 2009, Mitchel Musso released his first,
self-titled solo album, including a cover of "The In Crowd," which was
also featured on Radio Disney Jams, Vol 11. 

    JASON CASTRO
 Jason Castro, 22 years old, grew up in a musical family in
Rowlett, Texas, just outside of Dallas. Castro started playing drums in
the fifth grade and played in bands throughout high school. After
graduating, he entered Texas A University and bought a guitar because
he couldn't play drums in the dorm. "I couldn't sing when I picked up the
guitar," Castro says. "So I read about singing techniques on the
Internet, like how-to articles with breathing exercises, and taught
myself."

    As one of the cast members of the seventh season of American Idol, Castro
won over audiences with a number of memorable performances, including
"Over the Rainbow," "Daydream," and "Hallelujah." Castro was the show's
first-ever contestant to play an instrument onstage, accompanying himself
on acoustic guitar and ukulele. He finished as third place runner up on
the show. After the season's conclusion, Castro performed on the hugely
successful "American Idols LIVE! Tour 2008." At the conclusion of the
tour, he signed with Atlantic Records. His debut, self titled album was
released in April 2010 and includes his first single "Let's Just Fall In
Love Again." 

    Fam Jams! is proudly sponsored by B101 radio. Buzzbee and the crew from
B101 radio will be on hand to host the day's events. WBEB 101.1 FM (B101)
is an adult contemporary radio station broadcasting in the Philadelphia
market. Founded in 1963 by David L. Kurtz, B101 is credited with many
industry firsts. Owned and operated by Jerry Lee, it is the only
independently owned station that has enjoyed consistent Top 10 ratings
for decades.

    Fam Jams! is also sponsored by CBS 3 and The CW Philly. CBS 3 (KYW-TV)
and The CW Philly 57 (WPSG-TV) are part of CBS Television Stations, a
division of CBS Corporation.

    Public Programming at Penn's Landing would not be possible without the
continued support of corporate partners such as PECO, Verizon,
Pennsylvania Lottery, Live Nation, the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling
Company and the Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation, all
of whom are committed to serving the Greater Philadelphia community. 

    The 2010 Summer Program of Free Events at Penn's Landing is funded and

The Academy provides a forum for a select group of scholars, members of the
learned professions and government and business leaders to work together on
behalf of the democratic interests of the republic. It undertakes studies of
complex and emerging problems and its membership of scholars and practitioners

institutions; the humanities and culture and education.

Benjamin Franklin in the eighteenth century, Daniel Webster and Ralph Waldo
Emerson in the nineteenth century and Albert Einstein and Winston Churchill in
the twentieth century. The current membership includes more than 250 Nobel
laureates and more than 60 Pulitzer Prize winners. This year, the Academy
celebrates the 230th anniversary of its founding. 

"We are pleased to welcome Mr. Palmisano into the Academy," said Leslie
Berlowitz, chief executive officer and William T. Golden chair. "We look forward
to drawing upon his distinguished background in business and innovation. Mr.
Palmisano`s expertise and experience will aid the Academy in its mission to

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - In the movie "Ironman 2," Larry Ellison makes a cameo appearance as a billionaire, playboy software magnate. It is a role he knows well. He is playing himself -- chief executive of Oracle Corp, one of Silicon Valley's most enduring, successful and flamboyant figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 65, he is undertaking one of the biggest challenges of his career, and it's not playing Hamlet on Broadway. Oracle, the company Ellison founded three decades ago and built into dominant force in the software industry, is making a go at hardware with the acquisition of money-losing Sun Microsystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not entirely unlike MIT deciding to field a competitive football team, but Ellison being Ellison, he could not be less worried. "We have a wealth of technology to package into systems," said Ellison, who won the America's Cup in February. "I see no reason why we can't get this to where Sun under Oracle should be larger than Sun ever was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rare interview he discussed his turnaround efforts at Sun so far, revealed plans to purchase additional hardware companies and detailed new products that will launch in the near future. And he did so with his usual in-your-face style -- heaping all manner of abuse, for example, on Sun's previous managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 1990s, Sun prospered by selling high-end computers at top dollar to large corporations and dot-com start-ups. Its business peaked in 2001, then slid with the collapse of the Internet boom and never recovered, though the company is still widely respected for its technological prowess and the brain power of its engineering staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun came into play in November 2008 after IBM CEO Sam Palmisano made an overture to buy it. Oracle, which had been strictly a software maker, unexpectedly jumped in to outbid IBM by just 10 cents a share, paying a total of $5.6 billion in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Ellison says he is going to rebuild Sun's hardware business by using a strategy that helped IBM prosper in the 1960s: Selling computer systems built with standardized bundles of hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of skeptics doubt Ellison can pull it off. Sun lost $2.2 billion in its last fiscal year as an independent company. Conventional wisdom holds that he will end up divesting the company's hardware business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison has a pretty good track record when it comes to predicting where the industry is headed. Besides innovating the wildly lucrative relational database that bears Oracle's name, Ellison was quicker than most in creating software that works with both Internet technology and the widely used Linux operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also started buying up smaller software makers in 2003 when critics said his consolidation strategy was doomed to fail. It hasn't. "People have lost a lot of money second guessing Larry about IT strategy," said Dave Roux, co-founder of Silver Lake, the world's biggest private equity firm focused on technology, in which Ellison was an original investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's a very thoughtful and reasoned observer of the big tectonic forces that kind of go rippling through the industry," said Roux, who worked for Oracle before setting up Silver Lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison has maintained his status as the leader of a powerhouse in the topsy-turvy, protean technology world. IBM, which pioneered business computers, nearly collapsed in the 1990s, but then recovered as it aggressively expanded in services and software. Ellison's close friend Apple's Steve Jobs, was forced out of Apple, only to return a decade later to resurrect his company with the iPod. Meanwhile, Google has replaced Microsoft as the 'ubertech company' and occasional villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although his products are used by businesses only and not nearly as recognizable as Apple's Macs or Google's search engine, they've made Ellison the world's sixth-richest man, worth an estimated $28 billion, according to Forbes. Oracle counts the bulk of the world's major corporations as customers, and the company's market value now tops that of Hewlett-Packard, the world's top maker of personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STARING AT SUN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison says he has already stopped the carnage at Sun, less than four months after the sale closed in January. "Their management made some very bad decisions that damaged their business and allowed us to buy them for a bargain price," he told Reuters. He added that he expects profit from Sun's operations to boost Oracle's earnings in the current quarter, which ends May 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration has proceeded swiftly, says Ellison, because a protracted antitrust review in Europe gave Oracle time to draw up an exhaustive plan for resuscitating Sun. In typical Ellison fashion, he took a hands-on approach to the integration, choosing to meet directly with technical managers at Sun as often as four days a week to diagnose its problems, rather than delegating the work to underlings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Barrenechea, a former Oracle executive who used to sit in on weekly engineering meetings with Ellison and is now CEO of specialty computer maker Silicon Graphics International Corp., says this is what Ellison does best. "He doesn't write the code. He doesn't solder resisters onto motherboards. But he understands how all the pieces fit together and how he wants the building to look," said Barrenechea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ellison started scrutinizing Sun, he says he found plenty wrong: lots of waste among the billions of dollars that had gone into RD in recent years. The hardware maker had cut back the sales staff that sold its most profitable products, including its business computers and storage equipment, causing sales and earnings to decline. It operated an antiquated manufacturing and distribution system. It regularly sold hardware and software at a loss, sometimes losing more than $1 million on a single deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oracle is much more disciplined on the financial side. Much more detail oriented," said John Fowler, head of Oracle's new hardware division and the most senior Sun manager to survive the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison says he learned that Sun's pony-tailed chief executive, Jonathan Schwartz, ignored problems as they escalated, made poor strategic decisions and spent too much time working on his blog, which Sun translated into 11 languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The underlying engineering teams are so good, but the direction they got was so astonishingly bad that even they couldn't succeed," said Ellison. "Really great blogs do not take the place of great microprocessors. Great blogs do not replace great software. Lots and lots of blogs does not replace lots and lots of sales."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz declined comment as did Sun co-founder and former Chairman Scott McNealy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start, Ellison shut down one of Schwartz's pet projects -- development of the "Rock" microprocessor for Sun's high-end SPARC server line, a semiconductor that had struggled in development for five years as engineers sought to overcome a string of technical problems. "This processor had two incredible virtues: It was incredibly slow and it consumed vast amounts of energy. It was so hot that they had to put about 12 inches of cooling fans on top of it to cool the processor," said Ellison. "It was just madness to continue that project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More infuriating, says Ellison, is that Sun routinely sold equipment at a loss because it was more focused on boosting revenue than generating profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sales staff was compensated based on deal size, not profit. So the commission on a $1 million sale that generated $500,000 in profit was the same as one that cost the company $100,000, he said. "The sales force could care less if they sold things that lost money because the commission was the same in either case," he said. Ellison added that Sun also lost money when it resold high-end storage equipment from Hitachi Ltd, storage software from Symantec Corp and consulting services from other companies. Oracle is ending those deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison has been pruning Sun's line of low-end servers, an area where it lost money as it tried to compete in volume with market leaders Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell Corp. Sun never gained enough share to make it price competitive, but Ellison says that Sun became so desperate to goose the unit's revenue the company would pay a fortune to charter planes during the last two days of a quarter so that it could book extra sales for the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REORG OF A SALES FORCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Sun outsourced much of its sales, counting on resellers to promote its products. That's anathema at Oracle, which employs 22,000 salespeople and 11,000 software consultants who work directly with its largest customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One casualty of that strategy was StorageTek, a maker of tape storage systems for mainframe computers, which Sun bought for $4 billion in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Astonishingly they laid off all the sales people and they laid off all the field service people. They just got rid of them all," he said. "Guess what? Sales dropped. It's breathtaking!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result: Sun went from being tied with IBM as the market leader in 2005 to No. 2 in 2009, when its $474 million in sales were about half those of IBM, according to data from IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day the acquisition closed, Oracle advertised openings for some 2,000 hardware sales reps, which would almost double Sun's previous sales force of 3,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have their work cut out. Sun's share of the server and storage markets slipped last year as the company's pending sale raised uncertainty about its future. It slid from second to third place last year in the $13 billion UNIX server market behind IBM and HP, while sales of its storage gear plunged 27 percent, according to IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Ellison is looking to win back customers by boosting investment in Sun's key technologies -- including the SPARC microprocessor chip, the brain of its elite server line; the Solaris operating system that runs those computers, and the MySQL database as well as the widely used Java computer language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's picking the Sun technologies that are commercializable and focusing on those, and ignoring those that are not. They are just science projects," said Ellison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LESSONS LEARNED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he enters the hardware business, Ellison is looking to repeat the success he had with his last big strategy shift -- an acquisition spree that began in June 2003 with a hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft, a maker of programs for managing human resources. Prior to that, Ellison was known to mock advisers who recommended that he consider acquisitions, saying "we write software, we don't write checks." But he changed gears after more than a decade of unsuccessful attempts to design his own business management software, an area where Germany's SAP AG was rapidly consolidating its lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time there were few examples of successful acquisitions in the software industry, let alone hostile deals, but the purchase proved a winner, and Oracle has since spent more than $35 billion buying some five dozen software makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said it's going to get harder and harder to build on our business because we have such a large market share. When everybody else was standing on the sidelines, he went deep and he went long," said Howard Anderson, a lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle quickly cuts duplicate costs and waste at a newly acquired company, boosting its margins and absorbing its technologies. Meanwhile it cross sells its vast line of business software to an acquired firm's existing customers while generating revenue from maintenance services for the programs they already use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders have benefited. Oracle's stock price has nearly doubled since Ellison began his shopping spree, compared with a 21 percent gain in the SP 500 Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEAL TIME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison said he will expand further in hardware, adding providers of semiconductor, storage and server technologies to his list of acquisition targets. "We'll buy in all areas of our business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is looking for technologies he can incorporate into what Oracle is betting will be its next line of blockbuster products: gigantic appliances made up of servers, storage equipment, networking gear and software working together to handle specialized tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything is tweaked at the factory for optimal performance in the data center. "We don't want customers making those decisions. They never quite tune it the way we would," said Oracle President Charles Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach traces back to Ellison's strategy for building his software business. He has spent two decades telling customers that they should buy pre-integrated software business management suites from Oracle, rather than dealing with myriad vendors. His mantra: best of breed is good for dog shows, but not software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where we think we'll make our money -- where we think we're able to differentiate ourselves from IBM and everybody else -- is by building complete and integrated systems from silicon all the way up through the software, all prepackaged together," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His first appliance was developed as engineers found that hardware bottlenecks slowed the pace at which computers could process information stored in Oracle's database software. So the company forged a deal with Hewlett-Packard to jointly develop an appliance known as the Exadata database machine, whose chief components were Oracle's database software and an HP x86 server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison introduced that first appliance in 2008 with the intention of developing other machines with HP. But when Oracle had a chance to buy Sun, Ellison ditched HP and entered the hardware business on his own. Last year he unveiled Exadata, version 2, based on Sun technology, which he says initially has nearly $1 billion in potential sales and will likely have annual sales measured in the billions of dollars within a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine costs more than $1 million, stands over 6 feet tall, is two feet wide and weighs a full ton. It is capable of storing vast quantities of data, allowing businesses to analyze information at lightening fast speeds or instantly process commercial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But rivals remain unimpressed. They say that Exadata does not provide customers enough flexibility to customize the systems to meet their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's got a very narrow band of applicability. It's a one trick pony that has no ability to integrate," said Dave Gelardi, vice president of systems strategy at IBM, which sells more than 20 types of computer systems optimized for specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also has the world's largest technology services organization, which generates billions of dollars a year in fees by helping companies build customized systems. "We don't say 'The answer is Exadata. What's the question?' We operate from the perspective 'What is the business problem you are trying to solve?'" says Gelardi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard and Dell followed IBM's example of building a large services organization over the past two years with their acquisitions of EDS and Perot Systems. Ellison says he's not going down that path. While Oracle will maintain a relatively small force of consultants, his strategy is to do most of the integration work in the factory, based on the Exadata model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE NEXT STEP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He plans to unveil at least two new appliances in September, when the company holds its annual Oracle World customer conference in San Francisco, a gathering that had some 40,000 attendees last year, making it the world's biggest tech users conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine that will likely get the most attention is one that will run Oracle's yet-to-be-released next-generation suite of business management programs, dubbed Fusion Apps, which will compete with SAP's existing software line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That appliance will include servers, networking equipment and storage gear along with a database, middleware and the Fusion Apps programs. Oracle has spent five years and billions of dollars developing the software, which helps businesses manage accounting, human resources, sales and marketing as well as more specialized tasks for companies in industries including financial services, telecommunications, healthcare and retailing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellison says he will also show off an appliance that runs Oracle's so-called middleware -- the plumbing of a data center's software network, performing tasks such as helping various computer systems communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His key rival in this area, too, is IBM. And that fight won't be easy -- or short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ellison says he expects to see it through and has no plans to leave Oracle any time soon. "They may kick me out, but I have no plans to retire," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Jim Impoco, Ted Kerr and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Fraud Diagnostic Rating Tool Identifies Risks

Positive Pay, Reverse Positive Pay Now Available Through an Additional Online
Channel
Payables Web Services Offers Immediate Use of Tools to Clients Affected by Fraud


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan`s Treasury Services business, a full-service provider of cash
management, trade finance and treasury solutions, today announced enhancements
to its suite of fraud protection tools. A new Fraud Diagnostic Tool will rate
client`s vulnerability to fraud and recommend solutions to tighten security.
J.P. Morgan also now offers its patent-pending Positive Pay and Reverse Positive
Pay solution through Chase Commercial OnlineSM for the first time and has
enhanced its Payables Web Services offering to immediately make available tools
to help protect clients impacted by fraudulent activity against their accounts.
These enhancements will help clients mitigate the persistent threat of check
fraud. 

Fraud continues to be a critical issue for corporates as confirmed by a 2010
survey on fraud fielded by the Association for Financial Professionals (AFP) and
sponsored by J.P. Morgan. Nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of organizations
polled experienced attempted or actual payments fraud in the last year. 

"At J.P. Morgan, we are very aware of the negative impact of fraud attacks on
our clients` accounts," explained Stephen Markwell, Vice President, J.P. Morgan
Treasury Services. "We believe it is our responsibility as a banking partner to
maintain a dialogue with our clients about fraud and fraud protection in order
to help them guard their accounts from being compromised." 

Electronic Tools Deliver Vital Protection

J.P. Morgan has introduced these new enhancements to prevent attacks on clients`
accounts:

* The Fraud Diagnostic Tool rates clients` accounts for fraud risk, identifying
those that need additional protection. Recommendations on the most appropriate
fraud tools to deploy to best protect those accounts are then provided to
clients. 
* Positive Pay/Reverse Positive Pay is now available through Chase Commercial

&lt;p&gt;CitrixNetScaler VPX adds support for Hyper-V Delivering Internet-class
Availability and Performance for Microsoft Virtual Datacenter Environments 
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Today at Citrix Synergy, the event where virtualization, networking and cloud
computing meet, Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) announced its popular Citrix
NetScaler VPX virtual appliance will add extensive support for business-critical
Microsoft datacenter and infrastructure solutions, including Microsoft Hyper-V,
Microsoft System Center and key Microsoft enterprise applications like
SharePoint 2010 and Exchange Server 2010. As a result, Microsoft datacenter
administrators will now be able to apply all the same NetScaler acceleration,
load balancing and security features that power many of the world`s largest
datacenters, as a native Hyper-V workload from directly within System Center -
with no networking knowledge or configuration required. 

As a native Windows-based solution, NetScaler VPX not only provides reliable
acceleration, security and load balancing services necessary for delivering
Microsoft applications, it also includes the intuitive capabilities of Citrix
AppExpert Policy Manager, which provides pre-built and customizable templates
designed for all popular enterprise applications. In addition to offering
NetScaler VPX for Hyper-V, Citrix is now offering AppExpert templates for
Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and SharePoint 2010, giving Microsoft datacenter
managers the ability to ensure the best application performance and reliability
with zero configuration or tuning needed. 

Once in production, NetScaler VPX virtual appliances on Hyper-V can be
seamlessly managed via Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) and
System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM). SCOM-based management allows
datacenter managers to leverage System Center as a common management console for
monitoring the health and availability of the virtual environment, as well as
the performance of resources managed by NetScaler. If application performance
conditions fall below established service level agreements, capacity can be
scaled automatically using the Performance and Resource Optimization (PRO)
feature of Microsoft SCVMM. Tight management integration between Citrix
NetScaler and Microsoft System Center allows enterprises to deploy a single,
software-based virtual delivery stack for Microsoft applications that can be
jointly managed and monitored - a feat that is simply not possible with
traditional networking products. 

Quotes

Dai Vu, Director of Virtualization Solutions Marketing, Microsoft Corp.

"We have been working closely with Citrix to offer customers comprehensive and
cost-effective solutions from the desktop to the datacenter. As a result, Citrix
support for Hyper-V, along with the new NetScaler AppExpert templates for
Exchange Server and SharePoint, provides enterprise customers a simplified
virtual infrastructure that significantly enhances the delivery of Microsoft
applications."

Klaus Oestermann, Vice President and General Manager, Networking and Cloud
Product Group, Citrix Systems, Inc.

"The ability of Citrix NetScaler to support Microsoft Hyper-V and Microsoft
System Center brings an entirely new level of sophistication to the virtual
datacenter.With the rapid transition to Microsoft Exchange 2010 and SharePoint
2010, it is more critical than ever to intelligently construct a virtual
infrastructure for these application environments. With NetScaler VPX now
available as a native Windows service, optimized delivery of Microsoft
applications is now simple and seamless."

Cindy Borovick, Vice President, IDC

"The datacenter is moving to a virtualized IT environment. IDC believes that the
drivers for vitalized load balancing are similar to server vitalization in that
customers value the cost savings and IT flexibility of the offerings," says
Lucinda Borovick, vice president, Data Center Networks. "By expanding the IT
capabilities to include Microsoft Hyper V Citrix is bringing resiliency and
flexibility into the virtualized datacenter."

* Fully Virtualized Delivery Infrastructure for Microsoft 2010 Apps - Citrix

* NetScaler VPX Support Extended to Microsoft Hyper-V - NetScaler VPX virtual
appliances now run on Hyper-V, delivering native Windows load balancing,
acceleration and security in a flexible range of capacities and cost-effective

AppExpert Templates support Exchange Server 2010 and SharePoint 2010, making it

&lt;p&gt;Visa Adds 4,000 Locations in Further Expansion of Prepaid Reload Capabilities
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) today announced
plans to rollout Visa ReadyLink - Visa`s prepaid reload network - in 4,000
Marathon Brand retail stations. To date the service has rolled out to
approximately 2,000 locations, with the remainder expected to be active by the
end of 2010. Marathon markets through approximately 4,600 branded locations in
18 states in the Midwest and Southeast U.S. 

By introducing Visa ReadyLink, Marathon will enable consumers to load funds to
their eligible Visa Prepaid cards at thousands of convenient locations. Nearly
45,000 merchant locations nationwide have introduced or are in the process of
implementing Visa ReadyLink, further extending the convenience and security of
reload services to Visa prepaid cardholders in more convenient, everyday
shopping locations. 

The Visa ReadyLink service helps Visa`s client financial institutions and
merchant partners better meet the needs of financially underserved consumers.
According to Visa estimates, there are approximately 80 million underserved
consumers in the U.S. - those who lack access to a payment card or are without a
traditional banking relationship. 

"Our relationship with Marathon brings greater access and convenient services to
Visa prepaid cardholders in locations where they shop every day," said Brian
Triplett, head of global prepaid products, Visa Inc. "The expansion of Visa
ReadyLink to thousands of new locations helps to make prepaid products an
increasingly relevant money management tool for consumers, while enabling our
merchant and financial institution partners to better serve their customers." 

"Our customers are looking for a greater variety of secure and convenient
payment options," said Craig Weigand, Marathon`s Advertising and Credit Card
manager. "Providing Visa ReadyLink is just one more way we can bring our
customers value by providing greater access to the services they need."

&lt;p&gt;INDIANAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today filed suit seeking payment owed by the State of Indiana
for IBM's work to revamp and modernize Indiana's antiquated and highly
inefficient welfare eligibility system. 

The suit, filed in Marion County, Indiana, seeks recovery of fees and expenses
owed to IBM under a contract signed with the Family and Social Services
Administration (FSSA) in 2006. 

The State announced in October 2009 that it had decided to change course and
would no longer use IBM as the prime contractor for the project. Although the
contract gives Indiana the right to take such action, it also requires that it
pay IBM certain amounts, including deferred fees and equipment costs, if it
terminates the contract "for any reason." By refusing to honor certain contract
provisions, while at the same time relying on other provisions to remove IBM
from the project, the State threatens to undermine the integrity of a public
procurement process under which thousands of private companies conduct business
with Indiana expecting and depending on the State to fulfill its contractual
commitments. 

Specifically at issue in the suit are expenses IBM incurred at the outset of the
project but, as an accommodation to the State, agreed to defer payment to spread
costs more evenly over the 10-year project. Under the contract, payment of those
expenses is owed to IBM if it is removed from the project "for any reason." 

The FSSA is in the process of implementing a "hybrid" system using IBM
technology, infrastructure, applications, automated processes and systems. The
FSSA has announced that the hybrid system has been so successful that it wants
to expand it - underscoring IBM's contributions to an improved welfare
eligibility system in the State. 

IBM, in partnership with and directed by the FSSA, worked to revamp a welfare
eligibility system described by Governor Mitch Daniels prior to IBM's
involvement as "broken" and one of the worst in the nation because of extensive
fraud, high error rates, long customer wait times, onerous requirements that
applicants appear in person at county processing offices, and slow progress in
moving people from welfare to work. 

Under the FSSA's close supervision, IBM rolled out a revised eligibility system
to 59 Indiana counties during a time of dramatically increased demand for
welfare services because of the deteriorating state and national economies and
statewide natural disasters. 

Results acknowledged by the State include:

* A simplified and more accurate application process via a Web portal, call
centers and automation that makes it easier for persons to apply for
benefitsfrom their home, libraries or any PC connected to the Internet;

* Curtailing fraud that was estimated to cost Indiana taxpayers $100 million a
year prior to IBM beginning work on the project;

* Reduction of Indiana's operating expenses by approximately $40 million per
year for 2008 and 2009 and projected savings of hundreds of millions of dollars
in coming years;

* Creation of 1,000 new private-sector, high quality jobs;

* Ability for agencies assisting clients to view case files electronically and
better advocate on behalf of their client.

IBM is not disputing its removal from the project. In its court filing, IBM
acknowledges that the contract gives Indiana the right to replace it as the lead
contractor and that "All IBM seeks are those payments that the State promised
would be paid to IBM in the event that the State chose to terminate."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LESSONS LEARNED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  As he enters the hardware business, Ellison is looking to
repeat the success he had with his last big strategy shift --
an acquisition spree that began in June 2003 with a hostile
takeover bid for PeopleSoft, a maker of programs for managing
human resources. Prior to that, Ellison was known to mock
advisers who recommended that he consider acquisitions, saying
"we write software, we don't write checks."  But he changed
gears after more than a decade of unsuccessful attempts to
design his own business management software, an area where
Germany's SAP AG (SAPG.DE) was rapidly consolidating its lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the time there were few examples of successful
acquisitions in the software industry, let alone hostile deals,
but the purchase proved a winner, and Oracle has since spent
more than $35 billion buying some five dozen software makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He said it's going to get harder and harder to build on
our business because we have such a large market share. When
everybody else was standing on the sidelines, he went deep and
he went long," said Howard Anderson, a lecturer at the MIT
Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oracle quickly cuts duplicate costs and waste at a newly
acquired company, boosting its margins and absorbing its
technologies. Meanwhile it cross sells its vast line of
business software to an acquired firm's existing customers
while generating revenue from maintenance services for the
programs they already use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders have benefited. Oracle's stock price has
nearly doubled since Ellison began his shopping spree, compared
with a 21 percent gain in the SP 500 Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  DEAL TIME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Ellison said he will expand further in hardware, adding
providers of semiconductor, storage and server technologies to
his list of acquisition targets. "We'll buy in all areas of our
business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is looking for technologies he can incorporate into what
Oracle is betting will be its next line of blockbuster
products: gigantic appliances made up of servers, storage
equipment, networking gear and software working together to
handle specialized tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everything is tweaked at the factory for optimal
performance in the data center. "We don't want customers making
those decisions. They never quite tune it the way we would,"
said Oracle President Charles Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This approach traces back to Ellison's strategy for
building his software business. He has spent two decades
telling customers that they should buy pre-integrated software
business management suites from Oracle, rather than dealing
with myriad vendors. His mantra: best of breed is good for dog
shows, but not software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Where we think we'll make our money -- where we think
we're able to differentiate ourselves from IBM and everybody
else -- is by building complete and integrated systems from
silicon all the way up through the software, all prepackaged
together," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His first appliance was developed as engineers found that
hardware bottlenecks slowed the pace at which computers could
process information stored in Oracle's database software. So
the company forged a deal with Hewlett-Packard to jointly
develop an appliance known as the Exadata database machine,
whose chief components were Oracle's database software and an
HP x86 server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ellison introduced that first appliance in 2008 with the
intention of developing other machines with HP. But when Oracle
had a chance to buy Sun, Ellison ditched HP and entered the
hardware business on his own. Last year he unveiled Exadata,
version 2, based on Sun technology, which he says initially has
nearly $1 billion in potential sales and will likely have
annual sales measured in the billions of dollars within a few
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The machine costs more than $1 million, stands over 6 feet
tall, is two feet wide and weighs a full ton. It is capable of
storing vast quantities of data, allowing businesses to analyze
information at lightening fast speeds or instantly process
commercial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  But rivals remain unimpressed. They say that Exadata does
not provide customers enough flexibility to customize the
systems to meet their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's got a very narrow band of applicability. It's a one
trick pony that has no ability to integrate," said Dave
Gelardi, vice president of systems strategy at IBM, which sells
more than 20 types of computer systems optimized for specific
tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM also has the world's largest technology services
organization, which generates billions of dollars a year in
fees by helping companies build customized systems. "We don't
say 'The answer is Exadata. What's the question?' We operate
from the perspective 'What is the business problem you are
trying to solve?'" says Gelardi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hewlett-Packard and Dell followed IBM's example of building
a large services organization over the past two years with
their acquisitions of EDS and Perot Systems. Ellison says he's
not going down that path. While Oracle will maintain a
relatively small force of consultants, his strategy is to do
most of the integration work in the factory, based on the
Exadata model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE NEXT STEP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He plans to unveil at least two new appliances in
September, when the company holds its annual Oracle World
customer conference in San Francisco, a gathering that had some
40,000 attendees last year, making it the world's biggest tech
users conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The machine that will likely get the most attention is one
that will run Oracle's yet-to-be-released next-generation suite
of business management programs, dubbed Fusion Apps, which will
compete with SAP's existing software line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That appliance will include servers, networking equipment
and storage gear along with a database, middleware and the
Fusion Apps programs. Oracle has spent five years and billions
of dollars developing the software, which helps businesses
manage accounting, human resources, sales and marketing as well
as more specialized tasks for companies in industries including
financial services, telecommunications, healthcare and
retailing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ellison says he will also show off an appliance that runs
Oracle's so-called middleware -- the plumbing of a data
center's software network, performing tasks such as helping
various computer systems communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His key rival in this area, too, is IBM. And that fight
won't be easy -- or short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Ellison says he expects to see it through and has no
plans to leave Oracle any time soon. "They may kick me out, but
I have no plans to retire," he said.

&lt;p&gt; * Oracle CEO Ellison says he is already turning around Sun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * He blasts Sun's previous leaders for damaging the company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * But can a software maker figure out the hardware world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * And after his Ironman 2 cameo, what's next for Ellison?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, May 12 (Reuters) - In the movie "Ironman 2," Larry
Ellison makes a cameo appearance as a billionaire, playboy
software magnate. It is a role he knows well. He is playing
himself -- chief executive of Oracle Corp ORCL.O, one of
Silicon Valley's most enduring, successful and flamboyant
figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At age 65, he is undertaking one of the biggest challenges
of his career, and it's not playing Hamlet on Broadway. Oracle,
the company Ellison founded three decades ago and built into
dominant force in the software industry, is making a go at
hardware with the acquisition of money-losing Sun
Microsystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is not entirely unlike MIT deciding to field a
competitive football team, but Ellison being Ellison, he could
not be less worried. "We have a wealth of technology to package
into systems," said Ellison, who won the America's Cup in
February. "I see no reason why we can't get this to where Sun
under Oracle should be larger than Sun ever was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a rare interview he discussed his turnaround efforts at
Sun so far, revealed plans to purchase additional hardware
companies and detailed new products that will launch in the
near future. And he did so with his usual in-your-face style --
heaping all manner of abuse, for example, on Sun's previous
managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the 1990s, Sun prospered by selling high-end
computers at top dollar to large corporations and dot-com
start-ups. Its business peaked in 2001, then slid with the
collapse of the Internet boom and never recovered, though the
company is still widely respected for its technological prowess
and the brain power of its engineering staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun came into play in November 2008 after IBM (IBM.N) CEO
Sam Palmisano made an overture to buy it. Oracle, which had
been strictly a software maker, unexpectedly jumped in to
outbid IBM by just 10 cents a share, paying a total of $5.6
billion in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Ellison says he is going to rebuild Sun's hardware
business by using a strategy that helped IBM prosper in the
1960s: Selling computer systems built with standardized bundles
of hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plenty of skeptics doubt Ellison can pull it off. Sun lost
$2.2 billion in its last fiscal year as an independent company.
Conventional wisdom holds that he will end up divesting the
company's hardware business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ellison has a pretty good track record when it comes to
predicting where the industry is headed. Besides innovating
the wildly lucrative relational database that bears Oracle's
name, Ellison was quicker than most in creating software that
works with both Internet technology and the widely used Linux
operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also started buying up smaller software makers in 2003
when critics said his consolidation strategy was doomed to
fail. It hasn't. "People have lost a lot of money second
guessing Larry about IT strategy," said Dave Roux, co-founder
of Silver Lake, the world's biggest private equity firm focused
on technology, in which Ellison was an original investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He's a very thoughtful and reasoned observer of the big
tectonic forces that kind of go rippling through the industry,"
said Roux, who worked for Oracle before setting up Silver
Lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ellison has maintained his status as the leader of a
powerhouse in the topsy-turvy, protean technology world. IBM,
which pioneered business computers, nearly collapsed in the
1990s, but then recovered as it aggressively expanded in
services and software. Ellison's close friend Apple's (AAPL.O)
Steve Jobs, was forced out of Apple, only to return a decade
later to resurrect his company with the iPod. Meanwhile, Google
(GOOG.O) has replaced Microsoft (MSFT.O) as the 'ubertech
company' and occasional villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although his products are used by businesses only and not
nearly as recognizable as Apple's Macs or Google's search
engine, they've made Ellison the world's sixth-richest man,
worth an estimated $28 billion, according to Forbes. Oracle
counts the bulk of the world's major corporations as customers,
and the company's market value now tops that of Hewlett-Packard
(HPQ.N), the world's top maker of personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STARING AT SUN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ellison says he has already stopped the carnage at Sun,
less than four months after the sale closed in January. "Their
management made some very bad decisions that damaged their
business and allowed us to buy them for a bargain price," he
told Reuters. He added that he expects profit from Sun's
operations to boost Oracle's earnings in the current quarter,
which ends May 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The integration has proceeded swiftly, says Ellison,
because a protracted antitrust review in Europe gave Oracle
time to draw up an exhaustive plan for resuscitating Sun. In
typical Ellison fashion, he took a hands-on approach to the
integration, choosing to meet directly with technical managers
at Sun as often as four days a week to diagnose its problems,
rather than delegating the work to underlings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Barrenechea, a former Oracle executive who used to sit
in on weekly engineering meetings with Ellison and is now CEO
of specialty computer maker Silicon Graphics International
Corp. (SGI.O), says this is what Ellison does best. "He doesn't
write the code. He doesn't solder resisters onto motherboards.
But he understands how all the pieces fit together and how he
wants the building to look," said Barrenechea.
&lt;/p&gt;

PASADENA, Kalifornien &amp; LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Der Disney Store ist bereit f&#252;r eine Neudefinierung des Einzelhandels f&#252;r Kinder
und lanciert in diesem Sommer ein neues zauberhaftes Store-Design in wichtigen
M&#228;rkten in den USA und Europa. Das innovative Design der Disney Stores wird zum
ersten Mal im Juni im Einkaufszentrum &#8222;The Shops at Montebello" im
kalifornischen Montebello in der N&#228;he von Los Angeles enth&#252;llt. Darauf folgt im
Juli die europ&#228;ische Premiere im Einkaufszentrum &#8222;La Vaguada" in der spanischen
Hauptstadt Madrid. Als einzigartiges Einkaufsziel, das aus Kinderperspektive
heraus entwickelt wurde, wird in den neu gestalteten L&#228;den modernste Technologie
eingesetzt, um ein verbessertes Einkaufserlebnis inspiriert von den beliebtesten
Disney-Figuren und -Geschichten zu schaffen. 

&#8222;Wir haben alle Aspekte dieses einzigartigen Einkaufserlebnisses in
Disney-Zauber getaucht und erstklassige Einkaufszentren f&#252;r die Lancierung des
Disney Stores der Zukunft ausgew&#228;hlt", sagte Jim Fielding, Pr&#228;sident von Disney
Stores Worldwide. &#8222;Besonderheiten mit Wiedererkennungswert wie das
Disney-Prinzessinnenschloss mit Zauberspiegel und das Disney-Store-Kino sind nur
zwei Elemente der fantastischen neuen L&#228;den, welche das Erlebnis jedes Kindes
und jeder Familie im neuen Disney Store bereichern werden." 

In diesem Jahr ist die Er&#246;ffnung von &#252;ber 20 neuen und umgestalteten Disney
Stores in erstklassigen Einkaufszentren in ganz Nordamerika und Europa
vorgesehen. Best&#228;tigt wurden in Nordamerika die Standorte Roosevelt Field Mall
in Garden City, New York, Santa Monica Place in Santa Monica, Kalifornien,
International Plaza in Tampa, Florida, Stockton Street in San Francisco,
Kalifornien, und Fashion Valley in San Diego, Kalifornien. Die europ&#228;ischen
Standorte decken vier M&#228;rkte ab, mit Er&#246;ffnungen in Spanien, Portugal, Italien
und Gro&#223;britannien. Dazu z&#228;hlen NorteShopping in Porto, Portugal, das Orio
Center in Bergamo, Italien, sowie Standorte in Gro&#223;britannien wie Centre MK in
Milton Keynes, Bon Accord Centre in Aberdeen und Donegal Place in Belfast. 

Jedes neue Gesch&#228;ft hat eine besondere Bedeutung und wird als wichtiger
Meilenstein im Wachstum und in der Entwicklung der Disney Stores gefeiert.

* Roosevelt Field wird das erste neu gestaltete Gesch&#228;ft sein, das an der
US-amerikanischen Ostk&#252;ste er&#246;ffnet wird. 
* Im August ist der Disney Store zusammen mit einer Anzahl exklusiver
Einzelh&#228;ndler an der Neuer&#246;ffnung des Einkaufszentrums &#8222;Santa Monica Place" in
der N&#228;he des legend&#228;ren Santa Monica Pier in S&#252;dkalifornien beteiligt. Santa
Monica Place ist ein modernes Einkaufs- und Gastronomieerlebnis, in dem
zeitgen&#246;ssischer Stil mit nachhaltiger Architektur verbunden wird, und der
Disney Store wird der auserlesenen Kundschaft ein umfassendes Sortiment an
einzigartigen Disney-Produkten anbieten. 
* Im Zentrum &#8222;International Plaza" in Tampa, Florida, wird sich der dem Walt
Disney World Resort am n&#228;chsten gelegene Disney Store befinden. Somit k&#246;nnen
Familien ab diesem Sommer beiden Orten einen Besuch abstatten. 
* Im &#8222;Fashion Valley" wird die feinste Auswahl an L&#228;den von San Diego in einem
wundersch&#246;nen Einkaufszentrum unter freiem Himmel versammelt sein, und auch der
neu gestaltete Disney Store wird dort in diesem Sommer er&#246;ffnet. 
* Der Disney Store gesellt sich zu weiteren Einzelh&#228;ndlern am historischen Union
Square von San Francisco, einer der gr&#246;&#223;ten Einkaufsgegenden in den Vereinigten
Staaten. Der Union Square wurde Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts zum
Einkaufs-Epizentrum von San Francisco - heute befinden sich exklusive Gesch&#228;fte
und Hotels rund um den Union Square, und Einkaufsm&#246;glichkeiten erstrecken sich
vom Hauptplatz aus &#252;ber mehrere H&#228;userblocks. 
* In Europa wird in Porto der erste Disney Store in Nordportugal und erst der
zweite im ganzen Land er&#246;ffnet, nachdem die Marke im Jahr 2007 auf dem Markt
erfolgreich eingef&#252;hrt wurde.

In jedem der im Jahr 2010 neu er&#246;ffneten Disney Stores werden an einem
bestimmten Tag 10 Prozent des Umsatzes an die Stiftung &#8222;Make-A-Wish Foundation"
in den USA, in Spanien, Italien und Portugal und an die &#8222;Great Ormond Street
Hospital Children`s Charity" in Gro&#223;britannien gespendet.

"Obviously, it is a driver for advertising," he said. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Reuters Insider show on: link.reuters.com/fev83k ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Azcarraga said the group's growth will be driven by pay-TV units' sales which in the first quarter outpaced those of broadcast TV. [nN29128937] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Pay-TV is growing a lot. Telecommunications and connectivity in Mexico is very important so obviously -- because we can lower the prices of connectivity and telecommunications &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- that business is growing a lot," he said. -- that business is growing a lot," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We definitely see a recovery. We see that 2010 is going to be way better that 2009 in developing regions like Latin America, and we see that recovery with depend a lot on the U.S. economy. And that, we believe, is rebounding." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Azcarraga said Televisa was still reviewing the strategy of its troubled publishing unit which sells 400 magazines in 20 countries in Latin America, adding the group was seeking to adapt profitable magazines to new technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said in February the strategy would be tweaked by the second quarter after the unit's sales fell 9.3 percent last year. [nN26249536] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Publishing has been difficult... at all the publishing companies around the world. We need to understand how we can go from the paper to the new technologies," Azcarraga said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We see a lot of opportunities. We are reinventing our publishing strategy... we look at which magazines are profitable and which are not and obviously those profitable magazines (will be) merging into new technologies." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He also said Televisa had been looking at several Central American cable companies but saw no M opportunities there and decided to focus on Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Reporting by Maria Kiselyova, Dmitry Sergeyev and Kiryl Sukhotski; writing by Maria Kiselyova; Editing by Mike Nesbit) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ((Moscow Newsroom, +7495 775 1242, moscow.newsroom@reuters.com))   Keywords: TELEVISA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2010.

&lt;p&gt;Newly Established Saban Brands to Manage and License Property

BANDAI NAMCO Group Named as Master Toy &amp; Video Game Licensee

LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Saban Capital Group, Inc., in cooperation with Toei Company Ltd., the original
Japanese creator of the Power Rangers television show, announced today that it
has acquired the Power Rangers property from The Walt Disney Company. The
acquisition represents the return of the global franchise to its original
developer, Haim Saban, who introduced the first Power Rangers series in 1993.
The acquisition includes worldwide rights to the brand as well as over 700
episodes produced over 17 years. 

Power Rangers marks the first property for Saban Brands, the recently formed
subsidiary of Saban Capital Group, Inc., which was created to manage and license
entertainment properties and consumer brands across media and consumer platforms
throughout the world. Concurrent with the acquisition of the Power Rangers
franchise, Saban Brands has announced a new, long-term master toy and video game
license agreement with BANDAI NAMCO Group. Bandai has been the toy partner for
Power Rangers since its inception. 

"Power Rangers is one of the world`s leading children`s entertainment properties
and we are delighted to see its return," said Haim Saban, chairman and chief
executive officer, Saban Capital Group, Inc. "We are also very proud and excited
to renew our long-standing partnership with Namco/Bandai and know that this
powerful combination of experience and capabilities will continue to support the
global success of Power Rangers." 

Following its introduction in 1993 on the Fox Kids Network, Power Rangers
quickly became the most watched children`s television program in the United
States. Emphasizing the importance of teamwork, responsibility and helping
others Power Rangers follows the always exciting and often humorous adventures
of a group of ordinary young people who "morphed" into superheroes. The series
has been translated into numerous languages and rose to become the #1 boys brand
in the world from 1993-97, based on toy sales and television ratings. The Walt
Disney Company acquired the franchise in 2001 as part of its purchase of Fox
Family Worldwide, which included Saban Entertainment and its library of
children`s programs. To date, Power Rangers has aired in over 60 countries and
the property`s licensed products and promotions have generated well over $5
billion worldwide. 

"I am confident that the talented management team at Saban Brands will expand
our licensing partnerships and capitalize on the significant growth potential of
this powerful brand," said Haim Saban.

PASADENA, California e Londra--(Business Wire)--
Disney Store &#232; in procinto di ridefinire la vendita al dettaglio per bambini,
lanciando un nuovo magico design per i suoi negozi nei maggiori mercati degli
Stati Uniti e dell'Europa quest'estate. L'innovativo design del Disney Store
sar&#224; svelato per la prima volta a giugno presso The Shops at Montebello a
Montebello, California, proprio fuori Los Angeles, seguito dalla prima europea
all'inizio di luglio a Madrid, in Spagna, a La Vaguada. Meta straordinaria
sviluppata con la prospettiva di un bambino, il nuovo design del negozio integra
l'ultimissima tecnologia per creare un'esperienza di shopping esaltante e
ispirata ai pi&#249; noti personaggi e storie di Disney. 

"Abbiamo infuso la magia di Disney in tutti gli elementi di questa esperienza al
dettaglio unica nel suo genere e abbiamo selezionato centri al dettaglio primari
per lanciare il Disney Store del futuro," ha dichiarato Jim Fielding, presidente
di Disney Stores Worldwide. "Caratteristiche speciali come il mitico castello
della Principessa Disney con lo specchio magico e il Teatro Disney Store sono
solo due degli elementi stupefacenti nel nuovo negozio che arricchiranno
l'esperienza di ogni bambino e di tutte le famiglie al Disney Store." 

E' in programma l'apertura di oltre 20 sedi Disney Store nuove e rinnovate
quest'anno nei centri al dettaglio principali in tutta l'America del Nord e in
Europa. Sono state confermate le sedi nord-americane per il Roosevelt Field Mall
a Garden City, New York; Santa Monica Place a Santa Monica, California;
l'International Plaza a Tampa, Florida; lo Stockton St. a San Francisco,
California; e il Fashion Valley a San Diego, California. Le sedi europee coprono
quattro mercati con inaugurazioni in Spagna, Portogallo, Italia e Regno Unito.
Queste comprendono il NorteShopping a Oporto, Portogallo; il Centro Orio a
Bergamo, Italia e le sedi del Regno Unito comprendono Centre MK a Milton Keynes,
Bon Accord Centre ad Aberdeen e Donegal Place a Belfast. 

Ciascun nuovo negozio ha un significato speciale e sar&#224; celebrato come
un'importante pietra miliare nella crescita ed evoluzione del Disney Store.

* Il Roosevelt Field sar&#224; il primo negozio dal nuovo design ad aprire nella
costa orientale degli Stati Uniti. 
* Ad agosto, Disney Store si unir&#224; a un gruppo di dettaglianti esclusivi per la
riapertura del nuovo centro commerciale Santa Monica Place vicino il leggendario
molo Santa Monica Pier in California meridionale. Il Santa Monica Place &#232; una
meta moderna per lo shopping e per la ristorazione che combina stili
contemporanei ad un'architettura sostenibile e Disney Store offrir&#224; un
assortimento vastissimo di prodotti unici Disney alla clientela d'&#233;lite. 
* Il Disney Store ad International Plaza a Tampa, Florida sar&#224; il pi&#249; vicino al
Walt Disney World Resort, permettendo alle famiglie una visita ad entrambi
questa estate. 
* Fashion Valley riunisce la pi&#249; raffinata collezione di San Diego di negozi
ubicati in uno splendido centro commerciale all'aperto e il Disney Store dal
nuovo design sar&#224; inaugurato l&#236; questa estate. 
* Disney Store si unir&#224; ai dettaglianti della storica Union Square di San
Francisco, una delle pi&#249; grandi aree di shopping degli Stati Uniti. Union Square
&#232; diventata l'epicentro di San Francisco ai primi del '900 e oggi negozi
eleganti e alberghi circondano Union Square e lo shopping si estende per isolati
dalla piazza centrale. 
* In Europa, Oporto sar&#224; il primo Disney Store ad aprire al nord del Portogallo
e solo il secondo ad aprire nel Paese, dopo il successo del lancio del marchio
sul mercato nel 2007.

Per ciascuna inaugurazione di un nuovo negozio nel 2010, Disney Store stabilir&#224;
una data in cui il 10 per cento delle vendite saranno donate alla Make-A-Wish

&lt;p&gt;KATHMANDU (Reuters Life!) - Foreign mountaineers who have climbed Mount Everest and another peak will get free Nepali visas for two years, part of a scheme to boost tourism in the Himalayan nation, a senior government official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 4,000 climbers have scaled the 8,850 meter (29,035 feet) Everest summit since it was first climbed by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953. Some 700 of these foreigners are said to be still alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will waive the visa fees for them to visit Nepal in 2010 and 2011 part of the Nepal Tourism Year plan," Ranjan Aryal, the most senior bureaucrat in the tourism ministry told Reuters this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Himalayan Nepal, home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains, including Mount Everest, has designated 2011 as the year to boost tourism. It plans to receive one million visitors next year, up from nearly half a million now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourism accounts for 4 percent of the gross domestic product but travel officials say political unrest, frequent general strikes and shutdowns of transportation and roads had hit the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said nearly 200 foreigners who have climbed Mount Dhaulagiri, the world's seventh highest at 8,167 meters (26,794 feet), would also get free visa this year and in 2011 as Nepal marks the 50th anniversary this week of the first ascent of Dhaulagiri by a Swiss-Austrian expedition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climbers will also get a 50 percent discount in climbing fees for Dhaulagiri for the rest of 2010 and all of next year as part of the celebrations, another official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each foreign climber has to pay $5,000 to the government as royalty for climbing Dhaulagiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Miral Fahmy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp launched an updated version of its Office software on Wednesday, aiming to keep its grip on the hugely profitable business application market while countering the challenge of free online alternatives from Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is upgrading its popular Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint applications and rolling out its own online versions to keep up with the new class of mobile, Web-connected users that has emerged since the last upgrade in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced several improvements on Wednesday, such as editing photos in Word, using video in PowerPoint, collaborating on documents and connecting email contacts to Facebook information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the biggest change is Microsoft's move into the "cloud" -- allowing users to manipulate documents stored on remote servers from anywhere -- where Google has been setting the pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate buyers of Office will have immediate access to Microsoft Office Web Apps -- online versions of Word, PowerPoint and Excel programs for Internet-connected phones and PCs -- but will pay more to use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordinary consumers will be able to use online versions free from next month through Microsoft's Windows Live service, which the company is hoping will entice customers to pay for the full software, which will cost between $100 and $500, depending on the level of features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online strategy marks a major shift for the Windows franchise -- with 500 million users according to Microsoft -- which has so far relied on software installed on PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It brings Microsoft into direct competition with Google Docs, stripped-down alternatives to Microsoft's core programs, which are available over the Internet with no need to download software. They are free for personal users and $50-per-user per year for companies. Google says it has picked up 25 million users since launching Docs almost four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts worry that the cost of offering online versions will put a dent in the profit of one of Microsoft's two great profit engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margins will fall, but overall revenue and profit will rise as Microsoft grabs a bigger slice of companies' tech budget, said Stephen Elop, head of Microsoft's Business Division, in an interview at an Office launch event in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Margins are lower as a percentage of revenue because we are purchasing hardware and providing services that involve people," said Elop. "But most importantly, the absolute profit is expected to go up as a result of cloud computing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's business division, which gets 90 percent of its sales from Office, averages around $2.8 billion profit per quarter. That is 47 percent of Microsoft's total profit so far this fiscal year, second only to Microsoft's core Windows operating system franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop said he hopes customer adoption for Office 2010 will be the quickest ever, as companies start to replace aging machines this year and may decide to upgrade to the new Windows 7 system and Office 2010 at the same time. He said 8.6 million people are already using Office 2010 in test versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the latest data from tech research firm Forrester, 81 percent of companies are running Office 2007, compared with only 4 percent using Google's online equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Forrester poll indicates almost a third of existing Office users plan to upgrade to Office 2010 within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft were up 2.0 percent to $29.45 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, May 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Australian Department for Immigration and Citizenship, DIAC, have
announced that certain applications have been suspended from 8th May. It
comes as part of a set of changes to the Immigration Program and will
include occupations on the Skilled Occupation List (SOL) designed to
attract higher skilled migrants.

    The visas included in the suspension are:


--  Skilled Independent (Migrant) visa (Subclass 175) 

--  Skilled Sponsored (Migrant) visa (Subclass 176) 

--  Skilled Regional Sponsored (Provisional) visa (Subclass 475) 


    Senator Chris Evans, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship claims
that the revised SOL is essential to ensure the occupational
profile of applicants for General Skilled Migration clearly reflects the
needs of the Australian labour market.

    Australia's State Migration Plans (SMP) will tie in with the release of
the SOL, which will be announced later on this month. The country is
known for having one of the strictest immigration programmes in the world
and prefers applications from more highly skilled migrants, which looks
set to continue and become even more of a stipulation is part of the new
plans.

    There will be priority processing for Australian visa applications from
people with skills listed on the SOL and the DIAC claim this will
increase processing times. However, the suspension is only expected to be
lifted by the end of June, yet whether or not this will happen remains to
be seen. Some think the delays may continue past this time frame. It all
rests on the new Points Test being brought out and the Cabinet passing
the SMP.

    Applications for visas that have already been submitted will be processed
as normal, however, and international students will not be affected by
the changes. Successful migration is vitally important to Australia's
economy and development, which is why they remain stringent on
maintaining a high level of skilled migrants. It is thought that English
skills marks required will become higher and work experience or the job
ready test will be essential, but it is hoped the SOL should make the
whole process quicker and easier.

    Until these conditions are finalised and approved though, the DIAC are
not permitting anymore people entrance into the country. While the
suspension continues amid claims the numbers of applications outweighs
the number of places in the country, those demands will increase by the
day as more and more Australian visa applications stack up.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and a consortium of other top banks are part of an effort to save ShoreBank Corp, a Chicago bank with Washington ties, a community activist close to the institution said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Citigroup (C.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) are helping raise the $125 million the troubled community development lender needs to avoid a government takeover, said the activist, Bill Brandt, chairman of the Illinois Finance Authority, a state economic development entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ShoreBank is just one of hundreds of small U.S. banks dealing with distressed loan portfolios. But it has built strong political ties, largely because of the national recognition it has received over the years for its efforts to extend loans to low-income communities and environmental causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank, whose website even boasts of a connection to President Barack Obama, and its plight have become a positive publicity opportunity for Wall Street banks facing increased scrutiny over their role in the recent financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My understanding is that Goldman Sachs has made a significant commitment and will act on this commitment today," Brandt said. "Whether this deal gets finally cooked is a Herculean task."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandt said Goldman agreed to contribute more than $20 million to help rescue the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been trying to burnish its image after confronting political pressures and populist anger over its quick turnaround and perceived lack of concern over the economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its image was further tarnished last month when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought fraud charges against the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is considering a financing package of about $15 million that would include converting existing debt to equity as well as a cash investment, a person familiar with the bank's plan said. The second-largest U.S. bank is already an investor in ShoreBank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with the capital-raising efforts said ShoreBank is $10 million to $15 million short of the $125 million capital target set by regulators. The bank hopes to obtain enough commitments on Friday to get the full amount required, the source said, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how quickly the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp could take the bank into receivership if it does not come up with a recapitalization plan that satisfies regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDIC typically announces the seizure of banks on Friday evenings, but regulators will hold off on seizures if there is a viable "white knight" investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ShoreBank, which has $2.3 billion in assets and is nationally recognized for its programs to lend to low-income communities, faces a Monday deadline to show it has met regulators' capital demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're working expeditiously on our capital raise, and we appreciate all parties, including a number of banks, who are supporting us in this effort," said Brian Berg, a spokesman for ShoreBank. He declined to name any institutions helping in the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein had discussions with FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair about helping the bank. The FDIC declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ShoreBank has kept a high profile in the community development world. It focuses on loans that contribute to environmental efforts and targets borrowers looking to convert deteriorated apartment buildings into income-producing properties, expand small businesses, and upgrade homes and property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was especially hard-hit during the recession, reporting a net operating loss of $53.6 million in 2009. In 2008 it eked out net operating income of $1.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helping lead the bank's capital efforts is prominent Washington figure Eugene Ludwig, former comptroller of the currency and now chief executive of Promontory Financial Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellen Seidman, a former head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, serves as executive vice president of national policy and partnership development at ShoreBank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seidman is also a founding council member in Goldman Sachs' "10,000 Small Businesses" initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berg was careful to note that no one within ShoreBank has reached out to anyone in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Karey Wutkowski in Washington and Steve Eder and Emily Flitter in New York; additional reporting by Elinor Comlay in New York; editing by John Wallace and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms, assigns Loss Severity (LS) ratings and Outlooks to J.P.
Morgan Commercial Mortgage Finance Corp.'s mortgage pass-through certificates,
series 1997-C5, as follows: 

--Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable. 

--$51.7 million class F at 'A-/LS2'; Outlook Stable. 

Fitch does not rate the following classes: 

--$2.5 million class E; 

--$36.1 million class G; 

--$363 thousand class H. 

In addition, classes A-1, A-2, A-3, B, C and D have paid in full. 

The affirmations are warranted by the limited pay down since the last Fitch
review. As of the April 2010 distribution date, the pool's aggregate certificate
balance has been reduced 91% to $90.7 million from $1.03 billion at issuance.
Twenty-nine loans remain in the pool. 

Currently there are 12 Fitch loans of concern (17%) due to declining occupancy
and/or debt service coverage ratios (DSCRs) less than 1.0 times (x). As of the
April 2010 distribution date, there is one loan (1%) in special servicing. The
Days Inn hotel is located in Orangeburg, SC and was transferred into special
servicing in July 2009 due to imminent default. Occupancy and DSCR on the
property is down owing to competition from other hotels in the market. The
borrower has been approved for a forbearance plan expiring in June 2010. 

Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining non-defeased loans by applying a
10% reduction to 2008 fiscal year-end net operating income and applying an
adjusted market cap rate between 7.5% and 10.5% to determine value. 

Similar to Fitch's prospective analysis of recent vintage CMBS, each loan also
underwent a refinance test by applying an 8% interest rate and 30-year
amortization schedule based on the stressed cash flow. Loans that could
refinance to a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25x or higher were considered to
payoff at maturity. Under this scenario, two are not expected to pay off at
maturity, with two loans incurring a loss when compared to Fitch's stressed
value. 

Additional information on Fitch's amended criteria for analyzing recent vintage
U.S. CMBS is available in the July 7, 2009 report, 'Surveillance Methodology for
Recent Vintage U.S. CMBS,' which is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' under

&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP ("Robbins Geller")
(http://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases/pfizerinc/) today announced that an amended class
action complaint will be filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. The amended complaint will be on behalf of
purchasers of Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer") (NYSE:PFE) publicly traded securities
during the period between January 19, 2006 and January 23, 2009 (the "Class
Period"). 

If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than 60
days from May 11, 2010. If you wish to discuss this action or have any questions
concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff`s
counsel, Darren Robbins of Robbins Geller at 800/449-4900 or 619/231-1058, or
via e-mail at djr@rgrdlaw.com. If you are a member of this class, you can view a
copy of the existing complaint as filed or join this class action online at
http://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases/pfizerinc/. Any member of the putative class may
move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or
may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. 

The amended complaint will charge Pfizer and certain of its officers and
directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Pfizer is a
pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and
marketing of prescription medicines for humans and animals worldwide. 

The amended complaint will allege that during the Class Period, defendants
misled investors by failing to disclose that they were engaged in an ongoing
course of conduct designed to illegally promote the sale of Pfizer drugs,
including Bextra, Geodon, Zyvox and Lyrica. By such conduct, Pfizer caused
hundreds of millions of dollars in false or fraudulent claims to be submitted to
several federal healthcare programs, thus exposing the Company to untold legal
liability. 

On January 26, 2009, Pfizer announced that it was paying $2.3 billion to resolve
several ongoing investigations. These investigations included the improper
promotion of and kickbacks involving Bextra, Geodon, Zyvox and Lyrica. After the
cost of resolving these investigations became public, the price of Pfizer common
stock declined from $17.45 at the previous trading day`s close to $15.65 on
January 26, 2009. 

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of Pfizer
publicly traded securities during the Class Period (the "Class"). The plaintiff
is represented by Robbins Geller, which has expertise in prosecuting investor
class actions and extensive experience in actions involving financial fraud.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is expecting a boost this quarter from a rebound in business tech spending, likely outweighing negative effects from turmoil in Europe, the software giant's chief financial officer told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broad recovery in the economy and rising share prices will encourage more technology mergers and acquisitions, CFO Peter Klein told the Reuters Global Technology Summit in New York, but the world's largest software company had no "mega" deals planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, with $39.7 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, will stick to its dividend and stock buyback policy while waiting for clarity on tax rates, said Klein. He did not rule out another special dividend like its $30 billion-plus, one-time payout to shareholders in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're heading into our fiscal fourth quarter which is typically our biggest quarter for enterprise sales, and we're very optimistic about the opportunity there," said Klein, who took over as CFO last November. "For the next 12 to 18 months you'll see a gradual return to growth in IT spend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is hoping that companies will make the long-delayed move to replace aging computers as the economy improves, taking the opportunity to adopt its new Windows 7 operating system and Office 2010 suite of programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our last fiscal quarter, we saw for the first time (since the downturn) growth in businesses' spending on hardware, both PCs and servers, which we thought was a very encouraging sign," said Klein. "I've been out on the road this week, talking to a lot customers, talking to a lot of our sales people -- and it feels like things are loosening up a bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts are backing Klein's optimism, expecting $15.2 billion in sales for the company this quarter -- which ends June 30 -- up from $13.1 billion a year ago, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic problems in Europe could be a blot on the horizon, said Klein, but would likely not drag down the U.S. recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To the extent there is fiscal austerity that constrains overall economic growth, it's fair to think that might provide a headwind to IT spend (in Europe)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MA WAVE BREAKING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recovery will bring with it a new rash of deals, said Klein, as potential acquisition targets start to see the premiums that were absent during the market downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock market has clearly rebounded, so you sort of feel like you're back to equilibrium," said Klein "Over the course of the next couple of years you'll probably see a pickup in (MA) activity compared to the last year and a half."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft makes dozens of smaller deals each year, mostly under $250 million. Klein said the company is unlikely to do a "mega-acquisition," two years after its failed $47.5 billion bid to buy Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are very hard to do," said Klein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech deals are on the rise this year, with Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) slated to buy Palm Inc PALM.O, and Germany's SAP (SAPG.DE) agreeing to buy database software maker Sybase Inc SY.N for $5.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft isn't interested in launching a counter offer for Sybase, said Klein, nor is it looking to buy SAP -- the world's top maker of business management software for large corporations -- after looking at such a deal about five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WAITING ON DIVIDEND TAX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which handed more than $30 billion to shareholders in a special dividend in 2004, has no plans to repeat such a payout, but has not ruled it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is nothing under consideration now that is different than what we've been doing in the last several years," said Klein, when asked about a special dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft started paying an annual dividend in 2003 and moved to quarterly dividends the year after, as it looked to channel more money back to shareholders as growth rates moderated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taxes on dividends could almost double to 40 percent next year for top-bracket taxpayers if tax cuts enacted by the Bush administration are allowed to expire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to get their (investors') feedback on dividends, buybacks, and how tax policy may affect how they feel about that," said Klein. "We wouldn't do anything in anticipation of potential legislation. We'll plan for it, but won't do anything until there is any actual change in the tax policy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle and Paul Thomasch, Editing by Derek Caney, John Wallace and Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   * Goldman agrees to commit $20 million to rescue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Working with Citi, JPMorgan, Bank of America&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * ShoreBank needs to raise $125 mln or risks seizure
 (Rewrites first sentence, adds no comment from Bank of
America, adds background on bank seizures)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Karey Wutkowski and Steve Eder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, May 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) and a consortium of other top banks are part of an
effort to save ShoreBank Corp, a Chicago bank with Washington
ties, a community activist close to the institution said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, Citigroup (C.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Bank of
America (BAC.N) are helping raise the $125 million the troubled
community development lender needs to avoid a government
takeover, said the activist, Bill Brandt, chairman of the
Illinois Finance Authority, a state economic development
entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ShoreBank is just one of hundreds of small U.S. banks
dealing with distressed loan portfolios. But it has built
strong political ties, largely because of the national
recognition it has received over the years for its efforts to
extend loans to low-income communities and environmental
causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank, whose website even boasts of a connection to
President Barack Obama, and its plight have become a positive
publicity opportunity for Wall Street banks facing increased
scrutiny over their role in the recent financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "My understanding is that Goldman Sachs has made a
significant commitment and will act on this commitment today,"
Brandt said. "Whether this deal gets finally cooked is a
Herculean task."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brandt said Goldman agreed to contribute more than $20
million to help rescue the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs has been trying to burnish its image after
confronting political pressures and populist anger over its
quick turnaround and perceived lack of concern over the
economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its image was further tarnished last month when the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission brought fraud charges
against the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is considering a financing package of about $15
million that would include converting existing debt to equity
as well as a cash investment, a person familiar with the bank's
plan said. The second-largest U.S. bank is already an investor
in ShoreBank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan
declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A person familiar with the capital-raising efforts said
ShoreBank is $10 million to $15 million short of the $125
million capital target set by regulators. The bank hopes to
obtain enough commitments on Friday to get the full amount
required, the source said, speaking anonymously because of the
sensitivity of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is unclear how quickly the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp could take the bank into receivership if it does not come
up with a recapitalization plan that satisfies regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDIC typically announces the seizure of banks on Friday
evenings, but regulators will hold off on seizures if there is
a viable "white knight" investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ShoreBank, which has $2.3 billion in assets and is
nationally recognized for its programs to lend to low-income
communities, faces a Monday deadline to show it has met
regulators' capital demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're working expeditiously on our capital raise, and we
appreciate all parties, including a number of banks, who are
supporting us in this effort," said Brian Berg, a spokesman for
ShoreBank. He declined to name any institutions helping in the
effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman Sachs Chief
Executive Lloyd Blankfein had discussions with FDIC Chairman
Sheila Bair about helping the bank. The FDIC declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ShoreBank has kept a high profile in the community
development world. It focuses on loans that contribute to
environmental efforts and targets borrowers looking to convert
deteriorated apartment buildings into income-producing
properties, expand small businesses, and upgrade homes and
property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was especially hard-hit during the recession, reporting
a net operating loss of $53.6 million in 2009. In 2008 it eked
out net operating income of $1.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helping lead the bank's capital efforts is prominent
Washington figure Eugene Ludwig, former comptroller of the
currency and now chief executive of Promontory Financial
Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ellen Seidman, a former head of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, serves as executive vice president of national
policy and partnership development at ShoreBank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seidman is also a founding council member in Goldman Sachs'
"10,000 Small Businesses" initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berg was careful to note that no one within ShoreBank has
reached out to anyone in the White House.

 By Joe Silha and Jeff Jones

 NEW YORK, May 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N), already
the largest bank in commodities trading, has expanded that
business by acquiring the North American natural gas marketing
operations of Nexen Inc NXY.TO, Canada's No. 5 independent
oil explorer, for an undisclosed sum, Nexen said on Friday.

 The deal gives Goldman a business that Nexen has said is
one of the top 10 in gas trading on the continent.

 It buys and sells about 6 billion cubic feet of gas a day
and manages more than 50 billion cubic feet of gas storage
capacity. The business adds to Goldman's existing commodities
trading operation in Calgary.

 Nexen, best known as operator of the Long Lake oil sands
project in Alberta and the giant Buzzard offshore oil field in
the North Sea, had put the unit on the block last year, saying
it wanted its marketing business to reflect its production
weighting toward crude oil.

 "We can confirm the sale," Nexen Vice-President Pierre
Alvarez said, but he declined to offer more details.

 Earlier, Reuters reported the sale to J. Aron  Co, the
commodities division of Goldman Sachs, quoting a source
familiar with the transaction.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 The source also declined to comment on price, timing or if
Nexen's traders would be transferred to the buyer.

 A Goldman spokesman said he could not confirm the details.

 One Canadian-based analyst, who declined to be named, said
he believed the deal was worth under $100 million, and possibly
well under.

 "I'm sure this (deal) is well below what is material for
either company," he said.

 Goldman, which is under fire from the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission for the design and marketing of a subprime
mortgage securities product, is the biggest commodities player
among Wall Street banks, with more than 200 commodity
professionals in locations throughout the world.

 It risks more of its own money in commodities than any
other Wall Street bank, a figure hovering around $40 million
for the past two years.

 Goldman's J. Aron division is based in New York and trades
gas, precious metals, foreign exchange and over-the-counter
options.

 For Nexen, the deal follows the C$15 million ($14.6
million) sale of its European gas and power marketing business
to Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T), Japan's largest brokerage, in
February.

 Calgary-based Nexen said last month that it expects to
record a noncash loss of C$250 million to C$290 million on the
North American gas trading unit sale, relating to the transfer
of long-term physical gas transportation commitments.

 Last July, when Nexen began weighing options for the
business, it said its production was weighted 85 percent toward
oil, but that most of its trading was in gas, hence its desire
to align its operations.

 Nexen shares fell 44 Canadian cents, or 2 percent, to
C$22.36 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, on a day when crude had
tumbled nearly 4 percent CLc1 and the TSX oil group .SPTTEN
sank 1.7 percent.

 Goldman Sachs fell $1.42, or 1 percent, to $143.23 in New
York.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Chevron and the much-vaunted Gibson Dunn litigation team have suffered a severe
setback in California federal court in the company`s longstanding effort to
evade accountability for a $27 billion environmental disaster in Ecuador`s
Amazon. 

U.S. federal judge Claudia Wilken this week threw out seven out of eight claims
from a malicious prosecution case Gibson filed on behalf of Chevron against
Cristobal Bonifaz, a sole practitioner who works out of his farmhouse in
Massachusetts. Bonifaz was involved in the class action lawsuit that accuses
Chevron of dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into Ecuador`s Amazon. 

Gibson, which has roughly 1,000 lawyers and recently won national "litigation
firm of the year" from The American Lawyer magazine, was defeated by a small
California firm, Kerr &amp; Wagstaffe, which has only 11 lawyers. 

The decision is an embarrassing one for celebrated Gibson partners Scott Edelman
and Andrew Neumann, who were brought in by Chevron last year to take over the
sprawling Ecuador litigation which now spans six different courts in three
countries. Gibson markets its litigation team as "game changers" and is said to
be billing the oil giant millions per month as it assumes control of the Ecuador
litigation. 

Chevron repeatedly has said it expects an adverse decision in the Ecuador
matter. If the judge accepts the damages assessment, the company could be on the
hook for one of the largest civil judgments in history. 

Representatives of the Amazon communities have long charged that Gibson Dunn`s
legal team was hired to divert attention from Chevron`s fraudulent conduct in
Ecuador, which includes misrepresenting the results of a remediation to secure a
legal release. 

"Gibson Dunn likes to make wild accusations of fraud against lawyers who try to
hold Gibson`s clients - in this case Chevron -- accountable for their unethical
and criminal conduct against vulnerable people," said Pablo Fajardo, the
Ecuadorian lawyer who represents 30,000 rainforest residents suing the oil
giant. 

"By trying to help Chevron get away with these atrocities, Gibson`s lawyers are
complicit in the human rights abuses of their own client," he added. 

Chevron has admitted that Texaco (now part of Chevron) dumped billions of
gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon when it operated a huge oil concession
there from 1964 to 1990. Indigenous groups in the area have been decimated and
rates of cancer and other oil-related diseases have skyrocketed, according to
evidence before the court. 

Chevron had claimed that Bonifaz had engaged in "malicious prosecution" when he
brought a separate lawsuit (Gonzales v. Texaco) against the company in 2006
after he was discharged from the environmental case in Ecuador.

(NYSE: MOT), Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Frontier Communications (NYSE: FTR).

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Verizon: Earnings Scorecard

US wireless kingpin Verizon (NYSE: VZ) produced a mixed bag in the first
quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of 56 cents came in line with the Zacks
Consensus Estimate while net income plummeted 75% year-over-year. Profit was hit
by a $962 million one-time charge associated with the recent federal health care
reform, which eliminated certain tax benefits related to retired employees. 

On a positive note, Big Red reported a 1.2% annualized growth in revenues,
driven by the contributions from Alltel Corp acquired in early 2009 and healthy
gains across strategic growth areas such as wireless and FiOS footprint
(Internet and video). 

Wireless service revenues were buoyed by strong subscriber accretion and
sustained demand for data services. Verizon posted healthy growth in data ARPU
(average revenue per user) and decline in churn. Strong adoption of integrated
devices continues to boost data revenues. The dark side in wireless was the
decelerating contract customer growth (due to the maturing US wireless market)
to which the Street reacted negatively and shares fell. 

On the wireline side, revenues and margins remained under pressure due to the
money-losing fixed voice business, as well as declines across global wholesale
and enterprise operations. 

Agreement - Estimate Revisions

The overall trend in estimate revisions for 2010 is inclined towards the
negative side following tepid first quarter results. Out of a total of 32
analysts covering the stock, 23 have chopped their estimates over the past month
while just 2 analysts have made positive revisions. Likewise, 20 analysts (out
of a total of 30) have cut their forecasts for 2011 over the past month with 4
raising their estimates. 

This strong negative sentiment has been fueled by the wireline headwinds
(concerns over margins) and the dilutive impact of pension and benefit charges,
and the expenses associated with the impending spin-off of specific wireline
assets. Moreover, the recent slowdown in postpaid net additions, which mirrors a
general trend in the industry, also contributed to the gloomy opinion. 

The negative estimates revisions, which indicate weak performances moving
forward, not only exert a meaningful impact on the Zacks Rank, but also reflect
the potential for significant downward pressure on the stock. 

Magnitude - Consensus Estimate Trend

Downward estimate revisions accompanied by a sheer directional agreement have
led to a decline in annual forecasts for Verizon. Estimates for 2010 and 2011
have gone down by 4 cents and 7 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days. 

However, the magnitude of revisions has plateaued over the last week. The
current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2010 is $2.28, reflecting a 5.21%
year-over-year decline. 

Verizon Stays in the Neutral Zone

Verizon`s ongoing efforts to extend the nationwide coverage of its 3G network
remain encouraging. Moreover, the carrier is gearing up for the launch of its 4G
Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network in fourth-quarter 2010 in up to 30 markets. 

This will give Verizon a head start over its archrival AT (NYSE: T), which
lags with 4G LTE network launch planned in 2011. A major portion of capital
expenditures for 2010 has been directed at LTE network build-outs, as the
carrier has scaled back its FiOS deployments. 

Prospects in wireless will also be boosted by an array of next-generation
devices. Verizon launched Motorola`s (NYSE: MOT) Droid smartphone in late 2009
to take on the iPhone. The carrier has expanded its Android smartphone range
with the recently launched HTC Droid Incredible. 

Moreover, Verizon has started selling Microsoft`s (Nasdaq: MSFT) Kin phones and
targets to unveil a 4G smartphone by mid-2011. Verizon may also sell iPhones, as
AT is likely to lose its marketing exclusivity on the iconic device in 2010. 

To boost its wireline business, Verizon is replacing its copper line-based
networks with expensive fiber-optic deployments in key markets. The company is
selling its local wireline assets in 13 states to Frontier Communications (NYSE:
FTR) to focus on more densely populated markets as well as building its
fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) business.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is urging users to dump the aged Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) with a campaign that claims the browser is past its expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest push to convince users to quit IE6 equated the browser to a nine-year-old carton of milk. IE6 debuted in August 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You wouldn't drink 9-year-old milk," reads a milk carton pictured on a page hosted by Microsoft's Australian division . "So why use a 9-year-old browser?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign, which was first reported by Australian blogger Long Zheng , touts IE8 as the replacement for IE6, and cites company-funded research that claimed IE8's malware-blocking tools caught 85% of the malicious sites the browser faces. Microsoft has sponsored several such studies , all conducted by NSS Labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE6 has had its share of security problems. Late last year, for example, hackers used a vulnerability in the browser to steal confidential information from Google and scores of other major technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also gotten the cold shoulder from several prominent Web sites and services. Google's Gmail and YouTube, Facebook and Digg have all announced that they will no longer support IE6. Last March, a Denver design firm hosted a mock funeral for the browser; Microsoft sent a floral arrangement with a card reading, "Thanks for the good times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been begging users to leave IE6 for almost a year. Last August, the company's general manager for Internet Explorer noted that, "Friends don't let friends use IE6" as she made her plea to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether users listened or because millions have moved to Windows 7 , which includes IE8, the percentage of people running IE6 has plummeted since August 2009. According to data from Web metrics company NetApplications, IE6 has fallen from a usage share of 25.3% to 17.6% in the last nine months, a drop of nearly eight percentage points, representing a decline of 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft's newest pitch is misleading, since IE6 true expiration date is April 8, 2014, when it finally retires the almost-as-old Windows XP . After that date, Microsoft will not release security updates for IE6 or Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People still using IE6 must upgrade to Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3) to continue to receive patches after July 13, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE8 will be Microsoft's final browser for Windows XP customers, as the company will not support XP with IE9, the next-generation browser that is in the early stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - On Wall Street, Jamie Dimon is considered a leader, but some students at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York are not impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase  Co, is the keynote speaker on Sunday at Syracuse University's commencement ceremony, much to the dismay of some students and their parents, who complain he represents an industry that caused the worst financial crisis since the Depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students have collected about 1,200 names on an online petition entitled "Take Back 2010 Commencement," a number equal to about a quarter of the students graduating, although some of the signatories write on the website they are not current students, just people sympathetic to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dimon is part and parcel of a banking industry that robbed students of this generation of their hope of having a life as good or better than their parents," a group of Syracuse parents wrote in a letter to the university's newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A student identifying himself as "Delirium" posted a video on YouTube in which he raps in front of a group of people wearing mortarboards and robes protesting, holding signs such as "Mind over money" and "I'm angry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protest, Syracuse students say they are planning to remove their caps and gowns when Dimon speaks, according to the 'Take Back Commencement' group they launched on social networking site Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a far cry from the reception Dimon, 54, usually receives on Wall Street. A trade publication dubbed him "Banker of the Year" in 2009 and he was included in TIME magazine's 2009 list of the world's 100 most influential people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's bank was one of the few to remain profitable during the financial crisis and when regulators were looking for a bank strong enough to take on troubled Bear Stearns in 2008, they turned to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Saying he's the best of the banking industry isn't exactly a ringing endorsement right now," class of 2010 student Kelsey Dyer told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIDEN, JOEL, DIMON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank opened a technology center for students at Syracuse last year and some students are concerned Dimon's appointment as speaker was a move by the university to curry favor. Some of these students said they were also concerned the speaker selection process was not transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seemed like his spot was sort of bought and paid for with no regard for the students' wishes," Dyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university says the speaker was chosen by Syracuse University Chancellor Nancy Cantor from a list proposed by a committee of student marshals and student trustee representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list also included writer Maya Angelou, former British prime minister Tony Blair, actress Tina Fey and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, according to the university's newspaper, the Syracuse Daily Orange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vice President Joe Biden gave the address in 2009 and previous speakers include pop star Billy Joel and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Students also protested when Giuliani spoke in 2002, according to The Daily Orange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a rich tradition of university students protesting against their commencement speakers. Chancellor Cantor, in a letter to students last month, wrote: "In my experience, virtually every commencement speaker arouses a broad array of reactions, in line with the diversity of interests, opinions, and passions on a university campus, though I understand that in this economic climate the concerns may be especially acute."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon himself is unfazed by the kerfuffle. When asked last month about his response to the protest, he said that he had not expected to be a controversial choice as speaker, but added that "people should stand up for what they believe in." He still plans to attend the ceremony, a spokesman said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon will receive an honorary degree at the ceremony in the Carrier Dome on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by Carol Bishopric and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today announced additional information
on the Business Standards Committee. 

A week ago, at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Goldman Sachs announced the
creation of the Business Standards Committee. The Business Standards Committee
will undertake a review of our business standards and make recommendations to
the Board of Directors and senior management to reinforce the firm`s client
focus and improve upon the transparency of our activities. 

"We recognize that there is a disconnect between how we view the firm and how
the broader public perceives our roles and activities," said Lloyd C. Blankfein,
Chairman and CEO of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. "This initiative is consistent
with our obligation to ensure that our standards across our business activities
are of the highest quality and represent the benchmark for our industry
globally." 

The Business Standards Committee will establish working groups to focus on the
following five areas: 

Client Relationships and Responsibilities. This group will re-examine and
clarify the responsibilities we have to our clients and the different roles we
may play to accomplish our clients` objectives. 

Conflict Management. This group will review how the firm identifies and manages
conflicts across our business activities and how we share information with our
clients. 

Disclosure and Transparency of Firmwide Activities. This group will examine how
the firm`s public disclosure and financial reporting can better articulate the
nature of our activities and how they relate to our performance and our mission
to serve clients and the public interest. 

Structured Products and Suitability. This group will consider how to address
various issues surrounding complex products, including the suitability of
products for different types of clients. 

Education, Training and Business Ethics. The focus of this group will be on how
best to strengthen our training and professional development to reinforce the
importance of personal accountability, professional ethics and clear and
effective communication. 

The Business Standards Committee will actively seek input from external
constituencies and experts, including clients, shareholders, regulators,
academics and public policy groups. A series of discussions and meetings will be
held with these groups so the Committee hears and benefits from independent
views, advice and judgment. These interactions will represent a core component
of the Committee`s work. 

The Committee will issue a final report shortly after the Board of Directors`
meeting in mid-December. The report will be made public.

&lt;p&gt; * CLO proprietary trading desk is being merged-source&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Regulators have sought to limit prop trading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N), which has faced questions over its proprietary trading
operations, is winding down one such desk, a source familiar
with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's proprietary trading desk that deals CLOs - bonds
backed by corporate loans - is being merged with a desk that
handles trades and transactions for clients, the source said.
The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the
matter has not been made public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source said the change had been planned for several
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year U.S. President Barack Obama proposed a
rule that would bar banks from betting with their own money,
which is known as proprietary trading. The matter has been the
subject of regulatory debates throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman senior executive told a U.S. Senate committee in
February that the rule, known as the "Volcker rule" could
impact about 10 percent of the firm's net revenues.

"Partnership") announced today the Partnership`s results for the first quarter
ended March 31, 20101. 

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The Partnership was established on October 2, 2009 for the purpose of maximizing
returns to its limited partners through the acquisition, management, concept
planning and eventual sale of two properties consisting of an aggregate of 455
acres of undeveloped land in southern Ontario (the "Properties"). 

The land located near the Toronto area in Alliston, Ontario consists of two
parcels of land comprised of 155 acres. The land located in the southwest
quadrant of the City of Ottawa consists of 300 acres. 

It is the current intention of the Partnership to hold its interest in the
Properties as an investment and to eventually dispose of its interest prior to
physical development of the Properties. Should the partners of the Partnership
determine that the Partnership should participate in the development of the
Properties (other than pre-development concept planning), the activities of the
Partnership may also include the partial or full development of the Properties
prior to the sale of the Properties. 

OVERALL PERFORMANCE

The Partnership closed an initial public offering ("IPO") on February 25, 2010,
raising gross proceeds of $18,555,500 and issuing 1,855,550 units at $10 per
unit. 

The Partnership commenced a private placement offering on March 19, 2010 (the
"Private Placement"), for the sale of an additional 1,724,450 units at $10 per
unit for gross proceeds of $17,244,500. As of March 31, 2010, the Partnership
had received $699,000 in subscription funds for which units have not yet been
issued. As at the date of this release, the Partnership has received an
additional $6,763,500 in subscription funds for which units have not yet been
issued. The final closing for the Private Placement is to occur on or before
June 12, 2010. 

The Partnership will use the net proceeds raised under the IPO and the Private
Placement to purchase its interest in the Properties, and to fund a reserve to
pay for its ongoing operational, administrative, land management and concept
planning expenses (the "Refundable Expense Reserve"). The size of the
Partnership`s interest in the Properties will be equal to the amount of the
gross proceeds raised under both offerings divided by $35,800,000, which was the
maximum amount of the IPO. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Partnership's only material activities from the date of its formation on
October 2, 2009 through to March 31, 2010 was the completion of the IPO, the
commencement of the Private Placement, and the payment of costs associated with
these offerings and with the start up operations of the Partnership. 

During the 3 months ended March 31, 2010, the Partnership used approximately
7.0% of the gross proceeds from the IPO to pay (i) the fees of the agents who
sold the units under the IPO (5.5%), and (ii) organizational (or offering) costs
(1.5%). In addition, the Partnership utilized funds from the Refundable Expense
Reserve to pay operational and administrative expenses. 

The organizational costs of $278,333 relate to the amount the Partnership
reimbursed Walton International Group Inc. in respect of the costs incurred by
Walton to organize the Partnership, as well as preparing the IPO, including
legal, accounting, audit, printing, filing, transfer agent and other costs and
fees associated with the IPO (excluding the agents` fees), which, as described
in the prospectus, were capped at 1.5% of the gross proceeds raised under the
IPO.

sold its natural gas trading operations to a unit of Goldman

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The rest of Wall Street's pain is Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) gain, but Wall Street's dominant firm is not off the hook just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As subpoenas arrived at the doorsteps of Goldman's rivals this week, Wall Street's top firm enjoyed some company in the spotlight and a welcome break from being the sole target of prosecutors, lawmakers, and the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman is not quite on redemption road, some investors and analysts say, as it still faces public relations and legal hurdles ahead. Even over the past week, Goldman shares -- down 0.3 percent -- underperformed the sectoral Amex Securities broker dealer index .XBD, which gained 1.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have company in the doghouse, but they are still in the doghouse," said Michael Robinson, a financial and crisis public relations consultant with Levick Strategic Communications. "They were the first ones in and they were the highest profile. That others are believed to have done the same thing doesn't lessen the need to try to make this story go away as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, sources said that U.S. prosecutors and the New York Attorney General were conducting broad criminal investigations into Wall Street banks, probing their roles in the subprime mortgage crisis and what they told investors and credit ratings agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WIDENING PROBE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past month, Goldman has been at the center of a Wall Street dragnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman on April 16 of civil fraud in connection with its marketing of a subprime mortgage product called ABACUS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC accused Goldman of failing to tell investors who bought risky debt tied to subprime mortgages that hedge fund manager John Paulson helped select the underlying portfolio for a mortgage-linked security and was shorting the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was also the first Wall Street bank to be reported to be under the microscope of criminal investigators as it relates to the subprime mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the SEC's probe, Goldman shares have dropped more than 20 percent, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein has launched a public relations offensive, and even admitted the scrutiny has put a "strain" on clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Goldman seems to have found a bit of redemption of late and there have been several reminders lately of its dominant position on Wall Street -- which its critics have sometimes tarred as rife with conflicts of interest or even "squid-like."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, it reported that it had zero days of trading losses during the first quarter, the first time it has accomplished such a feat -- although it wasn't the only bank to score a "perfect game" for the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then its private equity arm appeared to be in the final stages of an agreement to buy a $1 billion stake in Taikang Life, China's No. 4 life insurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on Friday, industry sources told Reuters that Goldman had purchased Calgary-based Nexen Inc's NXY.TO North American natural gas trading book, in another reminder of the diverse markets in which the firm plays a key role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has also joined efforts to rescue ShoreBank, a politically-connected bank in Chicago -- a move that could win it points from Washington, where just weeks ago Blankfein and other executives were grilled by a Senate panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SHADOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news that investigations had broadened to include rivals like Morgan Stanley (MS.N), JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) was perhaps the most significant, as the other banks provided some cover after weeks of negative publicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is a feeling that Goldman still is playing the lead role in the unfolding saga, and it will continue to have more to explain to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the ABACUS shadow has gone away," said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. "They were named in a suit. It is more than just an investigation and it is going to carry weight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "Entities like CalPERS (the largest U.S. public pension fund) may think twice before dealing with Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, Goldman is facing a possible lawsuit by former Australian clients who say the bank misled them into over-paying for stocks under derivatives deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) also said this week it was reviewing its dealings with all of its counterparties during the financial crisis, including Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even as U.S. prosecutors wrap other banks into the ongoing probe, many of those are Goldman's chief trading partners. The pressure on the industry does not serve Goldman well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The broadening out of the investigation just makes the whole industry look worse, which Goldman is a part of," said Walter Todd, a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital, which owns Goldman debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve Eder, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) recently
purchased Calgary-based Nexen Inc's NXY.TO North American
natural gas trading book, industry sources told Reuters on
Friday, strengthening its already hefty presence in commodities
trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nexen, Canada's fifth-largest independent oil explorer,
operates in Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, Yemen, the North Sea
and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is the biggest bank in commodities
with a Value at Risk -- the industry standard measure for how
much of a banks' own money is at risk on any given day -- of
around $40 million over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Below is a history of financial institutions and their
involvement in commodities trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOLDMAN SACHS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global head -- Isabelle Ealet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staff -- Has more than 200 commodity professionals
throughout the world, in locations such as New York, Calgary,
Houston, London, Sydney, Singapore and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; History -- Entered the commodities business in 1981 with
the purchase of J. Aron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Focus -- Serving corporate clients and financial investors
ranging from hedge funds to institutional investors and private
equity firms. It is one of the few investment banks in the
world that physically trades and ships crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Growth plan -- Deliver customised risk management for
commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VaR -- Risks more of its own money in commodities than any
other Wall Street bank, a figure hovering at around $40 million
over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMORGAN CHASE (JPM.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global head -- Blythe Masters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; History -- Acquired Bear Stearns in March 2008 and
increased the bank's commodities business. Expanded its
presence again in February 2009 when it completed the purchase
of key parts of UBS commodities. A year later, it acquired the
non-U.S. assets of  commodities joint venture RBS Sempra from
Royal Bank of Scotland and Sempra Energy for $1.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Focus -- Trades oil, refined products, power, natural gas,
coal and emissions. Active in agricultural commodities such as
palm oil and cocoa along with base metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Growth plan --  To be a top-tier franchise globally. Has
moved into second place with a commodities-market VaR of just
over $30 million on average last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBS SEMPRA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global co-heads -- Mike Beck and Michael Goldstein replaced
Kaushik Amin after he resigned in late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; History -- The commodities joint venture between the Royal
Bank of Scotland and Sempra Energy was created in April 2008.
European Commission state aid requirements forced RBS to divest
its share over the next four years. In February 2010, RBS
signed a deal to sell JPMorgan Chase the non-U.S. assets in RBS
Sempra, its commodities joint venture with Sempra Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Focus -- Mainly active in physical markets and its main
markets are crude oil, base metals, European power gas and coal

it intends to expand commodities team by 25 percent over two to
three years in anticipation of strong demand for commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CITIGROUP (C.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global head -- Stuart Staley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; History -- Citibank has traded metals since they were
available to trade, added financial oil and oil related
products in the early 90s and added financial natural gas
products around 1997. Staff work in New York, London and
Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2004/2005, Citigroup committed to an organic build up of
the business and moved several traders from New York to
Houston.  In 2006, it began expanding in London. Today, there

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and a consortium of other top banks are part of an effort to save ShoreBank Corp, a Chicago bank with Washington ties, a Democratic activist close to the institution said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America are helping raise the $125 million the community development lender needs to avoid a government takeover, said Bill Brandt, chairman of the Illinois Finance Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My understanding is that Goldman Sachs has made a significant commitment and will act on this commitment today," Brandt said. "Whether this deal gets finally cooked is a Herculean task."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandt said Goldman agreed to contribute more than $20 million to help rescue the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is considering a financing package of about $15 million that would include converting existing debt to equity as well as a cash investment, a person familiar with the bank's plan said. The second-largest U.S. bank is already an investor in Shore Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and JPMorgan declined to comment. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with the capital-raising efforts said ShoreBank is $10 million to $15 million short of the $125 million capital target set by regulators. The bank hopes to get enough commitments today to get the full amount required, the source said, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ShoreBank, which has $2.3 billion in assets and is nationally recognized for its programs to lend to low-income communities, faces a Monday deadline to show it has met regulators' capital demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're working expeditiously on our capital raise, and we appreciate all parties, including a number of banks, who are supporting us in this effort," said Brian Berg, a spokesman for ShoreBank. He declined to name any institutions helping in the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported that Blankfein had discussions with Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair about helping the bank. The FDIC declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been trying to burnish its image after confronting political pressures and populist anger over its quick turnaround and perceived lack of concern over the economic downturn. Its image was further tarnished last month when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought fraud charges against the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ShoreBank has kept a high profile in the community development world. It focuses on loans that contribute to environmental efforts and targets borrowers looking to convert deteriorated apartment buildings into income-producing properties, expand small businesses, and upgrade homes and property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was especially hard hit during the recession, reporting a net operating loss of $53.6 million in 2009. In 2008 it eked out net operating income of $1.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has powerful ties to Washington, displaying on its website a YouTube video of a news report that links ShoreBank with President Barack Obama when he was a senator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helping lead the bank's capital efforts is prominent Washington figure Eugene Ludwig, former comptroller of the currency and now chief executive of Promontory Financial Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellen Seidman, a former head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, serves as executive vice president of national policy and partnership development at ShoreBank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seidman is also a founding council member in Goldman Sachs' "10,000 Small Businesses" initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berg was careful to note that no one within ShoreBank has reached out to anyone in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Karey Wutkowski in Washington and Steve Eder and Emily Flitter in New York; additional reporting by Elinor Comlay in New York; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Galleon hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam wants evidence concerning Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) stock and a score of other stocks thrown out of a U.S. government criminal case alleging insider trading, according to court papers on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam was arrested last October and charged along with 20 others in what prosecutors described as the biggest probe of insider trading in hedge funds, and the first significant Wall Street case to use secret telephone recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a filing on Thursday, Rajaratnam's lawyers said that of 21 stocks identified by the government in a March letter, 10 "were never mentioned in any of the government's applications for authorization to wiretap Rajaratnam's telephone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The request to throw out this alleged evidence follows a similar request on April 16 and a motion last Friday asking U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell to suppress thousands of recordings from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam argued that an FBI agent's initial applications to conduct wiretaps in the probe misled a judge because they contained false statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government listed the stocks in letters to defense lawyers dated March 22 and April 14, and also included ATT Inc (T.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those stocks and others are not in the formal charges against Rajaratnam that he illegally traded in 12 companies, netting about $45 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letters said he conspired to obtain material, nonpublic information about the quarterly earnings of Goldman before announcements in June and December 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said he also conspired to get confidential information on the $5 billion purchase by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) of Goldman preferred stock before the September 2008 announcement of that transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported in April that former Goldman director Rajat Gupta told Rajaratnam about Berkshire's investment before it became public, citing an unidentified source. Gupta's spokesman said he did nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government's applications to wiretap Mr. Rajaratnam's telephone refer to 13 stocks which have never been identified in any of the  government's letters or charging documents as being at issue in this case," Thursday's brief by attorney John Dowd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the government "simply ignores the most obvious question of all: Why, if it intended from the beginning to prosecute Mr. Rajaratnam for trading or conspiring to trade in all of the various stocks ... did it not simply identify those in the criminal complaint or indictments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral arguments on the wiretaps will be heard by Holwell on June 17, according to court papers. His decision would be published before the October 25 start of the trial of Rajaratnam and his principal co-defendant, Danielle Chiesi, a former trader with New Castle Funds LLC in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are USA v Raj Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;Wereldwijde onthulling van nieuw ontwerp in Montebello, CA en Europese premi&#232;re
in Madrid, Spanje

PASADENA, Californi&#235; en LONDEN--(Business Wire)--
Disney Store is klaar voor het opnieuw defini&#235;ren van winkels voor kinderen en
lanceert deze zomer zijn magische nieuwe winkelontwerp op de belangrijkste
markten overal in de Verenigde Staten en Europa. Het innovatieve Disney Store
ontwerp zal voor het eerst worden onthuld in juni in The Shops at Montebello in
Montebello, Californi&#235;, net buiten Los Angeles, gevolgd door de Europese
premiere begin juli in Madrid, Spanje in La Vaguada. Via een uniek concept,
ontwikkeld vanuit het perspectief van het kind, integreert het nieuwe
winkelontwerp de nieuwste technologie, met als doel het cre&#235;ren van een
verbeterde winkelervaring, ge&#239;nspireerd door Disney`s populairste figuren en
verhalen. 

"We hebben Disney magie gebracht in alle elementen van deze unieke
retail-ervaring en hebben de beste winkelcentra geselecteerd voor het lanceren
van de Disney Store van de toekomst," aldus Jim Fielding, president van Disney
Stores Worldwide. "Speciale kenmerken zoals het beeldende Disney Princess
kasteel met magische spiegel en het Disney Store Theater zijn slechts twee van
de verbazingwekkende elementen in de nieuwe winkel die de ervaring van elk kind
en elk gezin in de Disney Store zullen verrijken." 

Meer dan 20 nieuwe en opnieuw gemodelleerde Disney Store locaties zullen dit
jaar hun deuren openen in belangrijke winkelcentra over geheel Noord-Amerika en
Europa. Noord-Amerikaanse locaties zijn bevestigd voor Roosevelt Field Mall in
Garden City, New York; Santa Monica Place in Santa Monica, Californi&#235;;
International Plaza in Tampa, Florida; Stockton St. in San Francisco,
Californi&#235;; en Fashion Valley in San Diego, Californi&#235;. Europese locaties zijn
te vinden op vier markten met openingen in Spanje, Portugal, Itali&#235; en het
Verenigd Koninkrijk. Dit zijn NorteShopping in Oporto, Portugal; Orio Center in
Bergamo, Itali&#235;; en locaties in het Verenigd Koninkrijk waaronder Centre MK in
Milton Keynes, Bon Accord Centre in Aberdeen en Donegal Place in Belfast. 

Elke nieuwe winkel heeft een speciale betekenis en elke opening zal worden
gevierd als een belangrijke mijlpaal in de groei en ontwikkeling van Disney
Store.

* Roosevelt Field zal in de Verenigde Staten als eerste nieuw ontworpen winkel
aan de oostkust haar deuren openen. 
* In augustus zal Disney Store zich aansluiten bij een groep exclusieve
retailers voor de heropening van het nieuwe Santa Monica Place winkelcentrum bij
de legendarische Santa Monica Pier in het zuiden van Californi&#235;. Santa Monica
Place is een moderne winkel- en eetbestemming die eigentijdse stijlen combineert
met duurzame architectuur en Disney Store zal een uitgebreid assortiment unieke
Disney-producten leveren aan de elite-klanten. 
* Disney Store op International Plaza in Tampa, Florida zal het dichtst bij het
Walt Disney World Resort gevestigd zijn, zodat gezinnen deze zomer aan beide een
bezoek kunnen brengen. 
* Fashion Valley brengt San Diego's fraaiste verzameling winkels bij elkaar,
gevestigd in een prachtig buiten-winkelcentrum en de nieuw ontworpen Disney
Store zal deze zomer haar deuren openen. 
* Disney Store zal zich aansluiten bij retailers aan het historische Union
Square in San Francisco, een van de grootste winkelgebieden in de Verenigde
Staten. Union Square werd in de vroege twintigste eeuw de kern van San
Francisco's winkelgebied en is dat nog steeds. Vandaag de dag omgeven luxe
winkels en hotels Union Square en het winkelgebied strekt zich uit over meerdere
straten bij het centrale plein. 
* In Europa zal in Oporto de eerste Disney Store worden geopend, in het Noorden
van Portugal, pas de tweede die in dat land zijn deuren opent, na de succesvolle
lancering van het merk op de markt in 2007.

Met elke in 2010 geopende winkel zal Disney Store een dag aanwijzen waarop 10
procent van de verkopen gedoneerd zal worden aan de Make-A-Wish Foundation in de
V.S., Spanje, Itali&#235; en Portugal en aan Great Ormond Street Hospital Children`s
Charity in het Verenigd Koninkrijk.

invest, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A tentative group of investors includes Bank of America

(JPM.N), the newspaper said, but cautioned that the deal could

LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--

GLOBAL POWER RANGERS FRANCHISE RETURNS TO ORIGINAL DEVELOPER AS SABAN ANNOUNCES
ACQUISITION FROM DISNEY

Newly Established Saban Brands to Manage and License Property

Bandai America Incorporated Named as Master Toy &amp; Video Game Licensee

Saban Capital Group, Inc., in cooperation with Toei Company Ltd., the original
Japanese creator of the Power Rangers television show, announced today that it
has acquired the Power Rangers property from certain subsidiaries of The Walt
Disney Company. The acquisition represents the return of the global franchise to
its original developer, Haim Saban, who introduced the first Power Rangers
series in 1993. The acquisition includes worldwide rights to the brand as well
as over 700 episodes produced over 17 years. Broadcast partners will be
announced in the near future. 

Power Rangers marks the first property for Saban Brands, the recently formed
subsidiary of Saban Capital Group, Inc., which was created to manage and license
entertainment properties and consumer brands across media and consumer platforms
throughout the world. Concurrent with the acquisition of the Power Rangers
franchise, Saban Brands has announced a new, long-term master toy and video game
license agreement with Bandai America Incorporated, a subsidiary of Namco Bandai
Holdings (USA) Inc., which has been the toy partner for Power Rangers since its
inception. 

"Power Rangers is one of the world`s leading children`s entertainment properties
and we are delighted to see its return," said Haim Saban, chairman and chief
executive officer, Saban Capital Group, Inc. "We are also very proud and excited
to renew our long-standing partnership with Namco/Bandai and know that this
powerful combination of experience and capabilities will continue to support the
global success of Power Rangers." 

Following its introduction in 1993 on the Fox Kids Network, Power Rangers
quickly became the most watched children`s television program in the United
States. Emphasizing the importance of teamwork, responsibility and helping
others, Power Rangers followed the always exciting and often humorous adventures
of a group of ordinary young people who "morphed" into superheroes. The series
has been translated into numerous languages and rose to become the #1 boys brand
in the world from 1993-97, based on toy sales and television ratings. Disney
acquired the franchise in 2001 as part of its purchase of Fox Family Worldwide,
which included Saban Entertainment and its library of children`s programs. To
date, Power Rangers has aired in over 60 countries and the property`s licensed
products and promotions have generated well over $5 billion in retail sales
worldwide. 

"I am confident that the talented management team at Saban Brands will expand
our licensing partnerships and capitalize on the significant growth potential of
this powerful brand," said Haim Saban.

&lt;p&gt;BRISBANE May 17 (Reuters) - U.S. energy major Chevron
Corp's (CVX.N) is on track to make a final investment decision
on its proposed Wheatstone liquefied natural gas project in
western Australia in 2011, a top company official said on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Australia Managing Director Roy Krzywosinski said
at an energy industry conference that the firm was also
assessing the government's proposed tax changes to the resource
sector. The government unveiled a new tax regime, also known as
the Resource Super Profits Tax, earlier this month which plans
to impose a 40 percent profit tax on Australian miners' "super
profits" -- defined as mining returns above the 10-year
government bond yield of less than 6 percent.

&lt;p&gt;SYRACUSE, New York (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told Syracuse University graduates on Sunday he was confident the United States would see a recovery in the short term, but the country's condition over the longer term was in the hands of the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to thousands of students graduating as U.S. unemployment hovers just below 10 percent, Dimon, 54, talked for just under 20 minutes, often interrupted by applause, on the theme of accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He began his address by discussing the protests that marked his appointment in March as the speaker of the commencement ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some students had lobbied for a replacement speaker, arguing that Dimon represents an industry that caused the worst financial crisis since the Depression, but there was no obvious protest from students at the ceremony, beyond some booing when he first took the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon seemed to win some of the skeptical students over when he said he talked to a student who was leading the protests following his appointment in the spring and he was proud of her for standing up for what she believed in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It takes courage to be accountable," he said. "Have the fortitude to do the right thing, not the easy thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His answer to the tough job market he acknowledged students are facing?

&lt;p&gt; * Dimon discusses theme of accountability&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Dimon addresses more than 17,000 at Syracuse University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYRACUSE, N.Y. May 16 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told Syracuse University
graduates on Sunday he was confident the United States would
see a recovery in the short term, but the country's condition
over the longer term was in the hands of the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking to thousands of students graduating as U.S.
unemployment hovers just below 10 percent, Dimon, 54, talked
for just under 20 minutes, often interrupted by applause, on
the theme of accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He began his address by discussing the protests that marked
his appointment in March as the speaker of the commencement
ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some students had lobbied for a replacement speaker,
arguing that Dimon represents an industry that caused the worst
financial crisis since the Depression, but there was no obvious
protest from students at the ceremony, beyond some booing when
he first took the stage. [ID:nN13150695]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon seemed to win some of the skeptical students over
when he said he talked to a student who was leading the
protests following his appointment in the spring and he was
proud of her for standing up for what she believed in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It takes courage to be accountable," he said. "Have the
fortitude to do the right thing, not the easy thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His answer to the tough job market he acknowledged students
are facing? New graduates should learn from any failures and
take inspiration from others who have tackled adversity, such
as Nelson Mandela, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syracuse University Chancellor Nancy Cantor introduced
Dimon as "the government's banker of last resort," referring to
JPMorgan's acquisition of troubled investment bank Bear Stearns
and failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual Inc in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon, who was named "Banker of the Year" by a trade
publication in 2009, has frequently spoken out against some
elements of the U.S. government's efforts at financial reform.
While he has said he believes some reform is necessary, he has
criticized proposals that he worries could end entire
businesses, when it is only parts of those businesses that need
reforming. For example, he has said he does not agree with
forcing the exchange trading of all derivative instruments, but
he does agree that some derivative instruments could be traded
on an exchange or centrally cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In what could be read as a reference to the face-off
between politicians and bankers over financial reform, he told
students, "It's OK at times for us to blame and be dissatisfiedwith others ... it should not be acceptable to denigrate entire
groups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After he finished by congratulating the class of 2010, he
received more than a minute of applause. Some members of the
audience and students stood up, while other students, still
seated on the field, threw beach balls, orange balloons and a
blow-up doll that were later removed by officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan last year opened a technology center at Syracuse

&lt;p&gt;  STEVENSON, MD, May 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation announces that a class action
lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of the publicly
traded securities of Pfizer, Inc. ("Pfizer" or the "Company") (NYSE: PFE)
during the period between July 20, 2005 and January 23, 2009, inclusive
(the "Class Period").

    No class has yet been certified in the above action. Members of the Class
will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead
plaintiff. If you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the Class,
you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff no later than July 12, 2010
and be selected by the Court. The lead plaintiff will direct the
litigation and participate in important decisions including whether to
accept a settlement and how much of a settlement to accept for the Class
in the action. The lead plaintiff will be selected from among applicants
claiming the largest loss from investment in the Company during the Class
Period. You are not required to have sold your shares to seek damages or
to serve as a Lead Plaintiff. You may contact Brower Piven (through
hoffman@browerpiven.com or 410/415-6616) to answer any questions you may
have in that regard.

    The complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the Company's failure to disclose
during the Class Period that they were engaged in an ongoing course of
conduct designed to illegally promote the sale of Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer"
or the "Company") drugs, including Bextra, Geodon, Zyvox, and Lyrica that
resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in false or fraudulent claims
to be submitted to several federal healthcare programs, thus exposing the
Company to untold legal liability. According to the complaint, after, on
January 26, 2009, Pfizer announced that it was paying $2.3 billion to
resolve several ongoing investigations concerning the improper promotion
of and kickbacks involving Bextra, Geodon, Zyvox, and Lyrica and after
the cost of resolving these investigations became public, the price of
Pfizer common stock declined significantly.

    If you have suffered a net loss for all transactions in Pfizer, Inc.
publicly traded securities during the Class Period (including shares or
possibly calls purchased during, but not sold until after the end of the
Class Period or possibly put options sold but not covered until after the
end of the Class Period), you may obtain additional information about
this lawsuit and your ability to become a lead plaintiff by contacting

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made available on Monday Sliverlight 4 Tools for Visual Studio 2010, an add-on package for the Visual Studio 2010 IDE providing tooling for the Sliverlight 4 rich Internet plugin-in platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functioning with either the newly released Visual Studio 2010 or Visual Web Developer Express tools, Silverlight 4 Tools for Visual Studio supports capabilities such as Silverlight 4's elevated trust and out-of-browser application functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ See InfoWorld's report, "HTML5:  Could it kill Flash and Silverlight?" ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Silverlight 4 capabilities supported include Style Intellisense, for modifying XAML styles; Data Source Selector, for modifying data source information; and Go To Value Definition, for navigating directly from controls on a page to styles applied to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please note: many of the new designer features work well with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) as well as Silverlight projects, so this download is definitely recommended for Visual Studio 2010 WPF designer users too," the Visual Studio&#160;WPF and Silverlight Designer Team said in a blog post on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silverlight is Microsoft's entrant into the rich Internet application space, alongside rivals such as Adobe Systems Flash. But the HTML5 specification has been emerging as a potential rival and eventual replacement for single-vendor technologies such as Flash and Silverlight. Silverlight 4 was released last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siverlight 4 Tools for Visual Studio 2010 can be downloaded at Microsoft's Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "Microsoft Silverlight 4 tools released," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;MIcrosoft today said it is working with Apple to solve problems that iPad users have had with Windows Live Hotmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've seen some issues with using Hotmail on the new Apple iPad," acknowledged Mike Schackwitz, the Hotmail program manager, in an entry on the "Inside Windows Live" blog Monday. "Specifically, composing and replying to an e-mail is not working for some of our users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iPad users have reported problems with Microsoft's Web-based e-mail service, including the iPad's Safari browser freezing and an inability to compose new messages or reply to received mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can read mail but I can't compose a new message or reply to a message," said someone identified as "mitchgrrt" on Apple's support forum on April 6, just three days after the tablet went on sale. "iPad won't let me type in the message input area, and Safari hangs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're working with Apple to understand the issues, and we'll fix them as quickly as possible," said Schackwitz. He did not provide a timetable for a Hotmail fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Apple's support forum, most iPad users said that they were able to grab their Hotmail messages after setting up the tablet's baked-in Mail client to access Microsoft's service as a POP account. Others urged iPad users who were experiencing problems to switch to the mobile Hotmail site , which uses a stripped-down interface more suitable for the smaller screens on smartphones. Microsoft has since redirected all iPad traffic to the mobile version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is expected to unveil a new version of Windows Live Hotmail on Tuesday. Last week, Australian blogger Long Zheng said invitations had gone out for the unveiling of what Microsoft's codenamed the "Wave 4" versions of Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, the company's instant messaging client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today said it will pay communications software maker VirnetX $200 million to settle a three-year-old patent infringement case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original February 2010 lawsuit, Scotts Valley, Calif.-based VirnetX claimed Microsoft used its patented virtual private networking (VPN) technologies in Windows XP and Vista, Windows Server 2003, Live Communications Server, Windows Messenger, Office Communicator and Microsoft Office from the 2003 edition on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VirnetX added Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 to the list of Microsoft's infringing products in a second lawsuit filed in March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Texas federal jury awarded VirnetX $106 million last March to end the first lawsuit. At the time, Microsoft said it planned to appeal the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement Monday, VirnetX and Microsoft announced that both lawsuits would be dismissed as part of the $200 million settlement. Microsoft will also license the VirnetX patents, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All other aspects of the settlement will remain confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to work with VirnetX to bring these cases to a successful resolution through this settlement," said Tom Burt, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, in the joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that this successful resolution of our litigation with Microsoft will allow us to focus on the upcoming pilot system that will showcase VirnetX's automatic Virtual Private Network technology," said Kendall Larsen, VirnetX Holding Corp.'s CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is no stranger to the Tyler, Texas court where VirnetX won its jury verdict. That venue was also the scene of a nearly-$300 million verdict against Microsoft in August 2007, when a jury held that Microsoft illegally used Canadian developer i4i's XML editing technology in the popular Word line of word processing software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case attracted attention because U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Davis, who also heard the VirnetX case, issued an injunction that barred Microsoft from selling Word as of Oct. 10, 2009. Davis' injunction was later postponed after Microsoft threatened that sales chaos would result , and several major computer makers, including Hewlett-Packard and Dell , stepped forward to say the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2010, Microsoft stripped the custom XML tagging technology from Word 2007 to meet Davis' delayed deadline. Word 2010, which was officially released to businesses last week, does not include the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office confirmed i4i's patent .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An appeals court has refused to hear Microsoft's appeal on the injunction, but the company is still considering taking the case to the Supreme Court. "There remain important matters of patent law at stake, and we are considering our options to get them addressed, including a petition to the Supreme Court," said Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

The Silver Lining in the Euro Meltdown

I am bullish on EVERY USA company doing business in the EU, today and through Q2
reports ... around the second week of July 2010. 

Why? ... Smiling ... the silver lining in every cloud ... 

This Euro meltdown is a GREAT opportunity for USA companies, doing business in
the EU with euros in their EU bank accounts, to profit from the meltdown by
exchanging their euros for USA dollars. Therefore, I expect to see companies
like Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPQ) to report currency
exchange rate GAINS in addition to product profits. 

What tells me they're doing that ... when you exchange euros for the USD you are
"selling" Euros ... and "buying" USD. The selling in Euros ... is driving the
Euros down ... and the apparent availability of the euro to exchange for the USD
signals lack of euro demand ... while the raising USD signals strong demand and
lack of availability ... which the USA tried to head off at the pass by opening
up the window to the EU. Seems the gov'ts were aware this scenario was coming
... and points for being ahead of the curve ... or this would be WORSE. 

Surprise profits, and stocks "On sale, NOW!" ... that's why I'm bullish.

&lt;p&gt; * U.S. Trust poaches JPMorgan Private Bank's Middleton&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Middleton to run Palm Beach, Florida, business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Clare Baldwin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Trust, a high net worth
arm of Bank of America's (BAC.N) wealth business, on Monday
said it recruited JPMorgan Private Bank's Woodward Middleton to
lead the expansion of its business in the Palm Beach, Florida,
region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Middleton, who has more than 16 years experience in wealth
management and spent eight years in the U.S. Marine Corps, will
work in U.S. Trust's Palm Beach office. Middleton was formerly
a vice president and senior banker at JPMorgan (JPM.N) Private
Bank in the same affluent Florida town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Trust, like other private banks and brokerages, is
scrambling to recruit and retain bankers. U.S. Trust, which
lost five people last week to Citigroup's (C.N) Citi Private
Bank, focuses on ultra-wealthy clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit was bought by Bank of America for $3.3 billion in
2006. Bank of America last year bought Merrill Lynch, which
focuses on retail clients but also serves some high net worth
clients, raising some questions how the two businesses will
work together without competing for the same clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America wealth management boss Sallie Krawcheck has
said U.S. Trust is not for sale, and that the two businesses
complement one another.

&lt;p&gt;  SUNNYVALE, CA, May 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Juniper Networks(R) (NYSE: JNPR) today introduced a new enterprise
services portfolio, Juniper Care Plus, designed to protect high
performance network investments while increasing reliability and
operational effectiveness, and lowering operating expenses. Juniper Care
Plus, expected to be available in Q4 of this year, will build upon the
award winning Juniper Care set of services for device level support,
extending mission critical support for enterprise customers. 

    Juniper Care Plus will keep the network at optimum readiness through
high-touch support (Designated Service Manager), proactive automation
tools to help automate and simplify the network (Junos Space, Service
Now, Service Insight) and personalized services such as education,
network consulting and account management -- all mitigating risk for
enterprise customers. The Designated Service Manager will provide
personalized support through a single point of contact for all service
activities, issues and incidents. 

    "Networks must be reliable, scalable, and secure and are an increasingly
critical component to the overall success of enterprise organizations,"
said Christine Tenneson, research director with Gartner. "Service
organizations can help enterprises optimize network performance by
providing robust automation tools, education and training and consulting
services designed to help customers adapt rapidly to the increasingly
complex infrastructure requirements, while maintaining business
continuity."

    "Juniper's world-class services portfolio helps customers quickly
integrate Juniper technology into their enterprise and data center
environments to simplify operations, increase network availability, and
minimize business risk and costs," said Mike Rose, executive vice
president, Service, Support and Operations at Juniper. "Juniper Care Plus
will preempt exposure to known issues, not just by identifying and
resolving them, but by empowering customers and service partners to
anticipate problems and take proactive measures to avoid them."

    "IntercontinentalExchange facilitates high velocity electronic trading
activities for our customers around the world, which requires that we
deploy a flexible and highly available network without sacrificing
performance," said Mark Wassersug, vice president, Operations,
IntercontinentalExchange. "Juniper Care provides proactive support,
helping us better anticipate problems before they happen rather than
functioning in a reactive manner. This, in turn, increases our ability to
grow trading transaction volumes and deliver a high level of customer
satisfaction."

    Juniper also announced it is teaming with IBM Global Services, the
world's largest technology services and consulting provider, to integrate
Juniper's full portfolio of networking solutions into IBM's automated and
remote support services, providing better reliability, scalability,
security and availability to mobile enterprise clients. IBM will also
offer Juniper's data center networking solutions -- including switching,
routing and security technologies all running on the Junos(R) operating
system -- as maintenance and support services for cloud computing
environments.

    "IBM Hardware Maintenance Services for Juniper Networks products can help
customers enable a security-rich high-performance IT infrastructure with
around the clock global support," said Robb Kaufmann, vice president,
Global Alliances, IBM. "We recently added Service Now to our Juniper
support offering so that we can proactively monitor and identify problems
for our customers, reducing the time required to resolve issues on select
Juniper products. With faster problem-source identification and
resolution, network availability and IT efficiency are greatly improved." 

    Built on the Junos Space network application platform, Service Now
reduces time-to-resolution by providing an early-warning system that
keeps constant vigil for potential and acute problems on the network.
Service Insight delivers automated business intelligence for unsurpassed
proactive protection, diagnosis and resolution, thereby optimizing
network availability and eliminating time-consuming manual tasks.

&lt;p&gt;Global LCD TV Sales Remain Strong
CORNING, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) President and Chief Operating Officer Peter F.
Volanakis will tell investors today that "all of our businesses, including our
equity ventures, are on track with our expectations for the second quarter" when
he speaks at the J.P. Morgan Technology Conference in Boston at 8:40 a.m.
Corning`s comments at the conference can be heard via webcast at
www.corning.com/investor_relations. 

Industry data indicates that retail demand for LCD TVs, notebooks, and monitors
remains robust. April LCD TV unit sales increased 13% in the U.S. over last
year. Similarly, unit sales in Europe and Japan increased 22% and 44%,
respectively. "These growth rates continue to run ahead of our internal
forecasts," Volanakis will say. The retail data is the result of reports from a
variety of independent consumer market research organizations (NPD, GFK and CMM)
and the company`s internal analysis. 

In China, LCD TV demand appears to remain strong as well. "We do not yet have
April retail data for China, but there are no indications that consumers`
appetite has abated," Volanakis will say. "Incentive programs continue and
retail prices are very attractive. As a result, we still see 37 million LCD TV
unit sales in China this year." 

The company will note that second-quarter display volume expectations of
mid-single-digit sequential growth for both its wholly owned business and
Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd., have not changed. Price declines are
expected to be down slightly sequentially. Volanakis will add, "The operating
performance within our Display Technologies segment has been excellent." 

Volanakis will also comment that Corning`s Telecommunications segment remains on
track with the company`s previous guidance of a 10% to 15% sequential increase.
The business is experiencing very strong seasonal demand for both fiber and
cable in North America and Europe driven by very strong pull from new private
network builds, as well as from the start of a fiber-to-the-home ramp in Canada.
Second-quarter sales in the Specialty Materials segment are expected to be in
line with the company`s guidance of a 15% to 25% increase over quarter one,
primarily driven by Gorilla glass. Sales in both the Environmental Technologies
segment and the Life Sciences segment are also on pace with the company`s
guidance for the quarter. 

Corning's comments to investors at the J.P. Morgan Technology Conference will be
available by accessing the IR events calendar on Corning's Web site. To access
the calendar, go to www.corning.com/investor_relations and click Investor Events
on the left.

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta--(Business Wire)--
iStockphoto, the world`s busiest online stock image marketplace, today announced
the immediate availability of a new plug-in that puts more than six million
photos and illustrations at the fingertips of Microsoft Office users. The
plug-in is available for free and can be downloaded at

iStockphoto images from within PowerPoint and Word, where they can select,
preview, purchase and insert images directly into their documents. 

"iStockphoto has been a valued image provider on the Microsoft Office web site
for several years," said Sharon Meramore, the downloadable content manager for
the Office website. "We`re excited that iStock now exposes its whole collection
through the user interface of Word and PowerPoint, making it easier and faster
for our customers to create more compelling documents."

Reynolds, a popular blogger and author of the best-selling book, "Presentation
Zen." The video shows how easy it is to select and add an iStock image into a
PowerPoint presentation. 

"One of the most effective ways to turn a mediocre presentation into a
remarkable presentation is through the use of well-chosen, high-quality
imagery," said Reynolds. "The availability of this plug-in is great for
presenters and even better for their intended audiences."

&lt;p&gt;Asked about acquisitions like Hewlett-Packard Co's (HPQ.N) $13.2 billion purchase of EDS, Adam Klaber, general manager of consulting and analytics at International Business Machines Corp's Global Business Services, said he saw none so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't see them in the higher-ended services market, They haven't been there in the past ... and we don't see it," he told the Reuters Global Technology Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klaber oversees one of the fastest-growing segments of the company, which has been trying to shift to higher-margin services and software businesses from commoditized hardware over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM bought PricewaterhouseCooper's management consulting and IT services business from PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2002, and is the world's biggest IT consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other technology companies are also expanding into services and software, with Dell Inc DELL.O buying Perot Systems Corp for close to $4 billion and Xerox Corp (XRX.N) acquiring Affiliated Computer Services Inc for $5.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, by comparison, spent just $1.5 billion on acquisitions in 2009, mostly focused on niche technology companies. Chief Executive Sam Palmisano said on Wednesday it would spend around $20 billion in acquisitions through 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klaber said rivals were merely following their lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What they're doing is following the business model we have. We have a 10-year lead with them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to accelerate our investments but we're not going to change the course," Klaber said. "It may be a little boring, but we feel it works."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Facilities to Allow All-Round Experiments on Renewable Energy-Based Power
Supply
TOKYO--(Business Wire)--
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (TOKYO:6503) announced today that it will invest
a total of 7 billion yen by March 2012 in a project to build facilities within
the company's production sites in Japan for experiments designed to establish
advanced smart grid technologies. The project will contribute to the company's
efforts to support the adoption of sustainable power supplies worldwide. 

For an image of the facility, please visit:
http://global.mitsubishielectric.com/news/index.html

To address global environmental issues, Japan and many other countries are
promoting the production of energy from photovoltaic, wind-power and other
renewable energy sources as an alternative to fossil fuels. Generating power
from weather-dependent sources such as sun or wind, may impact the reliability
of the power system due to the fluctuation in electricity generation. Smart grid
technologies will help to integrate in the power system a large amount of
renewable sources without negative effects on the stability and reliability. 

Mitsubishi Electric will build experimental facilities at the company's three
Japanese domestic production sites located in Amagasaki, Wakayama and Ofuna. The
facilities will all be connected by a wide-area communication network and be
remotely monitored. 

At the Amagasaki site, located in Hyogo Prefecture, Mitsubishi Electric will
install a 4-megawatt photovoltaic system, a 500-kilowatt rechargeable battery
for transmission purposes, a power system simulator, power system stabilizer,
150 smart meters, an electric vehicle charging station and other related
equipment. Advance Metering Infrastructure, advanced energy management and
distribution automation system, will monitor and operate the assets and
equipment. The total system will be used to demonstrate the benefit of smart
grid technologies in each sector of the electricity industry. 

The company will also install a 200-kilowatt photovoltaic system at its Wakayama
site, located in Wakayama Prefecture, and a demonstration facility at its Ofuna
site, located in Kanagawa Prefecture. To demonstrate optimal energy management
in private residences, the facility in Ofuna will feature a residential
photovoltaic system, appliances for all-electric homes, smart meter,
home-gateway and other network-connected equipment 

By March 2011, Mitsubishi Electric plans to equip each site with the components
and build systems required for the company to begin basic experiments. By March
2012, the company plans to conduct full-fledged experiments, including analysis
of power supply when electricity generated from renewable energy sources flows
into power grids. Mitsubishi Electric aims to market smart grid related products
and systems in the near future, and contribute to the realizing of a low carbon
society. 

Future visions of Mitsubishi Electric's smart grid business

Mitsubishi Electric's smart grid business will be carried out as a company-wide
project spanning the company's five business segments. In April 2010, Mitsubishi
Electric established two project teams to promote development in smart grid
technology. The Power Grid Project in the Transmission &amp; Distribution Systems
Center will be responsible for smart grid electric systems and equipment. The
Next Generation Energy Communication Project in the Communication Networks
Center will be responsible for the smart grid communication network. 

Mitsubishi Electric's smart grid related technologies and know-how, as well as
the products developed from this project are not only targeted at the Japanese
market, but are also intended deployment in markets overseas. For the European
market, in particular, where a large amount of electricity is expected to be
generated from renewable energy sources, Mitsubishi Electric plans to utilize
its findings mainly to promote its photovoltaic systems business. In regions
where there is demand for the upgrade and expansion of electric infrastructure,
such as China, India and North America, Mitsubishi Electric intends to focus on
transmission and distribution equipment business. Meanwhile, in areas such as
South-east Asia, where there is strong demand for "comprehensive smart community
packages," including operation of electric infrastructure, the company will look
into entering the market through participation in Japan Smart Community
Alliances (JSCA).

&lt;p&gt;   * Wheatstone LNG on track for investment approval in 2011&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Assessing govt's proposed tax changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Awarded A$22 billion in contracts for Gorgon LNG (Adds
background, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRISBANE, Australia, May 17 (Reuters) - U.S. oil giant
Chevron (CVX.N) is sticking to the existing timetable for its
Wheatstone liquefied natural gas project in Australia, the firm
said on Monday, despite the nation's new mining tax. The
Australian government has hit the resources industry with a
planned 40 percent windfall-profits tax, forcing some of them
them to review major projects or extend development timetables
until their concerns over the tax are resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Australia Managing Director Roy Krzywosinski told
an energy conference he was assessing the impact of the tax but
said the firm was still on track to make a final investment
decision on the Wheatstone project in 2011. The Wheatstone
project has yet to be costed by Chevron but is often quoted in
media reports as being worth around A$20 billion ($17.7
billion), among roughly $200 billion worth of LNG projects on
the drawing board in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Santos Ltd (STO.AX), Australia's-second largest oil and gas
producer, said this month it would defer for up to six months a
decision on whether to build an LNG export terminal in
Gladstone in Queensland state, as it assesses the impact of the
tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new tax is to be introduced in 2012 and will not apply
to oil-and-gas producers operating in Australian waters, which
already pay a 40 percent petroleum resource rent tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two taxes are calculated differently and owners of
offshore oil-and-gas operations have the option of swapping
their petroleum tax for the new tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron plans to ship first gas out of its 8.6 million
tonnes per annum (mtpa) Wheatstone project as early as 2016. It
has inked preliminary sales of 4.1 mtpa to Japan's Tokyo
Electric Power Co (9501.T) and 0.8 mtpa to Kyushu Electric
Power Co (9508.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On its massive A$43 billion Gorgon LNG export project in
Australia, which was approved last year, Chevron said on Monday
it had awarded more than A$22 billion in contracts and was on
track for first LNG shipments as early as 2014.

&lt;p&gt;The Luna SA Product Integration Supports Enhanced Security and Database
Management
BELCAMP, Md.--(Business Wire)--
SafeNet, Inc., a global leader in information security, today announced that its
Luna SA and Luna PCI Hardware Security Modules (HSM) help secure Microsoft SQL
Server 2008 R2. The SafeNet HSMs work with the database management system to
provide organizations with a highly secure platform for storing and managing
sensitive data. This combination delivers enhanced cryptography and encryption
as well as high-speed and seamless installation. 

The integration of SafeNet`s Luna SA with SQL Server 2008 R2 allows storage of
the server`s master cryptographic keys - the foundation of any robust security
solution - and provides greater application security and performance by
separating select key management functionality. When embedded directly into the
database server, the Luna PCI provides added security, as well as accelerated
cryptographic performance and CPU offload. 

"SafeNet`s Luna SA and Luna PCI provide organizations using Microsoft SQL Server
2008 R2 with additional security features to help meet today`s ever-evolving
data threats and compliance mandates," said Claude Lorenson, director of SQL
Server marketing at Microsoft Corp. "Organizations can add a layer of security
technology that helps protect keys to be separate from the data it protects
while accelerating complex features such as key rotation." 

In addition to providing greater security, the updated technology will allow
many end users to meet compliance regulations, battle e-privacy issues, and
operate more efficiently and at a lower cost. 

"The SafeNet Luna SA and Luna PCI offer users of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2
two flexible encryption options for their deployment scenarios," said Chris
Fedde, president and COO, SafeNet. "With the integration of SQL Server 2008 R2,
we are confident that we are further enabling customers to fully realize a
seamless, security-enhanced integration, and become more compliant with
government standards and regulations." 

Integration with Microsoft applications is facilitated via the SafeNet Luna EKM,
which is used to set up Extensible Key Management (EKM) for SQL Server 2008 R2.
The Luna EKM Configuration Utility allows the flexibility to set parameters
required by the EKM module and allows for the encryption of data using
encryption keys on the external Luna EKM module. 

The relationship with Microsoft dates back to the development of the Luna HSM.
This latest collaboration continues the strong history of working together to
provide more secure products and operating environments. 

"In some performance testing, I found the Luna SA hardware implementation was
able to decrypt data that was a previously encrypted with a 2048 Bit RSA key
over 200 times faster than the CryptoAPI software implementation in Microsoft
SQL Server," stated Michael Coles, Microsoft SQL Server MVP and consultant. 

SafeNet`s HSM technology is a key component of its overall approach to data
security and risk management. These tools persistently protect data across the
entire enterprise via an integrated security platform. For more information

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sued Salesforce.com in federal court on Tuesday, alleging that the customer-relationship management (CRM) vendor has violated nine of Microsoft's patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move was a rare one for Microsoft. Although the company is often the target of patent litigation, it's rarely the instigator. In Microsoft's 35-year history , it's accused others of infringing its patents only three times before today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time was in 2009 when it sued GPS maker TomTom over the company's in-car navigational devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other patent infringement lawsuits Microsoft initiated were against Taiwanese mouse maker Primax Electronics in 2008, and peripherals manufacturer Belkin in 2006. Microsoft settled with both companies before the lawsuits reached trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They don't sue often," said Rob Enderle, an analyst at Enderle Group. "It's very rare that they aggressively go after someone [on patents]. But these are core Microsoft patents, the company's crown jewels. They'll heavily defend these against any software developer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft's complaint, which was filed on Tuesday in a Seattle federal court, Salesforce.com is using Microsoft-patented technologies in its Web-based CRM software and service service, and in supporting hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the patents are several that at a glance appear to be quite broad. One of the nine patents that Microsoft alleged Salesforce.com infringed is entitled "System and method for providing and displaying a web page having an embedded menu," while another is labeled "Method and system for stacking toolbars in a computer display."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe Salesforce was betting that they're too general [for Microsoft] to defend," said Enderle. "Older patents especially are sometimes hard to defend because they're so general. We'll see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com's director of public relations, Gordon Evans, declined to comment on the lawsuit today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had no such hesitation. "Microsoft has been a leader and innovator in the software industry for decades and continues to invest billions of dollars each year in bringing great software products and services to market," said Horacio Gutierrez, Microsoft's deputy counsel of intellectual property and licensing, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a responsibility to our customers, partners, and shareholders to safeguard that investment, and therefore cannot stand idly by when others infringe our IP rights," Gutierrez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My best guess is that Salesforce thought Microsoft was all bark and no bite," said Enderle. "But these patents are the building blocks of Microsoft, and differentiate its products from others'," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today warned users of a vulnerability in the 64-bit versions of Wndows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 that could be used to hijack systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug is in Windows' Canonical Display Driver, which blends the operating system's primary graphics interface, dubbed Graphics Device Interface (GDI), and DirectX to compose the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Jerry Bryant, a group manager with the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), the vulnerability affects any machine with the flashy "Aero" interface, which is the default on all but the least-expensive editions of Windows 7. Aero is an optional install on Windows Server 2008 R2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If exploited, it would likely cause the affected system to stop responding and restart," said Bryant in an entry on the MSRC blog . "Code execution, while possible in theory, would be very difficult due to memory randomization both in kernel memory and via Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, ASLR, one of the bulwarks of Windows 7's and Vista's security defenses, has been repeatedly bypassed by researchers , including two who won $10,000 cash prizes at the noted Pwn2Own hacking contest in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft gave the bug an exploitability index rating of "3," the lowest of the company's three-step scoring system it uses to predict the likelihood of reliable attack code appearing in the next 30 days. According to that score, Microsoft believes it's unlikely hackers will come up with an exploit in the coming month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're currently developing a security update for Windows that will address the vulnerability," promised Bryant, who did not set a timetable for a patch. In lieu of a fix, users can disable Aero to protect their machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attackers could exploit the vulnerability by tricking users into visiting a malicious site that hosts a rigged image file, Microsoft's advisory warned .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an attack may require more than that seemingly simple tactic, said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Security. "I believe what Microsoft is saying [in the advisory] is that the image viewers from Microsoft won't trigger the vulnerability, but third-party applications may."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To disable Aero, users can click Start, select Control Panel, then click on "Appearance and Personalization," Microsoft said in the advisory. Under "Presentation," users would then click "Change the Theme" and then select one of the "Basic and High Contrast Themes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's advisory is not the only vulnerability not yet patched by Microsoft. A flaw in SharePoint Server 2007 was acknowledged by the company late last month, but remains unfixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's next security updates are slated for release June 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company won't patch this latest vulnerability that fast, said Storms. "No way," he said via instant message when asked what chance Microsoft has to ready a fix in three weeks. "They are already saying it's difficult to reproduce, [so] it will be a low priority at the moment. But the info is public, so you can bet it's getting eyeballs and things can change rapidly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, Hotmail is the world's largest Web-based e-mail service, with more than 360 million active accounts worldwide. But when it comes to buzz, Gmail has had it beat for the past several years. Now that may change. A revamped Hotmail was announced on May 18; it will be available sometime in July or August, with the exact date still to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was able to work with the new version and found that it has the fast responsiveness and full feature set of a desktop application rather than a Web-based one. It also offers some very nifty features that Gmail is lacking, including better mail management and more ways to eliminate e-mail clutter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better interface&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the new Hotmail simply looks better -- it's more graphical and easier on the eyes. And it feels faster and more responsive. Like the old Hotmail, folders are on the left-hand side of the screen, and the in-box and reading pane on the right. But that basic layout has gotten a makeover, with a number of links added to the left side of the screen and a new set of links across the top of the right side of the screen to make it easier to find mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the left-hand side, underneath a list of your folders, is a section called Quick View, which allows you to quickly view mail based on several preset criteria. These include mail that you've tagged, mail with photos in it, mail with Office documents as attachments and mail sent from shipping services such as FedEx. Click any category, and you'll see only the relevant mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filters, located just above the main mail screen, allow you to view your e-mail based on several other categories, including unread mail, mail from contacts, mail from Windows Live groups and others. Filtering is particularly powerful when combined with Quick Views. You could, for example, choose to see only mail with Office documents attached that were sent by your contacts. Or you could see all unread shipping updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Message threading is also improved by the addition of a Conversation View, much like you will find in Outlook 2010. It lets you easily see an entire e-mail conversation at a glance, including all messages sent and received, rather than hunting for them individually in your in-box, out-box and other folders. This seemingly small feature may be the biggest productivity enhancer in the entire Hotmail upgrade. It can easily save hours each month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, the feature is turned off. To turn it on, you'll have to select Options -- More Options -- Conversation settings, select "Group messages by conversation" and click Save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the niftier new features is the ability to view embedded media content directly within Hotmail, instead of having to go to an external site to view it. So if you're sent a link to a YouTube video, for example, you'll be able to view the video within Hotmail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Sweep feature cleans up clutter by allowing you to delete or move all marked mail in a folder, or mark an entire folder as having been read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved security&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has added several new security features, most of which work behind the scenes, such as the SmartScreen antispam tool and what Microsoft claims is an improved spammer detection infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one security measure you will notice is the "trusted senders" feature, which puts a green safety logo next to legitimate senders that are often the target of phishing scams, such as banks. Hotmail identifies those messages that are from valid financial institutions and other targeted companies, making it less likely that you'll be victimized by a phishing attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotmail stays social&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you log into the new version of Hotmail, you don't immediately go to your in-box. Instead, you begin with a Hotmail highlights page (it actually lives on Windows Live rather than Hotmail) that grabs the latest information from your social networks, including Facebook and MySpace, as well as your contacts on Windows Live Messenger. (At this point, Twitter and LinkedIn are not available.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lets you see updates on Facebook without having to leave Hotmail. You'll be able to make comments on those updates, and they'll appear on Facebook, again without leaving Hotmail. You can even view videos posted on Facebook. You can't, though, post to your Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If more services are added (including the ability to post to your Facebook page), Hotmail could become a central point for your communication on social networking sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotmail integrates with social networking sites in another very important way as well: It includes your contacts from those sites in your Hotmail contacts list. That way, you don't need to go to multiple places to find contact information; it's all right in Hotmail. A nice touch is that it categories your contacts for you as well, showing you contacts from Facebook, Messenger and so on. You can also view them all together, uncategorized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you view a contact from a social networking site, you'll see his contact information and can also jump directly to his page on, say, Facebook. I found one aspect of the way that Hotmail integrates with social networking sites confusing, though. When I was in Hotmail and was looking at a contact who is one of my Facebook friends, there was a message "You're not friends with Barbara. Add as friend." In fact, what it was doing was showing that I wasn't friends with that contact on Windows Live Messenger -- but it didn't specifically mention Live Messenger in the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integration with Outlook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest version of Hotmail integrates with Outlook through the recently updated Microsoft Outlook Hotmail Connector. That's the good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that all of Hotmail's new features aren't carried over to Outlook. For example, the only Hotmail contacts you'll be able to see in Outlook will be those native to Hotmail itself -- you won't be able to view contacts from social networking sites such as Facebook. And while you can see your Hotmail e-mail in Outlook, you can't use the Conversation View for it, which is odd, considering that Outlook 2010 has its own Conversation View. Perhaps in time integration will improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other extras&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of other very nice extras in this version of Hotmail, including integration with the newly released Office Web Apps. When you're sent an Office document, you can save it to Skydrive -- Microsoft's free online storage service -- and from there open it in Office Web Apps, which is Microsoft's free online version of Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need heavier editing capabilities than are provided in Office Web Apps, you can then open the document in Office on your PC, although you'll need to be using Internet Explorer to do that. You can then save it back to Skydrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of attachments, you can send whopper-sized attachments in the new version of Hotmail if you want -- up 10GB in one message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way Hotmail works on mobile devices has also been improved. People who work in enterprises that use Exchange ActiveSync will be able to synchronize e-mail between their smartphones and the Web. Hotmail apps are available for BlackBerry and Symbian-based Nokia phones. (We weren't able to confirm whether apps for other mobile devices, such as the iPhone, are in the works.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the revamped Hotmail compare to Gmail? In some ways, it's superior. The new Hotmail beats Gmail hands down for social network integration; Gmail also lacks the ability to view embedded media content from sites such as YouTube. For e-mail handling, while Gmail does an excellent job of that, I prefer the new Hotmail -- but that's strictly a personal preference. (For more on Hotmail vs. Gmail, check out my blog entry.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new version of Hotmail focuses largely on productivity enhancements such as improved mail handling. It's also now easily the most elegant-looking of any Web-based mail service. If you've never used Hotmail before, or swore off it in the past, now is the time to take a new look -- you'll likely be exceedingly pleased at what you find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston Gralla is a contributing editor to Computerworld.com and the author of more than 35 books, including How the Internet Works (Que, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;

qu`elle constatait un int&#233;r&#234;t et un &#233;lan prononc&#233;s en Europe pour son EVault for

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of the Securities and Exchange Commission's most senior lawyers will take part in the regulator's civil fraud lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorin Reisner, the SEC's deputy director of enforcement and a former federal prosecutor, will participate in the case, the regulator said in a one-sentence filing with Manhattan federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reisner joined the SEC in August from Debevoise  Plimpton LLP, where he had since 1996 been a litigation partner focused on white-collar crime, internal investigations, and securities and other litigation. He previously worked from 1990 to 1994 as a federal prosecutor in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC lawsuit accused Goldman of creating and marketing collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages in early 2007, without telling investors that the hedge fund Paulson  Co helped choose the underlying securities and was betting against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors lost about $1 billion on the securities, the SEC said, roughly equal to the profit that Paulson gained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has denied wrongdoing. Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman vice president accused of being a key figure in creating the so-called Abacus transaction, was also sued by the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs  Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) shareholders rejected a proposal to strip Chief Executive Jamie Dimon of his chairman title, but they gave him a hard time at the bank's annual meeting on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest bank, which was profitable during the financial crisis, attracted a larger-than-usual turnout at the meeting, held in the heart of New York City's financial district and steps from Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some shareholders expressed their anger with salty questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Isn't this business a little bit like running a house of ill repute while knowing that all your ladies have AIDS?" asked one man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No," Dimon replied, then moved to the next question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon has won plaudits for his acquisitions of troubled Bear Stearns Cos in March 2008 and for failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual Inc just days after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy later that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, he faced shareholders angry about the bank's 5-cent-a-share quarterly dividend, upset homeowners whose homes Chase is foreclosing upon, and environmental groups critical of the bank's financing of mountaintop coal removal companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen protesters stood in the rain outside One Chase Manhattan Plaza, greeting shareholders going to the meeting just before it began at 10 a.m. ET. At one point, there were as many as 300 protesters, Dow Jones reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some protesters wore yellow T-shirts with the words 'Stop the loan sharks,' while others jangled keys, representing the houses Chase has foreclosed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal to split the jobs of chairman and chief executive received 33.9 percent of the vote. The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. public pension fund, said on Monday it was in favor of separating the roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders also voted more than 40 percent in favor of a proposal to give shareholders with more than 10 percent of the bank's stock the right to call shareholder meetings. They voted more than 30 percent in favor of a proposal to require the bank to disclose more about the use of collateral in its derivatives business. Both proposals failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dimon came in for more criticism than he faced at last year's annual meeting, he was not without fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jamie, you have to stay here forever," said Evelyn Davis, self-described "queen of the corporate jungle" and a perennial, sometimes persnickety presence at many companies' annual meetings. "I'm not going to let you ever resign."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIVIDEND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan told shareholders the bank is waiting on a "sustained" economic recovery before raising its dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are working as hard as we can to restore your dividend," Dimon told one shareholder who asked when she could expect to see an increase.

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan waiting for significant decrease in loan losses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Shareholders reject proposal for independent chairman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares down 1 percent
 (Adds shareholder comment, vote numbers)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Elinor Comlay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
shareholders rejected a proposal to strip Chief Executive Jamie
Dimon of his chairman title, but they gave him a hard time at
the bank's annual meeting on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. bank, which was profitable during
the financial crisis, attracted a larger-than-usual turnout at
the meeting, held in the heart of New York City's financial
district and steps from Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some shareholders expressed their anger with salty
questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Isn't this business a little bit like running a house of
ill repute while knowing that all your ladies have AIDS?" asked
one man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No," Dimon replied, then moved to the next question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon has won plaudits for his acquisitions of troubled
Bear Stearns Cos in March 2008 and for failed Seattle thrift
Washington Mutual Inc just days after Lehman Brothers filed for
bankruptcy later that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, he faced shareholders angry about the bank's
5-cent-a-share quarterly dividend, upset homeowners whose homes
Chase is foreclosing upon, and environmental groups critical of
the bank's financing of mountaintop coal removal companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than a dozen protesters stood in the rain outside One
Chase Manhattan Plaza, greeting shareholders going to the
meeting just before it began at 10 a.m. ET. At one point, there
were as many as 300 protesters, Dow Jones reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some protesters wore yellow T-shirts with the words 'Stop
the loan sharks,' while others jangled keys, representing the
houses Chase has foreclosed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposal to split the jobs of chairman and chief
executive received 33.9 percent of the vote. The California
Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. public
pension fund, said on Monday it was in favor of separating the
roles. [ID:nSGE64H04C]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders also voted more than 40 percent in favor of a
proposal to give shareholders with more than 10 percent of the
bank's stock the right to call shareholder meetings. They voted
more than 30 percent in favor of a proposal to require the bank
to disclose more about the use of collateral in its derivatives
business. Both proposals failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Dimon came in for more criticism than he faced at
last year's annual meeting, he was not without fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Jamie, you have to stay here forever," said Evelyn Davis,
self-described "queen of the corporate jungle" and a perennial,
sometimes persnickety presence at many companies' annual
meetings. "I'm not going to let you ever resign."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DIVIDEND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan told shareholders the bank is waiting on a
"sustained" economic recovery before raising its dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are working as hard as we can to restore your
dividend," Dimon told one shareholder who asked when she could
expect to see an increase. "We're hoping to do something like
that later this year or early next year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank plans to raise its dividend to about 30 percent to
40 percent of earnings when there is sustained improvement in
the economy and U.S. unemployment, and loan losses have
significantly fallen, Dimon said. JPMorgan pays a quarterly
dividend of 5 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is not ready to pay a special dividend before
permanently raising its quarterly dividend, Dimon said in
response to a shareholder question. The bank may at "some point
down the road" consider a share buyback program, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares fell 84 cents, or 2.1 percent, to close at
$39 on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) as the Bull of the Day
and American Oriental Bioengineering (NYSE: AOB) the Bear of the Day. In
addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Frontier Communications'
(NYSE: FTR), Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) and ArvinMeritor Inc. (NYSE:
ARM). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Microsoft's (Nasdaq: MSFT) huge core business, its acquisition strategy and cost
reduction initiatives are driving strong cash flows and earnings growth. That
said, shares are currently trading at 15.0X the trailing twelve months earnings
compared to 35.5X for the peer group and 29.6X for the S 500. 

While we recognize that competition continues to increase and the company's
dominant position in the PC market could erode, we note that attach rates of the
new operating system are increasing. We believe that Microsoft is poised to
benefit from new product cycles in both the enterprise PC and server markets. 

Over the past five years, MSFT shares have traded in the range of 8.6X to 24.9X
trailing twelve months earnings. Therefore, it is currently trading below the
middle of the historical range. shares had a great run in 2009, but the shares
are down 5.1% since the beginning of the year. However, we expect the shares to
trade higher since we are very optimistic about the new products and expect the
company to benefit from new product cycles. 

Bear of the Day: 

American Oriental Bioengineering's (NYSE: AOB) first quarter earnings per share
came in at $0.04, well below both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.07 and
$0.10 reported in the year-ago period. Although revenues recorded a 16.7%
year-over-year increase to $53.7 million, we remain concerned about the
declining operating margin. 

Prescription drug sales should continue their growth trajectory as China aims to
reform its health care sector to incorporate unaddressed rural markets. However,
in the highly fragmented Chinese pharmaceutical industry, AOB's expenses are
likely to increase given the need to stay ahead of its competitors and to meet
stringent manufacturing norms. 

We maintain our Underperform recommendation on the stock with a price target of
$3. Our target price is based on 6.5X our 2010 EPS estimate of $0.46.

Frontier Gets Last PSC Approval

Frontier Communications' (NYSE: FTR) pending acquisition of Verizon
Communications (NYSE: VZ) local wireline operations was at last approved by the
Public Service Commission (PSC) of West Virginia. With this, the company has
received all the required state approvals for the transaction. 

The deal has now passed a major obstacle -- it was opposed by the Communications
Workers of America (CWA) in West Virginia. The CWA feared that the transaction
is detrimental to the state`s interest and may lead Frontier to a severe
financial crunch. 

West Virginia is the ninth and final state to approve the deal, after the
required approvals from Arizona, California, Illinois, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon,
South Carolina and Washington. The pending acquisition is at present in the sole
hands of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as it has already received
various anti-trust approvals from Washington. The transaction is expected to
close by the end of the second quarter of 2010. 

As per the agreement, Verizon will receive $5.3 billion in Frontier common
stock, plus $3.3 billion in a combination of cash, debt and assumption of
previous debt issued by Verizon subsidiaries. Verizon holders will own 68% of
Frontier after the transaction. 

ArvinMeritor: Earnings Scorecard

ArvinMeritor Inc. (NYSE: ARM) reported its results for second quarter of its
fiscal 2010 ended March 31, 2010 on May 4, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate
by a significant margin of 16 cents per share. However, the market failed to
react very positively, with share prices fluctuating in the subsequent days,
mostly in a downward direction. 

Analysts declined to be encouraged by the results as well, given the company`s
weak outlook. Below we will cover the results of the recent earnings
announcement, subsequent analyst estimate revisions and Zacks ratings for both
short-term and the long-term outlooks for the stock.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Earnings Preview: Hewlett Packard

Hewlett Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ) is scheduled to announce its second quarter
2010 results on May 18, 2010 and we don`t see too much variation in analyst
estimates at this point. 

The company reported decent first quarter 2010 numbers, with EPS of $1.10
exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. 

HP delivered $31.2 billion in revenue, up 8.0% from $28.8 billion reported in
the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased across all businesses excluding
services. In particular, the Personal Systems Group (PSG) revenue was, up 20.0%
year over year, helped by a 26.0% year-over-year increase in unit shipments. 

Out of 28 analysts providing estimates for the second quarter, 2 have made
upward estimate revisions in the last 30 days, while there were no downward
revisions. For the July quarter, 4 analysts made upward revisions in the last 30
days, while 2 made downward revisions. This apart, out of 30 analysts tracking
the stock for fiscal year 2010, there were 3 upward revisions in the last 30
days and 1 downward revision. 

Most of the news flow relating to HP continues to be positive. As per the
figures published by IDC, HP still rules the computing world, with the largest
market share of 19.7% and registering a unit shipment growth of 19.9% in the
first quarter of 2010. This apart, the company has completed the acquisition of
networking major 3Com. HP will now be able to challenge networking leader Cisco
Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO), and can gain market share in the networking
business. 

We are optimistic about the company`s positive outlook for fiscal year 2010, its
enhanced product portfolio, growing customer base and the revival in the
macroeconomic scenario. Although we remain positive on the company`s performance
going forward given that demand is stabilizing and cyclical businesses
(particularly consumer PC) are rebounding, we remain concerned about the
long-term growth prospects of its printing unit. HP also plans to control costs
and generate incremental savings, which is essential for the company to maintain
growth in the upcoming quarters. 

Lowe`s Outpaces Zacks Consensus

Lowe`s Companies Inc. (NYSE: LOW), the world`s second largest home improvement
retailer, recently posted better-than-expected first-quarter 2010 results,
showing signs of improvement with consumers willing to spend on remodeling
projects and big ticket items. 

The quarterly earnings of 34 cents a share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of 31 cents, and climbed 6.3% from 32 cents posted in the prior-year
quarter. Lowe`s said that it now expects second-quarter 2010 earnings in the
range of 57 cents to 59 cents a share, and fiscal year 2010 earnings between
$1.37 and $1.47 per share. 

The company`s second-quarter 2010 guidance fell short of the current Zacks
Consensus Estimate of 62 cents a share. The stock fell $1.12 or 4.3% to $24.95
in pre-market trading on modest outlook despite stronger-than-expected results. 

Net sales for the quarter rose 4.7% year-over-year to $12,388 million, after
increasing 1.8% in fourth-quarter 2009. Management expects sales to increase
between 5% and 7% in the second-quarter and fiscal year 2010. 

IBM Faces Lawsuit Battle

International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and the State of Indiana have been
suing each other in an Indianapolis courthouse over a terminated outsourcing
deal, under which IBM was to overhaul and modernize Indiana's outdated and
ineffective welfare eligibility system. 

The State of Indiana sued its former welfare privatization partner, IBM,
alleging a breach of contract, which includes intentional denial of Medicaid
(the United States health program for eligible individuals and families with low
incomes and resources) to a dying cancer patient and a nun. 

The State is looking to recover a payment of $437.6 million to IBM (which it
paid over the past three years) in lieu of costs incurred for third-party
lawsuits, federal penalties and state employee overtime incurred as a result of
the deal. Moreover, the State is seeking triple damages of more than $1.3
billion under the state law, citing intentional denial of welfare benefits. The
Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) is also looking to set aside
IBM`s claim of $83.4 million in cancellation penalties claiming that this clause
in the agreement is unenforceable under state laws. 

IBM then countersued the State of Indiana, claiming recovery of fees and
expenses of $52.8 million due under a 10-year contract signed with the FSSA in
2006. IBM also wants cancellation penalties of $83.4 million. In October 2009,
the State terminated the contract and removed IBM from the position of lead
contractor for the deal. 

Salix Pharmaceuticals Beats Estimates

Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Nasdaq: SLXP) reported a net loss of 45 cents per
share in the first quarter of 2010, 6 cents better than the Zacks Consensus
Estimate. The company had guided towards a net loss of 50 cents. Salix reported
a net loss of 29 cents in the year-ago period. Net loss increased from the
year-ago period mainly due to an increase in costs and a slight decline in
revenues. 

First quarter revenues declined slightly (1.6%) to $44.1 million, mainly due to
decreased unit sales of MoviPrep, OsmoPrep, Apriso and Pepcid. This was
partially offset by increased unit sales of Xifaxan and price increases. Xifaxan
sales increased 23.9% to $29.9 million with prescription demand growing 15%
during the quarter. The bowel cleansing franchise, consisting of MoviPrep and
OsmoPrep generated revenues of $10.5 million, down 17.1%. OsmoPrep prescriptions
declined 38% mainly due to the boxed label warning announced by the FDA in late
2008. 

Gross margin was almost flat from the year-ago period at 77.8%. While research
and development expenses declined to $20.1 million during the quarter, Salix
recorded an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which came
in at $36.5 million.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An Australian hedge fund's former independent director has been complaining to regulators for more than two years about how Goldman Sachs Group contributed to the fund's collapse by selling it a toxic mortgage-linked security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in the wake of a recent Senate hearing on Goldman's role in the U.S. mortgage mess, during which the security -- called Timberwolf -- was repeatedly singled out by lawmakers as a particularly egregious transaction, David Mapley said he's finally getting a measure of satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mapley, a former independent director for the Basis Yield Alpha Fund, said what he really wants is for Goldman to give back the $100 million the Basis Capital fund and its investors sank into the Timberwolf collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are signs the persistence of Mapley and others connected to the defunct Australian hedge fund may be about to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Washington, D.C., law firm that represents the Basis fund is negotiating with Goldman over a possible settlement to the hedge fund's $100 million claim, people familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund's representatives initially hired Washington's Baach Robinson  Lewis more than a year ago to look into suing Goldman over the Timberwolf deal. The law firm did work on a draft complaint, but a lawsuit was never filed for reasons that remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'BEYOND THE NORM'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mapley, who resides in Switzerland but also has homes in the Cayman Islands and the United States, said he met with lawyers from Baach Robinson when he was still serving as one of the fund's independent directors and urged them to sue Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stepped down from the fund's board last summer and hasn't been involved in any settlement talks with the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found this aggressive behavior by Goldman," said Mapley, who still serves an independent director for a number of other offshore hedge funds. "We started uncovering certain practices that were beyond the norm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Basis fund's main contention is that the fund's managers were misled by Goldman when it purchased two $50 million tranches of Timberwolf, a $1 billion CDO that Goldman took to market in March 2007, according to Mapley and other people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Basis fund sank money into Timberwolf in June 2007, after the one-time $500 million fund claims it got assurances from Goldman's mortgage trading desk that the market for CDOs had stabilized after falling sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the hedge fund initially passed up an opportunity to invest in Timberwolf in April 2007 because Basis' managers were concerned about the health of the CDO market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mapley said he has been told Goldman sold the Timberwolf securities to the hedge fund at a significantly higher price than what similar mortgage-linked securities were selling for at the time. Basis' managers were not aware that Goldman's mortgage trading desk was actively shorting CDOs and other subprime mortgage-linked securities at the time of the Timberwolf deal, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a Goldman spokesman, said, "Basis advertised itself as a highly experienced, professional CDO manager and investor." He added that the hedge fund "had access to the same information regarding the underlying portfolio as Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEAL'S NOTORIETY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mapley, however, said he found Goldman's conduct in marketing and selling Timberwolf so disturbing that he contacted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about the deal in December 2007. He subsequently sat down with SEC lawyers several times in early 2008 to discuss the transaction, which he said securities regulators were already looking into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the SEC's early interest in Timberwolf, Mapley said he was surprised the commission's civil fraud claim against Goldman focused on another CDO -- Abacus 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I saw the SEC action against Goldman I thought it was going to be Timberwolf," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An SEC spokesman declined to comment on whether its lawyer met with Mapley and if regulators are looking into the Timberwolf transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Timberwolf deal drew considerable notoriety during last month's hearing by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation when lawmakers revealed that a former Goldman executive had described the transaction as "one shitty deal" in an internal Goldman email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman mortgage executive Thomas Montag, who now works for Bank of America, penned that "shitty deal" email on June 22, 2007. A week earlier, Basis invested in the Timberwolf deal by plunking down about $11 million in cash and financing the rest of the transaction with a margin loan from Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Timberwolf deal, which referenced a pool of other subprime-backed CDOs, quickly soured. By the end of August, the deal had lost 80 percent of its value and the CDO was liquidated in June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In buying Timberwolf on margin, Basis agreed to let Goldman re-price the value of the securities as it saw fit. And within weeks of closing the transaction, Goldman began marking down the securities and demanding cash collateral from Basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2007, the hedge fund told its investors it was planning to liquidate. Basis contends the liquidation was prompted in part by the demands for collateral payments by Goldman, said people familiar with the hedge fund and information reviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOKIO MARINE ROLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis was not the only hedge fund that purchased Timberwolf securities and went belly-up in summer 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The single biggest buyer of Timberwolf securities was the once giant Bear Stearns group of hedge funds, which invested $300 million in the CDO. The Bear funds, which once controlled nearly $30 billion of CDOs and other subprime mortgage-linked securities, imploded in June 2007 after the funds could not meet a series of margin calls from a dozen Wall Street lenders, including Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another buyer of Timberwolf securities was a division of Tokio Marine Holding Inc, one of Japan's largest property and casualty insurers, said people familiar with the Timberwolf deal. The insurer did not return phone calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matthew Goldstein with additional reporting in Australia by Narayanan Somasundaram and in Tokyo by Nathan Layne; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several dozen oil and gas producers have sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc and BP Plc, alleging they conspired with SemGroup LP to defraud the plaintiffs of money for oil and gas delivered just before the energy trader's 2008 bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 20 defendants, including Chevron Corp, were named in the four lawsuits filed earlier this month in Kansas and Oklahoma state courts. Goldman, BP and Chevron did not return requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the 14th-largest privately held U.S. company, SemGroup filed for Chapter 11 protection on July 22, 2008, in the wake of $3.2 billion of losses on energy futures and derivatives trades. It emerged on November 30, 2009, as SemGroup Corp, and this month said it plans to become publicly traded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 82 Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas producers are seeking millions of dollars owed on contracts in June and July 2008 to deliver millions of dollars of crude oil and gas to SemGroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN ROLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to two of the lawsuits, Goldman and its J. Aron  Co commodities trading unit took advantage of the bank's capacity as a SemGroup banker, lender and trading partner to enter transactions with the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SemGroup hedged its stored products with J. Aron, but soon faced a large margin call as oil and gas prices soared, the lawsuits said. This led to J. Aron's declaring a default and deciding to liquidate trading positions, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J. Aron has been linked in media reports, including an April 13, 2009, Forbes article, to allegations it profited from knowledge of SemGroup trading positions through Goldman's role as an investment banker for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the two lawsuits, "through their various relationships with ... SemGroup, J. Aron and Goldman Sachs gained access to confidential financial information, which J. Aron then used to its own advantage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Goodman, a principal at McKool Smith representing the producers, in an interview said: "We're saying that at a time J. Aron was undercollateralized in its trading relationship with SemGroup, it knowingly purchased crude oil and gas from SemGroup that it knew was coming from our clients, the producers, and knew it wasn't going to have to pay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Tucker, a partner at Rhodes, Hieronymus, Jones, Tucker  Gable who represents former SemGroup Chief Executive Thomas Kivisto, said he is looking into Goldman's role as he pursues claims his client may have over losses tied to the bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is correct to say that J. Aron and Goldman did have access to confidential trading information and strategies at SemGroup, and J. Aron became a significant counterparty," he said. "We are continuing our investigations along those very same issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP SETOFF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The producers separately contended that BP Oil Supply Co conspired to allow SemGroup to satisfy its contractual obligations by delivering the producers' crude oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Through this setoff scheme, BP was able to take possession of large quantities of crude oil and gas produced by plaintiffs without ever tendering payment," two of the lawsuits said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits seek compensatory, equitable and punitive damages, including damages from J. Aron and BP for conspiracy to commit fraud and conversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are Anstine  Musgrove Inc et al v. Calcasieu Refining Co et al, and Anstine  Musgrove Inc v. J.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) will cut 6,000 jobs, or 18 percent of the workforce, at its 78 manufacturing plants over the next five years as it pares back operations following last year's purchase of rival Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest drugmaker plans to cease operations at eight plants in Ireland, Puerto Rico and the United States by late 2015 and reduce activities at six factories in those countries, plus Germany and Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer had 40 manufacturing sites before acquiring more than three dozen Wyeth facilities in the October merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected plants make conventional pills, injectable medicines, biotech drugs and consumer healthcare products. Pfizer will wind down their operations over the next 18 months to five years, depending on business considerations such as the time required to transfer product manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said in November it would close six research sites and trim jobs in the United States and Britain as part of its absorption of Wyeth. It then began a six-month study of how to reconfigure its manufacturing sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a complex network of manufacturing plants, with excess capacity that is not good for costs," Nat Ricciardi, Pfizer's president of manufacturing, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer can be more competitive, both in its operations and drug pricing, by streamlining its plants and improving their processes, Ricciardi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not disproportionately Wyeth," Ricciardi said, adding that many legacy Pfizer plants and employees are on the target list. Half of the plants slated for ceased operations are legacy Pfizer sites, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest incentives for companies to merge is the ability to cut overlapping operations and employees. Pfizer said it is on track to realize total cost reductions from the deal of $4 billion to $5 billion by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in early 2009, at the time the Wyeth deal was announced, said it expected to cut 15 percent of the combined workforce -- or almost 20,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is counting on the savings to help offset expected plunging sales of its $12 billion-a-year Lipitor cholesterol fighter, which will face generic competition late next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 14 plants slated to cease or cut back operations are among Pfizer's 40 main sites for making prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By June, the company plans to make recommendations for facilities that make animal-health products and later this year will evaluate those that make drugs in emerging markets or nutritional products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not announcing closures, we're announcing exits," Ricciardi said, citing hopes that Pfizer will be able to sell some of the plants to owners that would continue to operate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although affected employees will have as long as five years to look for other jobs, Ricciardi predicted relatively few of the workforce cuts would come from attrition, given the attractiveness and good pay of the positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer plans to discontinue operations over the next 18 months to five years at three sites that make tablets and capsules: Caguas, Puerto Rico; Loughbeg, Ireland and Rouses Point, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another such facility will be phased out at Guayama, Puerto Rico, although it will expand its consumer healthcare operations. The company expects to reduce the size of two others, in Illertissen, Germany and Newbridge, Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two plants that make sterile injectable drugs -- in Dublin, Ireland, and Carolina, Puerto Rico -- are also ending operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Pfizer is making a concerted push into sophisticated biotech drugs -- medicines made in living cells rather than crafted from chemicals -- the company plans to trim operations that make biotech products and vaccines. It aims to exit operations in Shanbally, Ireland and biotech manufacturing at a longtime Wyeth facility in Pearl River, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it plans to reduce operations at U.S. plants in Sanford, North Carolina and Andover, Massachusetts; and at Havant in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer healthcare products will no longer be made at plants in Richmond, Virginia and Pearl River, N.Y., but consumer healthcare research will continue in Richmond, and the Pearl River site will remain a major center for vaccine research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In both Pearl River and Richmond, research and development jobs will be unaffected by the planned manufacturing exits," Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 13 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $15.98, at mid-afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Derek Caney and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Plans to cut up to 780 jobs in Ireland&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer is a major Irish employer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Marie-Louise Gumuchian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DUBLIN, May 18 (Reuters) - Irish recovery hopes were dealt a
blow on Tuesday as drug maker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) announced
hundreds of job cuts, with some politicians calling the move "a
meltdown" in the former 'Celtic Tiger's' multinational sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's biggest drugmaker said it will cut 6,000 jobs,
or 18 percent of its workforce, at 78 manufacturing plants over
the next five years as it pares back operations following last
year's purchase of smaller rival Wyeth. [ID:nN18134231]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Ireland, where it is one of the biggest employers, Pfizer
plans to cut up to 780 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strength of pharmaceutical companies has boosted Irish
exports, raising optimism that Ireland would soon emerge from
one of the deepest and longest recessions in the developed
world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Centre right opposition party Fine Gael said the jobs cuts
were "a meltdown in the multinational sector" in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Irish Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation Batt
O'Keeffe said the job losses were "deeply regrettable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer remains a major multinational employer in Ireland,
with more than 4,200 workers involved in the manufacture of
high-end products for the life science industry worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ireland wooed multinational companies with a low corporate
tax rate but several groups, such as Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries (TEVA.TA), have announced plans to relocate to
cheaper sites. [ID:nL4547021]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Computer manufacturer Dell DELL.O also announced thousands
of redundancies last year, blaming high costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ireland's gross domestic product has fallen nearly 11
percent from a 2007 high, more than double the average euro zone
peak-to-trough decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recent data has reinforced for the view the economy was
stabilising but the recovery remained fragile as a wider euro
zone crisis brewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; April's estimated unemployment rate was 13.4 percent, up
from 13.1 percent in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The American Chamber of Commerce said the Pfizer job cuts
were "deeply regretted" but added Ireland continued "to be a
base of strategic importance to U.S. multinationals."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Technical Computing initiative, announced Monday, will feature investments in parallel computing, technical computing in the cloud, and development of powerful technical computing tools and applications,&#160; company officials stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enablement of computer modeling will be a key element in the initiative, Microsoft officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is to unleash the power of pervasive, accurate, real-time modeling to help people and organizations achieve their objectives and realize their potential. We are bringing together some of the brightest minds in the technical computing community across industry, academia, and science at www.modelingtheworld.com to discuss trends, challenges, and shared opportunities," said Bob Muglia, president of Microsoft's server and tools business, in introducing the initiative in an executive email&#160; posted online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative builds on investments and inroads Microsoft has made in areas such as simplifying parallel programming, said S. Somasegar, senior president of the Microsoft developer division, in a blog posting. &#160;With parallel systems development, a developer must leverage the performance of multicore and many-core hardware systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Also on InfoWorld: Multicore chips mean  new challenges for developers. | Keep up with app dev issues and trends with InfoWorld's Fatal Exception blog. ] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Through the Technical Computing initiative, we will enable scientists, engineers, and analysts to more easily model the world at much greater fidelity," Somasegar said. "The Technical Computing initiative will address a wide range of users.&#160; One of the most critical elements is to help developers create applications that can take advantage of parallelism on their desktop, in a cluster, and in public and private clouds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Parallel programs are extremely difficult to write, test, and troubleshoot," Muglia said. "However, a consistent model for parallel programming can help more developers unlock the tremendous power in today's modern computers and enable a new generation of technical computing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somasegar noted the Visual Studio 2010 IDE already contains technologies for parallel programming, including Parallel Patterns Library, user level tasks, a parallel debugger and profiler, and other tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muglia also stressed goals of cloud and tools development as part of Microsoft's Technical Computing initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft will play a leading role in bringing technical computing power to scientists, engineers, and analysts through the cloud," Muglia said. "Existing high-performance computing users will benefit from the ability to augment their on-premises systems with cloud resources that enable 'just-in-time' processing. This platform will help ensure processing resources are available whenever they are needed -- reliably, consistently, and quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists, meanwhile, are pushing common tools such as spreadsheets to the limit with complex, data-intensive models, Muglia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need easy access to more computing power and simplified tools to increase the speed of their work. We are building a platform to do this. Our development efforts will yield new, easy-to-use tools and applications that automate data acquisition, modeling, simulation, visualization, workflow, and collaboration. This will allow them to spend more time on their work and less time wrestling with complicated technology," Muglia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft anticipates the technical computing community could achieve breakthroughs such as better predictions to help understand global health trends, predictive global climate change models, and more accurate prediction of natural disasters, Muglia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "Microsoft initiative invests in parallel computing," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt; * Ceasing operation at 8 plants; downsizing at 6 plants&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Job cuts in Ireland, Puerto Rico, U.S., Germany, Britain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Cuts to take place over next 18 mos. to 5 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares little changed
 (Adds details on affected plants, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N)
will cut 6,000 jobs, or 18 percent of the workforce, at its 78
manufacturing plants over the next five years as it pares back
operations following last year's purchase of rival Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's biggest drugmaker plans to cease operations at
eight plants in Ireland, Puerto Rico and the United States by
late 2015 and reduce activities at six factories in those
countries, plus Germany and Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer had 40 manufacturing sites before acquiring more
than three dozen Wyeth facilities in the October merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The affected plants make conventional pills, injectable
medicines, biotech drugs and consumer healthcare products.
Pfizer will wind down their operations over the next 18 months
to five years, depending on business considerations such as the
time required to transfer product manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said in November it would close six research
sites and trim jobs in the United States and Britain as part of
its absorption of Wyeth. It then began a six-month study of how
to reconfigure its manufacturing sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have a complex network of manufacturing plants, with
excess capacity that is not good for costs," Nat Ricciardi,
Pfizer's president of manufacturing, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer can be more competitive, both in its operations and
drug pricing, by streamlining its plants and improving their
processes, Ricciardi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's not disproportionately Wyeth," Ricciardi said, adding
that many legacy Pfizer plants and employees are on the target
list. Half of the plants slated for ceased operations are
legacy Pfizer sites, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the biggest incentives for companies to merge is the
ability to cut overlapping operations and employees. Pfizer
said it is on track to realize total cost reductions from the
deal of $4 billion to $5 billion by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer is counting on the savings to help offset expected
plunging sales of its $12 billion-a-year Lipitor cholesterol
fighter, which will face generic competition late next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 14 plants slated to cease or cut back operations are
among Pfizer's 40 main sites for making prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By June, the company plans to make recommendations for
facilities that make animal-health products and later this year
will evaluate those that make drugs in emerging markets or
nutritional products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're not announcing closures, we're announcing exits,"
Ricciardi said, citing hopes that Pfizer will be able to sell
some of the plants to owners that would continue to operate
them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although affected employees will have as long as five years
to look for other jobs, Ricciardi predicted relatively few of
the workforce cuts would come from attrition, given the
attractiveness and good pay of the positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer plans to discontinue operations over the next 18
months to five years at three sites that make tablets and
capsules: Caguas, Puerto Rico; Loughbeg, Ireland and Rouses
Point, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another such facility will be phased out at Guayama, Puerto
Rico, although it will expand its consumer healthcare
operations. The company expects to reduce the size of two
others, in Illertissen, Germany and Newbridge, Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two plants that make sterile injectable drugs -- in Dublin,
Ireland, and Carolina, Puerto Rico -- are also ending
operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Pfizer is making a concerted push into
sophisticated biotech drugs -- medicines made in living cells
rather than crafted from chemicals -- the company plans to trim
operations that make biotech products and vaccines. It aims to
exit operations in Shanbally, Ireland and biotech manufacturing
at a longtime Wyeth facility in Pearl River, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, it plans to reduce operations at U.S. plants in
Sanford, North Carolina and Andover, Massachusetts, and at
Havant in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer healthcare products will no longer be made at
plants in Richmond, Virginia and Pearl River, N.Y., but
consumer healthcare research will continue in Richmond, and the
Pearl River site will remain a major center for vaccine
research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In both Pearl River and Richmond, research and development
jobs will be unaffected by the planned manufacturing exits,"
Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares were up 1 cent at $16.12 in morning trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Many CEOs are doubtful &#160;their enterprises can handle a volatile, increasingly complex business environment, according to an IBM survey being revealed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biennial IBM Global CEO Study was conducted late last year and early this year and featured interviews with 1,541 CEOs, general managers, and senior public sector leaders from 60 countries and 33 industries worldwide. Eight in 10 CEOs, the survey found, expect their environment to grow more complex, while only 49 percent believe their organizations are equipped to deal with it, IBM said. This factor represented the largest leadership challenge identified in eight years of research, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Get expert networking how-to advice from InfoWorld's Networking  Deep Dive PDF special report. |  Keep up on the latest networking  news with our Technology:  Networking newsletter. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Less than half feel prepared for the complexity ahead," said Ragna Bell, a partner in the IBM Strategy amp; Change Consulting group. Successfully navigating an increasingly complex world will require creativity, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the expected impact of technology on organizations has risen from sixth place to second place in the last four studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey also found that in North America, CEOs are more wary of "big government" than elsewhere. This follows on the heels of governments becoming major stakeholders in private enterprises after the recent financial crisis. Some 87 percent of CEOs surveyed in North America anticipate greater government intervention and regulation in the next five years, thus compounding a sense of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North American executives demonstrated "a very strong sense that increased government is impacting their environment," &#160;Bell said. But the executives were not queried about whether they thought more government was good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did not ask them for value judgments," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complexity of an interconnected world is exacerbated by different factors, IBM said. Seventy percent of CEOs in the study said they have to double revenue from new sources in the next five years, while 65 percent foresee a shift of economic power to rapidly developing markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other findings:&lt;/p&gt;

Top-performing organizations are 54 percent more likely than others to make quick decisions and predict outcomes
Ninety-five percent of top-performing organizations cited getting closer to customers as their most important strategic initiative for the next five years, using Web, interactive, and social media channels to rethink engagements with customers and citizens
Having proven more resilient than developed nations during the economic downtown, CEOs in China are less concerned about volatility than CEOs in other regions&lt;p&gt;Executives were not asked about technological preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "IBM survey: CEOs say they can't handle growing complexity," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive Network Connectivity Portfolio Provides IBM Customers
Best-in-Class Networking Bandwidth, Application Performance and Response Time
SUNNYVALE, Calif. &amp; YOKNEAM, Israel--(Business Wire)--
Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ:MLNX) (TASE:MLNX), a leading supplier of
high-performance, end-to-end connectivity solutions for data center servers and
storage systems, today announced that its ConnectX-2 InfiniBand and Ethernet
adapters, as well as its IS5000 line of 36, 216, and 648-port fixed and modular
40Gb/s InfiniBand switches, are now available through IBM`s iDataPlex and
Intelligent Cluster product lines. Mellanox`s adapters and switch systems offer
IBM customers I/O infrastructure performance and scalability for data centers,
Cloud, Web 2.0 and high-performance computing (HPC) environments. 

"IBM is delivering solutions that maximize application performance but also meet
the requirements for infrastructure economics and green initiatives," said
Roland Hagan, VP System X Servers at IBM. "Mellanox adapters and switches
complement our Intelligent Cluster and iDataPlex products, giving IBM customers
both performance and efficiency benefits that are critical ingredients for
increased flexibility and higher return on their compute investment." 

ConnectX-2 adapters support an extensive array of networking, clustering,
storage, and management protocols. ConnectX-2 InfiniBand adapters are also
designed to provide hardware processing of application communications frequently
used by scientific simulation for data broadcast, global synchronization and
data collection, and new features, such as GPU-Direct, improve application
performance on GPU-based clusters by reducing the dependency on the CPU for data
movement. 

ConnectX-2 EN 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapter cards are VMware vSphere 4 certified,
enabling broad interoperability with other operating systems and the ecosystem
of OEM supplied servers, switches, gateways and storage systems. In addition,
ConnectX-2 EN with RDMA over Ethernet (RoE) delivers up to 1/10th the latency,
saves power consumption and delivers improved economics compared to other
standards-based 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapter solutions in the market today.
According to recent benchmark test results, IBM WebSphere MQ Low Latency
Messaging (LLM) software running over Mellanox 10GigE low-latency Ethernet
technology achieved an average latency of four microseconds at 50 thousand
messages per second, and six microseconds at one million messages per second -
the lowest latency achieved by any messaging delivery product over Ethernet. 

Mellanox`s IS5000 line of InfiniBand switches provides the highest-performing
fabric solutions. HPC and enterprise data center IT managers using the IS5000
will achieve a greater return on their compute and infrastructure investments
through higher CPU productivity due to higher network throughput and
availability. The switches were built using Mellanox`s 4th generation
InfiniScale IV InfiniBand switch device, and provide up to 40Gb/s fully
bidirectional bandwidth per port with industry-leading 100ns port-to-port
latency. Networks built with the IS5000 can carry converged traffic with the
combination of assured bandwidth and granular quality of service. 

"Delivering scalable performance to today`s extensive multi-core systems
requires a comprehensive interconnect solution that ensures optimal performance
and reliability," said John Monson, vice president of marketing at Mellanox
Technologies. "Using Mellanox`s industry leading ConnectX-2 Ethernet and
InfiniBand adapters and IS5000 family of switches, IBM can deliver
industry-leading performance for both Ethernet and InfiniBand applications with
greater efficiency and reduced complexity." 

Availability

Available today, Mellanox`s line of 40Gb/s InfiniBand adapter cards, switches,
and 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapter cards can be purchased from the IBM website at

&lt;p&gt;New solution empowers business development professionals to manage their
opportunities, appointments, emails and contacts within Microsoft Outlook and
automatically update Deltek Vision to ensure one system of record for sales and
marketing activities
NATIONAL HARBOR, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Deltek, Inc. (Nasdaq:PROJ), the leading provider of enterprise applications
software and solutions for project-focused businesses, today announced Deltek
Vision Connect for Microsoft Outlook. The new solution, shown exclusively at
Deltek`s Insight 2010 user conference, will integrate Deltek Vision with
Microsoft Outlook, enabling business development professionals, marketing
professionals, and executives to perform key Vision CRM tasks directly in
Outlook. The new solution then automatically synchronizes the work done in
Outlook with Deltek Vision, ensuring all sales and marketing activities are
recorded in one CRM system of record. 

In many organizations, business development professionals use two systems to
manage marketing and sales activities with prospects and customers - Microsoft
Outlook and their internal customer relationship management (CRM) system.
Juggling two systems can lead to data inaccuracies and inefficient work
processes. With Vision Connect for Microsoft Outlook, business development
professionals will be able to manage their business appointments, emails and
contacts, as well as manage clients, activities and opportunities - all from
Microsoft Outlook. By enabling personnel to manage the Deltek Vision records
directly in Outlook, user adoption of Deltek Vision CRM can expand significantly
within organizations that use both solutions. 

Vision Connect for Microsoft Outlook, leveraging technology from InvisibleCRM,
offers numerous innovative capabilities that will streamline important business
development processes, including:

* Client, Vendor and Opportunity Management: Vision Connect makes it easy to
enter and update client, vendor and opportunity records within intuitive Outlook
forms. Users can seamlessly identify and select the most important records they
need to manage to drive their business development activities forward. 
* Contact Management: With Vision Connect, it is simple to maintain Vision
contact information within the native Outlook contact form. There is no need for
multiple contacts folders - the solution manages personal and business contacts
that are shared and stored in Deltek Vision all in one place. 
* Email Management: Vision Connect offers a seamless way to create and send
emails in Microsoft Outlook that are captured within Deltek Vision. In addition,
the solution creates permanent activity records and links email attachments to
appropriate records within Deltek Vision to maintain one repository of all
business development activities.

Vision Connect also offers bi-directional synchronization that ensures
information between Vision and Microsoft Outlook stays consistent and
up-to-date. While offline, Vision Connect users can perform all the necessary
work they need to do with Vision data in Outlook, and Vision Connect for
Microsoft Outlook then synchronizes this data to Deltek Vision as soon as they
re-connect. These important synchronization capabilities empower professionals
to do work from any place at any time - greatly increasing productivity. 

"To win business in these dynamic times, leading professional services firms are
embracing technology to streamline and improve their sales and marketing
processes," said Ted Kempf, Vice President of Product Marketing for Deltek
Vision. "With Vision Connect for Microsoft Outlook, we are providing an
innovative solution that increases the efficiency and effectiveness of business
development processes and helps increase user adoption of critical CRM systems."


Vision Connect for Microsoft Outlook is scheduled to be released in June 2010.

&lt;p&gt;  SANTA CRUZ, CA, May 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Plantronics, Inc. (NYSE: PLT) today announced new audio functions and
tools for the current IBM Lotus(R) Sametime(R) and Sametime Unified

software that delivers intelligent call control between Plantronics' full
Unified Communications product portfolio and IBM Sametime, provides users

    Epilio uses IBM Lotus Sametime to increase the effectiveness of its

and video calls, as well as join a web conference, on the go -- letting
them work the way they want. The new plug-in provides integrated audio

control so users can gain hands-free mobility and easily control calls
directly from the audio device. The functionality extends to Plantronics'
wireless products, including the Voyager(R) PRO UC and the Savi(R) Office
system, to enable users to switch conversations between multiple devices,

&lt;p&gt;Caspio Provides Easy Cloud Solution for Access Developers to Bring Databases
Online; New Migration Kit Helps Cut Development Time by 90%
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Caspio, Inc. (www.caspio.com), the leading online database platform for creating
web applications without programming, today announced the launch of its Access
Migration Kit, which will provide a complete package of streamlined tools and
services for developers to easily bring their Microsoft Access databases online.


With last week`s launch of Microsoft Office 2010, there is a lot of talk
surrounding the new Office Web Apps, which allows users to stay connected to
their Office applications on-the-go. However, Office 2010 does not provide the
ability to easily create web-based apps using Microsoft Access because it
requires a multi-step integration with a SharePoint server. 

"Microsoft Office 2010 is an exciting release; however Access developers are
still challenged to find a viable solution for web-centric data management,"
said Caspio founder and CEO, Frank Zamani. "Caspio`s cloud platform provides
what`s missing in Microsoft Access, allowing for easy online databases and web
app creation." 

Fast and Seamless Online Database Migration

Caspio is designed to be completely intuitive for Access users, with built-in
step-by-step wizards that eliminate the complexities of creating database-bound
web forms, reports and apps, and guide the user through the app creation process
from start to finish. The hosted service enables easy migration with the
following:

* Built-in import and export functions that can read and write Microsoft Access
MDB format files. 
* The ability to publish imported data to any website, SharePoint and content
management systems (CMS), hosted anywhere through reports or interactive
searchable apps. 
* Point-and-click tools that allow for the application interface design to be
completed without programming. 
* A SOAP-compatible API that allows developers to extend the capabilities of
their online apps with any programming or scripting language, including ASP,
ASP.Net, and VB.Net. 
* A highly-scalable online platform that supports up to two million records in
each table and serves thousands of users simultaneously. 
* Enterprise-class security and reliability standards including SSL, SAS 70, PCI
compliance, Section 508 accessibility, and TRUSTe certification. 
* Cost-effective service pricing that includes unlimited app users with all
packages.

Caspio Plug-in for Microsoft Office

Additionally, Caspio offers a plug-in for Microsoft Access and Excel whereby
customers can synchronize an offline copy of their data with their online
database. The plug-in automatically downloads users` Caspio-hosted data to their
local desktop and keeps it refreshed, allowing them to use the Microsoft Office
productivity suite to run local analysis on the data, mail merge or integrate
with other applications. 

Complimentary Migration Kit for Access Developers

To encourage Access developers to try Caspio for seamless online database
migration, Caspio is offering an Access Migration Kit that includes a free trial
of Caspio Bridge, unlimited data import, video tutorials, a whitepaper on Access
migration, an upcoming instructional webinar, and a consultation with a database
migration expert.

&lt;p&gt;Highly Anticipated `Ground Breaking` Game from Black Rock Studio

Set within the World of a Fictional Reality TV Show

Features Tracks Rigged to Explode, Making Every Lap Different
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
One of the most anticipated video games of 2010 is now available with
Split/Second arriving at retail outlets throughout North America today.
Published by Disney Interactive Studios and developed by Black Rock Studio, the
dynamic game is releasing on the Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system
from Microsoft, PlayStation3 computer entertainment system, Windows PC and
iPhone/iPod Touch. 

Winner of the prestigious Game Critics Awards: Best of E3 2009, Best Racing Game
award from the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2009, Split/Second is one of
the most anticipated video games of 2010 with a highly successful demo on Xbox
LIVE online entertainment network (rated 4.5 stars out of 5 by users) and
PlayStationNetwork. 

In Split/Second, players don`t just race to the finish line to beat their
opponents, they build up their power meter through deft driving and trigger
"power plays," explosive moments that take out opponents or alter the track. The
game takes place within a hyper-competitive reality television show with
city-sized sets rigged for destruction. Each track has numerous power plays that
can be strategically triggered by skilled drivers. Competitors in Split/Second
don`t just collide with other vehicles to knock them from the track -- they can
trigger blockbuster action film-like explosive events that drastically alter the
dynamics of the race. Players must use strategy and pinpoint timing to derail
opponents, tactically alter the track or create entirely new routes. 

"With massive environments that players can dynamically change to take out
opponents and alter the track, Split/Second redefines the action racing genre
and provides a whole new level of fun for all video game fans," said Craig
Relyea, senior vice president, global marketing, Disney Interactive Studios.
"Black Rock Studio is among the world`s best game development studios and
Split/Second is an incredible entry in their impressive portfolio." 

As many as eight players can compete online in Split/Second through Xbox LIVE,
PlayStation Network and online on Windows PC. Also, two players can race against
each other on the same system in the same room through split-screen features. 

Black Rock Studio pioneered the innovative heads up display (HUD) affixed to the
back of the player`s vehicle. The Split/Second HUD showcases the player`s
relevant information (place, lap number, etc.) on the back bumper of the car,
the area of the screen where players primarily focus during racing games. 

"When we were early in development on the concept, we expected racing fans
throughout the world to be passionate about Split/Second but the feedback since
we announced the game has far exceeded our expectations," said Nick Baynes, game
director, Black Rock Studio. "We wanted to create something really fun that had
never been done before in the racing genre and Split/Second accomplishes that." 

Black Rock Studio has an impressive heritage in the racing video game genre. The
studio became the first developer to win consecutive Game Critics Awards: Best
of E3 in the racing category with two different franchises after having won with

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is set to begin rolling out the latest enhancements to its Hotmail Web mail service, with an aim to reduce clutter and make it easier to send photos and handle Office documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is taking a clear shot at Google's success with its online Docs service by making a Web-based version of Office available from within Hotmail's Web interface that allows use of widely used document formats such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest version of Hotmail will let users open and modify those document types within the browser with no additional software to download, said Dharmesh Mehta, director of product management for the company's Windows Live business. For richer document graphics, users will need to install a plugin for Silverlight, Microsoft's multimedia application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has done a good job of integrating Gmail and Docs, but the service lacks the capability to faithfully convert Office documents, Mehta said. Google hasn't fully implemented the specifications Microsoft has published for its Office suite, he said. That's a problem, Mehta contends, since the vast majority of documents that are exchanged via e-mail are Microsoft formatted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotmail users will be able to store documents using Microsoft's SkyDrive online storage and set permissions that allow for collaboration on the same document, Mehta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's essential for Microsoft to rework its profitable Office franchise into a mix of free offerings, such as the latest integration with Hotmail, along with the more advanced versions of Office it sells, said Clive Longbottom, service director and business process analyst with Quocirca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers are less likely these days to purchase Office, as the free Works package ships on most PCs, and companies can allow their employees to use a copy of Office at home. But securing the consumer market is essential to keeping control over the office productivity software market, Longbottom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have to be worried about what happens in the consumer space," Longbottom said. "If consumers really do take to Google Docs, it is a real big issue for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also leveraging SkyDrive to make it easier to share photos. Users frequently encounter problems with attachment limits either on the sending or receiving side, Mehta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is skirting around that problem by automatically creating a SkyDrive folder with photos as someone sends an e-mail with photo attachments. Rather than attaching multimegabyte photos with the message, Hotmail will instead send a thumbnail of the photos while the full-size photos are sent to SkyDrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can then opt to see the photo within a new photo viewer built inside Hotmail or download a zip file with all of the photos. If a Hotmail user receives a group of photos in an e-mail, Hotmail will display thumbnails and then allow a larger view of the photo with the built-in viewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mehta said Microsoft has also made changes to make it easier for people to see what's behind a link send in an e-mail, a feature called "Hotmail active views." For example, if someone sends a Flickr or a YouTube link, a Hotmail user will be able to see that content from within Hotmail rather than opening a new browser tab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has a similar feature within Gmail for its own services. On the technical side, it's not necessarily easy, as the link needs to be delivered in a format that's recognized by the Web mail service in order to work properly. Microsoft's long-term goal is to establish an industry standard for how those links can be formatted, Mehta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Hotmail feature will allow users to automatically see the tracking information for a package if there is a tracking number in an e-mail, Mehta said. That prevents a user from needing to copy the tracking number, open another tab for FedEx, for example, and then querying their item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other free Web mail providers will likely build similar features in their offerings, but Microsoft has "put a bit of thought into it. It's not going to be massive game changer, but what they've done is interesting and useful," Longbottom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also introducing a raft of features to make e-mail tidier, such as optional conversation threading, filters to direct messages from certain senders into a particular folder and highlighting messages users likely don't want to miss, such as those from social networking services or frequent contacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the security side, Microsoft is implementing DKIM, or DomainKeys Identified Mail, a system for linking an e-mail with cryptographic authentication, which is designed to make it easier to filter out spam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another effort to shore up security, Microsoft will also introduce one-time passcodes for Hotmail sent by SMS to a person's mobile phone. The one-time passcode would be used instead of the person's normal password at, for example, a public computer that might be infected with malware. Due to arrangements Microsoft has made with operators around the world, users will not be charged for the SMS, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later this year, Microsoft plans on introducing SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption for Hotmail, although the company has not decided whether it will be optional or not, Mehta said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hammer, Europe`s Leading Storage Distributor; and Inovativ, the First Microsoft
Gold Partner with Three System Center MVPs in the Netherlands to Sell EVault for
DPM
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
i365, Inc., A Seagate Company (NASDAQ:STX), today announced the company is
seeing strong interest and momentum in Europe for its recently announced EVault
for Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager, (EVault for DPM). EVault
for DPM is a collaboration with Microsoft that has resulted in the first and
only heterogeneous disk-based data protection solution that allows IT managers
to extend Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager 2010 across
non-Microsoft platforms and into the Cloud, using i365`s EVault data protection
software and Cloud-Connected storage solutions infrastructure. Hammer and
Inovativ are early members of the EVault for DPM reseller program and are now
taking orders for the solution. 

In mixed IT environments with Microsoft operating systems and applications as
well as data on other platforms or applications such as VMware, Oracle, Unix,
Linux and IBM i, customers have been struggling to find the best way to backup
and protect all of their company-critical data with a single solution. Until
now, no single data protection product offered DPM, with its protection for
Microsoft servers, applications and desktops, combined with heterogeneous
support for non-Microsoft platforms and the option to protect data in the Cloud.
EVault for DPM is the only product that can meet all of these needs. 

Paul Hickingbotham, solutions manager at storage distributor Hammer, said, "i365
and its integration with Microsoft's System Center DPM 2010 offers end users the
ability to implement a comprehensive and rounded DR strategy into a multi OS
environment, where they have previously been constrained by DPM's OS
restrictions. We are excited by the opportunity of selling this solution through
our Reseller and SI channels." 

EVault for DPM is an all-in-one backup and recovery appliance that combines
DPM`s unified data protection for Microsoft Windows servers and applications
with the robust protection of EVault Software for non-Microsoft platforms and
cloud connectivity. With EVault for DPM, customers can send both their DPM and
EVault-protected backup data to the i365 Cloud and get offsite disaster recovery
protection quickly and economically. The optional Cloud-Connected storage
service, scheduled to be available later this year, includes efficient and
secure replication of the backup data over the Internet, and maintains backup
copies of data in the i365 Cloud. The i365 Cloud is supported by ISO and/or
SAS70 Type II-certified data centers in EMEA, staffed by a team of experts and
employing state-of-the-art encryption protocols, storage technologies, and
redundancy practices to ensure ironclad protection of data. 

"We are impressed by the enhancements Microsoft has made to DPM 2010, including
single-item recovery within Hyper-V guests, end-user restore capabilities for
SQL databases, added client protection, and cloud capabilities," said Alex
Smits, consultant at Inovativ, a Microsoft Certified Gold Partner based in the
Netherlands. The company has eight Microsoft System Center consultants on staff,
three of who are certified System Center Microsoft Valued Professionals (MVPs).
"DPM offers a lot of value, but many of our customers also have a strong
interest in protecting their non-Windows workloads, especially Oracle. With its
support for Oracle and non-Windows operating systems, including Linux, VMware,
and UNIX, EVault for DPM is very compelling. We look forward to being part of
this venture." 

Customers have several configurations to choose from - each with all the
hardware, software, storage and support they need. The hardware will be powered
by Delltechnology and will ship factory-installed with both DPM 2010 and EVault
Software with a common user interface to help customers monitor their entire
heterogeneous environment and initiate complex tasks with ease. It also includes
helpful wizards that will guide customers through the setup process. 

"We are proud to have such strong European partners to help us deliver EVault
for DPM," said Keith Gnagey, managing director, i365 Europe. "EVault technology
is making Cloud-based data protection an important part of disaster recovery
initiatives for more customers every day, proving the efficiency, security, and
flexibility of these services. Our European customers can expect to see more
innovative Cloud-Connected offerings from i365 as we focus on meeting the
challenge of maintaining business continuity in cross-platform, multi-site
environments." 

Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager is a member of the Microsoft
System Center suite of management products, designed to help IT Professionals
manage their Windows environment. DPM 2010 delivers unified data protection for
Windows servers and clients as a best-of-breed backup and recovery solution from
Microsoft, for Windows environments. DPM 2010 provides the best protection and
most supportable restore scenarios for Windows environments to disk, tape and
cloud -- in a scalable, reliable, manageable and cost-effective way.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will beef up security in the revamped Windows Live Hotmail, including tying a user's account to a specific PC, a company executive said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Hotmail users whose accounts have been recently hacked say Microsoft's security improvements can't come too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated Hotmail is slated to start rolling out June 15, and should reach all users within six weeks, said Walter Harp, Hotmail's director of product management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is adding what Harp dubbed "proofs" to Hotmail to secure accounts against hijacking, or let users more easily recover control if their account has been snatched by criminals. Among those proofs will be one that links a specific computer to a user's account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You'll be able to set your computer as a proof," said Harp, referring to the link between a PC and an account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Web services, including Facebook and Google 's Gmail, already offer similar ties to stymie account hijacking. Facebook, for example, recently added a setting that lets users approve the devices they use to log in; if an account is accessed from an unapproved device, the user is notified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google tracks log-ins and warns Gmail users of suspicious patterns, such as an attempt to log-in from a foreign country, or multiple failed log-in attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think we've done it a little better than Gmail," argued Harp. "My mom's not going to get it if Gmail told her she had tried to log in from a different IP address."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the PC-to-account link won't be offered as one of Hotmail's new identity proofs until later this year -- likely this fall, said Harp, when Microsoft again updates the service -- others will debut at the launch next month of what Microsoft has codenamed "Wave 4" of its Web e-mail service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your mobile phone will be an additional proof," said Harp, explaining that if a user loses control of his or her account -- and thus has no way to reset the password to regain access -- Hotmail will notify the user by phone, then send a new password to that phone. "We'll do that if either a human or malware gets into your account," Harp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phones play another role in Hotmail's enhanced security: Users can request that Microsoft send a one-time password to their phones via SMS. Harp envisioned this being used by people logging in at public places, such as Internet cafes, libraries or unprotected Wi-Fi hotspots. The feature came out of conversations with focus groups in less-developed countries, where more people connect to the Internet at cafes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The general idea is that you'd use this to be particularly cautious at a public computer, which for all you know may be infected with keylogging malware," said Harp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotmail will also include a new feature tagged "Trusted Sender," which visually identifies legitimate mail from about 100 senders, mostly financial institutions like banks, that are commonly spoofed by identity thieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked to compare the new Hotmail security features with rivals such as Gmail and Yahoo Mail, Harp declined to go toe-to-toe with the competition. "The race isn't so much with the other [Web e-mail] services, but with the miscreants," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Rosoff, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft, disputed Harp's claim that rivals weren't at the root of Hotmail's changes. "Without the competition from Google['s Gmail], Microsoft would have much less incentive to improve Hotmail," said Rosoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Harp did tout the fact that Hotmail has all of Microsoft behind it, including the company's security team. "We bring all of Microsoft's know-how, not just the Hotmail's team, to the table," said Harp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, Microsoft will offer the Internet Explorer 8 (IE) "SmartScreen Filter" technology on its Windows Live properties. SmartScreen Filter is a combination anti-phishing and malware blocking tool in IE8 that warns users when they try to reach a potentially-dangerous URL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotmail users running rival browsers, including Google's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox, Apple's Safari and Opera Software's Opera, will receive that same protection later this year in a follow-on update to the June launch of Wave 4, said Harp. Other parts of Windows Live, including Messenger, Microsoft's instant messaging client, will have it immediately next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some users wished Microsoft had stepped up its Hotmail security efforts earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft today denied that there has been a recent uptick of Hotmail account hijackings, numerous users of the service have claimed that their inboxes have been hacked, and that their contacts have been purged .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several users who used Twitter today to report that their Hotmail accounts had been hacked also wanted better security now .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Microsoft] to give Hotmail a make-over [is] too little too late if the number of times my account has been hacked is an indicator," tweeted James Milligan today, referring to a Wednesday story on The Daily Telegraph 's Web site about Hotmail improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hotmail adding a bunch of new features ... how about focusing on security from hackers? And more help for hacked accts?" tweeted Bill Robb Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert McMillan of the IDG News Service contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, May 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SDForum, Silicon Valley's leading source of information and education in
the technology community, today announced it will host its first ever
symposium on healthcare information technology in partnership with IBM.
The event is being hosted by Pillsbury Winthrop on Tuesday June 8th, 2010
at 8:00 a.m. PT in Palo Alto, CA. Experts, investors and executives
including Lonne Jaffe of IBM, Brian Ascher of Venrock and Adam Bosworth
of KEAS will share their perspectives on where the opportunities for
innovation lie, and what hurdles remain.

    While information technology is critical to the success of efficient and
economic delivery of healthcare, the industry is lagging behind. Access
to vital information is essential and healthcare providers must now
conform to the requirements of HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act). 

    In Silicon Valley, a globally recognized heartland of innovation in
technology, what's happening to respond to this need and what are the
challenges involved in getting up to speed? Who are the stars and what's
next in healthcare information technology? 

    "The increased use of healthcare information technology can enable
clinicians to make more evidence-based treatment decisions, decisions
that are based on a comprehensive view of a patient's medical history and
the latest analytics comparing the effectiveness of all available
treatment options," said Lonne Jaffe, Director Public Sector Solutions,
IBM. "By enabling physicians, hospitals, labs, pharmacies, payers, and
patients to collaborate more effectively, healthcare information
technology can also dramatically lower the costs of delivering care,
helping to make the economics of the healthcare industry more
sustainable."

    "We have watched the political debates on providing healthcare to the
American population and this is the proverbial tip of the iceberg as the
underlying technology infrastructure also needs a radical overhaul," said
Susan Lucas-Conwell, CEO of SDForum. "The total market and growth
opportunity makes this an attractive space for entrepreneurs and
investors."

    Attendees will have the opportunity to share insights and network with
business executives, startups and investors in the healthcare information
technology market at this morning symposium.

restrict debit card fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saunders traveled to Washington "to highlight the negative
consequences that would result from Senator Durbin's
anti-consumer amendment," Visa Spokesman Will Valentine said in
an email on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Senate approved an amendment to the financial
regulation bill on Thursday that would limit so-called
interchange fees. The fees are a major source of revenue for
banks and, indirectly, for payments networks Visa and
MasterCard Inc (MA.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa shares have fallen about 15 percent since Thursday,
although they closed up 4.1 percent on Wednesday at $72.97.

Expect A Euro Bounce And Bank It

Have you tried to find someone bullish on the Euro CurrencyShares Euro Trust
(NYSE FXE)? I have had no success in finding anyone out there that is bullish.
What does that mean? It means I am moving to the bullish side on the Euro and
slightly bearish on dollar. 

Why would I do this? The short Euro trade has been done to death in the short
term. Over the weekend, every financial media outlet was talking about the Euro
crashing, coming to par with the Dollar. Every analyst was saying the same thing
as well. The trade is far too crowded to the short side on the Euro and in my
opinion, expect a sharp bounce later this week. It may not be a long bounce, but
it will be steep. 

Stocks and ETF's to play if this happens are all in the commodity arena. Look at
an ETF like United States Oil Fund LP (NYSE USO) or stocks like Southern Copper
Corporation (NYSE: SCCO), AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE AKS) or Chevron
Corporation (NYSE CVX). These will most likely have a sharp snap back rally on
any weakness in the Dollar which would come from strength in the Euro.

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Hewlett-Packard Beats, Gains After Hours

Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) did what it was supposed to do in its fiscal
second-quarter report. The market wanted further evidence that the recovery for
computer technology was not a fluke, but instead an indication of an improving
environment. We`ll have to wait to be certain, but HPQ probably accomplished
that, as did Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO), Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) and Microsoft (Nasdaq:
MSFT) before it. 

The company earned $1.09 per share in the quarter, compared to 86 cents a year
earlier. The result was 4 cents better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate; a 3.8%
surprise that was on-par with the fiscal first quarter. The result continues the
company`s exceptional record of outperforming expectations. 

Net revenue increased by 13% to $30.8 billion, as revenue in the Americas gained
11%, revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa also increased 11%, and
revenue in Asia Pacific advanced 19%. 

Revenue from outside the U.S. accounted for 66% of total revenue. 

Hewlett-Packard now expects non-GAAP earnings per share between $4.45 and $4.50,
compared to its previous outlook of $4.37 to $4.44. The Zacks Consensus Estimate
is currently at $4.45 for the fiscal year ending October 2010 and $4.90 for the
fiscal year ending October 2011. 

Earnings Scorecard: Eli Lilly

There is a significant negative bias in earnings estimate revisions for Eli
Lilly (NYSE: LLY). While all 19 analysts covering the stock have reduced their
earnings estimates for fiscal 2010, 16 of the 17 analysts covering the stock
have reduced their estimates for fiscal 2011. 

Estimates are down for the June and Sept quarters of 2010 as well. While 12 of
the 16 analysts have reduced their estimates for the June quarter over the last
30 days, only one has moved in the opposite direction. Meanwhile, 14 of the 16
analysts covering the stock have reduced their estimates for the Sept quarter
with no upward revisions over the past 30 days. 

About eight products, representing 74% of 2009 total revenues, are expected to
lose exclusivity over the next few years. While strong sales from key products
such as Cymbalta, Cialis and Alimta will be the fundamental strength to revenue
growth in 2010, longer-term growth prospects remain under question especially
once Zyprexa loses exclusivity in the US in 2011. Concerns remain that Lilly`s
pipeline may not be sufficient to offset the impact of key patent expirations.

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apotex Inc said on Wednesday it would immediately launch in Canada a copycat form of Pfizer Inc's blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol fighter, and Pfizer vowed to fight back with its own Lipitor generic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apotex said it is rolling out shipments after its product was approved earlier on Wednesday by Health Canada. Helped by a lower price, it aims to wrest away business from Lipitor, which had Canadian sales last year of more than $1.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privately held Apotex, which is based in Toronto, said it was able to overcome the various patents on Lipitor by creating its own crystal form of the treatment, to be marketed immediately under the name of Apo-Atorvastatin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which has a unit that makes generic medicines, said it aims to challenge the Apotex contender with its own discounted product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll be offering alternative versions of atorvastatin," Pfizer spokeswoman Sally Beatty said, referring to the active ingredient and generic name of Lipitor. She declined to say when Pfizer's own generic would be introduced, or how competitive its cost would be to the Apotex copycat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipitor is the world's biggest-selling drug, with global annual sales of more than $12 billion. The Canadian generic sets the stage for far more punishing competition in the United States by November 2011, when Lipitor's U.S. marketing exclusivity lapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apotex said its generic is a "bioequivalent" form of Lipitor -- meaning it works in the body the same way as Lipitor -- that is "absolutely" substitutable for the branded product. But Pfizer said the generic cannot be considered an identical "interchangeable" product until drug formularies maintained by Canadian provinces declare it so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If deemed interchangeable, pharmacists would be free to automatically substitute the Apotex product for Lipitor, speeding Lipitor's erosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As expected, we lost Pfizer exclusivity of Lipitor in Canada," Beatty said, noting that Pfizer's 2010 earnings forecast assumed generic competition this year in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said Lipitor's market exclusivity in Canada officially lapses on July 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Beatty noted that Apotex and Pfizer reached an agreement two years ago, after an earlier patent battle. The agreement, whose terms have not been made public, paved the way for the cheaper Apotex product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of the new generic in Canada comes at a time when government officials are looking for ways to cut mounting healthcare costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the government of Ontario, Canada's most populated province, announced a comprehensive plan aimed at cutting generic drug prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The province's plan aims to reduce its annual tab of more than $750 million for drugs covered under its benefit program. It would also reduce prices consumers pay for generics, and lower revenues for drugstores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it has since delayed its mid-May implementation of the plan following a backlash from the public and the big drugstore chains like Shoppers Drug Mart Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 2 cents to $15.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=$1.05 Canadian)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Scott Anderson, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been on the wrong side of a couple patent issues recently--the case with i4i over XML in Microsoft Word, and its recent settlement with VirnetX over VPN networking technology patents--but Microsoft does have an exhaustive portfolio of intellectual property and its not afraid to use it. Microsoft has filed a lawsuit against Salesforce.com alleging infringement of patents related to software efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the lawsuit is a battle for the customer relationship management--or CRM--market. CRM tools are a huge business software market, and Salesforce.com is a leader--raking in $1.3 billion in sales last year. However, Microsoft has its own CRM software and it would like to knock Salesforce.com down a notch and capture a bigger piece of that lucrative pie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, claims that Salesforce.com's CRM software violates nine different Microsoft patents and seeks an injunction as well as significant monetary compensation. An injunction would force Salesforce.com to cease using any technologies judged in violation of Microsoft's patents, perhaps denting the capabilities of Salesforce.com's CRM product and boosting the value of Microsoft's competing Dynamics CRM software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horacio Gutierrez, corporate vice president and deputy general counsel of Intellectual Property and Licensing for Microsoft said in a statement "Microsoft has been a leader and innovator in the software industry for decades and continues to invest billions of dollars each year in bringing great software products and services to market. We have a responsibility to our customers, partners, and shareholders to safeguard that investment, and therefore cannot stand idly by when others infringe our IP rights."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also recently alleged that the Linux-based Google Android mobile operating system infringes on Microsoft intellectual property, but it entered into an amicable licensing agreement with HTC and is ostensibly in talks with other Android smartphone manufacturers. The fact that Microsoft is seeking an injunction in this case demonstrates that Microsoft sees Salesforce.com as a direct competitor and a threat to the success of Dynamics CRM software, and that it would rather hinder the capabilities of Salesforce.com than profit by its success through a licensing agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had Salesforce.com been more amenable, though, perhaps it wouldn't have come to this. According to the annual SEC regulatory filing of Salesforce.com, it acknowledged that a large tech company had contacted it regarding patent infringement allegations, but that an examination of the merits of the claims was still ongoing. If Salesforce.com would have agreed on the merits of the patent claims and entered into negotiations with Microsoft, its possible Microsoft's intellectual property could have been licensed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses that rely on Salesforce.com don't need to panic. Should Salesforce.com ultimately lose this battle, it will most likely result in minor modifications to the functionality of the software related to the Microsoft patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Microsoft's perspective, if it is successful in both stripping functionality from Salesforce.com's competing CRM software with an injunction, and simultaneously hitting it in the wallet with substantial penalties and damages, it provides a win-win that can give Microsoft's Dynamics CRM a strategic window of opportunity to seize some market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can follow Tony on his Facebook page , or contact him by email at tony_bradley@pcworld.com .

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - Google has overtaken Microsoft in the battle over the software that runs mobile phones and is challenging Apple for share of the fast growing smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google's Android was the fourth most popular operating system on smartphones sold in the first quarter, research firm Gartner said on Wednesday, putting the company in a good position as handsets look set to surpass computers for browsing the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android, which was in 10 percent of smartphones sold in the quarter, still lags Nokia's Symbian, Blackberry-maker Research in Motion and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gartner said Android phones were already outselling the iPhone in North America, less than two years after the Internet search giant entered the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Android will sail smoothly.

&lt;p&gt; * Gartner, VCs see Android gaining on iPhone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft to face uphill battle
  (Recasts lead, adds comments, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tarmo Virki, European technology correspondent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PARIS, May 19 (Reuters) - Google (GOOG.O) has overtaken
Microsoft (MSFT.O) in the battle over the software that runs
mobile phones and is challenging Apple for share of the fast
growing smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google's Android was the fourth most popular operating
system on smartphones sold in the first quarter, research firm
Gartner said on Wednesday, putting the company in a good

Research in Motion RIMM.ORIM.TO and Apple (AAPL.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gartner said Android phones were already outselling the

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DEVELOPER BOOM FOR ANDROID&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More and more start-ups are developing applications for
Android, boosting interest among consumers and posing increasing
risk to Apple, venture capitalists told the Reuters Summit in
San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Apple's app store offers more than 200,000 games,
tools and other software to jazz up the iPhone, against just
38,000 for Android, the openness of Google's mobile operating
system is helping it gain popularity with developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am quite impressed by the traction the Android ecosystem
is getting," said Redpoint Ventures' partner Chris Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I want to say that on the current trajectory, they
(Android) will pass the iPhone platform, or at least reach
parity by the end of this year or middle of next year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; App developers usually choose a limited number of mobile
platforms to write software for as every additional platform 
sharply raises their costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CROWDED MARKETPLACE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nine major operating systems have either launched or are in
development. Some players in the industry expect to see further
consolidation, while others say fragmentation is set to
continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Markets will continue to remain fragmented and competition
will only get tougher as players will push hard to develop new
systems or upgrade existing ones to offer customised products
for mobile carriers," Lee Ho-soo, head of Samsung's bada
smartphone operating system, told the summit in South Korea.
[ID:nTOE64I064]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Gillis, chief of mobile operating system LiMo, told
the summit in Paris he expected to see more consolidation
following Nokia's and Intel's (INTC.O) merger of their
Linux-based operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think that the eventual number of industry device
operating systems will be no more than five, probably four,"
Gillis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICROSOFT CHALLENGED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which has been making mobile software for around
10 years, said it was committed to wireless, and hopes to claw
back market share it has lost to rivals with new Windows Phone 7
models, due to reach markets in time for holiday sales at the
end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are very committed, it's a core part of our strategy,"
Microsoft CFO Peter Klein told Reuters Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Handset makers such as HTC (2498.TW) and Samsung make
Windows phones but are increasingly turning to Android, which is
not only free but attracting a fast-growing developer community.

 It has been more than 10 years since the first Linux clusters arrived in the HPC market. The goal for early adopters was "just get it to work."                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 Fast forward to today: The production of HPC clusters, like IBM`s iDataplex, are delivered as ready-to-run solutions. IBM`s iDataplex leverages best-of-breed Ethernet connectivity from IBM alliance partner Force10 Networks, which offers ultra-high-density Ethernet technology designed to augment the HPC environment.              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 Today`s HPC cluster offers unprecedented control over issues such as price, performance, power and cooling, space, ease-of-use and job throughput.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Nuix, a leading vendor of electronic discovery (eDiscovery) and corporate
investigation software, today launched the world`s only forensically defensible
means of collecting all Electronically Stored Information (ESI) from Microsoft
SharePoint sites, including dynamic content. 

Nuix Collector for SharePoint can collect discussion threads, blogs, wikis,
calendars, task lists, and all associated data in a fully automated fashion. In
addition, Nuix Collector acquires the content in a manner that allows it to be
rendered as it looked on the SharePoint site. These capabilities are not
currently available in any other generally available software product. 

Nuix Collector for SharePoint supports Microsoft SharePoint WSS, 2007 and 2010,
as well as cloud-based SharePoint sites. Nuix Collector forms a key part of a
powerful, simple-to-use and forensically-sound suite of tools for the
identification, collection and preservation of potentially relevant ESI. 

Nuix CEO Eddie Sheehy said the Nuix Collector Suite is based on technology that
has been developed over the past eight years by MicroForensics. 

"Recently Nuix and MicroForensics formed a partnership to integrate our
technologies and bring to market a complete suite of eDiscovery tools that cover
both the left and right side of the EDRM," commented Sheehy. "It is exciting to
be able to bring to our customers an integrated suite of products that provide a
cost effective, easy-to-use and off-the-shelf solution." 

An experienced user of the Collector tools, David Greetham, managing director,
computer forensics at Houston-based HSSK Group, said, "Using Collector for
targeted collections has enabled us to collect from enormous data sources
including NAS devices, SharePoint and large data servers that other tools simply
cannot handle. Collector has provided HSSK with the technology to preserve ESI
more efficiently and with fewer resources, ultimately saving our clients money."


The Nuix Collector Suite is comprised of three powerful tools that can be used
alone or in conjunction with one another, as well as with Nuix`s data processing
and analysis tools. The three tools are:

* Nuix Collector for SharePoint provides a fast and defensible means of
collecting electronically stored information (ESI) from Microsoft SharePoint
sites, while maintaining the exact look-and-feel as it existed at the time of
collection. 
* Nuix Collector for Networks automates the collection of ESI from laptops,
desktops, enterprise file shares and common computer forensic file formats
stored on a Windows accessible network. 
* Nuix Collector Portable enables organizations to simply and rapidly collect
data in the field. It is an easy 'plug and play' solution so the end user needs
no expertise or specialist training.

The complete suite of tools will also be on display and available for
demonstration at booth #204 at the Computer and Enterprise Investigations
Conference (CEIC), May 24-27th in Summerlin, NV.

&lt;p&gt;Legal Departments at Discover Financial Services, Hewlett-Packard Company, and
The Williams Companies Are Selected As Finalists in Annual Competition
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
ALM`s Corporate Counsel today announced the selection of the in-house attorneys
of Microsoft Corporation as winners of the magazine`s fifth annual "Best Legal
Department" competition. Corporate Counsel's editors also named the legal
departments of Discover Financial Services, Hewlett-Packard Company, andThe
Williams Companies as finalists. Profiles of the winner and finalists, including
online video interviews, will be featured in the June issue of Corporate
Counsel, out today, and on the magazine`s website at www.corpcounsel.com. 

The in-house legal department at Microsoft was selected for achievements
including the settlement of the company`s longest and most expensive antitrust
legal battle, a fight with the European Union over opening its Windows operating
system to rivals` browsers. Microsoft`s general counsel, Brad Smith and his
legal team spent months last year hammering out the details of the 61-page
settlement, including 24 videoconferences and 34 conference calls with lawyers
representing EU regulators. The settlement was a major win for a legal team
which has set out to prove that it can resolve disputes amicably, despite
Microsoft`s reputation for aggressively fighting legal disputes to their bitter
end. 

In addition to its settlement and litigation successes, the 459-lawyer group was
cited for its steps to increase efficiency in the face of budget cuts, and for
its diversity and pro bono efforts, including helping laid-off workers get free
computer training and representing immigrant children in court. 

"As always, the competition among the finalists was extremely tight, but
Microsoft`s use of a conciliatory approach to bring resolution to a landmark
case that had dragged on for years stood out," said Anthony Paonita, editor in
chief of the magazine. "Equally important to our decision was the quality of
their litigation and IP work, as well as their efforts to bring real diversity
to their department." 

The magazine`s editors cited Discover Financial Service`s legal department - one
of the smallest to ever enter the competition with just 34 members - for its
creative problem solving and innovative use of staff. For example, its tiny
litigation team (just one full-time attorney and two part-time lawyers) handled
over 1,000 legal matters in 2009, while resolving 11 of 14 pending class action
suits. Working with outside counsel, the team collected $2.75 billion last year
from an antitrust suit it won in 2008 against Visa Inc. and MasterCard
Incorporated. It was the third-largest antitrust victory in history. 

The more than 400 lawyers in HP`s global legal team were recognized for work
that included a complete overhaul of HP`s compliance system. That involved
identifying close to 50,000 employees who dealt with the public sector side of
HP`s business in 12 different countries, and making sure they had the right
training to observe local corruption and bribery laws. Under the leadership of
general counsel Michael Holston, the group has helped the company recover from
boardroom scandals that prompted the departure of the company`s CEO and previous
general counsel and instituted a formal pro bono program, which is set to expand
to encompass the company`s large staff of international lawyers. 

At The Williams Companies, the legal department`s ability to analyze data and
make projections helped it craft innovative fee agreements with its main law
firms. Those deals have enabled Williams to cut its outside legal expenses by
about 15 percent. Led by general counsel Jim Bender, the 39 attorneys for the
natural gas company were also recognized for implementing a new compliance
program, including companywide training on compliance guidelines and procedures,
and for developing a comprehensive approach to discovery that has saved the
company millions of dollars. 

Winners were selected from responses submitted to a detailed questionnaire
developed by the editors and reporters of Corporate Counsel and distributed to
the general counsel of all Fortune 500 corporations. The magazine`s editors and
reporters evaluated submissions and selected the winners. The winner and
finalists will be honored this fall at a joint event with Corporate Counsel's
sibling publication The American Lawyer. The dinner will salute The American
Lawyer's Lifetime Achievement Award winners, the 20 firms from the Am Law 200
selected for the magazine's "A-List," and the winners and finalists of Corporate
Counsel's Best Legal Department competition. 

The award-winning Corporate Counsel, the nation`s leading magazine for general
counsel and in-house attorneys at corporations across the country, is published
by ALM in print and on the Web at www.corpcounsel.com.

investors` deposits into escrow for several months pending the approval by the
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Once the visa is approved, the
Regional Center invests the monies into the job creation initiative as intended.
However if not approved, the full value of the investment must be returned to
the investor. As a result the security of funds and financial transparency are
critical. 

The American Redevelopment Regional Center (ARRC -- www.arregionalcenter.com) is
involved in commercial property development, directly investing EB-5 visa
investor funds to create jobs in Southern California. ARRC`s management had
investors lined up to get the project underway but had struggled for weeks with
their existing banks and systems to set up all the necessary accounts. ARRC was
reaching a point where time was running out. 

"Working with NES Financial and their banking partners, we were able to move
forward quickly. Deploying their EB-5 Administration Solution and setting up all
the necessary accounts for our Regional Center allowed us to do in two days what
previously would have taken us more than six weeks to set up," said Ron Darling,
president of the American Redevelopment Regional Center. "In addition to the
obvious efficiency and compliance benefits for our Regional Center, the solution
also provides investors with additional funds security and financial
transparency." 

NES Financial`s EB-5 Administration Solution provides individual investor
recordkeeping and sub-accounts with full transparency to all parties. Built on
NES Financial`s proven eSTAC technology platform -- used to administer tens of
billions of dollars annually in complex multi-party escrows - the system is
proven to meet the requirements of even the most complex escrow solutions. 

"Using our EB-5 Administration Solution provides Regional Centers with a proven,
compliant and secure way to protect all parties involved in EB-5 visa
transactions, all in a package that brings cost benefits and efficiencies to
each Center." said Michael Halloran, president and CEO of NES Financial. 

With NES Financial`s EB-5 visa system, Regional Centers and investors see
immediate benefits including:

* Safety of Funds - Each individual investor has the maximum amount of FDIC
coverage on their accounts 
* Investor Recordkeeping - Information and documents for each EB-5 investor are
available on-line 
* Investor Reports - Customized reports are available 24x7 
* Investor Accounting/Reconciliation - Accounting and reconciliation for the
investor group, each individual EB-5 investor, and the Regional Center 
* Rejected Investor Accounting - A full accounting is provided to the Regional
Center and Investment Company for distribution back to the rejected EB-5
investors

Bank rolls out real-time alerts - and an easy way to act on them and avoid fees

Sends 725,000 low balance alerts each week
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Chase announced it has rolled out two new free mobile banking features to help
customers manage their accounts more effectively. 

Customers now can receive a text message the moment their checking account
balance falls below a pre-selected amount - and then instantly transfer funds by
sending a text-message reply as short as four keystrokes. 

Already, Chase is sending out 725,000 low-balance alerts each week, helping
customers keep track of their bank balances and avoid fees. 

The new Instant Action Text Alerts improve upon Chase`s very popular low balance
account alerts, which were sent to customers after the close of the business
day. 

"The new features make it easier for customers to manage their accounts, and
avoid making purchases that could overdraw their accounts," said Charles Scharf,
head of Retail Financial Services at Chase. "Customers who liked our
balance-alert emails are going to love these." 

Customers can immediately - and simply - transfer funds from an eligible
checking, savings or money market account by replying to text message alert as
soon as it is received. 

For example, to transfer funds, customers should reply by typing the letter "T"
- which stands for Transfer - followed by a space and then the dollar amount.

* Sample: To transfer $250 = T 250.

If there is more than one eligible account to transfer from, the Chase text
alert will show the customer the balance for two of those accounts and provide
the option to choose either "A" or "B" as the "Transfer from" account.

* Sample: To transfer $250 from one of those accounts = A 250 or B 250.

Fund transfers via text message can only be made in response to a low-balance
text alert. 

The Instant Action Alerts are free and can be used by any Chase checking
customer who has a mobile phone with an SMS - or text messaging - service and
has signed up for the Chase MobileSM offerings. Customers can sign up for
Instant Action Alerts and even set their own delivery time preferences and
black-out times at www.chase.com, or by visiting a Chase branch. 

Customers also can text Chase (24273) to get account balances and view
transaction history on checking, savings, credit card, mortgage and home equity
accounts. 

Chase.com is optimized for mobile phone Web browsers - and available as an
iPhoneSM application - so customers can pay their bills, transfer money, find
Chase branches and ATMs, send wire transfers and complete other transactions
through their cellular phone. 

There is no charge from Chase to use the mobile offerings, but standard text
message and data rates may apply from a customer`s wireless provider.

&lt;p&gt;Innovative providers team up to offer economical, easy start-up, online
invoicing
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Invoice Cloud (IC), a SaaS provider of electronic bill presentment and payment
(EBPP) solutions, and Blue Moon Industries, Microsoft Dynamics GP ISV and
Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, successfully launched their joint solution at
Microsoft Convergence, April 24-28, Atlanta, GA. 

The Invoice Cloud - Blue Moon partnership solves a big problem for organizations
that spend too much time and money sending out paper bills and processing paper
checks. The fully integrated Blue Moon Microsoft Dynamics GP module helps
billers save money, speed cash flow and enhance the customer experience by using
Invoice Cloud to seamlessly move away from paper invoices and checks to
electronic bills and payments. 

The 4 top reasons that Microsoft Dynamics GP users are adopting this online
billing and payment solution are: 

1. Customer Demand for Easy Self Service
2. Easy to Implement
3. Lower Costs
4. Environmental Impact 

This secure, web-based solution is PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliant and
custom branded for each billing entity. This relieves billers of the burdens
associated with storing sensitive financial information and the related
development costs. What`s even more compelling is that there`s little to no
upfront cost and the solution can be operational in days or weeks, not months. 

Gary Palardy, President of Blue Moon said, "We selected Invoice Cloud to provide
this capability because it has several advantages over the competitors: SaaS is
an IC core competency, no registration is required to make a payment, and their
pay-as-you-go model costs less than any other solution out there." 

Blue Moon actually uses the solution to process its own invoices, so customers
have had a chance to experience paying online from the payer perspective.
Understanding how easy it is to use the system allows billers to quickly
implement and guide the customer experience. More help is available from the
"Payer Adoption Kit" which includes examples of how to present online billing
and payment to customers. 

States Invoice Cloud CEO Bob Bennett, "This is a great marriage of cost saving
efficiency and environmental responsibility. Invoice Cloud billers and payers
feel good about saving money, trees, and reducing their carbon footprint."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan today announced Auto Substitution, new functionality that will
enhance the operating model of the U.S. Tri-Party Repo market in support of the
recommendations issued recently by the Payments Risk Committee-sponsored Tri
Party Repo Infrastructure Task Force. Auto Substitution addresses the primary
component of Recommendation 1 of the Task Force - implement operational
enhancements to achieve the practical elimination of intraday credit by the
clearing banks. It also presents the opportunity to reduce the sizeable credit
risks historically associated with the $2 trillion Tri-Party Repo market, while
allowing dealers to retain access to securities required for intra-day trading. 

J.P. Morgan`s investment in Auto Substitution reflects its commitment to
increasing the stability and reliability of Tri-Party Repos as an essential
financing vehicle. Auto Substitution minimizes the use of cash as collateral and
reduces unsecured depositor risk as investors are able to remain collateralized
by eligible securities intra-day, as well as overnight. Through the substitution
process, dealers and investors can maintain true term exposure to the
counterparty with which they have contracted, reducing the need for the daily
unwind without affecting market liquidity. 

J.P. Morgan`s patent-pending Auto Substitution functionality will allow the
release of assets held in tri-party repo loans by substituting those assets with
other eligible securities. To meet delivery instructions, Auto Substitution will
employ continual scanning technology to search the loans for assets that meet
the delivery criteria and will replace them with eligible securities or cash.
Auto Substitution also reduces the investor`s depositor risk to the clearing
bank, while requiring little change to the current processes dealers use to
execute securities trades. 

"Auto Substitution breaks new ground in reducing systemic risk for the U.S.
Tri-Party Repo market," states Kelly Mathieson, global business executive for
J.P. Morgan`s Clearance &amp; Collateral Management business. "It represents a
paradigm shift-the new options for both dealers and investors significantly
enhance their ability to manage their collateral and mitigate risk more
effectively." J.P. Morgan has successfully completed development and testing of
Auto Substitution functionality. 

Auto Substitution is the latest in a series of innovative new products and
services being introduced as part of J.P. Morgan`s Global Collateral Engine
initiative, a multiyear strategic investment program to deliver fully global,
enterprise-wide collateral management. 

Collateral management is a vital risk management tool for institutions seeking
to generate additional value from their portfolios while effectively managing
their credit risk. A pioneer and market leader in global collateral management,
J.P. Morgan was recently named the best tri-party service provider in Asia
Pacific by The Asset Magazine. The 2010 Global Custodian Tri-Party Repo Survey
distinguished J.P. Morgan from other providers, noting that "J.P. Morgan still
has the broadest reach". In fact, J.P. Morgan was the only institution to
qualify in all three regions and globally, gaining Commended ratings across the
board.

highlighting the essential role that IBM Business Partners play in driving
innovation for clients and making a difference in today's highly competitive
marketplace. Teaming with IBM, these Beacon Award winners have set the standard
for technical capabilities, vision, ingenuity in solving problems and client
satisfaction. 

FIS was selected for the award based on its core Profile conversion for
Government Savings Bank (GSB) in Thailand, the country`s fourth largest bank.
The conversion was completed within a 16 month timeframe, and included the
entire branch and back office technical infrastructure of the bank and 20
million deposit and loan accounts. Two weeks after going live with Profile in a
full production environment, GSB introduced new savings products that resulted
in significant market share gains and achieved 107 percent of its product launch
goal in the first 30 days. In addition, the cost efficiencies and currency float
attained on the new savings products alone more than paid for the FIS Profile
system, a return on investment in less than 12 months. 

FIS teamed with IBM Global Services for the IBM System p and AIX implementation
to help plan, implement and manage the dynamic FIS Profile infrastructure
environment for GSB. FIS Profile is a transformational core banking platform
targeted to top-tier financial institutions, including leading global retail and
direct banks. GSB selected Profile as their solution to dramatically increase
their efficiency, support new products and eliminate service outages. 

"We are very proud to have won a Beacon award this year," said Frank Sanchez,
corporate executive vice president, FIS Strategic Solutions. "FIS goes to great
lengths to deliver market-leading technology that demonstrates the highest level
of product innovation, industry expertise and client service for organizations
throughout the world. This award validates our continued commitment to providing
reference solutions that support our clients` strategic objectives and generate
tangible results." 

The IBM Beacon Awards provide a wide range of industry recognition, increased
visibility and promotional opportunities to award winners and finalists.
Hundreds of nominations were judged by a team of leading industry journalists,
analysts and IBM executives, who selected winners and finalists in 9 overall
categories encompassing 21 awards covering hardware, software, and service
solutions, Midmarket, ISV and technical awards as well as a focus on Smarter
Planet. Among the categories were three new additions for 2010: New
Intelligence, Smart Work and Smarter Planet. 

"Our Beacon Award winners represent the tremendous power of the IBM Business
Partner ecosystem in creating unique client value through our combined
capabilities, expertise and offerings," said Rich Hume, general manager, IBM
Business Partner Organization. "By winning the Outstanding Enterprise
Application Solution by an ISV Category award, FIS has demonstrated its ability

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Certified Application Specialist (MCAS) Certification to Become
Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) 2007
SALT LAKE CITY--(Business Wire)--
Certiport (www.certiport.com), the official test delivery solution provider for
the global workforce and academic markets, today announced the Microsoft
Certified Application Specialist (MCAS) certification will be renamed Microsoft
Office Specialist (MOS) 2007 beginning June 2, 2010. 

According to a new report by Forrester Research, eighty percent of enterprise
customers use some version of Microsoft Office for worker productivity and
collaboration, with only eight percent using alternatives. Replacing MCAS, MOS
2007 will continue as the premier, globally recognized certification program
chosen by individuals seeking to validate their knowledge, skills and abilities
relating to the 2007 Microsoft Office system. 

Microsoft Office Specialist 2007 Details:www.certiport.com/MOS2007

All individuals who have earned a MCAS credential will be considered
certification holders of the MOS 2007 certification. The certification exam will
remain unchanged, without any new requirements or content. 

"After lengthy market analyses, the new Microsoft Office Specialist 2007 brand
represents a more concise message for our testing centers, partners and
certification holders," said Ray Kelly, chief executive officer, Certiport.
"Today, we're strengthening the visibility and equity of the MOS brand by
strongly connecting the product name with the value of a globally-recognized
certification, significant in both academia and business." 

In the academic environment, MOS 2007 will continue to enhance scholastic
performance and prepare students to enter the workforce. In a competitive job
market, individuals will continue to use MOS 2007 to differentiate themselves,
prove their skills, enhance job performance and advance their careers. 

"The strength of our brand is one of our most prized assets and the value it
brings to our business is immeasurable," said Lutz Ziob, general manager,
Microsoft Learning. "Microsoft Office is our second most popular brand, and
renaming the certification will help students and individuals in the workforce
further distinguish themselves as recognized Microsoft Office application
experts." 

Current MCAS certification holders may choose to use the new branding
designation on personal documents since they will, by design, retain the MOS
2007 credential. They can also replace their MCAS documentation with a MOS 2007
certificate for a small fee to cover fulfillment costs at
www.certiport.com/portal/SSL/Login.aspx. 

Certiport is the only authorized provider of Microsoft`s Business
Certifications. The MOS 2007 exam covers the entire Microsoft Office Suite,
encompassing Word 2007, PowerPoint 2007, Excel 2007, Outlook 2007 and Access
2007, as well as Windows Vista.

&lt;p&gt;Yereth Rosen began working as a stringer for Reuters in 1989, reporting on the Exxon Valdez oil spill. She has covered a variety of Alaska news, from oil and gas issues to volcanic eruptions and sled-dog races, and lives with her family in Anchorage. In the following story, she recounts how the disaster cast a decades-long shadow over the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Yereth Rosen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE (Reuters) - It did not take a major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to jog Alaskans' memories of our own Exxon Valdez, the spill more than 20 years ago that would become a byword for environmental disasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reminders come in unlikely places, like my favorite midtown Anchorage drive-up coffee stand. One special this month was a latte with hazelnut and butter rum flavoring, a popular combination dubbed the "Exxon Valdez."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Alaskans, the Exxon Valdez is still around and memories cross generations. Exxon Valdez Oil Spill takes too long to say, so we just say EVOS, pronounced "Ee-vose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Gulf of Mexico beaches brace for the impact of a vast and spreading slick from the BP oil well, I remember 1989, when oil from the punctured Exxon Valdez tanker was just starting to spread over Prince William Sound and adjoining waters of the Gulf of Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I interviewed some volunteers working in the animal-rescue center set up at the Homer High School pool -- their young children were at a nearby sink with a toy boat, playing a game they called "Oil Spill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was in the Prince William Sound town of Cordova, home of the fishing fleet that mustered a "mosquito fleet" of tiny boats to help contain the oil spill -- and saw one fishery collapse despite their best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bookstore owner and former mayor Kelly Weaverling, his long ponytail of two decades ago shorn to a buzz cut, was looking at a new site on Facebook, "Alaskan Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Survivors in Solidarity with the Gulf Coast." A Brown University graduate student, a third-generation Cordovan who was a toddler in 1989, created it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That student, Rory Merritt, recalls a childhood, "watching fewer and fewer cars park on Main Street and more and more businesses closed," he told me by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-delayed resolution of Exxon Valdez civil litigation, ironically, has ended up hurting him because payments finally made to his parents disqualified him from some student financial aid, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIFE'S BACKDROP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spill has permeated my life since it began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years after the Exxon Valdez ran aground in the sound, eventually spilling 11 million gallons (41 million liters) of crude, I spent almost my whole summer at the federal courthouse in downtown Anchorage reporting on the class- action civil trial representing about 32,000 plaintiffs, including Merritt's parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 10th anniversary, I was back in Cordova, pregnant with my first child and queasy as in early days when I endured rides in bumpy seaplanes to far-flung cleanup sites. Once, I paused to retch on a downtown sidewalk. Locals, by then old acquaintances, sized up the situation and inquired about my due date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 20-year mark, my daughter created an Exxon Valdez exhibit for her third-grade class "living museum." My preschool-aged son by then was fond of a picture book, "Prince William," the story of a seal rescued from the Exxon spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just human generations that share a spill legacy. Some sea otters and ducks probing beach sediments are encountering Exxon Valdez oil that was deposited there years before they were born, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVOS has even wormed its way into local art.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE May 19 (Reuters) - It did not take a major oil
spill in the Gulf of Mexico to jog Alaskans' memories of our
own Exxon Valdez, the spill more than 20 years ago that would
become a byword for environmental disasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Reminders come in unlikely places, like my favorite midtown
Anchorage drive-up coffee stand. One special this month was a
latte with hazelnut and butter rum flavoring, a popular
combination dubbed the "Exxon Valdez."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Alaskans, the Exxon Valdez is still around and memories
cross generations. Exxon Valdez Oil Spill takes too long to
say, so we just say EVOS, pronounced "Ee-vose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the Gulf of Mexico beaches brace for the impact of a
vast and spreading slick from the BP oil well, I remember 1989,
when oil from the punctured Exxon Valdez tanker was just
starting to spread over Prince William Sound and adjoining
waters of the Gulf of Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I interviewed some volunteers working in the animal-rescue
center set up at the Homer High School pool -- their young
children were at a nearby sink with a toy boat, playing a game
they called "Oil Spill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, I was in the Prince William Sound town of
Cordova, home of the fishing fleet that mustered a "mosquito
fleet" of tiny boats to help contain the oil spill -- and saw
one fishery collapse despite their best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bookstore owner and former mayor Kelly Weaverling, his long
ponytail of two decades ago shorn to a buzz cut, was looking at
a new site on Facebook, "Alaskan Exxon Valdez Oil Spill
Survivors in Solidarity with the Gulf Coast." A Brown
University graduate student, a third-generation Cordovan who
was a toddler in 1989, created it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That student, Rory Merritt, recalls a childhood, "watching
fewer and fewer cars park on Main Street and more and more
businesses closed," he told me by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The long-delayed resolution of Exxon Valdez civil
litigation, ironically, has ended up hurting him because
payments finally made to his parents disqualified him from some
student financial aid, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LIFE'S BACKDROP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spill has permeated my life since it began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five years after the Exxon Valdez ran aground in the sound,
eventually spilling 11 million gallons (41 million litres) of
crude, I spent almost my whole summer at the federal courthouse
in downtown Anchorage reporting on the class-action civil trial
representing about 32,000 plaintiffs, including Merritt's
parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the 10th anniversary, I was back in Cordova, pregnant
with my first child and queasy as in early days when I endured
rides in bumpy seaplanes to far-flung cleanup sites. Once, I
paused to retch on a downtown sidewalk. Locals, by then old
acquaintances, sized up the situation and inquired about my due
date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the 20-year mark, my daughter created an Exxon Valdez
exhibit for her third-grade class "living museum." My
preschool-aged son by then was fond of a picture book, "Prince
William," the story of a seal rescued from the Exxon spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not just human generations that share a spill legacy.
Some sea otters and ducks probing beach sediments are
encountering Exxon Valdez oil that was deposited there years
before they were born, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EVOS has even wormed its way into local art. The most
famous piece of Exxon Valdez-inspired art is the "Shame Pole"
carved by Cordova fisherman and Native artist Mike Webber, who
used his own blood to paint dollar signs that represent the
"spillionaires" who profited from the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Non-Alaskans may not fully appreciate how the spill changed
the trajectory of history here. Consider: The lucrative Exxon
Valdez cleanup contract was what vaulted Anchorage oil-services
company VECO Corp. into the big leagues of business and power.
VECO was at the center of a huge political corruption scandal
that broke in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The scandal made national headlines, sent former VECO CEO
Bill Allen and other prominent Alaskans to federal prisons,
ended the career of the U.S. Senate's longest-serving
Republican, Ted Stevens, and created a throw-the-bums-out
atmosphere in which Alaskans chose as governor a former mayor
with a strong outsider appeal, Sarah Palin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Palin, who went on to become Republican John McCain's
running mate in the 2008 presidential election, 
enthusiastically embraced the "Drill, Baby, Drill" mantra and a
plan to drill in frontier waters of the Arctic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skeptics respond, as they do to practically every major
development proposal in Alaska, by invoking the Exxon Valdez.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
The following is a statement from Visa Inc. in response to Senate passage of S.
3217: 

"We are disappointed that legislation intended to make our financial system
safer and fairer for consumers includes an irresponsible and anti-consumer
amendment offered by Senator Durbin. Adopted with no debate or review of facts,
the amendment allows retailers` to shift their cost for accepting debit cards
onto the backs of consumers while they continue to receive the value of
electronic payments - including faster check-outs, ticket lift and guaranteed
payment. 

"Written and backed by lobbyists representing the nation`s largest retailers,
the Durbin amendment could significantly harm consumers. Consumers could have
less choice, higher costs and could experience an increase in costs for checking
accounts and online banking fees and reduced debit card benefits like fraud
protection and rewards. Those who rely on prepaid cards for government
disbursement, such as child support, could be particularly hard hit. 

"For financial institutions, this amendment could force them to reduce or
eliminate valuable debit and checking account services and could especially harm
community banks and credit unions that depend on interchange to offer
competitive banking services to firefighters, police officers, teachers,
veterans, congressional staffers and other customers. 

"The Durbin amendment also gives retailers the power to set arbitrary, minimum
purchase requirements for consumers choosing to pay with plastic. This means
that customers who want to buy a gallon of milk or loaf of bread could be forced
to buy more unnecessarily if they use electronic payments at the register. This
could be especially devastating for those on a fixed income who rely on prepaid
cards for government disbursements such as social security. 

"The Durbin amendment is not germane to the overall Financial Reform bill
legislation. We hope Congress sees the amendment for what it is - an attempt by
retailers to increase their profits at the expense of consumers."

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest complaints about the federal government's H-1B and L-1 visa programs is that they could be used by corporations to hire skilled workers born outside the U.S. at wages lower than the U.S. market rate. Indeed, anti-H-1B visa activists say the program depresses American IT workers' salaries and robs them of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But new research from the University of Maryland seems to contradict anti-H-1B visa activists' claims about the immigration program's impact on American wages. In fact, the research suggests that foreign-born IT professionals with temporary skilled worker visas actually earn more than their American counterparts, not less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hank Lucas, professor of information systems at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, and assistant professor Sunil Mithas examined the effect of immigration policies on IT salaries using data from online salary surveys conducted from 2000 to 2005 by InformationWeek and management consultancy Hewitt Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for educational qualifications, work experience, and other individual characteristics, Lucas and Mithas found that IT professionals without U.S. citizenship earned 8.9 percent more than American citizens. Tech workers on temporary visas, such as the H-1B and L-1, were paid 6.8 percent more than those with U.S. citizenship, and green card holders took home 12.9 percent more than their American-born counterparts, according to Lucas' and Mithas' research, published this month by the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The professors say restrictive visa policies resulted in even higher salary premiums. In years when applications exceeded the annual caps for H-1B visas, salaries for all non-U.S. citizen IT workers--that is, visa or green card recipients--rose relative to the salaries of American-born IT professionals, say Lucas and Mithas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mithas says the study was driven by the lack of compelling data around claims that foreign-born IT professionals are taking away jobs from American workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Much of the immigration debate in this country ignores skill levels," says Lucas, adding that the influx of non-U.S. citizens has a much different impact on job availability and wages for unskilled labor than it does for skilled workers. U.S.-born citizens and foreign workers can potentially benefit from an influx of skilled workers, Lucas says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H-1B Salary Survey Ignites Controversy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lucas-Mithas research deviates from the findings of other studies investigating the effect of temporary visa programs on the salaries of U.S. IT professionals. According to Lucas and Mithas, H-1B visa holders earned an average of $75,358 from 2000 to 2003, compared with the average U.S. citizen's salary of $66,836. (The InformationWeek survey did not ask about visa status in 2004 and 2005). But according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS), the median salary for H-1B visa holders in computing professions during the 2000 to 2003 period was just over $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It [seems]strange to me that the authors would depend on sampled data when we have the whole census of new H-1B recipients' salaries reported [by] the USCIS, at least in aggregate terms," says Ron Hira, associate professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology. "For computing occupations those data show low wages relative to Bureau of Labor Statistics wages for Americans. The median salary for new H-1Bs is comparable to the entry-level wages for freshly minted bachelors in computer science, as reported by the National Association of Colleges  Employers. So half the new H-1Bs are being paid at- or below entry-level wages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas and Mithas say the USCIS and BLS numbers aren't granular enough to make meaningful comparisons. "You don't get a good sense of who these people are, what is their educational background, how long have they been in IT, what industry are they working in," says Mithas. "If you don't have data at an individual level, you don't know if you're comparing apples to apples."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hira suggests there may be a self-selection bias at play when using a sample population. The data Lucas and Mithas used comes from 50,000 IT professionals, including 809 temporary visa holders, who opted to participate in an online salary survey. The researchers say the overall sample and sample of non-U.S. citizen foreign-born IT professionals in their study is reasonably representative of the U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those numbers may line up, it's unlikely that H-1B or L-1 grantees who depend on their employers for their visas and who earn lower than average wages would participate in such a survey, says Hira. "The [Lucas-Mithas] report may be able to control for some additional factors that affect wages, but there is no doubting the USCIS characteristics data ," says Hira. "It is a census, not a sample."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas admits that selection bias could be a factor in any survey, but he remains confident in his data. "In situations like this, there's always the possibility for the sample not to be truly random," he says. "But I feel more comfortable with this survey with 50,000 respondents than I would if we did a random sample of a couple hundred IT professionals on our own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Corporations Pay More for H-1Bs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas and Mithas say their research proves that corporations use foreign-born IT professionals as a complement to, not as a cheaper substitute for, their American workforce. But the data does not provide any explanations for why employers would pay non-citizen IT workers more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas and Mithas have their own theories. For one, they think companies recruit foreign IT professionals for skills or expertise that they can't get from American workers, whether it's a stronger work ethic, multi-cultural experience, or willingness to travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were searching for an explanation, and it wasn't education or anything we could measure. So it had to be something intangible, like how aggressive you are or how much of a risk taker," says Lucas. "I'd have to say it's motivation. You have to be motivated to break out of the rut you're in, get out of the city you were born in, go to another country and work in IT."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hira is not buying it. "There's no doubt in my mind that, in general, H-1B workers are underpaid. That's why the offshore outsourcing majors rely almost exclusively on H-1Bs rather than hiring Americans," he says. "Plus they are beholden to their employer, making it more difficult for them to protest against poorer [wages and] working conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hira notes that it's possible the compensation among IT workers on temporary visas falls into two camps: "lots of low wage workers and a good portion of high wage workers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B. Lindsay Lowell, director of policy studies for Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of International Migration, has been analyzing the salaries of H-1B visa holders in science and technology using data from the National Science Foundation's National Survey of College Graduates. He has found that H-1Bs are paid lower average wages during the first three years of their permitted stay, but once they reapply for another three years or change employers, they may earn more than comparable U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The NSCG is an odd survey itself, but it's the largest random survey of graduates in the United States," says Lowell. "The reason we think there's an increase in wages is due to a change in bargaining power on the part of the H-1B. Of course, the first three years still reflects a savings to the employer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, examined the Department of Labor's database of labor condition applications (LCAs) and surmised that many large U.S. corporations and educational institutions frequently offer their H-1B recipients salaries substantially above the prevailing U.S. wage. However, he says, "offshoring/outsourcing type IT services providers" aggressively pursue all legally available paths to cut labor costs, including paying foreign workers only the legally mandated 95 percent of the prevailing wage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That suggests another point I've long argued, and which is supported in my and others' research," says Lowell, "which is that the H-1B labor market is softly segmented with different types of employers who pay less than the mainstream to the H-1Bs in their employ."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucas and Mithas consider the LCA data unreliable because it does not provide actual salary data, and many approved LCAs don't result in the granting of an actual visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are an awful lot of anecdotes of this or that company bringing in foreign workers and paying them less than the going wage, but you can't take that and generalize it to thousands of people," says Lucas. "We'd love to get inside of Infosys and Accenture and get detailed individual information, but privacy concerns enter into this, and they wouldn't want to give us the information anyway. They're afraid, no matter which way the research comes out, they'll be criticized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More Research Into H-1B Wages Needed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are as many as 700,000 temporary high-skill foreign professionals in the United States on visas today (approximately 500,000 in the H-1B category alone), and 60 percent of them work in IT, according to some estimates. More detailed data from USCIS or some other source would go a long way toward settling the debate over whether or not these visa programs depress the wages of IT professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This may be a good thing for the DHS or GAO to do," says Hira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   * Visa, MasterCard lost about $13 bln market cap over week&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Investors see market "overreaction" to Senate fee vote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * V shares down 22.6 pct vs. month-ago, MA down 21.6 pct &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Surprise Senate vote triggers network share sell-off  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Investors confident in long-term business model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Maria Aspan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - Credit card networks Visa Inc
(V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) have lost about $13 billion in
market capitalization in the past week, but some investors
argue that the companies' still-strong growth prospects should
outweigh fears about regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors' worst fears seemed to be realized a week ago,
when the Senate voted to restrict debit card fees. The prospect
of such regulation has been a long-standing threat for
MasterCard and Visa, whose revenues depend on how much
consumers use their cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most analysts and investors had considered such fee
legislation unlikely, which made its approval an extra jolt to
the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a lot of fear, a lot of concern. Probably more
than anything else, it's the surprise. People didn't expect
this," said David Carr, the chairman of Oak Value Capital
Management Inc, which includes MasterCard and American Express
Co (AXP.N) in its $200 million worth of assets under
management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of MasterCard have fallen about 21.4 percent in the
past month, to close at $205.50 on Thursday. Shares of Visa,
which dominates the U.S. debit market and thus would be more
affected by the legislation, have lost about 22.6 percent in
the past month, closing at $72.82 on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even after the month-long slide in their share prices,
Visa trades at about 19 times its 2011 earnings estimates, and
MasterCard trades at about 15 times its estimates, relatively
high multiples compared with most financials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies together process about 80 percent of the
world's electronic payments, reaping big returns as consumers
switch from cash and checks to credit and debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the short-term there may be some impact from any kind
of (card fee) caps or reductions, but in the long term ... we
don't see a lot of basis" to market fears, Carr said. "It's a
fixed-cost operation for the processors, and as they increase
volume (of payments) over time, it's very profitable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OPENING A DOOR?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The slide in Visa and MasterCard shares was accelerated by
fears over the pace of the U.S. economic recovery, the
faltering euro, and the impact of broader financial regulation,
according to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But their primary concern is that the Senate vote on debit
fees could open a door to wider restrictions on so-called
credit card interchange fees, which account for about a fifth
of banks' credit card revenue. They also indirectly boost Visa
and MasterCard revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Unfortunately I think there are just a couple of places
where the government, with the stroke of a pen, can
dramatically change the profitability of the companies," said
James Ellman, president of financial services hedge fund
Seacliff Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you're willing to believe that the government
interference in their business has peaked at this point, (Visa
and MasterCard) are great buys," he said. But "if you are
concerned that the government has only just started, then
unfortunately there could be significant downside risk left in
both stocks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa and MasterCard intensified their damage-control
efforts this week. Visa Chief Executive Joseph Saunders visited
Washington on Wednesday, "to highlight the negative
consequences that would result" from the amendment, a Visa
spokesman told Reuters. [ID:nN19252495]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MasterCard President of U.S. Markets Chris McWilton told
Reuters on Sunday that it had lost "a big battle" with the
Senate but planned to redouble its efforts to win the war. On
Thursday, General Counsel Noah Hanft said he was in Washington
to meet with lawmakers and "to make it clear to them on the
House side that the ... amendment is an error." [ID:nN1781278]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AWAITING A BOTTOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many analysts remain bullish on the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's an overreaction," said Scott Valentin, an analyst
with FBR Capital Markets. "It didn't take much to spook
investors  ... These stocks (are a) good value, but people want
to see some stability in the stock price first, so it becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MasterCard has more than quadrupled its share price since
its initial public offering in 2006, and Visa has gained about
22 percent since its IPO two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the best-known hedge funds, including Julian
Robertson's Tiger Management and Andreas Halvorsen's Viking
Global Investors, have been big shareholders of MasterCard and
Visa for several years, though they have been reducing their
positions over the past six months, according to Thomson
Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa was the fifth-most popular stock and MasterCard 44th
most popular held by a group of 30 of the largest
equity-oriented hedge funds as of March 31, according to a
Thomson Reuters survey of Securities and Exchange Commission
filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Nix, a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital
Associates, said on Wednesday that he was holding off on buying
any more Visa shares at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I want to see a couple of days of stabilization," he said.
"When you see this type of volatility, there can be a couple of
headaches when it comes to finding a bottom."

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron must test blowout preventer, other equipment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Audits and drill ship inspections to be more frequent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Must get clearance before reaching target at Nfld well
 (Adds detail and comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Scott Haggett&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CALGARY, Alberta, May 20 (Reuters) - A Canadian regulator
tightened offshore drilling rules on Thursday in response to
the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, forcing new
restrictions on Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) operations off
Newfoundland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron will have to provide test results for the blowout
preventer and its activation systems at the Lona O-55
exploratory well off the eastern Canadian province, the
regulator said. It was the blowout preventer for the BP Plc
(BP.L) well in the Gulf that failed, leading to the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum
Board said it was making the new requirements in light of the
situation unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico and heightened public
concern over drilling operations currently under way off the
province of Newfoundland and Labrador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Along with other measures, Chevron's drill ship will face
more frequent audits and inspections and regulators will ensure
that safety systems are functioning before the drilling reaches
its planned target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said it will comply with the new regulations for
the well, being drilled in water 2,600 meters deep in the
Orphan Basin, about 430 kilometers (267 miles) northeast of St.
John's, Newfoundland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are cooperating fully ... and will facilitate the
board's planned oversight measures for Orphan Basin drilling
operations," Leif Sollid, a spokesman for Chevron, said. "The
focus of everyone involved is to ensure safe and incident free
operations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BP well is under 1,500 meters of water 68 kilometers
(42 miles) offshore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian governments and regulators are reassessing the
country's preparedness for an offshore disaster following the
April 20 explosion of Transocean Ltd's (RIG.N) Deepwater
Horizon drilling rig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The explosion killed 11 workers and triggered what could
prove to be the worst U.S. oil spill if the crude keeps spewing
unchecked into the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron well is the only offshore drilling currently
underway in Canadian waters. However both BP and Exxon Mobil
Corp (XOM.N) have longer term plans to explore for petroleum in
the Beaufort Sea, north of the Arctic Circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The National Energy Board, Canada's federal oil and gas
regulator, launched a review of Arctic safety and environmental
drilling requirements last week, canceling planned hearings on
a request from BP and Exxon reexamine a requirement that Arctic
drillers would need to drill a relief well in the same season
an exploratory well was completed.

&lt;p&gt;  GHENT, BELGIUM, May 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Ablynx (Euronext Brussels: ABLX) announced today that the research
collaboration which forms part of its license agreement for Nanobodies to
tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) with Pfizer has been extended
for another year.

    Ablynx announced the exclusive research collaboration and license
agreement with Pfizer (originally signed with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) in
November 2006, a deal potentially worth $212.5 million in past and future
milestone payments for commercialisation across multiple indications. In
addition, Ablynx is eligible to receive royalties on product sales. Under
this agreement, Pfizer has exclusive rights to develop and commercialise
anti-TNF-alpha Nanobodies developed under the collaboration. The lead
Nanobody-based candidate is in a Phase II study in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Vivianne Rodrigues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 20 (Reuters) - Emerging markets government
bond spreads widened more than 20 basis points over comparable
U.S. Treasuries on Thursday as investors shunned riskier assets
and moved into safer havens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ukraine's debt spreads widened the most, or 81 basis points
to 691 basis points over Treasuries, according to JP Morgan's
Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (EMBI+) 11EMJ.JPMEMBIPLUS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spreads in the overall index -- a benchmark for investment
in emerging markets -- rose 21 basis points to 341 basis
points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emerging markets stocks and currencies also fell as well as
oil and other commodities on fears the European sovereign debt
crisis may drag on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are rising worries that the economic recovery in the
United States and major emerging markets economies will not be
enough to compensate for a drop in demand conditions from
Europe," Manuel Oliveri, an analyst at UBS AG said in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS Risk Index, another widely followed risk gauge, rose to
1.11 on Thursday from 0.88 in the previous session, moving
further into risk averse territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spreads on Argentine bonds also jumped, rising as much as
72 basis points earlier to 854, its highest level since
September. Argentine spreads last traded up 52 basis points at
834.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues; Editing by Diane Craft)

&lt;p&gt;(Updates with Goldman Sachs declining comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 20 (Reuters) - The New York Metropolitan
Transportation Authority is ending its relationship with
Goldman Sachs and will pick a new financial adviser next week,
a source familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's (GS.N) contract with the MTA -- which runs New

major bridges and tunnels -- expired in 2009 and since then has
been renewed on a month-by-month basis, the authority said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The MTA began a search for a new financial adviser last
June and is due to announce its pick on Monday morning at its
monthly budget meeting. The full MTA board will vote to approve
the choice on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman at Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has been charged with fraud by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission over the design and marketing of a
subprime mortgage securities product, but the source said the
MTA's decision was unrelated to Goldman's recent troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The MTA faces an estimated deficit of $537 million next
year, and that figure could rise to as high as $860 million,
the state comptroller said in a new report last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency has been criticized for its failure to rein in
construction cost overruns and has some massive projects under
way.

&lt;p&gt;More Than 500,000 Fans in 94 Cities in 84 Countries Had a Close Encounter with
Football`s Greatest Prize
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Before a ball is kicked in the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the teams compete for the
greatest prize in football, the tournament`s 18-carat gold trophy has already
undertaken its biggest ever global tour. Travelling 151,217 kilometers (93,958
miles), over 225 days crossing five continents and touching the lives of more
than 500,000, the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola has now touched down
in South Africa for a final tour of the host nation. 

Commencing eight months ago on 21 September 2009, from the home of FIFA in
Zurich, the tour has undertaken its most ambitious and exciting journey to date,
making history along the way by visiting 50 African cities from Abidjan, Ivory
Coast to Yaounde, Cameroon. The Trophy was greeted by passionate football fans
in an additional 34 countries around the world, from established football
nations including Brazil, Italy and England to countries where fan enthusiasm is
growing such as New Caledonia, Malaysia and Kazakhstan. 

FIFA World Cup winners including Pele, Lothar Matthaus, and Christian Karembeu
have shared in the Trophy Tour experience along with fans around the world who
have enjoyed the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour celebrations. Welcoming the magic of
the FIFA World Cup to their countries, 44 heads of state have made time in their
schedules to greet the prestigious Trophy`s arrival. 

Bringing an African inspired flavour to select FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour events
and collaborating with leading artists in each country, Somali hip-hop artist
K`NAAN has been treating fans to live performances of his hit `Wavin` Flag -
Coca-Cola Celebration Mix,` which is the anthem of Coca-Cola`s 2010 FIFA World
Cup campaign. The uplifting African-inspired track will be widely used as the
music element throughout Coca-Cola`s FIFA World Cup marketing campaign and is
set to have fans singing along all summer. 

"We have been able to bring fans closer to the FIFA World Cup experience and
give them a chance to stand just inches away from the same Trophy that has been
held aloft by the winners of the FIFA World Cup," said Emmanuel Seuge, group
director, worldwide sports and entertainment marketing, The Coca-Cola Company.
"Experiences like this create a lasting impression of a day they will never
forget and an emotional connection with our brand." 

Fulfilling every football fan`s dream, thousands of souvenir pictures of fans
posing with the authentic Trophy have been taken at Trophy Tour events and
shared by consumers online reaching nearly 400,000 people. Visitors to the
Trophy Tour events were also able to view a special 3-D movie showcasing
memorable moments of the FIFA World Cup, see entertainment such as music and
ball juggling acts, play 5-a-side games and go head-to-head on EA Sports 2010
FIFA World Cup video consoles. 

The final leg of The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour is underway now in South Africa
with visits to 32 cities including those staging FIFA World Cup matches and
playing host to world football`s leading players as they compete for the prize
that has visited fans in every competing nation as part of the FIFA World Cup
Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola.

Before a ball is kicked in the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the teams compete for the
greatest prize in football, the tournament`s 18-carat gold trophy has already
undertaken its biggest ever global tour. Travelling 151,217 kilometers (93,958
miles), over 225 days crossing five continents and touching the lives of more
than 500,000, the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola has now touched down
in South Africa for a final tour of the host nation. 

Commencing eight months ago on 21 September 2009, from the home of FIFA in
Zurich, the tour has undertaken its most ambitious and exciting journey to date,
making history along the way by visiting 50 African cities from Abidjan, Ivory
Coast to Yaounde, Cameroon. The Trophy was greeted by passionate football fans
in an additional 34 countries around the world, from established football
nations including Brazil, Italy and England to countries where fan enthusiasm is
growing such as New Caledonia, Malaysia and Kazakhstan. 

FIFA World Cup winners including Pele, Lothar Matthaus, and Christian Karembeu
have shared in the Trophy Tour experience along with fans around the world who
have enjoyed the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour celebrations. Welcoming the magic of
the FIFA World Cup to their countries, 44 heads of state have made time in their
schedules to greet the prestigious Trophy`s arrival. 

Bringing an African inspired flavour to select FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour events
and collaborating with leading artists in each country, Somali hip-hop artist
K`NAAN has been treating fans to live performances of his hit `Wavin` Flag -
Coca-Cola Celebration Mix,` which is the anthem of Coca-Cola`s 2010 FIFA World
Cup campaign. The uplifting African-inspired track will be widely used as the
music element throughout Coca-Cola`s FIFA World Cup marketing campaign and is
set to have fans singing along all summer. 

"We have been able to bring fans closer to the FIFA World Cup experience and
give them a chance to stand just inches away from the same Trophy that has been
held aloft by the winners of the FIFA World Cup," said Emmanuel Seuge, group
director, worldwide sports and entertainment marketing, The Coca-Cola Company.
"Experiences like this create a lasting impression of a day they will never
forget and an emotional connection with our brand." 

Fulfilling every football fan`s dream, thousands of souvenir pictures of fans
posing with the authentic Trophy have been taken at Trophy Tour events and
shared by consumers online reaching nearly 400,000 people. Visitors to the
Trophy Tour events were also able to view a special 3-D movie showcasing
memorable moments of the FIFA World Cup, see entertainment such as music and
ball juggling acts, play 5-a-side games and go head-to-head on EA Sports 2010
FIFA World Cup video consoles. 

The final leg of The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour is underway now in South Africa
with visits to 32 cities including those staging FIFA World Cup matches and
playing host to world football`s leading players as they compete for the prize
that has visited fans in every competing nation as part of the FIFA World Cup
Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola.

&lt;p&gt;Research Collaboration Aims to Break Barriers with Conversational and
Intelligent Speech Products


BURLINGTON, Mass. &amp; ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUAN) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced
that the companies recently entered into a five-year joint-research initiative
designed to advance next-generation natural language speech technologies.
Leveraging Nuance and IBM`s research and development expertise, the initiative
is designed to expand the global use of speech technology and set new benchmarks
in design, usability and technical excellence. 

IBM and Nuance have long focused on speech technology to create and facilitate
more meaningful interactions between human and machine, and among people. Today,
businesses and consumers alike can easily exploit the technology to communicate
naturally and intuitively. Together, IBM and Nuance intend to further enhance
these mass market speech interface solutions to increasingly resemble
human-to-human interaction, whether in the car or home, on a mobile device, PC
and telephone, or within settings such as customer service, healthcare and many
others. 

"Our relationship with Nuance demonstrates how IBM is applying its deep research
skills and assets to help its collaborators and their clients address some of
the world`s most formidable and exciting technical challenges," said Dr. John E.
Kelly III, senior vice president and director of IBM Research. "Combining our
technical talent with the expertise of companies like Nuance, we can create
transformational technologies that hold promise to make the world work better." 

"Speech technology already enables highly intuitive interactions, but there is
still significant potential for the development and availability of
next-generation speech solutions that allow people to communicate with machines
in a natural, unconstrained fashion," said Paul Ricci, chairman and CEO, Nuance.
"The expanded collaboration between Nuance and IBM will deliver an inspiring
portfolio of speech innovations that can accelerate the proliferation of speech
across global industries. With IBM and Nuance working together, our objectives
are within reach and we are well on our way to the day when people will interact
with machines just as they would with another person." 

The latest collaboration complements two other agreements between the companies
to embark on joint projects. Last year, IBM named Nuance its Preferred Business
Partner for speech technologies and related professional services, aimed at
complementing IBM`s Industry Solutions portfolio. The companies also entered
into a licensing and technical services agreement. The agreement announced today
focuses on conducting joint research, the results of which will be
commercialized by Nuance.

Files Revised Plan of Reorganization and Disclosure Statement with Support of FDIC and JPMorgan Chase</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
Washington Mutual, Inc. (Pink Sheets: WAMUQ.PK) ("WMI" or the "Company") today
announced that it has filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court") an Amended Plan of Reorganization
(the "Plan") and Disclosure Statement (the "Disclosure Statement"). The Plan
implements and incorporates the terms of a revised global settlement agreement
(the "Settlement") reached among WMI, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
("FDIC") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (NYSE: JPM) ("JPMC"). 

The terms of Settlement were first announced on March 12, 2010. The terms of
Settlement were subsequently modified as reflected in filings with the
Bankruptcy Court on each of March 26, 2010 and May 16, 2010, and additional
modifications are reflected in the Plan and Disclosure Statement filed today
with the Bankruptcy Court. WMI noted that the Plan, Disclosure Statement, and
the Settlement were filed with the full support of the FDIC, JPMC and the
Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, which was appointed by the Bankruptcy
Court. 

WMI commented: 

"WMI is pleased to have reached an agreement with the FDIC and JPMC, and we
appreciate the strong support of the Creditors' Committee. WMI has worked
diligently over the last 20 months to maximize the value of the bankruptcy
estate and is confident that the Amended Plan will accomplish the objective of
providing substantial recoveries for WMI`s creditors." 

As previously announced, the Plan under which the Settlement will be implemented
contemplates, among other things:

* WMI will establish a liquidating trust to make distributions to creditors on
account of their allowed claims. In accordance with the terms of the Plan, the
trust will distribute funds in excess of approximately $7 billion, including
approximately $4 billion of previously disputed funds on deposit with JPMC. 
* It is anticipated that the reorganized WMI will undertake a rights offering
pursuant to which certain creditors will receive a right to purchase newly
issued shares of reorganized WMI common stock. The reorganized WMI will retain
equity interests in WMI Investment Corp. and WM Mortgage Reinsurance Company. 
* JPMC will assume certain liabilities related to benefit plans (including the
pension plan sponsored by WMI). 
* The various litigations involving WMI, JPMC and FDIC will be stayed or
dismissed. In addition, JPMC and the FDIC (in its capacity as receiver of
Washington Mutual Bank and in its corporate capacity) will withdraw claims
against WMI`s bankruptcy estate and the parties will exchange mutual releases. 
* Preferred and common equity securities previously issued by WMI will be
cancelled.

The Bankruptcy Court will hold a hearing on June 3, 2010 to consider approval of
the Disclosure Statement. Following approval of the Disclosure Statement, WMI
will ask the Bankruptcy Court to confirm the Plan by July 20, 2010. 

WMI`s Plan and Disclosure Statement, as well as the Settlement annexed to the
Plan, are available at www.kccllc.net/wamu. The Plan is subject to confirmation
by the Court. This press release is not intended as a solicitation for a vote on
the Plan. 

The Disclosure Statement filed today contains historical information regarding
WMI and certain of its affiliates, a description of proposed distributions to
creditors, an analysis of the Plan`s feasibility, as well as many of the
technical matters required for the solicitation process, such as descriptions of
who will be eligible to vote on the Plan and the voting process itself.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Stocks featured in this week`s Zacks Industry Rank analysis include Goldman
Sachs (NYSE: GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS). 

Zacks Industry Rank Analysis is written by Dirk Van Dijk, CFA, Chief Equity
Strategist, Zacks.com. 

Beware the Brokers

Most of the time in this report, I look at industries that look particularly
strong based on the Zacks Rank. This week, however, I want to focus on a group
that looks very weak. That group is the investment brokers. 

It is a relatively large industry by number of firms, with 31 companies in it.
Of those 31 firms, six of them hold the dreaded Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) and
another ten hold a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell). Since only the most unattractive 5% of
all firms are stuck with a Zacks #5 Rank, and only the next 15% get a Zacks #4
Rank, having 19.4% of the firms in the industry at Strong Sell, and an
additional 32.3% at Sell is enough to sit up and take note. 

Overall the industry is in 250th place among the 256 industries we rank, with an
average score of 3.61 versus 3.65 last week. Despite the slight improvement in
its average score, it deteriorated by two spots from last week. 

The recent downdraft in the stock market (and just about every market with the
exception of longer-term Treasuries) is likely to directly hit the earnings of
these companies, and will thus likely lead to further estimate cuts for both
this year and next. 

The first table below shows all the number five ranked firms in the industry,
along with their valuations and recent changes in their mean estimates (one of
the primary drivers of the Zacks Rank). Most of the firms are small caps. The
big firms in the industry like Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and Morgan Stanley
(NYSE: MS) have neutral Zacks #3 Ranks. 

Most sport reasonable P/E ratios, at least based on 2011 earnings, but the
estimates are slipping and slipping fast. That raises serious questions about
whether the current level of expectations will be achieved. A falling
denominator can raise a P/E ratio as fast or faster than a rising numerator, and
is not nearly as much fun for the investor. I would note that the larger sector,
the Financials, have been mired near the bottom of the sector list for several
months now. 

The recent tumble in the market, coming when the wounds of the 2008 meltdown are
still fresh, is not going to be good for investor confidence. Unexplained drops
and recoveries of 700 points on the down over the course of an hour are not
particularly helpful, either. At least for now, it looks like it is better to
buy through your broker, rather than buying your broker.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft this week offered a release candidate nbsp;of its Windows Server AppFabric technology for caching of Web applications. A general release is planned for next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also made available a beta release of BizTalk Server 2010, which supports Windows Server AppFabric. BizTalk Server 2010 is due to be released to manufacturing -- which happens shortly before the product is made generally availablenbsp;-- in the third quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Related:  InfoWorld's Paul Krill reports  on Microsoft's priorities for application development technologies. |  Also on InfoWorld, see "The Windows vs. Linux server faceoff." | Keep up with app dev issues and trends with InfoWorld's Fatal Exception blog. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using distributed caching, Windows Server AppFabricnbsp; offers speed, scalability, and high availability for Web applications, Microsoft said. nbsp;AppFabric also features tools to simplify development and management of composite applications built using Windows Communication Foundation and Windows Workflow Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[AppFabric is] an add-on to Windows Server.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc shares rose as much as 5.4 percent on Friday on rumors of a possible settlement with regulators and a feeling that the stock could be oversold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shares were up 3.5 percent at $140.80 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, off an earlier high at $143.44.

&lt;p&gt;UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Iran has accused the United States of abusing its position as the host of the United Nations by denying a visa to the Islamic Republic's deputy foreign minister, according to a letter released on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran's letter to the U.N. Committee on Relations with the Host Country said Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Mohammad Mehdi Akhondzadeh Basti was repeatedly denied a visa by U.S. authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the letter, Iran's U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Khazaee said Washington's refusal to issue an entry visa to Tehran's top official overseeing its relations with the United Nations kept him from attending events like the May 3-28 review conference on the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, where Iran's atomic program is a key topic of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khazaee said U.S. authorities were misusing the country's status as the seat of the United Nations headquarters "as political leverage to advance their political agenda against certain countries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it was "nothing short of calculated political intimidation and pressure" which he said "impairs the very foundations of multilateral diplomacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley declined to comment on Akhondzadeh Basti's visa. "Visa decisions are confidential," he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akhondzadeh Basti previously headed Iran's diplomatic missions to Pakistan, Germany and the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the host of U.N. headquarters, the United States has pledged to issue entry visas to officials from U.N. member states, though it can and does deny entry permits to foreign officials for many reasons, such as failure to meet deadlines or provide proper documentation, or if espionage is suspected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington issued Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a visa to attend the opening of the nuclear arms treaty review conference earlier this month, though it has denied Iranian officials visas in the past, prompting complaints from Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States cut off diplomatic relations with Iran in 1980 during a hostage crisis. For the last eight years Washington and Tehran have been locked in an escalating standoff over Iran's nuclear program, which Western powers fear is aimed at producing atomic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tehran says its nuclear program is entirely peaceful and will produce electricity, not bombs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week the United States submitted a draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council that would impose a fourth round of U.N. sanctions against Iran for refusing to halt its enrichment program. The draft was agreed with Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Vicki Allen)&lt;/p&gt;

shares rose as much as 5.4 percent on Friday on rumors of a
possible settlement with U.S. regulators and a feeling that the
stock could be oversold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shares were up 3.5 percent at $140.80 in afternoon

investors that a prominent hedge fund helped choose the
underlying securities and was betting against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Market sources confirmed that the early jump in Goldman
shares -- following Thursday's slump in U.S. stocks -- was
based on rumors that the bank might be close to a settlement
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and because

leverage into the world." [ID:nSGE64K02U]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He's basically admitting that they didn't do some things
as well as they could have and that is suggesting that there is

Dietze said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Salem, Massachusetts-based Cabot Money Management fixed
income manager William Larkin, who owns Goldman bonds, said
Goldman stock has been oversold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman has been oversold, and the bonds have been
widening pretty substantially the last couple days," he said.

&lt;p&gt;Program Introduces Middle School Students to the Wonders of Math and Science

* Dr. Bernard Harris, first African American to walk in space, to speak to 360
middle school students. 
* The Dream Tour provides out-of-this-world experience and encourages students
to reach for the stars. 
* Sponsored by ExxonMobil, national tour highlights Science, Technology,

DENVER--(Business Wire)--
Former U.S. Astronaut Bernard Harris gave students and teachers in Denver a
first-hand experience with the wonders of science, technology, engineering and
mathematics when "The Dream Tour, presented by ExxonMobil" made its fifth stop
of 2010 on May 21 speaking to 360 students from Grant Beacon Middle School. 

The tour is designed to encourage today`s middle school students to realize
their potential and strive to acquire strong math and science skills. The
program included an interactive and inspirational program by Harris, a
demonstration on space and engaging dialogue about achieving goals. 

"It is critical that American students are prepared with the problem-solving
skills and tools to tackle challenges they may face in the future. Providing
them with a strong foundation in math and science education is imperative, and
with The Dream Tour, I hope to inspire students to pursue studies and careers in
these fields," said Dr. Harris. 

From humble beginnings in San Antonio to making history as the first African
American to walk in space, Dr. Harris is a living example of achieving high
aspirations. His story provides a powerful backdrop to bring his message to
students in cities across America. Since 2008, Dr. Harris has encouraged almost
35,000 middle school students in more than 20 cities nationwide. This year, The
Dream Tour will visit Anchorage, Baton Rouge, Billings, Cleveland, Denver,
Nashville, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco as Dr. Harris
continues to motivate and inspire students to pursue math and science. 

"ExxonMobil is focused on the need to attract more of America`s students to
higher level math and science courses in secondary school. The classes they
choose today can make or break their options for the future, and `The Dream
Tour, presented by ExxonMobil,` is one way to expose them to the possibilities,"
said Gerald McElvy, President, ExxonMobil Foundation.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JP Morgan (JPM.N) chief Jamie Dimon faces an unenviable choice - splash out $3 billion on much-needed but lavish new London headquarters or cull the twin skyscrapers in a nod to the war on banking extravagance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank is dragging its heels on the glamorous plan, fearing it could rile regulators determined to bring mega-banks considered "too big to fail" under tighter control, sources in the banking and property industries said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a massive dilemma for them. They need new space to grow but they don't want to make a hasty decision," said one property industry source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reasons for doing this or not doing this are becoming less and less about real estate and more and more about politics," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3 million square foot complex comprises two towers of 28 and 34 floors overlooking the river Thames, linked by a lower-rise office containing three trading floors, the website of architects Adamson Associates shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision rests squarely on the shoulders of Dimon, who steered his bank away from the big sub-prime losses of many rivals, picking up failed banks Washington Mutual, Wachovia and Bear Stearns at knock-down prices on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost considerations will play an overriding role in the decision. But the sources said the lender may also decide to axe or scale down the plan to sweeten regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has already repaid the $25 billion of taxpayer rescue funds it received during the crisis, but the shock fraud probe on powerhouse Goldman Sachs has shown even the strongest banks are not immune from regulatory attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like it will be a political decision -- can you really spend almost 2 billion pounds ($2.87 billion) with everything else that's going on?," another source in the property industry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCHEME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan signed a deal with Canary Wharf Group (CWG), the operators of the eponymous business district, in late 2008, part of a long-held ambition to consolidate its scattered London workforce in one corporate-branded complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank bought the site of the prospective new offices at Canary Wharf Riverside for 237 million pounds and appointed CWG as development and construction manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has agreed to cover the costs for completed infrastructure, design and planning works and pay CWG 76 million pounds representing a portion of developer profits on the scheme if it postpones or scraps the development altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to work on the design, planning, piling, raft construction and further infrastructure works for Riverside South... Advanced construction is pending a decision by JP Morgan," a CWG spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With politicians on a mission to show voters they are getting tough on banks, industry sources suggest the public profile of the bank could suffer if the building goes ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon faced a double bind at the bank's shareholder meeting this week from homeowners whose properties Chase is foreclosing, and investors who want dividends raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources described the bank's former European investment banking head Bill Winters as a key champion of the Canary Wharf move, but say enthusiasm has waned since he left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Property market sources said JPMorgan may be tempted to swap the massive attention-grabbing spend on the Riverside South building for a cheaper letting deal at one of several office developments planned in or close to the City of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not inconceivable that they stay in the City ... one property source said. "CWG could be willing to cut a deal if it becomes clear the Riverside South plan is incompatible with a crackdown on banks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.6959 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Douwe Miedema; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(See www.reutersrealestate.com for the global service for real estate professionals from Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

skyscrapers in a nod to the war on banking extravagance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S bank is dragging its heels on the glamorous plan,
fearing it could rile regulators determined to bring mega-banks
considered "too big to fail" under tighter control, sources in
the banking and property industries said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a massive dilemma for them. They need new space to
grow but they don't want to make a hasty decision," said one
property industry source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The reasons for doing this or not doing this are becoming
less and less about real estate and more and more about
politics," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 3 million square foot complex comprises two towers of 28
and 34 floors overlooking the river Thames, linked by a
lower-rise office containing three trading floors, the website
of architects Adamson Associates shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision rests squarely on the shoulders of Dimon, who
steered his bank away from the big sub-prime losses of many
rivals, picking up failed banks Washington Mutual, Wachovia and
Bear Stearns at knock-down prices on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cost considerations will play an overriding role in the
decision. But the sources said the lender may also decide to axe
or scale down the plan to sweeten regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has already repaid the $25 billion of taxpayer
rescue funds it received during the crisis, but the shock fraud
probe on powerhouse Goldman Sachs has shown even the strongest
banks are not immune from regulatory attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It looks like it will be a political decision -- can you
really spend almost 2 billion pounds ($2.87 billion) with
everything else that's going on?," another source in the
property industry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCHEME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan signed a deal with Canary Wharf Group (CWG), the
operators of the eponymous business district, in late 2008, part
of a long-held ambition to consolidate its scattered London
workforce in one corporate-branded complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank bought the site of the prospective new offices at
Canary Wharf Riverside for 237 million pounds and appointed CWG
as development and construction manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has agreed to cover the costs for completed
infrastructure, design and planning works and pay CWG 76 million
pounds representing a portion of developer profits on the scheme
if it postpones or scraps the development altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to work on the design, planning, piling, raft
construction and further infrastructure works for Riverside
South... Advanced construction is pending a decision by JP
Morgan," a CWG spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With politicians on a mission to show voters they are
getting tough on banks, industry sources suggest the public
profile of the bank could suffer if the building goes ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon faced a double bind at the bank's shareholder meeting
this week from homeowners whose properties Chase is foreclosing,
and investors who want dividends raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources described the bank's former European investment
banking head Bill Winters as a key champion of the Canary Wharf
move, but say enthusiasm has waned since he left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Property market sources said JPMorgan may be tempted to swap
the massive attention-grabbing spend on the Riverside South
building for a cheaper letting deal at one of several office
developments planned in or close to the City of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's not inconceivable that they stay in the City ... one
property source said. "CWG could be willing to cut a deal if it
becomes clear the Riverside South plan is incompatible with a
crackdown on banks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.6959 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Douwe Miedema; Editing by David

&lt;p&gt;Many NFPs standardizing on Microsoft Dynamics ERP and CRM for membership
management, financial reporting and grant management infrastructure strongly
considering cloud computing
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The Not for Profit Solution Center, a network of Microsoft Dynamics partners,
today announced that Microsoft`s cloud computing strategy for ERP and CRM
solutions will be a featured topic at the NGO Connection Day on May 25 in
Manhattan. The NGO Connection Day will be a unique opportunity for not for
profit (NFP) executive, financial and IT professionals to get their questions
answered about cloud computing and if it`s the best approach for them to take
when deploying Microsoft Dynamics ERP and CRM solutions. It`s generally accepted
in the NFP arena that Microsoft Dynamics ERP and CRM solutions provide the
necessary infrastructure critical for membership management, financial reporting
and grant management required of NFPs. 

Stan Freck, Microsoft Director of Cloud Computing for the US Public Sector
markets and keynote speaker at the NGO Connection Day, said that there are many
benefits to NFPs in utilizing cloud computing. 

"NFPs can take advantage of the deep investment Microsoft has made in cloud
computing at a very inexpensive price while avoiding many barriers to entry.
This frees them up to focus on their mission and service," he said. "For
example, with cloud computing, NFPs will always have the latest version of
Dynamics at their disposal, security concerns addressed, and access to support
from their partner and Microsoft at very compelling pricing." 

Freck said that his presentation will help NFPs determine the level of
investment in cloud computing they should consider, what the trade offs and
risks are, and how legacy systems factor into their decision. 

The NFP Solution Center is comprised of leading Microsoft partners that have
expertise in bringing ERP and CRM products and services to NFPs. Many of these
partners have been supporting NFPs for decades. One such partner is AVF
Consulting. AVF Consulting offers a wide range of technology solutions for not
for profits and is the leading Serenic Navigator reseller in the U.S. Serenic
Navigator is a top Microsoft Dynamics-based not for profit accounting software
platform for automating, improving, and streamlining NFP processes. AVF clients
include The Salvation Army, AED-ARTS, Habitat for Humanity, International
Planned Parenthood, Gifts in Kind International, and Pact World. 

"Cloud computing allows trusted, reliable access to technology that might
otherwise take up a nonprofit`s resources," says Andrew Fass, CEO of AVF
Consulting. "Traditionally, an organization needed to have IT resources to
manage the software and hardware associated with their ERP system. Cloud
computing creates a strong ROI factor in that it eliminates the need for a
nonprofit to become experts in ERP technology. Instead, they can focus their
resources on the nonprofit`s core mission." 

Lisa Malone, Microsoft Partner Account Manager and NFP Solution Center Manager,
has seen how NFPs have gravitated to Microsoft technologies for the past decade.


"The interest in utilizing Dynamics ERP and CRM solutions via cloud computing to
improve membership management, implement accurate and timely reporting methods,
and improve access to data makes a lot of sense for small to mid-sized NFPs as
it relates to cost controls, usability, and service levels," she said. "At the
NGO Connection Day, NFP executives will have a great opportunity to learn about
everything related to cloud computing and determine if it`s the right approach
for them to take when deploying Dynamics solutions." 

About NGO Connection Days

The NGO Connection Days, held in conjunction with the Microsoft Community
Affairs organization, will bring top NFP executive, IT and financial leadership
together to learn about and discuss the critical organizational issues facing
them today. To register for the NGO Connection Day events and to learn more

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Credit card network Visa Inc said it was disappointed with an amendment that was passed along with the U.S. Senate financial regulation bill late on Thursday that would limit interchange fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fees are a major source of revenue for banks and, indirectly, for payments networks Visa and MasterCard Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amendment was proposed by U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, last week. It allows retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp to shift their cost for accepting debit cards onto the backs of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Written and backed by lobbyists representing the nation's largest retailers, the Durbin Amendment could significantly harm consumers," Visa said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 19, Visa Chief Executive Officer Joseph Saunders visited lawmakers in Washington, DC, in an attempt to forestall legislation that would restrict debit card fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate approved a sweeping Wall Street reform bill on Thursday night, capping months of wrangling over the biggest overhaul of financial regulation since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa shares, which have fallen about 22 percent over the last month, closed down about 0.2 percent at $72.82 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   * Family Dollar to see 400 bps jump in comp sales&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says longer hours, more advertising etc helping May 21
(Reuters) - JP Morgan upgraded Family Dollar Stores (FDO.N) to
"overweight" from "neutral," saying the discount chain
operator's efforts like longer store hours, space reallignment
and more advertising are going to help it drive sales in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Charles Grom said the dollar arena will continue to
take share from the likes of Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) and other
grocers, as they provide a better assortment and more
convenient shopping experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Family Dollar sells most of its merchandise for $10 and
less and typically draws shoppers with household incomes of
$40,000 or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Over the past few months, the 'stickiness' of dollar
stores has been above our expectations as shoppers have
elevated the importance of convenience to their retail
destination decision," analyst Grom wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Generally speaking, we think the easier/quicker/more
efficient shopping experience is trumping modestly lower price
points at Wal-Mart, allowing for the dollar stores to gain
material market share," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family Dollar shares were trading up a percent at $40.53
Friday before the bell. They had closed at $40.24 Thursday on
the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; * Visa says amendment could harm consumers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says amendment will restrict interchange fees (Adds
details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 21 (Reuters) - Credit card network Visa Inc (V.N) said
it was disapointed with an amendment that was passed along with
the U.S. Senate financial regulation bill late on Thursday that
would limit interchange fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fees are a major source of revenue for banks and,
indirectly, for payments networks Visa and MasterCard Inc
(MA.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The amendment was proposed by U.S. Senator Richard Durbin,
an Illinois Democrat, last week. It allows retailers like
Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) to shift
their cost for accepting debit cards onto the backs of
consumers. [ID:nN20220779]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Written and backed by lobbyists representing the nation's
largest retailers, the Durbin Amendment could significantly
harm consumers," Visa said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On May 19, Visa Chief Executive Officer Joseph Saunders
visited lawmakers in Washington, DC, in an attempt to forestall
legislation that would restrict debit card fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Senate approved a sweeping Wall Street reform bill
on Thursday night, capping months of wrangling over the biggest
overhaul of financial regulation since the 1930s.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft revealed on Monday two open source projects intended to improve interoperability with Microsoft Outlook files and even enable easier migrations from Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects include tools to make it easier for developers to read and write data out of Microsoft Outlook Personal Folders (.pst) files. These files store email, contacts, attachments, and other data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ See InfoWorld's report on a  Google Apps sync tool for Outlook that has gotten poor reviews thus  far. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available under an Apache license at Microsoft's CodePlex open source projects site, projects include a .pst Data Structure Tool and a .pst File Format SDK. Developers can use the tools in conjunction with .pst file format documentation released earlier this year and available at Microsoft's Website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data structure tool gives developers a visual representation of data in the .pst file, said Paul Lorimer, group manager for interoperability in the Microsoft Office group. "[The tool] lets you visually navigate through the different levels of hierarchy," to understand where data is stored in a .pst file, Lorimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SDK, he said, "is a cross-platform library of code that can read all of the data out of a .pst file," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers can use the tools to build solutions like a photo extraction application, an archive search application, or software to upload data to a computing cloud. But they could also use them to migrate Outlook data to a competitor's system, said Lorimer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've heard from our users that they're concerned about getting locked in to Microsoft applications, and this is really just a path" to provide access, transparency, and interoperability, Lorimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it makes our customers happier that we're providing transparency and that they're not locked in," Lorimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope that we're producing better software and people will choose to use our products" rather than migrate to a rival platform, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to release of the tools and documentation, developers could access data stored in the .pst file format using MAPI (Messaging API) and Outlook Object Model. But Outlook had to be installed on the client. The tools remove the need for Outlook to be installed on a desktop in order to access .pst files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about privacy concerns of applications that access email, Lorimer said users must choose to offer access to their .pst file. "We've heard from our users and our competitors that it's important to be able to access data in the .pst file so that the data is not locked into Outlook," Lorimer said. nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article, "Microsoft eases access to Outlook data," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded seven classes from J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Corp., Series 2006-FL2, reflecting Fitch's base case loss
expectation of 10.9% for the pooled classes. Fitch's performance expectation
incorporates prospective views regarding commercial real estate market value and
cash flow declines. The Negative Rating Outlooks reflect additional sensitivity
analysis related to further negative credit migration of the underlying
collateral. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this
release. 

Under Fitch's methodology, approximately 51.8% of the pool is expected to
default in the base case stress scenario, defined as the 'B' stress. In this
scenario, the average cash flow decline is 13.8% from fourth quarter 2009 cash
flows. In its review, Fitch analyzed servicer reported operating statements and
rent rolls, updated property valuations, and recent lease and sales comparisons.
Given that the loan positions within the pooled portion of the CMBS are the
lower leveraged A-notes (average base case LTV of 108.7%), Fitch estimates the
average recoveries on the pooled loans will be approximately 78.9% in the base
case. The defaults are determined considering the total leverage of each asset,
including additional B-notes and mezzanine debt, however, a default may not
result in a loss to the pooled portion given its lower leverage position. The
base case term and refinance DSCR for the pooled A-notes is 2.09x and 1.53x,
respectively. 

The transaction is collateralized by nine loans, four of which are secured by
office properties (47.7%), four secured by hotels (35.4%), and one loan secured
by a retail property (16.9%). All of the final extension options on the loans
are within the next five years and are as follows: 30.2% in 2011, 2.8% in 2012,
and 67.0% in 2013. 

Fitch identified one Loan of Concern within the pool, Menlo Oaks Corporate
Center (7.3%), which is specially serviced. In addition, Fitch's analysis
resulted in loss expectations for two loans in the 'B' stress scenario. The two
contributors to losses (by unpaid principal balance) in the 'B' stress scenario
are Menlo Oaks Corporate Center (83.7%) and Marina Village (13.6%). The two
junior non-pooled component classes linked to the Lehigh Valley loan survive
their base case stress resulting in no defaults and no losses. 

The largest contributor to loss under the 'B' stress, the Menlo Oaks Corporate
Center loan, is secured by a class 'B', office park totaling 374,139 sf located
in Silicon Valley in the city of Menlo Park, California. At issuance, major
tenants at the property consisted of E*Trade Financial (42% of NRA), IBM
(16.2%), Access Intelligence (4.8%), and FBI/US Government (4.6%). The E*Trade
and IBM leases, which combined accounted for 217,524 sf (58.2% of NRA) had lease
expiration dates in August 2010 and March 2010, respectively. Due to the
rollover risk associated with the two leases, the loan was structured so that a
cash management agreement and leasing cost reserve would become effective if the
loan extended past its original two year term. The loan transferred to the
special servicer in October 2009, following the loan's inability to extend at
its maturity in September 2009. Also, the borrower requested to amend the loan's
rollover reserve requirements associated with the E*Trade space. E*Trade has
renewed 76,010 sf of the 157,026 sf they occupy at rent with the submarket but
significantly below rates negotiated between years 1998 and 2000, when the
submarket was booming. As a result rental revenue from E*Trade has significantly
declined. The loan is still with the special servicer who is contemplating a
modification to the leasing cost reserve requirements. IBM (16.2%) vacated its
premises at its lease expiration of March 2010, reducing occupancy to 53.9% from
70.1%. In addition, given that E*Trade is renewing only 76,010 sf of its 157,026
sf, unless new tenants are signed on at the property, occupancy is expected to
decline to approximately 32.2%. 

The second largest contributor to loss under the 'B' stress, the Marina Village
loan, is collateralized by 34 office buildings totaling 1,162,319 sf on 73
acres, located in a 205-acre master-planned development located in Alameda,
California, within the San Francisco Bay Area. The property consists of low-rise
and mid-rise office buildings (collateral), a shopping center, a hotel, 178-unit
residential town-home community, and open space along the waterfront (with a
990-berth marina). As of September 2009, the occupancy at the property was
69.4%, a significant drop since issuance when occupancy was 79.6%. Average
rental rate at the property was approximately $22.92 psf including
reimbursements, compared to $24.22 psf at issuance. 

The transaction follows a pro-rata pay structure which may revert to sequential
pay under two conditions: a) specially serviced assets in the deal account for
more than 20% of the outstanding deal balance, or b) 80% of the original pool
balance has been paid down. In addition, any principal distribution received
from a loan in special servicing will be applied sequentially. Also, the
transaction is structured so principal disbursements and interest from the
underlying mortgages are combined into one account which then is used for
principal and interest distributions to the bonds. The pro-rata nature of the
transaction combined with the commingling of principal and interest remittances
have resulted in interest shortfalls, stemming from servicing fees, to result in
a principal loss to the junior-most class L. The principal loss is recoverable
in future periods, similarly to an interest shortfall, if excess interest
becomes available. Since the principal loss may be recovered, class L was
assigned a rating of 'C' instead of 'D'. 

Fitch removed the following classes from Rating Watch Negative and has
downgraded, assigned Rating Outlooks, Loss Severity (LS) Ratings, and Recovery
Ratings (RR), as indicated to the pooled classes: 

--$21.9 million class E to 'A/LS5' from 'A+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$21.9 million class F to 'BBB/LS5' from 'A'; Outlook Negative; 

--$19.4 million class G to 'BB/RR1' from 'A-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$24.3 million class H to 'CCC/RR4' from 'BBB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$24.3 million class J to 'CC/RR6' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$21.9 million class K to 'CC/RR6' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$29 million class L to 'C/RR6' from 'BB'; Outlook Negative. 

In addition, Fitch removes from Rating Watch Negative and has affirmed the
following classes, assigns Rating Outlooks, and LS Ratings as indicated to the
pooled classes: 

--$285.5 million class A-1 at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable; 

--$298.3 million class A-2 at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable; 

--$58.5 million class B at 'AA+/LS5'; Outlook Stable; 

--$53.6 million class C at 'AA/LS5'; Outlook Stable; 

--$19.4 million class D at 'AA-/LS5'; Outlook Negative. 

Additionally, Fitch has removed from Rating Watch Negative and has affirmed, and
assigned Recovery Ratings to the following junior non-pooled component classes: 

--$7.4 million class LV-1 at 'BB+'; Outlook Stable; 

--$2.6 million class LV-2 at 'BB'; Outlook Stable. 

In addition, Fitch has affirmed the following class and revised the Rating
Outlook as indicated: 

--Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook to Stable from Negative. 

Class X1 has paid in full. 

This transaction was analyzed according to the 'Surveillance Criteria for U.S.
Commercial Real Estate Loan CDOs'. It applies stresses to property cash flows
and uses debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) tests to project future default
levels for the underlying portfolio. Recoveries are based on stressed cash flows
and Fitch's long-term capitalization rates. This methodology was used to review
this transaction as floating-rate CMBS loan pools are concentrated and similar
in composition to CREL CDO pools. In many cases, the CMBS notes are senior
portions of notes held in CDO transactions. The assets are generally
transitional in nature, frequently underwritten with pro forma income
assumptions that have not materialized as expected. Overrides to this
methodology were applied on a loan-by-loan basis if the senior position of the
CMBS note or property specific performance warranted an alternative analysis. 

For bonds rated 'B-' or better, the current credit enhancement levels were
compared to the expected losses generated in each rating category divided by the
total deal size. These classes were assigned Loss Severity (LS) ratings, which
indicate each tranche's potential loss severity given default, as evidenced by
the ratio of tranche size to the expected loss for the collateral under the 'B'
stress. LS ratings should always be considered in conjunction with probability
of default indicated by a class' long-term credit rating. Fitch does not assign
Rating Outlooks or LS ratings to classes rated 'CCC' or lower. 

Rating Outlooks were determined by further stressing the cash flows and fully
recognizing all maturity defaults in all ratings stresses. The credit
enhancements were then compared to the expected losses generated in each rating
category to determine potential credit migration over the next two years. If the
Rating Outlook scenario would imply a lower rating, then the class was assigned
a Negative Outlook. 

The ratings for bonds rated 'CCC' or lower, are based on a deterministic
analysis. Bonds are rated 'C' when the expected losses on currently defaulted
loans exceed a classes' respective credit enhancement level. Bonds are rated
'CC' when the combined base case expected losses on the currently defaulted
loans and loans likely to default exceed a classes' respective credit
enhancement level. Bonds are rated 'CCC' when the base case expected loss
exceeds a classes' respective credit enhancement level. 

Bonds rated 'CCC' and below were assigned Recovery Ratings (RR) in order to
provide a forward-looking estimate of recoveries on currently distressed or
defaulted structured finance securities. Recovery Ratings are calculated by
subtracting the base case expected losses in reverse sequential order from the
pooled certificates. Any principal recoveries first pay interest shortfalls on
the bonds and then sequentially through the classes. The remaining bond
principal amount is divided by the current outstanding bond balance. The
resulting percentage is used to assign the Recovery Ratings on the bonds. 

The assignment of 'RR4' to class H reflects modeled recoveries of 34.4% of its
outstanding balance. The expected recovery proceeds are broken down as follows: 

--Present value of expected principal recoveries ($8.2 million); 

--Present value of expected interest payments ($59,025); 

--Total present value of recoveries ($8.3 million); 

--Sum of undiscounted recoveries ($9.2 million). 

Classes are assigned a Recovery Rating of 'RR6' when the present value of the
recoveries in each case is less than 10% of each class' principal balance. 

These rating actions reflect the application of Fitch's current criteria which
are available at 'www.fitchratings.com' and specifically include the following
reports: 

--'Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria' (Sept. 30, 2009); 

--'Surveillance Criteria for U.S. Commercial Real Estate Loan CDOs' (Nov. 9,

&lt;p&gt;Chevron`s Hewitt Pate Issues False Statements Ahead of Wednesday Shareholder
Meeting
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Chevron`s chief lawyer, Hewitt Pate, is putting out false statements to lay the
groundwork for the oil giant to avoid paying a potential $27.3 billion judgment
for contaminating the Ecuadorian rainforest ahead of the annual shareholder
meeting Wednesday, representatives of the indigenous and farmer communities
suing Chevron said today. 

The quantity of oil waste dumped by Chevron in Ecuador`s Amazon from 1964 to
1990 far exceeds the size of the tragic BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico,
according to experts. Unlike the Gulf spill, which was an accident, Chevron`s
disaster in Ecuador was the result of deliberate production decisions designed
to cut costs over a period of two decades, according to the lawsuit. 

"Chevron`s charges are old news designed to distract shareholders from the
obvious mistakes management has made," said Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the
Amazon Defense Coalition, the group suing the company in Ecuador. 

"Hewitt Pate`s reckless and false statements are designed to cover up Chevron`s
responsibility for creating an environmental and public health catastrophe in
the rainforest," added Hinton. "By his actions, Pate may be exposing Chevron to
additional liability." 

Among Chevron`s inaccurate and misleading statements today:

* Chevron misrepresentation: Plaintiffs inappropriately provided information to
Cabrera.
Fact: It was appropriate for the parties to furnish information toCabrera.
Cabrera solicited information from both parties, in accordance with his
court-ordered mandate to provide the best possible estimate of the damage caused
to the region. While the plaintiffs complied with Cabrera`s information
requests, Chevron chose not to participate. 
* Chevron misrepresentation: Chevron has uncovered "new evidence" that
plaintiffs submitted documents to the court expert.
Fact: Chevron has not "uncovered" any new evidence. Contrary to its statements,
Cabrera requested information from both parties in compliance with various court
orders. In fact, court records indicate Chevron knew all along that plaintiffs
had submitted documents to Cabrera. 
* Chevron misrepresentation: Sections of Cabrera`s report are tied directly to
Plaintiffs.
Fact: It is completely appropriate for experts in Ecuador to adopt materials
submitted by the parties. Several court experts in the Ecuador trial have
adopted Chevron`s materials in their reports, while others have adopted
materials provided by the plaintiffs. This is also standard practice in the U.S.
and in courts around the world.

Chevron has admitted in trial to dumping 15.8 billion gallons of toxic "produced
water" directly into the rainforest, abandoning more than 900 unlined waste pits
filled with toxic oil sludge, and burning millions of cubic meters of poisonous
gases with no controls. The company did this deliberately to cut costs, say the
plaintiffs, producing a humanitarian and public relations catastrophe. 

Since evidence at trial has indisputably shown Chevron is responsible for
extensive contamination, the company has done everything within its power to
attack the judicial process as its last hope of evading liability, said Hinton. 

Chevron`s liability in Ecuador has long been an overhang on the company`s stock
price and has dominated recent annual shareholder meetings. At the company`s
2009 annual meeting, management suffered a major "no confidence" vote as three
separate shareholder resolutions led to more than $37 billion in shares to
upbraid the company over the Ecuador problem. 

Another shareholder vote rebuking Chevron`s management over Ecuador is expected
this Wednesday, said Hinton. 

"Chevron`s shareholders should not be fed more false statements by Pate or any
other member of company management," said Hinton.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Big Banks Boost Industry Profit

Following the dreadful phase of the economic downturn, the banking industry`s
profits soared during the first quarter of 2010. However, this was primarily led
by the big banks, while small banks remained strained due to deteriorating
credit conditions. 

According to the quarterly banking industry report released by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) on Thursday, the industry made an $18 billion
profit, a record since the financial crisis in 2008. 

This improvement in the industry data reflects near-zero interest rates and
lower reserves for losses. As a result, more than half of the industry
participants reported improvements over the prior-year period. 

Though the profit for the reported remained historically weak, it jumped from
$5.6 billion in the year-ago period. 

The biggest banks (with at least $10 billion of assets) have earned nearly 79%
of the industry's total first-quarter profit. These banks together earned $14.2
billion during the reported quarter, almost double compared with the year-ago
period. However, profit for small banks (with less than $1 billion in assets)
increased only 16%. 

The big banks include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:
GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:
C). 

Big banks enjoyed significantly lower funding cost compared to two years ago.
According to FDIC, funding cost was at its lowest since 1984. 

Now the question to ponder is whether this impressive industry data can be
viewed as a significant step up for the industry. Probably, the answer would be
`No`. The banking industry as a whole is not yet out of the woods as tumbling
home prices, soaring loan defaults and a high unemployment rate continue to take
their toll on small banks.

&lt;p&gt;IBM CEO Sam Palmisano said in a meeting with investors earlier this month that his company plans to spend $20 billion on acquisitions over the next five years. IBM announced Monday its first billion-dollar deal of 2010, acquiring Sterling Commerce from ATT for $1.4 billion in cash.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech MA deals of 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If IBM makes good on its plans to spend $20 million on takeovers between 2010 and 2015, it will represent a more accelerated acquisition pace than IBM has maintained since Palmisano took the CEO position in March 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has spent roughly $14 billion to acquire 70 companies since 2002, according to a presentation by Mark Loughridge, IBM's senior vice president and CFO. Nearly half of those deals were inked in the last three years. From 2007 to 2009, IBM acquired 33 companies for $9 billion, with investments concentrated in business analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sterling deal ranks among IBM's largest in recent years. IBM spent $1.2 billion to acquire analytics player SPSS last year, and in 2007 it offered $5 billion to acquire Cognos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of the companies Big Blue has acquired so far in 2010, beginning with the most recent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling Commerce: IBM is paying $1.4 billion in cash to acquire Sterling Commerce, an ATT company that makes business-to-business e-commerce software designed to help companies connect with the systems of their customers, partners and suppliers.

Intelliden's automation tools can track changes made to network devices such as hubs, routers and switches and ensure those changes won't negatively impact the IT environment -- a capability that's crucial as data centers adopt virtualization and cloud-based services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initiate Systems: Master data management vendor Initiate Systems was picked up by IBM on Feb. 3 for an undisclosed amount. MDM software is designed to ensure consistency of data, such as customer and product information, that's recorded in multiple systems and applications within a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Interest Security Company: IBM added public sector consulting expertise to its ranks with the Jan. 20 acquisition of National Interest Security Company.

&lt;p&gt;IBM is buying ATT subsidiary Sterling Commerce, maker of business-to-business data integration software, for about US $1.4 billion in cash, the companies announced Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pending acquisition will bolster IBM's already burgeoning portfolio of data management software. Sterling Commerce's capabilities, combined with IBM's own middleware and analytics products, will help companies respond more nimbly to sudden business challenges," IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling Commerce's platform helps companies exchange documents and other information, as well as tie together business processes. The company competes with the likes of GXS, Inovis and Axway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is buying market share as well as technology. Sterling Commerce counts about 18,000 customers in the financial services, retail, manufacturing and other industries, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 2,500 Sterling Commerce employees will join IBM's WebSphere division after the deal's close, according to a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition is IBM's 57th since 2003, and follows its recent move to purchase application integration vendor Cast Iron Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sterling deal was "not a very well-kept secret" in industry circles, with rumors floating around for quite some time, according to Forrester Research analyst Ken Vollmer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling Commerce is "a solid number two" after GXS in the B2B service provider space, Vollmer said. There could be additional acquisition activity in the market during the next couple of months, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM chose Sterling based on business results and customer satisfaction levels relative to rivals in the market, said Craig Hayman , general manager of WebSphere, during a conference call Monday. "The difference was not trivial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling is itself the product of some consolidation, having purchased supply chain application vendor Yantra in 2005 and Nistevo, maker of transportation management software, in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the pending deal, IBM is making a fresh run at the B2B service space, having sold off related businessesto GXS in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Blue's move to buy Sterling Commerce reflects the fact that vendors need dedicated B2B capabilities when trying to serve large customers, Vollmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies bring respective strengths to the table, Altimeter Group analyst Ray Wang  said in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "[Sterling] built a reputation connecting businesses with their trading community of suppliers, customers, banks and transportation providers. IBM built a strong platform for inter-enterprise integration and SOA governance," he wrote. "Should the acquisition succeed, customers will gain integration across business networks and improve decision making through richer integration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM intends to bring together Sterling's technology with its own "in a way that supports what the Sterling customer set and the IBM customer set wants to do," Hayman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) plans to buy Sterling Commerce from ATT Inc (T.N) for about $1.4 billion in cash to expand its portfolio of software for companies in financial services, manufacturing and retail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
ACM SIGGRAPH announces the selection of Jim Morris, General Manager and
Executive Vice President of Production at Pixar Animation Studios, to give one
of the keynote presentations at SIGGRAPH 2010, the 37th International Conference
and Exhibition on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques. 

At Pixar since 2005, Morris has worked as a producer and production executive in
the motion picture industry for more than 23 years. As part of Pixar`s executive
team, he has served as production executive on many of Pixar`s most successful
films including "Ratatouille," "Up," and the upcoming "Toy Story 3." In 2009, he
produced Disney&#8226;Pixar`s highly acclaimed, "WALL&#8226;E," which won the Oscar for Best
Animated Feature and garnered him the Producer of the Year Award in Animated
Theatrical Motion Pictures from the Producer`s Guild of America. He is currently
producing Disney`s much anticipated "John Carter of Mars," which is scheduled
for release in 2012. 

"As an industry leader and visionary, Jim`s keynote will be one of many `can`t
miss` moments of SIGGRAPH 2010," said Terrence Masson, SIGGRAPH 2010 Conference
Chair from Northeastern University. "His contributions over the years have moved
the industry forward in ways we never imagined. His impact will be felt for
decades to come. With his breadth and depth of experiences, he truly is the
epitome of this year`s underlying focus of the `People Behind the Pixels.`" 

Prior to Pixar, Morris worked for Lucasfilm and its divisions for 17 years. He
served as president of Lucas Digital Ltd. for 11 years, where he was responsible
for Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), Lucasfilm Animation, and Skywalker Sound. At
that time, Morris served as ILM's general manager, where he supervised a staff
of more than 1,400 artists and technicians, and guided the largest visual
effects facility in the entertainment industry. Under Morris` leadership, ILM
created the groundbreaking and Academy Award-winning visual effects seen in
"Jurassic Park," "Death Becomes Her," "Forrest Gump," and more than 150 other
films. 

Morris had previously supervised all of ILM`s production, including "Terminator
2: Judgment Day," which won an Oscar for Best Achievement in Visual Effects,
"Hook," "Star Trek VI," "The Rocketeer," "Backdraft," "Die Hard 2," and dozens
of other successful film projects. 

Morris first joined ILM in 1987 as a producer of visual effects for films and
commercials. Among other films, Morris produced effects for James Cameron`s "The
Abyss,"which also earned an Academy Award for Best Achievement in Visual
Effects, and Steven Spielberg`s "Always." 

Morris earned a B.S. degree in film from the Newhouse School, Syracuse
University, and holds a M.S. in television and radio from the same institution.
He has served as president of the San Francisco Film Commission and was the
founding chair of the Visual Effects Society (VES). Morris is a member of the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Producers Guild.

&lt;p&gt; * Company claims expert violated his legal duties&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Ruling on potential $27 billion case expected this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES May 24 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which
is in the throes of a multibillion-dollar pollution lawsuit in
Ecuador, has requested courts there disregard an environmental
expert who has said the company should pay $27 billion in
damages for polluting the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a filing to the Lago Agrio court last Friday, Chevron
said it was seeking the dismissal of geologist Richard Cabrera
as an appointee and the rejection of his work in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cabrera has said Chevron should pay $27 billion in
compensation for environmental damage stemming from oil
pollution in the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit contends that Texaco, which Chevron bought in
2001, polluted the jungle and damaged the health of local
residents by dumping 18 billion gallons (68 billion liters) of
contaminated water from 1972 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which has been snarled in a legal fight for 17
years, has said the claim against it is without merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a copy of the court filing given to Reuters by Chevron,
the company says Cabrera had had ongoing contact with
plaintiffs' representatives and that he based a large part of
his report on material provided by them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron claims Cabrera violated his legal duties by working
directly with the plaintiffs' lawyers and consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This direct evidence of fraud and ex parte contacts
further demonstrates the illegitimacy of the fictitious $27
billion number the plaintiffs' lawyers have created for the
purpose of extracting money from Chevron and its shareholders,"
said Chevron vice president and general counsel Hewitt Pate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The argument about Cabrera not being independent is one
Chevron has made before, most notably when he revised his
damage estimate to $27 billion in 2008.

determine if patents have been infringed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lower courts had found that the date-picker tool in
Microsoft's Outlook calendar infringed a patent held by French
telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (ALUA.PA).
The companies have an unresolved fight over damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its appeal, Microsoft argued that a patent could be held
invalid if evidence is presented in a court case that was not
available at the time the patent was granted. It also said that
the standard for invalidating a patent should be a
"preponderance" of evidence, rather than "clear and convincing"
evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the high court declined to take the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In September 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit overturned a $358 million damage award against
Microsoft saying that Microsoft did infringe Alcatel-Lucent's
patent but that the damages were not justified and the case
must be retried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alcatel said it was happy about the Supreme Court's
decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are pleased, but not surprised, that the Supreme Court
rejected Microsoft's appeal in this case and left intact the
jury decision in the federal appeals court that our Day patent
is valid and that Microsoft infringes it," said spokeswoman
Mary Ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We look forward to the upcoming trial in San Diego
district court to determine the compensation to which
Alcatel-Lucent is entitled based on Microsoft's infringement,"
she said in an emailed statement. That trial opens Dec. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Justice John Roberts did not participate in the
decision to decline to hear the Microsoft appeal. He had
represented states in an antitrust lawsuit against the software
giant that is still pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declined comment on the decision.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), focusing on constitutional law,
said today it is preparing to file a federal lawsuit against a New York school
that once again suspended a 13-year-old student for wearing a Rosary to school.
Raymond Hosier was suspended for two days last week from Oneida Middle School in
Schenectady. When he returned to school today and displayed the Rosary, he was
suspended again. The ACLJ represents Raymond and his mother, Chantell Hosier. 

"Without question, the continuing action taken by the school district in
punishing Raymond for wearing a Rosary to school violates the constitutional
rights of our client," said Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel of the ACLJ. "Under the
law, Raymond has a First Amendment right to wear his Rosary to school. The
school district had an opportunity to take corrective action today by permitting
Raymond to wear the Rosary to school. Instead, the school district chose to
suspend Raymond again today. We're preparing to file a lawsuit in federal court
to protect the constitutional rights of our client." 

The ACLJ sent a Demand Letter yesterday to the Superintendent of the Schenectady
City School District, the Board of Education, and the Principal of Oneida Middle
School warning them that a lawsuit would be filed if they did not take
corrective action and permit Raymond to wear the Rosary to school. 

In the Demand Letter, the ACLJ asserts that Raymond's actions are
constitutionally protected: 

"Raymond has a First Amendment right to continue to wear his Rosary to school as
he has been consistently doing since September 2009," the letter states.
"Raymond's Rosary is a form of symbolic speech. The Rosary, which includes a
Crucifix, is commonly understood to be a religious symbol. Raymond wears the
Rosary to convey his faith in God. He also wears it to convey his love for his
deceased brother, who many people in the area know was killed at the age of
twelve while riding a bicycle, and to convey his love for his recently deceased
uncle." 

The ACLJ also notes that Raymond has worn his Rosary outside his shirt in school
since September 2009 to express his religious and personal views saying his
message "has never caused any material and substantial interference with the
requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school or with
the rights of other students. Under the law, Raymond has a First Amendment right
to wear his Rosary to school."

&lt;p&gt;For the second month in a row, Microsoft has tried to eradicate a mutating rootkit that has blocked some Windows users from installing security updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Microsoft Malware Prevention Center (MMPC), this month's Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) has scrubbed the Alureon rootkit from over 360,000 Windows PCs since its May 11 release. That represented 18.2% of all MSRT detections for the month, more than double the 8.3% the rootkit accounted for in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The free MSRT is updated each month as part of Microsoft's monthly Patch Tuesday, and pushed to users via the same Windows Update mechanism used to serve up security fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April's edition of MSRT, which was released April 13, also included Alureon sniffing skills. Last month, MSRT removed the rootkit from more than 260,000 Windows systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Alureon rootkit is no malware newcomer -- antivirus company Symantec identified it in October 2008 -- it first made news last February when Microsoft confirmed that the rootkit caused infected PCs to crash when users applied a patch the company issued that month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the number of crash reports grew, Microsoft stopped automatically serving the MS10-015 update. It reissued the update only after it had added a Alureon detector that made sure infected Windows machines would not receive the patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft used the Alureon detection again in April when it shipped another Windows kernel patch in the MS10-021 update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until Alureon is removed, infected systems cannot apply the MS10-015 and MS10-021 updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's not uncommon for MSRT to remove a specific piece of malware from machines for several months running, it is unusual when the number of cleaned systems climbs after Microsoft adds detection for that threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers at MMPC said the 37% increase in Alureon detections in was due to new variants of the rootkit. "There were several changes to the design of the rootkit to avoid detection and cleaning, revealing that the rootkit is still under active development and distribution," said Vishal Kapoor and Joe Johnson of the MMPC in an entry on the team's blog last Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May's edition of MSRT spotted more copies of Alureon.H than any other variant, Microsoft said. Alureon.H accounted for 43% of all versions of the rootkit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapoor and Johnson also spilled more bad news. "One of the notable changes was to infect arbitrary system drivers instead of only the hooked miniport driver," they said. "This can have negative side effects on the machine depending on the chosen driver."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some PC keyboards have gone south after an Alureon infection, they said, while other Windows XP machines must be reactivated because the rootkit's dirty work has tricked Microsoft's product activation software into thinking that the user has swapped out one or more PC parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost two-thirds (65%) of the PCs infected with Alureon this month were running Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3), with the No. 2 spot taken by Windows XP SP2 (14%). Only 3.5% of the rootkit-infected PCs were running Windows 7, said Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest version of the MSRT can be downloaded from Microsoft's site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese laptop-maker Micro-Star International (MSI) plans to launch a Windows 7 tablet PC next week at the Computex Taipei electronics show, after showing off a prototype tablet running Google's Android mobile software early this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSI is now the second major Taiwanese vendor to dump an anticipated Google-based tablet launch at Computex in favor of one with Microsoft Windows 7. Last month, Asustek's CEO said the company's first tablet PC, the Eee Pad, will run on Microsoft software instead of a Google OS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSI and Asustek both showed off tablets with Android software at the International Consumer Electronics show in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Acer, the world's second-largest PC vendor and also a Taiwanese company, last week took the unusual step of denying rumors it might launch a device with Google's new Chrome OS on board at Computex. Acer normally does not comment on rumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google appears to be having trouble convincing PC makers to use its software, which puts it in a tough position because Taiwanese manufacturers account for the bulk of the world's computers via contract manufacturing for global companies including Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and others. The island has long been a bastion for Microsoft and Intel, making Google's job harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google representatives did not return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the losses aren't just Google's. They are also losses for chip makers such as Qualcomm, Freescale Semiconductor and Nvidia, which have developed chips based on the Arm processor technology Android runs on. The Asustek and MSI tablets will both use Intel microprocessors instead of Arm-based processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computex is an important trade show for gadget makers, and unlike other electronics shows that provide a view of the distant future, Computex instead shows what gadgets will be on store shelves this year. That means the first round of new devices aimed at rivaling Apple's iPad will use Windows instead of Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The host of the trade show, Taiwan, is also the center of the computer manufacturing industry, and global technology companies often turn to Taiwanese companies with new technologies they hope to promote to the PC industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google appears to be having trouble convincing PC makers to use its software, which puts it in a tough position because Taiwanese manufacturers account for the bulk of the world's computers via contract manufacturing for global companies including Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and others. The island has long been a bastion for Microsoft and Intel, making Google's job harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asustek and MSI both said they may still release tablets with Google software later this year, but neither has said when. And last year, Qualcomm showed off an Asustek netbook with Google Android at Computex, a device Asustek then declined to talk about and put on hold. Now, it's unclear if Asustek's Google-based netbook will ever launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSI Slatebook tablet PC, which sports a 10-inch touchscreen, will debut at Computex next week and go on sale globally soon after. The company said the tablets will include built-in 3G and Wi-Fi wireless connectivity and will sport USB and HDMI ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. oil benchmark price will on average be lower than its European counterpart for "the next few years," undermining West Texas Intermediate's (WTI) status as a yardstick for global crude markets, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Front-month futures of WTI crude, priced at the U.S. mid-continent hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, where growing imports of Canadian crude are stored, settled almost $6 a barrel below North Sea Brent on May 14, the biggest discount in 15 months. The discount was at about $1.20 on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not going to be a static relationship between international crudes and mid-continent crudes, but on average, over the next few years you are going to have to see WTI priced at a discount," Lawrence Eagles, JPMorgan's managing director and global head of commodities research said at the Reuters Global Energy Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've got to see Canadian crude in particular trading at a significant discount to Gulf Coast crudes. That means WTI de facto is going to trade cheap relative to its historic norms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude had for decades commanded a premium to European and Middle Eastern supplies to attract transatlantic arbitrage cargoes and plug a deficit in the North American market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent is the benchmark for about two-thirds of the world's oil, including the eastern Atlantic basin comprising Europe and Africa. Exports of most Middle Eastern grades to the Mediterranean and trade of selected Asia-Pacific crudes are also referenced to the European marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTI reflects the specific balance between supply and demand at Cushing, detached from U.S. crudes produced along the Gulf of Mexico coast, which maintain a steadier relation to Brent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inventories at Cushing soared to 37.9 million barrels the week to May 14, government statistics from the Energy Information Administration show. Refineries in the U.S. Midwest have reduced crude intake over the past two months as they carried out spring maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genscape, which uses visible and infra-red spectrum monitoring techniques to estimate storage levels at crude tanks in Cushing, said supplies rose even further to 39.46 million barrels in the week to May 18, or 77 percent of shell capacity, which cannot be exhausted because of operational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CANADA IMPORTS SOAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As U.S. oil demand slumped over the past year and a half, U.S. imports of Canadian crude originating mainly from Alberta's oil sands jumped to about 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.5 million bpd a decade earlier, EIA data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Canadian crudes have to price themselves at a level which will encourage pipeline capacity to move crude out of the region," Eagles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By virtue of storage economics, that means that if there is surplus of Canadian heavy sours, it translates into a discount for WTI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glut has also depressed the value of prompt WTI contracts relative to later-delivery contracts, a market structure called contango. The opposite structure is known as backwardation because of progressively lower prices for contracts further out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extended refinery maintenance season in Asia and the overhang at Cushing will delay an expected flip in the market structure from contango to backwardation until July or August, JPMorgan (JPM.N) said in a report dated May 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IS WTI A VIABLE BENCHMARK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eagles says the volatility in front-month WTI does not prevent it from remaining as a marker for crude produced in the U.S. and the rest of the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Benchmarks are difficult to create. They tend to be chosen by the market, and as such, WTI still has a significant number of crudes which are priced off it," Eagles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the emphasis may gradually switch to Brent as a headline figure, he said, because news organizations tend to quote the highest price, especially at times of rising oil costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Brent has always been the more significant physical benchmark. Previously, when the price of crude was high, people always wanted to quote the highest crude benchmark and that was WTI. But if it is no longer the highest, then people will talk about Brent more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most liquid market for Brent crude futures is the ICE exchange, which centers trading of the contract in London, while for WTI it is the New York Mercantile Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As always within all these markets, volume attracts more volume, liquidity attracts more liquidity. At the moment, you wouldn't say there is any sign that WTI liquidity is shifting significantly," Eagles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ramthan Hussain)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - Danish third seed Caroline Wozniacki showed no signs of her recent injury troubles with a 6-0 6-3 demolition of Russia's Alla Kudryavsteva in the French Open first round on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Open runner-up burst out of the blocks and wrapped up the first set in just 25 minutes under the blazing sun on Court Philippe Chatrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kudryavtseva, the world number 78, stopped the rot by winning the eighth game and had the audacity to break for a 2-1 lead before Wozniacki, 19, restored order, making the decisive break in game eight for a 5-3 lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She sealed the win after an hour and nine minutes when the Russian netted a backhand service return. She now plays Germany's Kristina Barrois or Italy's Tathiana Garbin for a place in the third round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Miles Evans)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's Robbie Bach, head of its video games and mobile phones unit, is retiring in a management shuffle, as Chief Executive Steve Ballmer tightens his grip over a division steadily ceding ground to rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The departure of the 22-year veteran, credited for launching the Xbox in 2001, comes as the world's largest software maker and its mobile efforts are being brushed aside by Apple Inc's iPhone and Google Inc's Android operating system in a fast-growing, but increasingly crowded smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The positive for shareholders is that this is Steve Ballmer hitting the reset button on phones," said Toan Tran, an analyst at Morningstar, who described Microsoft's phone strategy as "complete disarray."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes months before the launch of Microsoft's new Windows Phone 7 software, which will appear in phones this holiday shopping season. "It's probably their last chance," said Tran. "Apple and Google are so far ahead now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bach -- known more as a polished marketer and manager than a tech visionary -- will retire this autumn at the age of 48. He has led the entertainment and devices unit since its creation in 2005. Microsoft tends to make big executive changes close to the end of its fiscal year on June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From July 1, the two senior vice presidents in charge of games and phones, Don Mattrick and Andy Lees, respectively, will report to CEO Ballmer, known for his energetic and abrasive management style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move replicates events at Microsoft almost two years ago, when Ballmer appointed two executives to take control of the key Windows unit after the departure of executive Kevin Johnson. The strategy paid dividends with the success of Windows 7 last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bach made no mention of a new job in a statement, saying he would be spending more time with his family and on nonprofit projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J. Allard, the entertainment and device unit's chief technology officer -- a 19-year Microsoft veteran who led the design development of the Xbox and Zune -- is also leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOBILE BATTLEGROUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entertainment and devices is the fourth-largest of Microsoft's five operating units -- behind its Windows, Office and server units -- and is on track to post more than $8 billion in revenue for the year ending June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last quarter, it contributed 11 percent of Microsoft's overall sales and 3 percent of its operating profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit developed the highly successful Xbox game system, but has so far failed to make an impact with its Zune digital music player and is losing ground in mobile and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft can't afford to be eliminated from the mobile sector, analysts say, as increasingly powerful smartphones and portable tablets like Apple's iPad are poised to dominate low-end computing. Microsoft's most recent offering -- the youth-oriented, social networking-focused Kin device -- has not been a great success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 10 percent of smartphones sold in the United States in the first three months of this year run Windows software, according to retail research firm NPD Group. That is well behind Apple with 21 percent, Google with 28 percent and BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion Ltd with 36 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, Google's Android passed Microsoft's Windows as the fourth most popular smartphone operating system in the first quarter, according to research firm Gartner, behind Apple, RIM and Nokia's Symbian system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing its problems, Microsoft announced earlier this year a completely new software system for phones called Windows Phone 7, which is scheduled to hit the market in a new range of handsets for the holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some questioned the timing of Tuesday's announcement, as Microsoft gears up to unveil Natal -- its revolutionary hands-free gaming system -- at the E3 gaming show in mid-June. The company is also launching the next installment of its blockbuster Halo game in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing is "awkward," said Mike Hickey, an analyst at Janco Partners Inc, but Microsoft's plans appear to be intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The initial worry is 'Uh oh, something is wrong'," said Hickey. "What's important from a product perspective is that all of their holiday launches are still on track -- Natal, Windows Phone 7, Halo Reach. So it doesn't look like it's a response to potential disruption in the near-term pipeline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares fell as much as 3.4 percent, but closed down less than 1 percent at $26.07. The Nasdaq also pared earlier losses to close down 0.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; additional reporting by Franklin Paul in New York; editing by Gerald E.

Stock Market Update: Pro View

Technology is leading the way today with Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) taking
charge. Apple Inc. is surging 2.81% to $249.14 +$6.82. This stock alone is
helping to carry the Nasdaq slightly higher. Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) is also
advancing nicely today with a gain of 2.81%. The stock is trading at $485.31
+$13.26. 

Aside from technology, the markets seem to be somewhat on pause and still
jittery. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S 500 are lower on the day.
The real kicker today seems to be the Euro and Dollar once again. The Euro is
having a brutal day to the downside while the U.S. Dollar is surging. This is
putting pressure on commodity stocks, and most sectors aside from technology. 

Amongst financial stocks, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) is trading lower
while Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) is flat on the day. The rest of the
financial sector is mostly lower as well.

&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Shareholders of bankrupt Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK asked a federal judge for permission to investigate JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) for its role in the failure of Washington Mutual Bank, according to court documents filed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equity committee wants information that could lead to potential claims against JPMorgan if they can show that the investment bank had a role in the bank's failure, the largest in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual Bank was seized in September 2008 during a bank run at the height of the financial panic. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp sold the bank immediately after it was seized to JPMorgan for $1.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholders are seeking to pick up where Washington Mutual left off. The holding company was locked in a battle for documents and depositions from JPMorgan when it reached a settlement now at the heart of the company's proposed reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed plan leaves nothing for shareholders and distributes around $7 billion to creditors. It also provides a range of liability releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders have estimated the company may have assets worth up to $20 billion when factoring in potential legal claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An attorney for shareholders told the judge earlier this month that there were "multibillion-dollar claims against JPMorgan for causing the bankruptcy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders focused their investigation request on what it said was an untapped source of information -- the pre-seizure business records of Washington Mutual Inc, or WMI, and its bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan took control of those documents when it bought the seized bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders said those records could contain information about JPMorgan's supposed interest in Washington Mutual Bank prior to its seizure and "intelligence about market rumors concerning WMI's financial condition that JPMC (JPMorgan) may have had a hand in generating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders made similar arguments earlier this month when they argued for a court-appointed examiner to investigate many of the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Mary Walrath denied that request because she said the bank failure had been widely investigated. However, she also said the equity committee could conduct its own investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholders also want to investigate the circumstances that led to the settlement between the company and JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment, as did Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Washington Mutual rose 2.7 percent to close at 11.3 cents in pink sheet trading on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Washington Mutual Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington), No. 08-12229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tom Hals; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Shareholder see claims for JPMorgan role in bank failure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Want to pick up investigation dropped by holding company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tom Hals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WILMINGTON, Del., May 25 (Reuters) - Shareholders of

month that there were "multibillion-dollar claims against
JPMorgan for causing the bankruptcy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders focused their investigation request on what it
said was an untapped source of information -- the pre-seizure
business records of Washington Mutual Inc, or WMI, and its
bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan took control of those documents when it bought the
seized bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders said those records could contain information
about JPMorgan's supposed interest in Washington Mutual Bank
prior to its seizure and "intelligence about market rumors
concerning WMI's financial condition that JPMC (JPMorgan) may
have had a hand in generating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders made similar arguments earlier this month when
they argued for a court-appointed examiner to investigate many

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is feeling the heat over the foray of both Apple and Google into the consumer devices market, and is expected to reshuffle the management of its mobile phones and videogames divisions, according to sources quoted by the Wall Street Journal.The iPhone, the iPad, and Android devices are becoming very popular with consumers, largely at the expense of Microsoft, which is losing customers to Apple and Google's smartphone and tablet offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Journal's report says that Microsoft will announce major organizational changes at its Entertainment  Devices Division as early as this week, especially in the Windows Phone area, where Microsoft has seen sharp declines in market share over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's entertainment and devices group is currently headed by Robert J. Bach, who was in charge of products such as the successful Xbox 360, the less successful Zune music player, and the Windows Mobile operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Apple have stolen the thunder from Microsoft in the smartphones business with the iPhone and Android. Most market statistics agree that the battle for the top spot is between Apple, Google, and BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion, despite Microsoft's latest attempts with the upcoming Windows Phone 7 OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tablet computers, whose emerging popularity has led to sales of more than one million iPads for Apple, is becoming another weak spot for Microsoft. First, the Redmond company ditched the Courier tablet concept without even showing a prototype, and then HP killed Windows off its upcoming Slate tablet, in exchange for Palm's WebOS, after purchasing the company. Dell has also opted for Android on its Streak tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear how this Microsoft shake-up would affect the company's current mobile strategy. Microsoft just introduced its new line of Kin devices, high-end feature phones aimed at teenagers; and later this year, new Windows 7 Phones are expected from both Dell and HTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co overtook IBM as the world's top server maker by sales during the first quarter as customers held off on buying equipment from IBM before new product launches, a research firm said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HP sales of business servers climbed 15.9 percent from a year earlier to $3.4 billion during the first quarter, giving the company 31.5 percent of the market.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney has resumed negotiations with financier brothers Alec and Tom Gores on a sale of Miramax after exclusive talks with Weinstein Co and billionaire financier Ron Burkle's Yucaipa have stalled, sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the situation told Reuters that exclusive talks with Hollywood producers Harvey and Bob Weinstein and Yucaipa were off for now after disputes over the control of Miramax, the studio behind films like "Pulp Fiction" and "The English Patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source said he would not rule out discussions resuming between the Weinsteins, Yucaipa and Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney was unavailable for comment. Officials for the Weinstein Co, the Gores and Yucaipa declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burkle's Yucaipa Cos, which has grocery store holdings, and Weinstein Co, run by brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, had launched a $625 million bid for Miramax, which has a library of more than 600 films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those parties entered into an exclusive negotiating window in April on the sale of Miramax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before then, sources said Disney had received a $650 million offer from embattled film executive David Bergstein, who had recently been taken to court by creditors seeking to force several of his companies into bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney also had received a $550 million offer from the firms of Alec and Tom Gores, with their brother Sam Gores, head of Paradigm Talent Agency, acting as adviser, sources said. That bid was later raised, sources said, but it was unclear by how much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sue Zeidler, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE : XOM) a publi&#233; aujourd`hui son rapport2009 sur la
citoyennet&#233; d`entreprise qui d&#233;taille les mesures visant &#224; am&#233;liorer ses
performances environnementales, &#233;conomiques et sociales, tout en fournissant
l`&#233;nergie dont le monde a besoin pour r&#233;pondre &#224; la demande mondiale croissante.

Le rapport expose comment ExxonMobil, a r&#233;duit les &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de
serre g&#233;n&#233;r&#233;es par ses op&#233;rations, fait figure de leader en mati&#232;re de s&#233;curit&#233;
et sant&#233; au travail et comment, malgr&#233; le ralentissement de la conjoncture
&#233;conomique, la soci&#233;t&#233; a investit en 2009 un montant record de plus de 27
millions de dollars en capital et en d&#233;penses d`exploration. La soci&#233;t&#233; a par
ailleurs contribu&#233; &#224; hauteur d`environ 262 milliards de dollars, soit plus de
treize fois le montant de ses b&#233;n&#233;fices, pour le d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique de
nombreux pays par l`interm&#233;diaire de paiement d`imp&#244;ts ainsi que d`achats de
biens et services. 

&#171;Relever le d&#233;fi du d&#233;veloppement durable implique que nous r&#233;pondions
efficacement aux questions environnementales, &#233;conomiques et sociales actuelles,
tout en assurant notre r&#244;le principal, qui est de trouver et fournir des sources
d`&#233;nergie fiables dont les g&#233;n&#233;rations actuelles et futures ont besoin pour
pouvoir se d&#233;velopper&#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Rex W. Tillerson, pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral.


&#171;Le ralentissement de l`&#233;conomie mondiale observ&#233; depuis le milieu de l`ann&#233;e
2008 a eu des r&#233;percussions sur la demande et sur les prix de l`&#233;nergie.
Cependant, il n`a pas eu d`impact sur la demande des pays qui connaissent une
croissance et un d&#233;veloppement rapides, ni sur les besoins des plus de 2
milliards d`individus qui n`ont pas acc&#232;s aux sources d`&#233;nergie modernes.
ExxonMobil s`engage &#224; respecter les standards les plus &#233;lev&#233;s en mati&#232;re de
citoyennet&#233; d`entreprise tout en fournissant l`&#233;nergie qui est essentielle &#224; la
croissance et au d&#233;veloppement.&#187; 

M. Tillerson a indiqu&#233; que la priorit&#233; principale d`ExxonMobil en mati&#232;re de
citoyennet&#233; d`entreprise reste son engagement pour la s&#233;curit&#233;, la sant&#233; et la
protection de l`environnement dans tous les aspects de ses op&#233;rations &#224; travers
le monde. 

&#171;Le tragique accident de la plate-forme Deepwater Horizon dans le golfe du
Mexique rappelle &#224; toute notre industrie que nous devons toujours veiller &#224; la
protection des personnes, des communaut&#233;s locales et de l`environnement&#187;, a
confi&#233; M. Tillerson. 

Le rapport d&#233;taille comment ExxonMobil :

* a r&#233;duit de 11 %, en moyenne chaque ann&#233;e depuis 2005, le taux de fr&#233;quence

atteint, pour l`ensemble de son personnel et de celui des entreprises
intervenantes. 
* a r&#233;duit &#224; 128 millions de tonnes les &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre
g&#233;n&#233;r&#233;es par ses op&#233;rations, soit une r&#233;duction de trois millions de tonnes. Ce
qui &#233;quivaut &#224; retirer environ 600 000 voitures de la circulation et r&#233;duire de
23 % le br&#251;lage &#224; la torche d`hydrocarbures des activit&#233;s
exploration/production. 
* a investi 1,3 milliard de dollars au cours des cinq derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, pour
augmenter l`efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique et r&#233;duire les &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de
serre ; 
* a am&#233;lior&#233; son efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique dans toutes ses op&#233;rations de raffinage
et de chimie, maintenant le cap pour atteindre son objectif d`am&#233;lioration de
l`efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique d`au moins 10 % entre 2002 et 2012 ; 
* n`a constat&#233; aucun d&#233;versement accidentel d`hydrocarbures en provenance des
navires p&#233;troliers exploit&#233;s ou affr&#233;t&#233;s par ExxonMobil en 2009 et a r&#233;duit de
35 % le nombre de d&#233;versements accidentels sup&#233;rieurs &#224; un baril, depuis 2005. 
* a augment&#233; de 43 % par rapport &#224; 2008, ses achats de biens et de services

Etats-Unis. Soit un montant total de 863 millions de dollars. 
* a vers&#233; 235 millions de dollars au niveau mondial &#224; des &#339;uvres caritatives
sous forme de dons d`argent, ou de fourniture de biens et de services. Ce
montant inclut 39 millions de dollars de dons de la part des salari&#233;s et
retrait&#233;s d`ExxonMobil 
* a mis en &#339;uvre divers programmes de soutien et d`incitation visant au
d&#233;veloppement socio-&#233;conomique local, commun&#233;ment appel&#233; "programmes de
d&#233;veloppement local". Au Nigeria par exemple, ExxonMobil a achet&#233; des biens et
des services &#224; des entreprises locales pour un montant total de 1,8 milliard de
dollars. 43 % de ce montant a &#233;t&#233; conserv&#233; dans le pays.

&lt;p&gt;Both IBM and Sybase have updated their lines of analytics software, optimistic of the growing market for such tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We see business analytics and information management as a strategic growth area," said Bernie Spang, director of IBM's strategy and marketing for information management. The company expects to generate US$16 billion of revenue by 2015, just from work in analytics and information management, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sybase, which SAP recently began the process of acquiring, has updated its Sybase IQ column-oriented database management software, so that it can execute queries against unstructured data, that is to say the e-mails, Web pages, word processing documents or other formats that have not been indexed in some systematic way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 70 percent of corporate information is unstructured, said Tom Traubitz, the director of Sybase IQ product marketing, who quoted an estimate from IT analyst firm Forrester. By making this information searchable as well, organizations can get a wider grasp of potential trends and trouble spots, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sybase IQ, which is widely used in data warehouses, has a number of other new features as well, Traubitz said. It can support federation search, that is to say it can search for information across multiple databases, even other non-Sybase relational databases, such as Microsoft's SQL Server and IBM's DB2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This version of the software has a range of new application programmer interfaces to allow programs written in new Web-oriented languages, such as Perl, Python, PHP and others, to access Sybase IQ directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software will be available in June, Traubitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has also been beefing up its capabilities in analytics. The company has announced that it plans to incorporate into its analytics service offerings the Hadoop, an open source framework for breaking a search across multiple nodes and reassembling the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM package of Hadoop will be called InfoSphere BigInsights, and like Sybase's offering, it too can use unstructured as well as structured data as source material. Hadoop "is an approach for gathering information from across a wider spectrum of structured and unstructured information, such as across the Internet or intranet, and doing analysis against it," Spang said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also upgraded the analytics software it acquired in its purchase of SPSS last year. The newly released version 6 of the SPSS Decision Manager predictive analytics software is the first to feature a Web browser-based interface, in addition to the regular thick-client version of the software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new interface "makes it very easy for the business user to take advantage of Decision Manager's model or to customize or build their own models," Spang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these updates, IBM has also developed a package for organizations, called SQL Skin for Sybase ASE, that wish to migrate their data and stored procedures off a Sybase ASE database, and onto IBM's DB2 database. This software is a follow-up release to last year's IBM package that allowed organizations to move their material from Oracle databases onto DB2 ones.&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds analyst comment, byline, background on phones)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, May 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
replaced the chief of its division focused on mobile phones,
videogames and other consumer devices on Tuesday, allowing two
lower executives to report to Chief Executive Officer Steve
Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move comes as the world's largest software maker is
being brushed aside by Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone and Google
Inc's (GOOG.O) Android operating system in the fast-growing
smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A 22-year Microsoft veteran, Robbie Bach will retire this
autumn at the age of 48, Microsoft said. Bach led the
entertainment and devices unit since its creation in 2005 and
was responsible for the original launch of Xbox in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From July 1, the two senior vice presidents in charge of
games and phones, Don Mattrick and Andy Lees, respectively,
will report to CEO Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's maybe time for new leadership," said analyst Matt
Rosoff of independent research firm Directions on Microsoft.
"They've really been struggling to get traction in mobile for
some time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Entertainment and devices is the fourth-largest of
Microsoft's five operating units -- behind its Windows, Office
and server units -- and is on track to post more than $8
billion in revenue for the year ending on June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last quarter, it contributed 11 percent of Microsoft's
overall sales and 3 percent of its operating profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit developed the highly successful Xbox game system,
but has so far failed to make an impact with its Zune digital
music player and is losing ground in mobile and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only 10 percent of smartphones sold in the United States in
the first three months of this year run Windows software,
according to retail research firm NPD Group. That is well
behind Apple with 21 percent, Google with 28 percent and
BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion Ltd RIM.TO with 36
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worldwide, Google's Android passed Microsoft's Windows as
the fourth most popular smartphone operating system in the
first quarter, according to research firm Gartner, behind
Apple, RIM and Nokia's (NOK1V.HE) Symbian system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recognizing its problems, Microsoft announced a completely
new software system for phones earlier this year, called
Windows Phone 7, which is scheduled to hit the market in a new
range of handsets for this year's holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If those phones don't make an impact, Rosoff said,
Microsoft may begin looking at acquisitions in the mobile
sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft were down 2.3 percent at $25.67 in
afternoon trading.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Bernstein Liebhard LLP today announced that a class action has been filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of
purchasers (the "Class") of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) ("Goldman" or
the "Company") common stock during the period of October 15, 2009 and April 16,
2010, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Defendants are Goldman and certain of its
officers and executives. 

The complaint charges Goldman and certain of its officers and executives with
violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Goldman is a financial
holding company that provides global banking, securities and investment
management services in the United States and internationally. 

The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants failed to
disclose material adverse facts about the Company`s true financial condition,
business and prospects. Specifically, the complaint alleges that defendants
failed to disclose: (i) the Company had, in violation of applicable law, not
fully disclosed the facts and circumstances concerning the formation and sale of
the ABACUS 2007-AC1 deal to investors such that it had engaged in misleading
conduct; (ii) the Company had, in fact, bet against its clients and constructed
collateralized debt obligations that were likely, if not designed, to fail; and
(ii) the Company had received a Wells Notice from the SEC about the ABACUS
transaction but failed to inform shareholders of this fact. 

After the market opened on April 16, 2010, it was revealed that Goldman`s U.S.
broker-dealer, GS, had been sued by the SEC "for making materially misleading
statements and omissions in connection" with ABACUS 2007-AC1. As news of
Goldman`s misconduct reached the market, Goldman stock immediately plummeted
$24.05, declining from $184.27 per share on April 15, 2010 to close at $160.70
per share on April 16, 2010. 

Plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of all Class members who purchased
or otherwise acquired shares of Goldman during the Class Period. If you
purchased or otherwise acquired Goldman shares during the Class Period, and
either lost money on the transaction or still hold the shares, you may wish to
join in the action to serve as lead plaintiff. In order to do so, you must meet
certain requirements set forth in the applicable law and file appropriate papers
no later than June 25, 2010. 

A "lead plaintiff" is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class
members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed lead plaintiff,
the court must determine that the class member`s claim is typical of the claims
of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the
class. Under certain circumstances, one or more class members may together serve
as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however,
affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. You may
retain Bernstein Liebhard LLP, or other counsel of your choice, to serve as your
counsel in this action. 

Bernstein Liebhard has pursued hundreds of securities and consumer cases and
recovered almost $3 billion for its clients. It has been named to The National
Law Journal`s "Plaintiffs` Hot List" in each of the last seven years. 

You can obtain a copy of the complaint from the clerk of the court for the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com Chairman and CEO Marc Benioff Tuesday declined to comment on the patent lawsuit brought against his company by Microsoft, but that didn't stop him from calling his rival names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft sued Salesforce.com, alleging that the company infringed nine of its patents. The suit -- a rare example of Microsoft using the courts to defend its patent portfolio -- covers several broad patents, including one for a system used to display a Web page with embedded menus. Another patent covered by the suit covers a method for stacking toolbars in a computer display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with reporters on the sidelines of a company conference in Singapore, Benioff declined to comment on specifics of the suit, but reiterated his description of Microsoft as a patent troll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patent trolls are part of the industry today, that's just the way it is. We've dealt with them before and we'll deal with this situation in the same exact way," Benioff said, noting that the Microsoft lawsuit would have no material impact on the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm just very disappointed in this, from a former leader of our industry, that they would do this," he said. "We will resolve it in the way that we have resolved these matters in the past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a keynote speech held earlier, Benioff repeatedly mocked Microsoft, describing the company's products as old technology that's out of sync with the emergence of cloud computing, a catch-all term used to describe IT infrastructure and applications delivered as a service over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an earlier conference session, Benioff questioned Microsoft's recent release of a new version of its Office productivity suite, which includes a free Web version. The Web version of Office 2010 is Microsoft's attempt to add cloud-computing capabilities to its productivity suite, but Benioff said it falls short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a false cloud," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO May 25 (Reuters) - Global Partners LP (GLP.N) said
on Tuesday it signed an agreement with Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
to buy 190 Mobil-branded gas stations in three New England
States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil, like several other large refiners, has said
that it wants to exit retail operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sales price is $200 million, with the assumption of
certain environmental liabilities, said Eric Slifka, Global
Partners' president and chief executive, calling the assets
best in class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global also has agreed to supply contracts for 31
additional independently operated gas stations, also carrying
the Mobil brand name, also in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of the 190 stations, 42 are company operated and 148 are
dealer operated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subject to approval of its independent directors, Global
intends to negotiate a contract for the management of the
company-operated stations and the dealer relationships with
Alliance Energy LLC, an experienced retail operator. Alliance
is approximately 95 percent owned by members of the Slifka
family, who also own the General Partner of the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slifka said that Global Partners storage has almost doubled
since 2005 and now stands at 10.2 million barrels, with most
storage dedicated to gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global expects the deal to be accretive in first 12 months
of operation, and factors in $1.5 million a year for
environmental remediation. The deal is expected to close by the
end of the year.

&lt;p&gt;2009 Corporate Citizenship Report Details Industry Leading Results

* Greenhouse gas emissions reduced by three million metric tons, the equivalent
of taking 600,000 cars off U.S. roads 
* Lowest-ever workforce lost-time incident rate recorded 
* More than $860 million spent with U.S.-based minority- and women-owned

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today issued its 2009 Corporate Citizenship
Report detailing actions to improve environmental, economic and social
performance, while providing the energy needed to support economic recovery and
growth around the world. 

The report details how ExxonMobil reduced greenhouse gas emissions, was an
industry leader in worker safety and, despite the economic downturn, invested at
record levels in 2009 - more than $27 billion in capital and exploration
expenditures. The company also contributed about $262 billion, or more than 13
times its earnings, to economies around the world through taxes and purchases of
goods and services. 

"Meeting the challenge of sustainability requires that we effectively address
the complex environmental, economic and social issues of our time while
delivering on our primary responsibility - finding and providing the reliable
supplies of energy needed by current and future generations for progress and
prosperity," said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer. 

"The global economic downturn since mid-2008 has affected energy demand and
energy prices, but it has not extinguished the aspirations of today`s rapidly
developing nations or the needs of the over 2 billion people who lack access to
modern energy supplies. ExxonMobil is committed to the highest standards of
corporate citizenship while supplying the energy that is essential to growth and
development." 

Tillerson said ExxonMobil`s most fundamental corporate citizenship priority was
its continued commitment to safety, health and environmental protection in every
aspect of its operations around the world. 

"The tragic Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico is a reminder to
our entire industry of the need to be ever vigilant in protecting people, local
communities and the environment," said Tillerson. 

The Corporate Citizenship Report details how ExxonMobil:

* Recorded its lowest-ever combined employee and contractor workforce lost-time
incident rates in 2009, and achieved an annual 11 percent reduction in lost-time
incident rate on average each year since 2005. 
* Reduced direct greenhouse gas emissions from its operations to 128 million
metric tons, a reduction of three million metric tons, which is the equivalent
of taking 600,000 cars off U.S. roads, and cut upstream hydrocarbon flaring by
23 percent. 
* Invested $1.3 billion in the past five years to increase energy efficiency and
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
* Improved energy efficiency across its refining and chemical operations,
keeping it on track to meet its target of improving energy efficiency by at
least 10 percent between 2002 and 2012. 
* Achieved zero spills from ExxonMobil owned and operated marine vessels and one
leak of trace amounts from a long-term chartered marine vessel in 2009. Reduced
the number of other/non-marine spills greater than one barrel by 35 percent
since 2005. 
* Increased its purchases of materials and services from minority- and
women-owned businesses based in the United States by 43 percent from 2008 to
$863 million. 
* Provided $235 million in combined corporate giving in the form of cash, goods
and services worldwide, including donations of $39 million from ExxonMobil
employees and retirees. 
* Employed a variety of economic support and incentive programs for capacity
building - collectively referred to as national content development. In Nigeria
for example, ExxonMobil awarded contracts totaling more than $1.8 billion to
Nigerian-registered companies, and 43 percent of total in-country spending was
retained in Nigeria.

millones de personas que carecen de acceso a los suministros modernos de

es un recordatorio para toda nuestra industria de la necesidad de estar siempre
atentos a la protecci&#243;n de las personas, las comunidades locales y el

&lt;p&gt;Program Enables Remittances from the US to Latin America and Asia
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), the world`s largest retail payments network1, and Bancomer
Transfer Services, Inc. (BTS), a subsidiary of BBVA Bancomer, S.A., today
announced the launch of a money transfer service that will provide an additional
alternative for consumers that send money from the United States to friends and
family living abroad. 

Starting this month, consumers will be able to initiate a Visa money transfer
transaction at any BTS location in the United States. The Visa money transfer
transaction can reach any eligible Visa account in the world, including all key
remittance destination countries; however, the initial deployment of the service
will enable consumers to send funds from the United States to select countries
such as El Salvador, Brazil, China and The Philippines, with plans to extend the
program to allow remittances from BTS locations to any country within the Visa
network. 

The new program offered by BTS is an enhancement to its recognized service
offering that enables U.S. consumers to safely and securely send remittances
worldwide. BTS is an integral part of BBVA Bancomer, the banking subsidiary of
BBVA Group (BBVA), one of the most successful financial groups in the world. The
alliance with Visa combines the reliability, scale and security of Visa`s global
payment network, with BTS` leading-edge money transfer platform that emphasizes
efficiency and advanced anti-money laundering detection capabilities and its
vast commercial industry-leading experience, bringing the convenience, speed and
security of Visa money transfer to consumers in the U.S. 

"The expansion of Visa money transfer to enable remittances from the U.S. to
eligible Visa accounts in Latin America is a significant milestone for Visa and
our clients," said Jim McCarthy, Global Head of Product at Visa Inc. "Our
alliance with BTS is a great example of how Visa is expanding its business
network to bring the convenience and security of Visa digital currency to more
consumers in more countries around the world." 

Largest Remittances Corridor in the World

According to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Latin America
corridor is one of the largest money transfer markets in the world, with a total
of USD $58.8 billion transferred in 2009. In 2009, BTS alone accounted for USD
$10 billion in consumer funds transferred to Latin America, making BTS one of
the largest processor of remittances for this region2. Other large remittances
markets served by BTS from the U.S. include Asia, Europe and Africa. 

"As a member of the BBVA Group, we are always working to help people simplify
their lives via sound, innovative products and services," said Moises Jaimes,
President and CEO of BTS. "This goes far beyond being a complement to our
traditional money transfer services. Our work with Visa strengthens our
commitment to the evolution of the remittances industry, and, by providing our
consumers with a wider array of safe and secure services and channels, it gets
us one step further in our quest towards serving this important segment in the
financial services industry." 

Visa money transfers initiated at a BTS location in the U.S. are processed
through Visa`s secure network and will become available to Visa cardholders, who
won`t need to go to a physical location to receive the money. Funds can be
transferred to eligible Visa debit, credit or prepaid accounts. The agreement
with Visa provides BTS with access to Visa`s global network and has the
potential for BTS to reach more consumers in more countries. 

"The Visa money transfer and BTS agreement is a serious endorsement of Visa`s
ability to become an alternative channel for money transfer companies and
banks," said Gwenn Bezard, Research Director at Aite Group. "Money transfer
companies` desire to enable remittance transfers directly into bank accounts has
grown in recent years, and Visa is positioned to become the go-to utility for
that service." 

For the launch of this new service, Visa worked closely with BTS and Visa Debit
Processing Services (DPS), to securely connect BTS` money transfer platform to
VisaNet, Visa`s global processing network. DPS is Visa`s issuer processing
service in North America that connects outside parties, such as issuing
financial institutions and merchants to VisaNet. 

About Bancomer Transfer Services

Based in Houston, BTS is an affiliate of BBVA USA, which is part of the BBVA
Group (NYSE: BBVA) (MAD: BBVA), a multinational financial service group that
operates in more than 30 countries. BTS has provided money transfer services to
Mexico since 1995 and expanded to other key Latin American markets in 2002.
Today, BTS offers consumer money transfer services in 23 countries with over
73,000 payment locations. With this strong foundation BTS continues expanding
the service in Europe and Asia. The strength of the BBVA Global Brand, coupled

&lt;p&gt;ALEXANDRIA, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Toxicologists across the country are sounding the alarm about a contaminant
increasingly found in cocaine that is impairing cocaine users` immune systems,
subjecting them to various infections and, in some cases, causing death. 

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency estimates some 70 percent of cocaine currently
coming into the country is contaminated with levamisole - a drug used to de-worm
animals. The drug can cause dangerous effects in people, most notably
agranulocytosis, or a low white blood cell count, which prevents the immune
system from fighting infections. 

Dr. Steven Seifert, medical director of the New Mexico Poison and Drug
Information Center and a board member for the American Association of Poison
Control Centers, co-authored a report on the current status of
levamisole-contaminated cocaine that was published in the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention`s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in
December 2009. The report reviewed what had been previously known and included
additional cases of agranulocytosis linked to people with a history of cocaine
use. 

It is unclear when levamisole started contaminating cocaine supplies or why, but
the contamination appears to be widespread: In July 2009, the Drug Enforcement
Agency reported detecting levamisole in nearly 70 percent of seized cocaine lots
coming into the United States. 

Seifert said the public health threat presented by this contamination is
underappreciated and is being under-reported because of a lack of awareness in
the medical community. Physicians should suspect levamisole-contaminated cocaine
in patients presenting with immune suppression, with or without infection, and
should contact their county or state health departments for assistance with
testing and epidemiologic investigation. Physicians with questions about the
impact of levamisole should call their poison center at 1 (800) 222-1222.
Doctors should also warn patients known to use cocaine of the presence of a
potentially lethal contaminant in cocaine supplies. 

In Arizona, five doctors for the Banner Good Samaritan Poison and Drug
Information Center in Phoenix recently authored a "Dear Colleague" letter urging
fellow physicians to consider the possibility of levamisole exposure in patients
who appear to have impaired immune systems, including testing urine for cocaine.
They wrote that the agranulocytosis is "usually reversible after exposure to
levamisole is terminated." 

Both centers are members of the American Association of Poison Control Centers,
which maintains a database, the National Poison Data System (NPDS), that tracks
calls to poison centers. According to the association, poison centers have
received 25 calls related to weakened immune systems from patients who have used
cocaine since Jan. 1, 2009. Of those, two cases resulted in death. 

Jim Hirt, executive director of the American Association of Poison Control
Centers, said poison centers are uniquely positioned to often be the first to
see public health threats. "Poison centers have been on the forefront of public
health surveillance," he said. "And this is another example of how medically
staffed poison centers can track public health problems in the making." 

The American Association of Poison Control Centers represents the nation`s 60
poison centers. Poison centers offer free and confidential services 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. If you have a question about poison or
are worried you`ve been exposed to a possible poison, call 1 (800) 222-1222.

&lt;p&gt;IBM Certifies ExaScale to Interoperate With Its x iDataPlex Clustering Solutions
for Dynamic Data Center Environments
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Force10 Networks, Inc., the global technology leader that data center, service
provider and enterprise customers rely on when the network is their business,
today announced that its ExaScale E-Series virtualized core switch/router will
be integrated into IBM's iDataPlex servers and Intelligent Cluster. IBM will
also provide support for the ExaScale switch/routers - including implementation
and technical support - for enterprise customers worldwide. 

"Today`s data centers require massive compute resources to answer the increasing
growth of data while challenged to save power, cooling and management costs,"
says Wendy McGee, director, HPC and iDataPlex Business Unit, IBM. "Since 2003,
data center and grid computing environments have leveraged our Linux cluster
technology, coupled with the Force10 core switch/routers, to gain line-rate 10
GbE throughput advantages that can cost-effectively scale in these density- and
performance-sensitive applications. By certifying ExaScale virtualized core
switch/routers to integrate with x iDataPlex technology, IT managers can now
leverage Force10`s network management and architectural tools to gain greater
data center efficiency and agility through better space utilization and
computing density, all while using less power." 

Force10 Networks ExaScale E-Series is purpose-built for dynamic data center
environments, such as those served by x iDataPlex. This virtualized core
switch/router family incorporates Force10`s Open Automation technology which
leverages new "open" components within the modular Force10 Operating System
(FTOS) software that streamline the data center network fabric`s ability to
participate in automated, policy-driven, real-time workload allocation in
response to changing application and service demands. These software features
within FTOS promote network agility through real-time communication with
middleware orchestration tools and virtualized server technologies to enable
automatic provisioning and management throughout the data center network. 

"IBM and Force10 Networks have enjoyed considerable success over the past
several years in delivering high performing, cost-effective networking solutions
for large data centers," said John Erdman, vice president of OEM Alliances,
Force10 Networks. "Our agreement formally extends this automated, yet flexible
approach we have taken together to leverage standards-based management,
provisioning and automation tools, to help data centers deliver on-demand
performance, rapid service delivery and lower management, power and cooling
costs."

Corp (EMC.N) to "neutral" from "overweight," saying it does not
see a lot of upside potential to earnings and revenue in 2010
and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said the data storage company was facing
rising competition in virtualized environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan upgraded smaller rival NetApp Inc (NTAP.O) to
"overweight" from "neutral," citing potential growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "NetApp appears to be benefiting from a secular shift in
server virtualization," analysts Mark Moskowitz and Anthony

allowing businesses to replace multiple pieces of equipment
with one machine. That helps save money on hardware,
maintenance and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said the shift to midrange products favored
NetApp more than EMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We highlight NetApp as offering long-term investors
exposure to a model with the potential of crossing into 20
percent-plus growth territory beyond 2010," the analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst raised his price target on NetApp shares to $41
from $36.50 and cut his price target on EMC shares to $21 from
$22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of NetApp closed at $32.40 Monday on Nasdaq, while
shares of EMC closed at $18.06 on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of EMC Corp (EMC.N) fell 3.4 percent to $17.45 in premarket trading on Tuesday after JPMorgan downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "overweight."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The U.S. oil benchmark price will on average be lower than its European counterpart for "the next few years," undermining West Texas Intermediate's (WTI) status as a yardstick for global crude markets, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Front-month futures of WTI crude, priced at the U.S. mid-continent hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, where growing imports of Canadian crude are stored, settled almost $6 a barrel below North Sea Brent on May 14, the biggest discount in 15 months. The discount was at about $1.20 on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not going to be a static relationship between international crudes and mid-continent crudes, but on average, over the next few years you are going to have to see WTI priced at a discount," Lawrence Eagles, JPMorgan's managing director and global head of commodities research said at the Reuters Global Energy Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've got to see Canadian crude in particular trading at a significant discount to Gulf Coast crudes. That means WTI de facto is going to trade cheap relative to its historic norms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude had for decades commanded a premium to European and Middle Eastern supplies to attract transatlantic arbitrage cargoes and plug a deficit in the North American market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent is the benchmark for about two-thirds of the world's oil, including the eastern Atlantic basin comprising Europe and Africa. Exports of most Middle Eastern grades to the Mediterranean and trade of selected Asia-Pacific crudes are also referenced to the European marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTI reflects the specific balance between supply and demand at Cushing, detached from U.S. crudes produced along the Gulf of Mexico coast, which maintain a steadier relation to Brent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inventories at Cushing soared to 37.9 million barrels the week to May 14, government statistics from the Energy Information Administration show. Refineries in the U.S. Midwest have reduced crude intake over the past two months as they carried out spring maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genscape, which uses visible and infra-red spectrum monitoring techniques to estimate storage levels at crude tanks in Cushing, said supplies rose even further to 39.46 million barrels in the week to May 18, or 77 percent of shell capacity, which cannot be exhausted because of operational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CANADA IMPORTS SOAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As U.S. oil demand slumped over the past year and a half, U.S. imports of Canadian crude originating mainly from Alberta's oil sands jumped to about 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.5 million bpd a decade earlier, EIA data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Canadian crudes have to price themselves at a level which will encourage pipeline capacity to move crude out of the region," Eagles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By virtue of storage economics, that means that if there is surplus of Canadian heavy sours, it translates into a discount for WTI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glut has also depressed the value of prompt WTI contracts relative to later-delivery contracts, a market structure called contango. The opposite structure is known as backwardation because of progressively lower prices for contracts further out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extended refinery maintenance season in Asia and the overhang at Cushing will delay an expected flip in the market structure from contango to backwardation until July or August, JPMorgan (JPM.N) said in a report dated May 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IS WTI A VIABLE BENCHMARK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eagles says the volatility in front-month WTI does not prevent it from remaining as a marker for crude produced in the U.S. and the rest of the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Benchmarks are difficult to create. They tend to be chosen by the market, and as such, WTI still has a significant number of crudes which are priced off it," Eagles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the emphasis may gradually switch to Brent as a headline figure, he said, because news organizations tend to quote the highest price, especially at times of rising oil costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Brent has always been the more significant physical benchmark. Previously, when the price of crude was high, people always wanted to quote the highest crude benchmark and that was WTI. But if it is no longer the highest, then people will talk about Brent more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most liquid market for Brent crude futures is the ICE exchange, which centers trading of the contract in London, while for WTI it is the New York Mercantile Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As always within all these markets, volume attracts more volume, liquidity attracts more liquidity. At the moment, you wouldn't say there is any sign that WTI liquidity is shifting significantly," Eagles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ramthan Hussain)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Continued Commitment to Operational Excellence Helps Microsoft Global
Outsourcing Receive COPC Inc.`s First-Ever Block Recertification for Procurement
and Contracting Services
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
COPC Inc. (Customer Operations Performance Center Inc.) today announced that
Microsoft Global Outsourcing (MGO) has successfully completed Block
Recertification for their worldwide procurement and contracting services. This
accomplishment makes Microsoft Corp. the first company worldwide to achieve this
type of recertification to the COPC&#174; Vendor Management Organization Standard
(COPC-2000 VMO Standard). 

The COPC-2000 VMO Standard is recognized in the customer service operations
industry as the highest level of best practices for outsourcing management.
Vendor management organizations (VMOs) are comprised of internal and/or external
teams that manage a company`s relationship with their outsourced customer
service, contact center and business process outsourcing providers.
Certification to the industry standard ensures that regardless of being
in-sourced or outsourced, corporations can ensure their customers consistently
receive high levels of service and quality combined with high levels of
operational efficiency with reduced costs. 

Block Certifications are an innovative aspect of the COPC-2000 VMO Standard and
run on two distinct tracks: one covering Procurement of Vendors, and the other
for managing daily operations with vendors. Organizations performing VMO
processes are becoming more and more specialized and these separate tracks of
Block Certification support this specialization allowing companies to get
exactly the certification they need. 

Block Recertification has provided benefits to MGO such as receiving a rigorous
assessment of their successful business practices and processes; global
recertification to a known and "valued" standard in the contact center industry;
recognition that their procurement and contracting functions continue to be high
performing resources; and sharing of benchmarks and best practices - both within
MGO, as well as compared to other high performing VMOs` processes/approaches. 

The Microsoft Global Outsourcing Block Recertification audit took place in
concert with the Microsoft North America Customer Service recertification. Both
recertifications were achieved the week of April 6, 2010. 

"The Block Recertification of Microsoft Global Outsourcing to the COPC-2000 VMO
Standard further demonstrates the company`s dedication to effectively managing
their Customer Service Provider relationships," said Cliff Moore, COPC Inc.
Chairman. "Once again, Microsoft has distinguished itself as an innovator and
leader in being the first-ever organization to receive this type of
recertification." 

"Being the first global outsourcing entity to receive this recertification is a
great achievement for MGO and our company. It demonstrates that our outsourcing
practices deliver consistent, reliable, and predictable business results," said
Mike Simms, MGO General Manager. "It again reflects our ongoing commitment to
the continuous improvement of our core processes and our core mission of
providing outstanding service to our customers." 

COPC also commended Microsoft Global Outsourcing for its commitment to
continuous improvements in its procurement and contracting services, including:

* Monthly scorecard reviews of team commitments that are linked throughout the
organization 
* A Vendor Scorecard used to assess all vendors on a consistent measurement
framework 
* The Outsourcing Management System (OMS) - documenting each of its processes,
making OMS part of each MGO employee`s commitments and adapting the OMS
framework for other MGO business engagements 
* Continuous focus on innovation with projects to test out other outsourcing
business models

Microsoft Global Outsourcing (MGO) manages the procurement and contracting
activities for contact centers that support the global Consumer, Commercial
Technical Support and Customer Service business segments of Microsoft, across
approximately 114 sites worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;  CEDAR RAPIDS, IA, May 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ETM today announced it has attained Gold Certified Partner status in the
Microsoft Partner Program with a competency in ISV/Software Solutions
Competency, recognizing ETM's expertise and impact in the technology
marketplace. As a Gold Certified Partner, ETM has demonstrated expertise
with Microsoft technologies and a proven ability to meet customers'
needs. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners receive a rich set of benefits,
including access, training and support, giving them a competitive
advantage in the channel.

    "We've made great strides in becoming a solver of business problems for
our clients," said Larry Kane, ETM's president. "But this achievement
proves we continue to hone our IT chops. This is a feather in the cap of
our development shop. We're proud of our entire IT staff. And we're
grateful to Microsoft for recognizing their achievements with this
milestone."

    As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status,
ETM had to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft Competencies are
designed to help differentiate a partner's capabilities with specific
Microsoft technologies to customers looking for a particular type of
solution. Each Competency has a unique set of requirements and benefits,
formulated to accurately represent the specific skills and services that
partners bring to the technology industry. Within select Competencies,
there are Specializations that focus on specific solution areas that
recognize deeper expertise within that Competency. Serving as a
specialized path to earning those Competencies, Specializations give
direct access to the tools and resources that support that specific area
of focus.

    ETM's Wings Plus was Microsoft tested and approved in March. The company
achieved its ISV/Software Solutions Competency in April by meeting
testing requirements for its software, its operating system, and other
components -- and by receiving the required number of customer
references. In addition, ETM earned 120 partner points in these
categories: Microsoft Competencies, Microsoft Certified Professionals,
Microsoft Tested Products, Customer Reference, Customer Satisfaction
Survey, and Additional Competency &amp; Designations.

    "Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap
between their business demands and technology capabilities," said Allison
Watson, corporate vice president of the Worldwide Partner Group at
Microsoft Corp. "They need to trust in a company that can act as an
expert adviser for their long-term strategic technology plans. Microsoft
Gold Certified Partners, which have certified expertise and direct
training and support from Microsoft, can build a positive customer
experience with our technologies. Today, Microsoft recognizes ETM as a
new Gold Certified Partner for demonstrating its expertise in providing
customer satisfaction using Microsoft products and technology."

    "Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to better
enable ISVs to meet customer needs," said Walid Abu-Hadba, corporate vice
president of the Developer and Platform Evangelism Group at Microsoft
Corp. "They allow ISVs to keep and win customers through their deep
knowledge of solutions-based Microsoft platform technologies. Microsoft
has a long history of working closely with ISV partners to help them
deliver compelling solutions and applications to our mutual customers,
and the Microsoft Competencies are an important step in continuing to
enhance vital relationships with ISVs worldwide."

America`s national security, its armed forces, intelligence agencies and the
many vital operations of our government. CACI people and our management team are

Purchase Includes Supply Rights at Additional 31 Independently-Owned Mobil
Stations;
Agreement Significantly Expands Global`s Position in Supply of Wholesale
Transportation Fuels;
Partnership to Host Conference Call Today at 10:00 am (ET)


WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Global Partners LP (NYSE: GLP) ("the Partnership") today announced the signing
of an agreement with Exxon Mobil Corporation to purchase 190 Mobil branded
retail gas stations in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. The
agreement includes the right to supply Mobil branded fuel to the stations as
well as to an additional 31 Mobil stations owned and operated by independent
dealers in those same states. 

Of the 221 stations, 179 are located in Massachusetts, 22 in Rhode Island and 20
in New Hampshire. All of the stations will continue to operate under the Mobil
brand as part of a long-term branding agreement between ExxonMobil and Global
Partners. The stations sold approximately 370 million gallons of gasoline and
diesel fuel in 2009. 

"This is a major milestone for Global Partners," said Eric Slifka, the
Partnership`s President and Chief Executive Officer. "The purchase of these
best-in-class assets achieves two important objectives for Global: expanding the
transportation fuels component of our business and extending our presence in
wholesale supply. These Mobil sites are highly visible with high traffic counts,
and situated on virtually non-replicable, prime locations. 

"We believe that the strategic value of this transaction comes from the
significant new stream of income we expect to generate by supplying these 221
locations in New England with gasoline and diesel fuel through our supply and
terminaling system. This transaction offers efficiencies and opportunities
within our existing gasoline and diesel fuel wholesale supply business," Slifka
said. 

"As a leading refined products terminaling and supply company in New England,
Global Partners has been a valued ExxonMobil customer for nearly 50 years," said
Ben Soraci, ExxonMobil`s Director of U.S. Retail Sales. "I'm pleased that Global
is extending its resources, capabilities and commitment to meeting the needs of
Mobil customers throughout Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island." 

Global Partners intends to finance the purchase of the ExxonMobil assets with
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement with its bank group and/or
access to the capital markets. Global Partners expects the transaction to be
accretive in the first 12 months of operation with improving returns over time
as the business potential of these assets is further realized. 

Of the 190 stations being acquired by Global Partners, 42 are company operated
and 148 are dealer operated. Subject to approval of its independent directors,
the Partnership intends to negotiate a contract for the management of the
company-operated stations and the dealer relationships with Alliance Energy LLC,
an experienced retail operator. Alliance is approximately 95 percent owned by
members of the Slifka family, who also own the General Partner of the
Partnership. 

"We look forward to working closely with the Mobil franchise dealers in
providing competitively priced, safe, reliable, and quality Mobil transportation
fuels throughout New England," Slifka said. 

ExxonMobil employees whose positions will be impacted by this sale will receive
offers of employment from Global Partners or from Alliance Energy pending
successful completion of pre-employment screening and continued satisfactory
performance. Employees of dealer-owned and/or operated stations are employed by
the dealer, not ExxonMobil, and thus are not impacted by this change of
ownership. Additionally, ExxonMobil Fleet employees are not included in the
transaction. 

The purchase is subject to customary regulatory approvals and various other
customary commercial closing conditions, and is expected to be completed byyear
end 2010.

&lt;p&gt;CNBC to Serve as Official Broadcast Partner

Veteran Journalists Develop Event Devoted to Accelerating Innovation
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Techonomy, a newly formed media enterprise founded by well-known business
journalists, today announces its formation and the details of its debut
conference. The conference will be held at the Ritz-Carlton Highlands Lake Tahoe
in Truckee, California from August 4-6, 2010 (www.techonomy.com). Hosts of the
conference and founding partners of Techonomy, LLC, are Fortune Magazine
veterans David Kirkpatrick, Peter Petre and Brent Schlender. 

Bill Joy, a partner at Kleiner Perkins and co-founder of Sun Microsystems, who
has been an advisor to Techonomy from its inception, said, "We are at an
inflection point in the global economy and need to accelerate innovation.
Techonomy is about identifying and promoting ideas, principles and enterprises
that have the ability to change the economics of industries and create new forms
of growth and opportunities to solve global challenges." 

About Techonomy

Techonomy's founders aim to convince leaders that invention-both technological
and social-is central for all organizations. While technology, with its rapid
and often exponential advance, can bring about change that is disturbingly fast,
it enables us to solve problems that would otherwise stymie us. The viewpoint is
inherently optimistic. 

"We've created Techonomy because we believe that the pace and gravity of
technological change in business and society remains underappreciated," said
co-founder David Kirkpatrick. "The Techonomy conference will gather many of the
world's smartest and most accomplished leaders to engage in a dialogue about the
roles of technology and invention in all areas of human endeavor and act as a
catalyst for transferring those ideas across industries and sectors." 

Techonomy, LLC, will launch later this year. The model will be a hybrid of
original reporting, opinion, aggregated content and contributed long form
journalism. The company will create and distribute video, audio and textual
content starting this year and will include news and commentary building upon
the conference. 

The Upcoming Techonomy Conference

The Techonomy conference has already attracted sponsors and strategic partners
including: HP, Chevron, McKinsey, Intel, Centerview Partners, LPL Financial,
Hill &amp; Knowlton, The World Business Council for Sustainable Development and
Scientific American. CNBC, First in Business Worldwide, will serve as the
exclusive broadcast partner for the event and will be broadcasting live from
Techonomy in August. 

Confirmed speakers reflect a wide range of "techonomists" including Bill Gates,
Padmasree Warrior, CTO of Cisco, Deborah Hopkins, Chief Innovation Officer,
CitiGroup, Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, and Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. 

Additional speakers include: Prabhu Pingali, Gates Foundation food and
agriculture expert, Bjorn Stigson, president of the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development, social entrepreneur Bill Drayton of Ashoka, and danah
boyd of Microsoft Research New England, and Harvard's Berkman Center. 

About the Founders:

David Kirkpatrick, Peter Petre, and Brent Schlender each spent the last twenty
years as senior writers and editors at Fortune Magazine, where they led the
magazine`s technology coverage during most of that period. 

David Kirkpatrick was also founder and host of Fortune`s Brainstorm conference
series from 2001 through 2006 and for the Brainstorm Tech conferences from 2007-
2009. In June, Simon &amp; Schuster will publish his book The Facebook Effect: The
Inside Story of the Company that is Connecting the World. 

Peter Petre has also co-authored several bestselling books include: Alan
Greenspan`s memoir, "The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World"; General
H. Norman Schwarzkopf`s "It Doesn`t Take A Hero" and Thomas J. Watson, Jr.`s
"Father, Son &amp; Co.: My Life at IBM and Beyond." 

Brent Schlender has written extensively about the high-tech industries, business
strategy, and management and leadership, and also spent many years as a foreign
correspondent for both Fortune Magazine and The Wall Street Journal in Latin
America and Asia. He co-developed a dramatic television series with Robert
Altman and Garry Trudeau called Killer App.

&lt;p&gt; * JP Morgan restructures equity capital markets team&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Achintya Mangla rejoins as co-head of ECM Asia ex-Japan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, May 25 (Reuters) - JP Morgan has restructured its
Asia Pacific equity capital markets and derivatives team,
promoting Kester Ng and Doug Howland as the co-heads of
Asia-Pacific (including Japan and Australia) ECM, according to a
memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan (JPM.N), which is one of the underwriters for
Agricultural Bank of China's [ABC.UL] $30 billion initial public
offering, has also taken back Achintya Mangla as co-head of ECM
Asia ex-Japan and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Howland was previously head of ECM for Japan while Ng was
head of ECM for Asia ex-Japan and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IFR was first to report JP Morgan's ECM team shakes up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capital raisings are a hot story in Asia, with major Chinese
lenders alone planning to raise about $60 billion in 2010.
Underwriters are getting their teams into shape as they prepare
for a busy year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan also appointed Aloke Gupte as the head of
equity-linked origination for Asia Pacific including Australia
and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mangla, who had resigned in early May to join Bank of
America-Merrill Lynch, has been named joint head of ECM Asia
ex-Japan and Australia, along with Arjun Khullar. JP Morgan
declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt; * Report says software giant to overhaul device unit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Chief tech officer Allard said to go-WSJ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shake-up comes as unit struggles in mobile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Changes dateline; adds background on unit, executives)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, May 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is set
to overhaul management of its division focused on mobile phones,
videogames and other consumer devices, the Wall Street Journal
said on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software maker, which has been brushed
aside by Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone and Google Inc's (GOOG.O)
Android operating system in the fast-growing smartphone market,
may announce the changes at its entertainment and devices
division as early as this week, the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J. Allard, the unit's chief technology officer -- a 15-year
Microsoft veteran who led the development of the Xbox game
system and Zune music player -- is expected to leave following
Microsoft's recent decision to shelve an experimental tablet
computer called the Courier, which Allard was spearheading, the
Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reorganization will be broader than Allard's departure,
the Journal said, without giving details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That could mean a change of role for Robbie Bach, who has
led the entertainment and devices unit since its creation in
2005. Bach, a 22-year Microsoft veteran, was responsible for the
original launch of Xbox in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A management shake-up would come just before Microsoft
unveils its new hands-free system for the Xbox -- code-named
Natal -- at the E3 gaming conference in mid-June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Entertainment and devices is the fourth biggest of
Microsoft's five operating units -- behind its Windows, Office
and server units -- and is on track to post more than $8 billion
in revenue this fiscal year, which ends June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last quarter, it contributed 11 percent of Microsoft's
overall sales and 3 percent of its operating profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit developed the highly successful Xbox game system,
but has so far failed to make an impact with its Zune digital
music player and is losing ground in mobile and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only about 10 percent of smartphones sold in the first three
months of this year in the United States run Windows software,
according to retail research firm NPD Group. That is well behind
Apple with 21 percent, Google with 28 percent and
BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion Ltd RIM.TO with 36
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worldwide, Google's Android passed Microsoft's Windows as
the fourth most popular smartphone operating system in the first
quarter, according to research firm Gartner, behind Apple, RIM
and Nokia's (NOK1V.HE) Symbian system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recognizing its problems, Microsoft announced a completely
new software system for phones earlier this year, called Windows
Phone 7, which is scheduled to hit the market in a new range of
handsets for this year's holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft needs to regain momentum in the mobile computing
sector as Apple's iPad and a host of competing slate or tablet
devices are poised to reshape the software industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company may have lost an important ally in the emerging
tablet market with Hewlett-Packard Co's (HPQ.N) recent deal to
buy smartphone pioneer Palm Inc PALM.O, signaling that HP is
planning to use Palm's operating system instead of Microsoft's
Windows in its forthcoming slate devices.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Apple Inc shot past Microsoft Corp as the world's biggest tech company based on market value on Wednesday, the latest milestone in the resurgence of the maker of the iPhone, which nearly went out of business in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple's shares rose as much 2.8 percent on Nasdaq on Wednesday, as Microsoft shares floundered, briefly pushing its market value above $229 billion, ahead of its longtime rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both stocks ended down after a late-day sell-off, but Apple emerged ahead with a market value of about $222 billion, compared with Microsoft's $219 billion, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple shares closed down 0.4 percent at $244.11 on Nasdaq, while Microsoft fell 4 percent to a seven-month low of $25.01.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Apple are worth more than 10 times what they were 10 years ago, as it has profited from revolutionizing consumer electronics with its stylish, easy to use products such as the iPod, iPhone and MacBook laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time Apple had a higher market value than Microsoft was December 19, 1989, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose operating system runs on more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers, has not been able to match growth rates from its hey-day 1990s. Its stock is down 20 percent from 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple, which struggled for many years to get its products into the mainstream, resorted to a $150 million investment from the much larger Microsoft in 1997 in order to keep it afloat. At that time, Microsoft's market value was more than five times that of Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft still leads Apple in sales. In the latest quarter, Microsoft reported $14.5 billion in revenue compared with Apple's $13.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cupertino, California-based Apple is now the second-largest company on the Standard  Poor's 500 index by market value, behind energy behemoth Exxon Mobil Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting Rodrigo Campos and David Gaffen; Editing by Gary Hill and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

(Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PERTH May 27 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) has sold
295 of its fuel retail service stations on Australia's east
coast to convenience store chain 7-Eleven Australia Pty Ltd for
an undisclosed sum, as part of an effort to streamline its
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, which has refining and upstream oil and gas
operations in Australia, will continue to supply fuel to the
service stations involved in the deal, and plans to remain a
major fuel wholesaler in the commercial and industrial market,
it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale comes a month after Exxon scrapped a deal to sell
302 of its service station to refiner Caltex Australia Ltd
(CTX.AX) for A$300 million ($247.1 million) due to an objection
by the competition regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon owns one refinery in Australia and has the smallest
market share in the petroleum refining business in the country.
It has said that it wants to focus on the natural gas projects
in Australia and Papua New Guinea, with plans to invest
billions in the next three to five years.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Walt Disney Co employee and her boyfriend have been charged with a "brazen" insider trading scheme in which they said the media conglomerate was in advanced talks to sell its ABC TV network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney quickly said that claim was false. But the incident, which came to light on Wednesday after a months-long FBI undercover sting operation, is an irritant for a company known for a carefully spun image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Disney leapt as much as 4.7 percent before backtracking after the denial to end the day up 2.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors accuse Bonnie Hoxie, an assistant to Disney's corporate communications chief, and Yonni Sebbag of trying to sell insider information to over 30 hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a total embarrassment for Disney, but it can happen to any company," said Alan Gould, an analyst with Soleil Research. "What's far more interesting from the share value perspective is if they are selling ABC."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors have been cracking down on insider trading but this investigation is not part of the closely watched probe that ensnared Galleon hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and 20 others last year from Wall Street to Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court documents said Hoxie and Sebbag conspired from March through May 25 of this year to try to profit off confidential information available to her as assistant to a top executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoxie is accused of giving information about Disney's earnings to Sebbag, who in turn tried to sell it to U.S. and European hedge funds, according to criminal and civil charges filed in New York on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assistant and Sebbag -- also known as Jonathan Cyrus -- were arrested by FBI agents in Los Angeles and arraigned in Los Angeles federal court on Wednesday. Hoxie was released on $50,000 bail and ordered to a hearing in New York on June 3. Sebbag was deemed a flight risk and was detained. He will be transported to New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Hoxie and Sebbag kicked off their effort by sending cold emails to hedge funds, many of whom then went straight to federal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an undercover dragnet, agents contacted Sebbag, who in one email said he learned Disney was in talks to sell ABC, a long-standing subject of speculation on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bob Iger is in serious and advanced negotiations with two private equity firms to sell them the ABC network but no price has been determined yet," Sebbag wrote in the email, according to the criminal complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney responded: "The reference in the complaint to conversations regarding the ABC Network were and are false."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE STING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear from the complaints what motivated the pair.

The charges carry a maximum possible sentence of 20 years' imprisonment should they be found guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is being prosecuted in New York rather than in Los Angeles because the pair contacted several hedge funds in New York. Sebbag stayed at a Manhattan hotel during a trip to collect payment for the sale of the confidential information about Disney, the complaints said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that meeting on May 14 with two putative traders, in reality FBI agents, Sebbag was paid $15,000 in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sebbag, with an envelope containing $15,000 in his grasp, revealed his true identity to the supposed traders and discussed building their relationship by providing more confidential Disney information in future, the complaints said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recording of the meeting, Sebbag told the undercover FBI agents his source at Disney was an assistant to one of the top five executives at the company.

&lt;p&gt;Apple passed a major milestone today, becoming the world's largest technology company as measured by the total value of its shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the close of trading on the Nasdaq exchange, Apple's market capitalization stood at $223 billion, higher than No. 2 Microsoft, which had a market cap of $219.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first time that Apple's total share worth climbed above its rival's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Apple's market cap just exceeded Microsoft's for the first time ever, making it the world's largest tech company in terms of market cap," said Brian Marshall, an analyst with BroadPoint AmTech. "It's interesting that just seven years ago, the company traded at less than cash."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company's market cap is equal to its share price times the number of shares outstanding. A year ago, Apple's shares closed at $130.78; today, the company's shares fell in late afternoon trading to $244.13, a one-year increase of 86.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares, meanwhile, dropped to $24.99 in late trading, off more than a dollar for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google , a competitor to both Apple and Microsoft, closed the day with a market cap of $152 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil giant Exxon Mobil is the U.S.'s largest company, with a market cap of $278.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to BroadPoint's Marshall, both Apple and Microsoft will generate in the neighborhood of $65 billion in revenues during the 2010 calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney/ABC TV Group is shutting down decade-old cable channel SoapNet to make room for a new kids channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company will launch Disney Junior, a 24-hour channel devoted to youngsters aged 2-7. The move will expand Disney Channel's current daytime programing block, Playhouse Disney, into its own network. The network will debut in 2012, taking advantage of the 75-million-home distribution of SoapNet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SoapNet was created in 2000 to give daytime viewers the ability to watch time-shifted soaps, before multiplatform viewing and DVRs were part of our vocabulary," said Anne Sweeney, co-chair, Disney Media Networks. "But today, as technology and our businesses evolve, it makes more sense to align this distribution with a preschool channel that builds on the core strengths of our company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoapNet mainly airs repeats of broadcast network daytime soap operas, particularly ABC programs, such as "All My Children" and "One Life to Live," as well as more contemporary titles like "One Tree Hill" and "Gilmore Girls."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With daytime soaps a dying breed on broadcast, and the kids TV market booming, it's no surprise Disney would shift the channel to target younger viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Junior will launch with 200 episodes annually of new series and current Playhouse Disney titles such as "Mickey Mouse Clubhouse," "Handy Manny" and "Jungle Junction," as well as showcase classic Disney movies such as "Little Mermaid."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While governments and other organizations are stepping up efforts at providing more information for public consumption, they should also provide tools to allow people to interpret this data, argued a Microsoft social media researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Information is power, but interpretation is more powerful," said Danah Boyd, speaking at the at the O'Reilly Gov 2.0 Expo, being held this week in Washington, D.C. "We want this information out there. We want people to make informed decisions. But we also want to give them to tools to interpret what we see," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking before an audience of mostly government executives and supporting contractors, she had stated that it is not enough to provide information to the people -- as government agencies are doing through efforts like Data.gov and Data.Gov.UK -- because tools must also be provided to aid in the interpretation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to think not just how we want to make data available but how to help people process it," she said. Such skills will not come about simply "because people have access to information," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without such tools, information can be misused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, Boyd pointed to the U.S. registries of sex offenders. Brought about by a 1996 U.S. federal law, nicknamed Megan's Law, states are allowed to compile public listings of names and addresses of convicted sex offenders within their jurisdictions. While such repositories have helped parents know if there are any pedophiles in their neighborhoods, they have also brought about a fair amount of misunderstanding, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, the sex offenders are not pedophiles, but rather offenders who, at the time of their crimes, were barely legal adults who had intimate relations with partners not quite of legal age. The example Boyd used is of one 17-year-old girl who was convicted of having sex with someone a year younger. For these people, being on a registry has led to unjust public shame, she argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem doesn't lie with the registries themselves, but rather with "how people interpret" them, she said. While providing useful information to parents, such registries also "help people stay afraid and are also meant to encourage certain kinds of hateful feelings towards other citizens," she said..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As another example of data misuse, she pointed to a widely cited statistic from a 2006 study from the Crimes Against Children Research Center, which showed that one in seven minors are solicited online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people assume that one in seven minors are sexually solicited by adults," she said. But a closer analysis reveals a different picture. Over 90 percent of the solicitations were actually made by other minors or young adults, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we use these numbers, as politicians and as members of the public, we have to be really careful with what we are saying," she said. "We use this information to generate fear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boyd said this practice of spinning information, or interpreting data that supports only a single view, will be done with increasing sophistication in the years to come. "Data will become something we will fight over again and again," she said. "Information is power. But spinning information is also a power."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, people will have to become experts have in interpreting information, or develop what she calls information literacy, and government is in the unique position to help develop such skills, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK on Wednesday sued JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), accusing the second-largest U.S. bank of illegally siphoning billions of dollars of desperately-needed assets in the days leading up to its record bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit filed in Manhattan bankruptcy court accused JPMorgan of using its "unparalleled access" to inside details of Lehman's distress to extract $8.6 billion of collateral in the four business days ahead of Lehman's September 15, 2008, bankruptcy, including $5 billion on the final business day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was Lehman's main "clearing" bank, in which it acts as a go-between in Lehman's dealings with other parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, JPMorgan knew from this relationship that Lehman's viability was fast weakening, and threatened to deprive Lehman of critical clearing services unless it posted an excessive amount of collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With this financial gun to Lehman's head, JPMorgan was able to extract extraordinarily one-sided agreements from Lehman literally overnight," the complaint said. "Those billions of dollars in collateral rightfully belong to the Lehman estate and its creditors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman also said JPMorgan officials including Chief Executive Jamie Dimon decided to extract the collateral after learning from meetings with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that the government would not rescue Lehman from bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the widely expected lawsuit, Lehman and its official committee of unsecured creditors are seeking $5 billion of damages, a return of the collateral and other remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti called the lawsuit "meritless," and said the bank will defend against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any money recovered could increase the payout to creditors. Lehman has also sued Barclays Plc (BARC.L) to recover an $11.2 billion "windfall" from the takeover of U.S. assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, a bankruptcy judge approved an accord providing for JPMorgan to return several billion dollars of assets to Lehman's estate, but giving Lehman a right to sue further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman collapsed after letting its balance sheet swell through exposure to commercial real estate, subprime mortgages and other risky sectors.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Walt Disney Co employee and her boyfriend have been charged with an insider trading scheme in which they said Disney was in advanced talks to sell its ABC network -- a claim that Disney said was false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney said it was fully cooperating with an investigation into allegations by U.S. prosecutors that Bonnie Hoxie, an assistant to the head of corporate communications, and boyfriend Yonni Sebbag tried to sell insider information to more than 30 hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reference in the complaint to conversations regarding the ABC Network were and are false," Disney added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoxie is accused of giving confidential information about Disney's earnings to Sebbag, who in turn tried to sell it to U.S. and European hedge funds, according to criminal and civil charges filed in New York on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoxie and Sebbag -- otherwise known as Jonathan Cyrus -- were arrested by FBI agents in Los Angeles, law enforcement officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors in New York have been cracking down on insider trading, but this investigation is not part of the closely watched probe that ensnared Galleon hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and 20 others in October and November last year from Wall Street to Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an FBI sting operation, undercover agents contacted Sebbag, who in one email said he had learned Disney was in talks to sell ABC, a subject of speculation on Wall Street the company has never confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney ended 2.3 percent higher at $33.07 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday after rising as much as 4.7 percent earlier. Analysts said the shares had risen earlier on the claims regarding ABC rather than the insider trading charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a total embarrassment for Disney, but it can happen to any company. But what's far more interesting from the share value perspective is if they are selling ABC," said Alan Gould, an analyst with Soleil Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court documents said Hoxie and Sebbag conspired from March through May 25 of this year to try to profit from confidential information available to Hoxie as the assistant to an executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE STING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An undercover FBI agent who identified himself as a hedge fund trader began communicating with Sebbag on March 11, court documents said. On March 15, Sebbag wrote that Disney's chief executive was in advanced talks to sell ABC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bob Iger is in serious and advanced negotiations with two private equity firms to sell them the ABC network but no price has been determined yet," Sebbag wrote in the email, according to the criminal complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges. Its complaint said Sebbag was Hoxie's boyfriend. It said they sent anonymous letters to U.S. and European hedge funds, offering a pre-release of Disney second-quarter 2010 results in exchange for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal complaint filed in Manhattan federal court in New York charged Hoxie, 33, and Sebbag, 29, with conspiracy and wire fraud in allegations of illegal insider trading. The charges carry a maximum possible sentence of 20 years' imprisonment should they be found guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are scheduled to make an initial appearance before a judge in Los Angeles later on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is being prosecuted in New York rather than in Los Angeles because the pair contacted several hedge funds in New York. Sebbag stayed at a Manhattan hotel during a trip to collect payment for the sale of the confidential information about Disney, the complaints said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that meeting on May 14 with two putative traders, in reality FBI agents, Sebbag was paid $15,000 in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sebbag, with an envelope containing $15,000 in his grasp, revealed his true identity to the supposed traders and discussed building their relationship by providing more confidential Disney information in future, the complaints said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recording of the meeting, Sebbag told the undercover FBI agents his source at Disney was an assistant to one of the top five executives at the company. He said she had access to emails about sensitive business information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not (a one-time deal)," Sebbag said, according to the criminal complaint.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Apple Inc shot past Microsoft Corp as the world's biggest tech company based on market value on Wednesday, the latest milestone in the resurgence of the maker of the iPhone, which nearly went out of business in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple's shares rose as much 2.8 percent on Nasdaq on Wednesday, as Microsoft shares floundered, briefly pushing its market value above $229 billion, ahead of its longtime rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both stocks ended down after a late-day sell-off, but Apple emerged ahead with a market value of about $222 billion, compared with Microsoft's $219 billion, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple shares closed down 0.4 percent at $244.11 on Nasdaq, while Microsoft fell 4 percent to a seven-month low of $25.01.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Apple are worth more than 10 times what they were 10 years ago, as it has profited from revolutionizing consumer electronics with its stylish, easy to use products such as the iPod, iPhone and MacBook laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time Apple had a higher market value than Microsoft was December 19, 1989, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose operating system runs on more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers, has not been able to match growth rates from its hey-day 1990s. Its stock is down 20 percent from 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple, which struggled for many years to get its products into the mainstream, resorted to a $150 million investment from the much larger Microsoft in 1997 in order to keep it afloat. At that time, Microsoft's market value was more than five times that of Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft still leads Apple in sales. In the latest quarter, Microsoft reported $14.5 billion in revenue compared with Apple's $13.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cupertino, California-based Apple is now the second-largest company on the Standard  Poor's 500 index by market value, behind energy behemoth Exxon Mobil Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting Rodrigo Campos and David Gaffen; Editing by Gary Hill and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Housing Prices Mixed in March

While this is a mixed report, keep in mind that it is coming in the context of
massive government support for the housing market. Economic theory tells us that
when a transaction is subsidized, both the buyer and seller will share in the
subsidy. The seller`s share of the subsidy shows up in higher prices. 

Clearly, the home buying tax credit is a subsidy to the transaction. A more
indirect subsidy is the Fed`s now-completed purchase of $1.25 Trillion in
mortgage paper, mostly backed by Fannie Mae (NYSE: FNM) and Freddie Mac (NYSE:
FRE). That held mortgage rates below where they otherwise would have been, and
also helped to support housing prices. 

While that program has now expired, the crisis in Europe has caused the yields
on T-notes to plunge, and mortgage rates have followed suit. The tax credit
support is in the process of coming off. In the Case Schiller data we should see
its effect for one more month, as house have to be under contract by the end of
April to qualify. 

It seems likely that when the government crutches come off that house prices
could start to fall again. However, with prices already down by close to 30%
from the peak, prices are not nearly as out of line with incomes and rents as
they were a few years ago. Thus, any future declines are likely to be moderate,
at least relative to what we have seen already. 

Homeowners Equity to Take Another Hit?

Given the leveraged nature of the housing market, even small declines in the
price of a house can have an outsized impact on homeowners equity. Homeowners
equity is, or at least was, the principal store of wealth for the vast majority
of Americans. 

Each decline in home prices pushes more homeowners underwater. The further
underwater people become, the more likely they are to simply walk away from
their house. Sometimes they will arrange what is known as a short sale, where
the house is sold for less than the value of the mortgage. If there is a second
mortgage (and homeowners lines of credit of HELOC`s are generally second
mortgages) on the property, it is usually wiped out. 

Others will simply stop paying their mortgage and live rent- and mortgage-free
until the sheriff eventually shows up to throw them out of the house. Neither
course of action is good news for the big banks that have large exposures to the
residential mortgage market, like Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) or JPMorgan Chase
(NYSE: JPM). 

Earnings Scorecard: Boeing Co.

Following the earnings release of Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) on April 21,
analysts covering the stock have become apprehensive of its near-term prospects
and revised downwards their estimates. The market has reacted similarly, and the
stock to date has fallen by approximately 16% subsequent to its earnings
release. 

The Street was apprehensive of Boeing`s ability to recover since its commercial
airplane deliveries were badly affected by cancellations and deferment from
customers recovering from the aftermath of the worldwide recession. 

Boeing following the earnings release witnessed mixed estimate revision trends
for the short and the long term. Over the past month, only 3 analysts (out of
22) revised estimates positively for the upcoming quarter, while 2 revised their
estimates downward. 

For fiscal 2010, all 12 analysts tracking the stock are waiting on the sidelines
for any news trigger for revising their estimates. The stock is currently
trading at a premium to the peer group and the S 500, based on forward
earnings estimates.

Stock Market Movers, Money Makers

Since the opening highs of the Dollar, a pullback has occurred. The markets in
response have inched higher into the gap down low from Friday. On the SPDR S
500 ETF (NYSE: SPY), this level is $105.90. The SPY has hit it many times today
and has yet to break through. As long as the markets stay below this level, look
for a possible retest of the lows of the day. Should the markets inch above this
$105.90 level, the markets may continue to advance higher for the rest of the
day. 

The key for this market remains Europe and the Euro. Europe must find some way
to calm the fears of default and get the Euro to inch higher. So far this has
not been possible. 

While most financial stocks continue to be under pressure, Goldman Sachs Group,
Inc. (NYSE: GS) is trading nicely higher. The stock is at $138.53 +$1.84
(1.35%). This is in a sharp contrasts to stocks like Wells Fargo &amp; Company
(NYSE: WFC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS),
which are all solidly lower on the day. One has to wonder if Goldman Sachs is
making a killing on the crazy volatility in this market. Earnings may be
insanely huge when they report for the current quarter.

&lt;p&gt;$38 Billion In Shareholder Value Defies CEO Watson

Board Members Confronted by Angry Shareholders, Indigenous Leaders; Five People
Arrested As Company Refuses Proxies
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Chevron`s annual shareholder meeting erupted in chaos today after CEO John
Watson received a stern rebuke from shareholders for its Ecuador environmental
disaster and a 71-year-old Ecuadorian woman said the company was responsible for
an environmental atrocity in the rainforest that cost her two children and was
devastating the lives of thousands of people. 

Chevron`s management also seemed to panic during the meeting when they summoned
the Houston police to arrest noted author and Chevron critic Antonia Juhasz when
she confronted Watson over Chevron`s environmental record. Four other
individuals - all well-known critics of the company - also were also arrested
when they were refused entry despite having proxies from shareholders. 

"Chevron`s [CEO] Watson lost control of the meeting and it degenerated into
chaos and ended abruptly," said Maria Ramos, an organizer with the Rainforest
Action Network, a San Francisco-based group that has been campaigning against
the company. "It was obvious that Watson has very thin skin when it comes to
Chevron`s critics." 

In all, only seven of the 27 persons with proxies that were brought by the
environmental groups were allowed to enter the meeting - possibly an "illegal
act" that violates SEC regulations, said Ramos. Chevron selectively enforced
various proxy rules to keep critics out of the meeting, Ramos said. 

"Chevron was smarting for a confrontation today and then lost its head when it
happened," said Ramos. 

Others arrested were Mitch Anderson, the lead campaign coordinator against
Chevron for Amazon Watch; Han Shan, also a leading Chevron critic who works with
Amazon Watch; the Rev. Kenneth David from Richmond, California, the site of a
Chevron refinery that local residents say causes pollution; and Juan Parras, a
Houston-based organizer who has confronted Chevron over pollution at its
refineries in Texas. 

Chevron`s management team also suffered a humiliating rebuke when shareholders
supported a resolution stemming from the Ecuador problem with a whopping 26% of
the vote representing approximately $38 billion in shareholder value.
(Generally, any shareholder resolution that receives 10% support is considered a
success given the opposition of management.) 

The resolution, which called for the company to appoint a director with
environmental expertise, was co-sponsored by the Pennsylvania State Treasury,
Trillium Asset Management Corporation, and Amnesty International USA. Risk
Metrics, an influential investment advisory group, advised shareholders to
support the resolution. 

Marianna Jimenez, a 71-year-old grandmother from Ecuador, stood up during the
meeting and said Chevron`s pollution had caused the deaths of two of her
children. She told Watson: "I want you to take responsibility for this crime
that your company has committed in my country." 

Watson also received a direct challenge from Ramos in the meeting when he was
nominated to join Chevron`s Board. Watson was the Chevron executive with lead
responsibility for integrating Texaco into the company in 2001. 

"A particular important question for shareholders is whether Watson, as
architect of the merger, adequately vetted Texaco before purchasing the company
for $31 billion - a sum only $4 billion more than its current exposure in the
Ecuador lawsuit," said Ramos. Watson responded by saying Chevron had been
"richly rewarded" by its acquisition of Texaco. 

Speaking in front of Chevron`s Houston headquarters before the meeting,
Ecuadorian indigenous leaders demanded that Watson stop hiding the disaster that
Chevron`s operations have caused in Ecuador. Guillermo Grefa, from the Kichwa
tribe, said: "We must not allow Chevron to continue lying to us about its
contamination in the Amazon." 

Chevron has admitted to dumping at least 15 billion gallons of toxic "produced
water" into the region`s water supply when it operated an oil concession in
Ecuador between 1964 and 1990. It also abandoned more than 900 unlined waste
pits, causing an outbreak of cancer and the decimation of indigenous groups,
according to evidence in trial. 

"Mountains of evidence in the trial prove what the people of the Ecuadorian
Amazon already know; that Chevron is guilty of massive toxic contamination in
Ecuador," said Shan before his arrest. "Instead of taking responsibility,
Chevron is weaving an ever more complex web of deception and deceit, and it`s
time for Chevron`s Board of Directors to put an end to it." 

Chevron General Counsel Hewitt Pate also has come under fire for making false
statements designed to mislead shareholders about the trial process in Ecuador.
Pate, a Deputy Attorney General in the Bush administration, has been criticized
for not adequately disclosing the company`s risks in Ecuador to shareholders - a
fact which prompted an inquiry into Chevron`s public disclosures last year from
the New York Attorney General. 

At last year`s annual Chevron meeting, a resolution relating to Ecuador that
asked the company to adopt a "verifiable" human rights policy garnered a
remarkable $37 billion in voting shares out of the $133 billion outstanding. 

"The entire issue of corporate compliance with human rights norms is trending
heavily against Chevron, which is falling behind most of its peers in this
area," said Ramos.

&lt;p&gt;Nationally Recognized Leader in Electronics Recycling Systems Joins CEA
ARLINGTON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) today announced that Walter Alcorn
has been named Vice President, Environmental Affairs and Industry
Sustainability. Alcorn, co-founder of the National Center for Electronics
Recycling (NCER), is a nationally recognized environmental consultant
specializing in electronics recycling systems. 

"We`re thrilled to have Walter lead our environmental policy efforts," said Gary
Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA. "His deep knowledge of the issues surrounding
electronics recycling will be a critical asset to the industry as we move
forward with recommendations for national electronics recycling policy." 

In addition to founding NCER in 2005, Alcorn led the development of the National
Electronics Recycling Infrastructure Clearinghouse (NERIC), a joint effort
between NCER and CEA. In 2006, he authored a study that compared compliance
costs of a state-by-state versus a federal approach to electronics producer
responsibility mandates and later co-founded an organization to provide
compliance assistance services to electronics manufacturers subject to state and
local electronics recycling mandates. 

In addition to electronics recycling, Alcorn will take on other priority issues
for CEA, including legislative initiatives impacting electronic product design,
eco-labeling and hazardous materials restrictions. 

Amy Dempster has also been promoted to Senior Manager, Governmental Affairs and
Environmental Policy. She will manage a range of environmental policy issues as
well as transportation and infrastructure initiatives on behalf of the industry.

&lt;p&gt;Dolsten was previously research head at Wyeth, which Pfizer acquired in October for $67 billion. Revenue from lucrative Wyeth biotech products, including blockbuster arthritis drug Enbrel, will help Pfizer endure expected plunging sales of its Lipitor cholesterol fighter when the world's top-selling medicine faces generic competition late next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said Mackay, a soft-spoken and personable native of Scotland, had resigned and left the company "immediately." He had led Pfizer's PharmaTherapeutics research team since October, having been the company's global research chief for the previous two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mackay will take on the new role of president of RD at AstraZeneca on July 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dolsten, who headed Wyeth's research operations for about a year and a half, became Pfizer's president of BioTherapeutics Research after the merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That left Mackay and Dolsten as highly visible co-heads of research. Mackay took the lead on conventional drugs made from chemicals, while Dolsten headed up research on biotech products, complex proteins made in living cells that Pfizer aims to make a highly lucrative mainstay of its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That structure was unusual," Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said. "It struck me as potentially a vetting period for Dolsten," to better assess his leadership skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, AstraZeneca has separated the two stages of RD by having a head of drug discovery and a head of drug development, leaving some investors uncertain about the focus of its pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mackay's appointment brings the two roles together as the company overhauls RD operations to prepare for a wave of patent expiries on top drugs like Nexium, for acid reflux, and Seroquel, for schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca spokesman Neil McCrae said a unified head of RD would speed up decision making and help in the allocation of resources between different projects at a time of major change in the company's research laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We set out our strategy for RD in January, which calls for some significant changes as we seek to improve the productivity of our pipeline," he said. "In addition, since the acquisition of MedImmune, it has become clear that we need a single point of accountability to manage the entire RD portfolio."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mackay has extensive experience working on both sides of the Atlantic. Prior to joining Pfizer in 1995, he focused on research into central nervous system diseases at Ciba-Geigy, now part of Novartis (NOVN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of AstraZeneca were up 0.7 percent in London. In morning New York Stock Exchange trading, the stock (AZN.N) was down 0.7 percent at $41.03, while Pfizer gained 1.0 percent to $15.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Hirschler and Ransdell Pierson; additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Paul Sandle and Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) as the world's biggest tech company as
measured by market value on Wednesday, the latest milestone in
the resurgence of the maker of the iPhone, which nearly went
out of business in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple's shares rose 1 percent on Nasdaq on Wednesday,
pushing its market value up to $225.1 billion and ahead of
Microsoft's $222.7 billion, according to Reuters data. Apple

Microsoft shares were down 2.2 percent to $25.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Apple are worth more than 10 times what they were

iPod, iPhone and MacBook laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, whose operating system runs on more than 90
percent of the world's PCs, has not been able to match growth
rates of previous years. Its stock is down about 18 percent
from 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple, which struggled for many years to get its products
into the mainstream, resorted to a $150 million investment from
the much larger Microsoft in 1997 in order to keep it afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cupertino, California-based Apple is now the second-largest
company on the SP 500 index by market value, behind energy
behemoth Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N).

 (Adds comments from news conference)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Anna Driver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DALLAS, May 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) chief
executive said on Wednesday his company was still working with
BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) to contain the massive oil spill in the
Gulf of Mexico and urged U.S. policymakers to take a thoughtful
response to the accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They need to recognize that there have been very effective
procedures in place," Rex Tillerson, Exxon's CEO, told
reporters after the company's annual meeting. He added that
about 14,000 deepwater wells around the world have been drilled
safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, has drilled 262
deepwter wells wordwide without indcident, and 35 of those were
in the Gulf of Mexico, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company continues to assist BP by providing boats and
personnel in the effort to contain the oil that is gushing from
a ruptured well nearly a mile below the ocean's surface in the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's drilling plans are developed "to anticipate risk at
every step of the operation," Tillerson said. The company's
offshore operations have not been disrupted except for plans
for an exploratory well in the Gulf of Mexico. [ID:nWEN5165]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In response to the accident, the U.S. Mineral Management
Service has banned new drilling until inspections are completed
by May 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP was leasing the Deepwater Horizon rig when it exploded
on April 20, killing 11 workers and triggering a spill that
threatens some of the richest fisheries in the United States
and has already soiled more than 70 miles (113 km) of
Louisiana's 400-mile (644 km) coastline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For more than a month, the amount of crude oil leaking into
the Gulf has been the center of intense debate. Estimates range
from 5,000 to 100,000 bpd (210,000 gallons/795,000 litres to
420,000 gallons/1.6 million litres).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANNUAL MEETING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eleven shareholder proposals including two new ones calling
for increased disclosures about Exxon's oil sands mining
operations and hydraulic fracturing failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe increased disclosure is critical for investors
to understand the scope of Exxon's investment in the oil
sands," Emily Stone, a shareholder advocate said ahead of the
meeting on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO), which is majority owned by
Exxon, is planning an $7.4 billion Kearl oil sands mining
project, where production is expected in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon also faced questions about its planned merger with
XTO Energy Inc XTO.N, a company that drills for natural gas
onshore in North America using techniques like hydraulic
fracturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Environmentalists and others worry those fluids, which are
pumped at very high pressure to crack rock and release gas, are
toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's nothing in there (the fluid) that is particularly
exotic," Tillerson told Exxon shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon agreed to buy XTO Energy Inc in December in an
all-stock deal that was valued around $30 billion at the time.
At current prices, the transaction is now valued at about $24
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; XTO shareholders are due to vote on the merger on June 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Police outnumbered protesters outside Exxon's Irving, Texas
annual shareholders meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Robinson, wearing a T-shirt that read "Dump the
Pump" and several others showed up to protest a wide range of
issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have been polluting the world for years," Robinson
said, adding that the BP spill heightened the need for better
accountability from all of the oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's shares rose 45 cents to $60.16 in afternoon trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; * Protesters chant outside, inside Chevron annual meeting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 5 activists arrested, including one who spoke at meeting
 (Adds five activists arrested, more detail from meeting,
byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, May 26 (Reuters) - Discussions of safety were
prominent at Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) annual shareholder meeting
in Houston on Wednesday, as a blown-out BP Plc (BP.L) well
continued to spew oil into the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Watson, who took over as chief executive and chairman
of the second-largest U.S. oil company this year, highlighted
Chevron's improving safety record in an industry that he said
could never completely eliminate risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But we can mitigate risk," Watson told the meeting as he
discussed last month's explosion on a BP-operated rig that led
to the spill. "There will be lessons to learn. Our industry
will learn them, our industry will share them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apart from the new man at the helm, it was also a different
venue this year for Chevron, which held last year's meeting at
its San Ramon, California headquarters. But familiar criticism
from shareholders and activist representatives surfaced,
including a massive potential legal liability in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just this week, Chevron asked Ecuador's courts to disregard
an environmental expert who had said the company should pay $27
billion in damages for the pollution there. [ID:nN24181826]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit contends that Texaco, which Chevron bought in
2001, polluted the jungle and damaged the health of local
residents by dumping billions of gallons of contaminated water
over two decades, before leaving in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watson expressed sympathy over the environmental damage
that led to the lawsuit, but said Texaco had done its share of
the remediation, and pinned the blame for any remaining
problems on state-owned Petroecuador, which took over
operations there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watson also answered criticism of Chevron's natural gas
interests in Myanmar by saying such projects required long lead
times, and many things could change before they were finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Over that time period, we can see considerable change in
host governments," he said. "In some cases, we may like the
change, in some cases we may not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the environmentalists' concerns seemed to resonate
with the rest of the shareholders. More than a quarter of them
voted for a proposal to appoint a board director with
environmental expertise, according to a preliminary count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the question and answer session, Antonia Juhasz, author
of "The Tyranny of Oil," offered a heated critique of Chevron's
environmental record and then joined a few other activists in
several minutes of chanting "Chevron lies" before Watson
brought the meeting to a close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About three dozen protesters, including a few wearing
turtle costumes, greeted shareholders with signs and more
chants as they left Chevron's office in downtown Houston. The
protesters were corralled by several city police officers,
including five on horseback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five activists, including Juhasz, were arrested after the
meeting, according to a spokeswoman for the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She said the other four had been refused entry to the
meeting, including Reverend Ken Davis, who at last year's
meeting lambasted former CEO David O'Reilly over pollution from
Chevron's refinery in Richmond, California, where Davis lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One shareholder at Wednesday's meeting invited Watson to
move Chevron's headquarters to Houston, where the company would
be more welcome than it was in California. "They want gasoline,
but no drilling," he said amid laughter. "Is that right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watson, a California native who earned his undergraduate
degree in the state, said he certainly enjoyed visiting
Houston, but assured his shareholders that Chevron would remain
based in California "for a long time."

 (Adds employee shared info on ABC sale, analyst comment,
bylines)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sue Zeidler and Grant McCool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - A Walt Disney Co
(DIS.N) employee and her boyfriend have been charged with
trying to sell insider information to over 30 hedge funds,
including a tip that the media and consumer giant was in
advanced talks to sell its struggling ABC TV network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An assistant to the company's head of corporate
communications gave confidential information about Disney's
quarterly earnings to her boyfriend, who in turn tried to sell
it to U.S. and European hedge funds, according to criminal and
civil insider trading charges filed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bonnie Hoxie and her friend, Yonni Sebbag -- otherwise
known as Jonathan Cyrus -- were arrested by FBI agents in Los
Angeles, law enforcement officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a sting operation, undercover agents contacted Sebbag,
who in one email said he had learned that the company was in
discussions to sell ABC -- which Wall Street had speculated on
but the company has never confirmed. [ID:nN10165402]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Disney were up 3.2 percent to $33.35 in afternoon
trading, boosted by the possibility of an ABC sale rather than
hurt by the charging of an employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a total embarrassment for Disney, but it can happen
to any company. But what's far more interesting from the share
value perspective is if they are selling ABC," said Alan Gould,
an analyst with Soleil Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney representatives did not return calls for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A statement by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney said that from
March 2010 through May 25, 2010, Hoxie was employed as a
secretary to Disney's Head of Corporate Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In this capacity, Hoxie obtained material, nonpublic
information, including Disney's quarterly earnings statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Then, in violation of her duties of trust and confidence,
Hoxie disclosed the Inside Information to Sebbag, who in turn
disclosed the inside information to outside investors for the
purpose of trading in advance of the official public
announcement of Disney's earnings," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE STING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to court documents, an undercover FBI agent who
identified himself as a hedge fund trader began communicating
with Sebbag on March 11. On March 15, Sebbag wrote that
Disney's chief executive was in advanced talks to sell ABC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Bob Iger is in serious and advanced negotiations with two
private equity firms to sell them the ABC network but no price
has been determined yet," Sebbag wrote in the email, according
to the court document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related
civil charges. Its complaint said Sebbag was Hoxie's boyfriend.
It said they sent anonymous letters to U.S. and European hedge
funds, offering pre-release of Disney second quarter 2010
results in exchange for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The criminal complaint filed in Manhattan federal court in
New York charged Hoxie, 33, and Sebbag, 29, with conspiracy and
wire fraud in allegations of illegal insider trading. The
charges carry a maximum possible sentence of 20 years
imprisonment if they are found guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are scheduled to make an initial appearance before a
judge in Los Angeles later on Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt; * CEO says can only seek to mitigate risk in oil industry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Protesters chant outside, inside Chevron annual meeting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 26 (Reuters) - Discussions of safety featured
especially high on the agenda at Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) annual
shareholder meeting in Houston on Wednesday, as a blown-out
BP Plc (BP.L) well continued to spew oil into the Gulf of
Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Watson, who took over as chief executive and chairman
of the second-largest U.S. oil company this year, highlighted
Chevron's improving safety record in an industry that he said
could never completely eliminate risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But we can mitigate risk," Watson told the meeting as he
discussed last month's explosion on a rig operated by BP that
led to the spill. "There will be lessons to learn. Our industry
will learn them, our industry will share them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a different venue this year for Chevron, which held
last year's meeting at its San Ramon, California headquarters,
and a new man at the helm, but some familiar criticism from
shareholders and activist representatives surfaced, including
the massive potential legal liability in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just this week, Chevron asked Ecuador's courts to disregard
an environmental expert who has said the company should pay $27
billion in damages for the pollution there. [ID:nN24181826]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit contends that Texaco, which Chevron bought in
2001, polluted the jungle and damaged the health of local
residents by dumping billions of gallons of contaminated water
over two decades, before leaving in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watson expressed sympathy for the environmental damage that
led to the lawsuit, but said Texaco had done its share of the
remediation, and pinned the blame for any continuing problems
on Petroecuador, which took over responsibility for operations
there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the question and answer session, Antonia Juhasz,
author of "The Tyranny of Oil," offered a heated critique of
Chevron's environmental record before joining a few other
activists in several minutes of chanting "Chevron lies" before
Watson brought the meeting to a close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About three dozen protesters, including a few wearing
turtle costumes, greeted shareholders with signs and more
chanting as they left the Chevron office in downtown Houston.
The protesters were corralled by several city police officers,
including five on horseback.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
A combination of safe, reliable operations and superior execution helped Chevron
Corporation (NYSE:CVX) generate value for stockholders, maintain financial
strength and advance a leading queue of projects, attendees were told today at
the company`s 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 

"The world needs energy, and it will need more energy as the global economic
recovery takes hold," said John Watson, chairman and CEO. "As our employees work
to supply energy to fuel the world`s growing economies, our commitment to safe
and reliable operations will remain a core value." 

Watson discussed Chevron`s strong 2009 financial performance, which produced
earnings of $10.48 billion. The company increased the quarterly dividend by 4.6
percent in 2009, marking 22 consecutive years of annual dividend increases.
During this period, dividends grew at an average annual rate of 7 percent.
Continuing the tradition, Chevron announced another quarterly dividend increase
in April 2010. Watson said Chevron led its peers in total stockholder returns in
the past three- and five-year periods, besting the S 500 by more than 10
percentage points over those spans. In Chevron`s 2010 first quarter, net income
was up sharply from the same period in 2009, and production increased 5 percent.


Watson also reinforced Chevron`s long-standing commitment to safe, reliable
operations. Chevron is an industry leader in safety and in 2009 achieved the
best safety performance in the company`s history. Watson also discussed the
support that Chevron is lending to efforts in the Gulf of Mexico spill response.
This includes participation in industry task forces assessing offshore
procedures. 

George Kirkland, Chevron`s vice chairman and executive vice president, Global
Upstream and Gas, noted that future energy demand is going to be strong,
especially in developing countries, and Chevron is investing in a world-class
queue of projects to meet the world`s future energy needs. Chevron plans on
investing $21.6 billion in 2010, with 85 percent of that expected to fund
upstream activities. 

Kirkland noted that in 2009 production grew to 2.7 million barrels per day.
Since 2002, Chevron has added more than 9 billion barrels of oil-equivalent
resources to its portfolio through exploration efforts. Nine major capital
projects started up in 2009, demonstrating Chevron`s ability to execute large
projects. Production from project startups between 2007 and 2009 has grown to
460,000 barrels per day. These projects, along with new startups, are forecast
to deliver more than 800,000 barrels per day by 2012. He also spoke about 10
major capital projects that are expected to begin production during the next
three years and have a Chevron investment of more than $1 billion each. 

Kirkland stated that the centerpieces of Chevron`s future production growth are
the Gorgon and Wheatstone natural gas projects in Australia. Chevron`s $37
billion Gorgon project reached the final investment decision in 2009, and first
liquefied natural gas is expected in 2014. Gorgon is expected to be the largest
CO2 injection project in the world, with plans to inject and store up to 4
million metric tons of CO2 annually - more than four times as much as any other
project in the world, reducing Gorgon`s greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 40
percent. Wheatstone is in front-end engineering and design, with the final
investment decision anticipated in 2011. 

Kirkland also discussed Chevron`s downstream advantages, which include
industry-leading refinery utilization and assets in North America and Asia, two
of the world`s strongest regions for refining and retail sales. Kirkland
commented that Chevron`s downstream business leaders are taking steps to react
to tough market conditions, high-grading the portfolio by exiting some locations
and continuing to reduce costs while adhering to stringent safety standards. He
noted that by creating a smaller portfolio while retaining volume and scale,
Chevron intends to improve focus, efficiency and profitability. 

Chevron stockholders voted on nine proposals. As of May 25, 2010, the
preliminary report of the Inspector of Election was as follows:

* Item 1: More than 1.2 billion shares, or approximately 94 percent of the votes
cast, were voted for the 16 nominees for election to the board of directors.

proposal to approve amending Chevron`s bylaws to reduce the percentage of

&lt;p&gt;PlantBottle Packaging Receives Gold Medal At DuPont Awards for Packaging
Innovation


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company received high honors at the 22nd annual, global DuPont
Awards for Packaging Innovation. The Company`s PlantBottle packaging earned a
gold award, out of more than 160 global entrants in the overall program, for its
demonstrated breakthrough packaging innovation. 

Made of up to 30 percent plant-based material, PlantBottle packaging is a
natural step toward the Bottle of the Future. It is the first of its kind -
beverage packaging made from renewable sources that is 100 percent recyclable,
like traditional PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic. PlantBottle packaging
can be recycled in the existing commercial recycling infrastructure. 

The prestigious DuPont Award is the packaging industry`s longest running,
independently judged global award program. Leading international industry and
sustainability experts judge entrants on their excellence in innovation,
sustainability and cost/waste reduction. "Our journey has only just begun, but
the initial success we have seen in the marketplace along with highly credible
recognition like this from DuPont show that we are making progress and
delivering packaging innovation in response to consumers, customers and our
franchise insights and business needs," said Scott Vitters, PlantBottle Business
Lead, The Coca-Cola Company. 

Launched in Denmark in December 2009, PlantBottle packaging is now available in
a variety of pack sizes in the Company`s sparkling and still beverage portfolio
in the United States, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Brazil and Norway. This innovative
sustainable packaging is a key example of how the Company has continuously
evolved its packaging over the years. The Company has maintained its
high-quality performance while improving its environmental impact. 

Through the development of this innovative PlantBottle packaging, The Coca-Cola
Company is able to reduce its reliance on nonrenewable resources. Preliminary
research indicates that the carbon footprint of PlantBottle packaging is an
improvement over that of traditional PET bottles. 

Dr. Shell Huang, Director, Packaging Research, The Coca-Cola Company says her
team is already working on the next generation PlantBottle packaging, "We are
working with R partners to advance next generation technologies to allow us to
produce future generations of PlantBottle packaging. Our ultimate vision is to
develop recyclable plastic bottles made from 100 percent renewable materials." 

Exal Corporation, the supplier that produces the aluminum Coca-Cola contour
bottle, took home a Diamond Award in the DuPont program for their lightweight
"Coil to Can" manufacturing technology which features recyclable aluminum alloy.


FEMSA, the largest bottler of Coca-Cola products in Latin America, was awarded a
notable accomplishment for its "IIF Inside Injection Foaming Process" which
enables highly durable, recyclable plastic pallets to replace wooden ones.

&lt;p&gt;Companies Combine the Ariba Commerce Cloud and IBM LotusLive to Fuel Better
Commerce
ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Ariba, Inc. (Nasdaq: ARBA), the leading provider of collaborative business
commerce solutions, and IBM (NYSE: IBM) have signed an agreement designed to
help fuel better commerce by matching business-to-business buyers and sellers of
goods and services in the Cloud using state-of-the-art collaboration and social
networking technologies. 

Ariba plans to integrate its cloud solution, the Ariba Commerce Cloud, with IBM
LotusLive to help buyers and sellers communicate and share information more
fluidly and effectively, leading to faster, more confident business decisions
for organizations of all sizes. The news came during Ariba LIVE, the premier
conference for business professionals engaged in buying, selling or managing
cash being held at the JW Marriot Grand Lakes in Orlando, Florida. 

"Finding the right trading partners is hard. Collaborating with them to do
business better is even harder," said Bhaskar Himatsingka, Chief Technology
Officer, Ariba, Inc. "Our integration plans with IBM LotusLive are designed to
help make it easier for buyers and sellers to collaborate in new ways by taking
advantage of IBM`s powerful set of web-based tools for real-time collaboration
within Ariba`s sourcing and sales process solutions." 

Simplified Interactions

Face-to-face meetings, phone calls, faxes, documents and spreadsheets are
quickly being leapfrogged by more advanced, efficient methods of collaboration
and communication such as Web conferencing, instant messaging, social networking
and file sharing, among other things. To help companies take advantage of these
advances, Ariba plans to integrate IBM`s LotusLive with Ariba &#174; Discovery&#8482;, a
web-based service that helps buyers and sellers find each other quickly and
efficiently for new business opportunities by automatically matching buyers`
business requirements to seller capabilities. 

Integrating LotusLive communication and collaboration into the buyer-seller
discovery process will lead to better business results for buyers and sellers by
providing them the tools to interact, answer questions and exchange accurate
information prior to entering the formal RFI/P or contracting phase. 

"A successful integration with IBM LotusLive would enable us to move beyond
document-driven interactions with our customers and collaborate in a true
sense," said Tricia Johnson, Western Regional Sales Manager, Eagle Press, and
user of the Ariba Commerce Cloud. 

A unique Web-based platform that enables companies to buy, sell and manage cash
more efficiently and effectively than ever before, the Ariba Commerce Cloud
provides companies with everything needed to manage collaborative
inter-enterprise commerce, including market-leading technology, expert skills
and capabilities and the world`s largest global trading community. 

LotusLive delivers cloud-based, integrated email, Web conferencing, social
networking and collaboration services to help simplify and improve daily
business interactions with customers, partners and colleagues -- all with IBM's
focus on security, reliability and integration. 

"Like people searching for someone special, businesses are looking for a high
degree of compatibility with their prospective partners," said Sean Poulley,
Vice President, IBM Cloud Collaboration. "The successful combination of
LotusLive and the Ariba Commerce Cloud will provide such a matchmaking comfort
zone in which networks of partners, suppliers and customers can easily work
together across company boundaries to help do their jobs more efficiently and
cost-effectively, and perhaps even develop lasting relationships."

</body></entry><entry author="Joseph Giannone" date="2010-05-26T14:41:50+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressReleasesMolt/idUSTRE64P3UN20100526"><headline>Spotlight on Goldman making wealth unit uneasy</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK. (Reuters) - The public spotlight on Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is making things uncomfortable for the secretive bank's wealth managers and may crack open the door for rivals looking to lure business away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank with the Midas touch has seen its reputation tarnished after regulators accused it of fraud in connection with the design and marketing of a subprime mortgage security in which investors lost about $1 billion. Lawmakers questioned its business practices and portrayed Goldman as a firm that favors its own interests over those of its clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, Goldman's Private Wealth Management advisers have largely stayed put. Still, the episode has given wealthy clients pause and made some of the firm's roughly 350 U.S. advisers more open to considering a move, recruiters and industry rivals said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are talking to a lot of their advisers. They are all saying that their relationships are strong but that every client is asking about the accusations of conflicts (of interest) . It's a little draining," said Mindy Diamond, whose recruiting firm, Diamond Consultants, has worked with Goldman advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman formed its private wealth business to help retain some of the windfalls reaped by investment bank clients. The unit's 25,000 accounts also generate business for Goldman's trading desks and invest in its buyout, real estate and hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet these clients -- individuals with at least $10 million of assets as well as some family offices and foundations -- are sensitive to conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has scrambled to reassure customers that it is committed to their interests. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein recently spoke to private wealth clients in a rare conference call, promising the firm would "analyze what we did and how we got ourselves into this place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokeswoman Melissa Daly declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONG SHADOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has denied the fraud charges. Still, competitors are using the Securities and Exchange Commission allegations and the broader scrutiny of the bank's ethics to lure away some of Goldman's deep-pocketed clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This case definitely casts a long shadow with clients," said a senior executive at a national high-net-worth adviser. "It makes clients wonder about the differences in objectivity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Goldman clients are making inquiries about moving parts of their holdings out of Goldman, said an executive who runs a high-net-worth firm in the U.S. Southeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The door's more open now because (Goldman's) image is somewhat tarnished. It's creating a tough market obstacle for them to overcome," the executive said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attracting new clients and assets has become difficult in this environment, according to Goldman rivals and recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank pushes advisers to constantly bring in clients, and conducts weekly meetings where advisers must report their efforts to bring in new assets, a former Goldman broker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boutique advisory firms contend Goldman's business model stresses the sale of investment products, many of which are manufactured by Goldman. That is hardly unique among Wall Street brokers, but clients sometimes can suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They made money. I didn't," said one financial industry executive who was a former Goldman client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it is not easy to lure Goldman brokers away. Historically, the bank has kept a strong hold on its brokers, recruiters said, since many clients were loyal to the firm rather than the individual adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients also find it difficult to move accounts that hold Goldman investments that cannot be quickly sold or moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHAGRINED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tight-lipped Goldman is especially secretive about its wealth management unit. The bank does not disclose the unit's performance and makes no mention of it in quarterly filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its latest 10-K filing, Goldman said it managed $231 billion for individuals at the end of 2009, up more than 7 percent from a year earlier. The Standard  Poor's 500 index rose 23 percent last year, and hedge funds rose 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's asset management division, which includes private wealth management, had $39 billion of first-quarter outflows as it grappled with a spate of money-losing funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, there has been little movement among advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman people are a little chagrined by all the visibility, to put it mildly, but so far advisers are staying put," said recruiter Courtney Raymond of Houston-based Courtney Raymond Consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been a few departures this year. Credit Suisse Group's (CSGN.VX) U.S. private bank in February poached seven Goldman advisers in Atlanta. Citigroup's (C.N) Citi Private Bank a few weeks ago hired Goldman's Rudolf Hitsch in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Goldman broker estimates more than 10 teams have left the bank over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many recruiters said Goldman's public relations disaster will have to persist for quite a bit longer, and hit brokers in their wallets, before the industry sees major defections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see advisers going out the door at this point. It's wait and see," said Michael King of Michael King Associates. "I do think that this puts a chink in their armor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A. Giannone and Joe Rauch; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * No signs of attrition, but brokers making inquiries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman executives scramble to reassure clients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Adding new clients tougher amid fraud accusations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joseph Giannone and Joe Rauch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK. May 26 (Reuters) - The public spotlight on
Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is making things uncomfortable for the
secretive bank's wealth managers and may crack open the door
for rivals looking to lure business away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank with the Midas touch has seen its reputation
tarnished after regulators accused it of fraud in connection
with the design and marketing of a subprime mortgage security
in which investors lost about $1 billion. Lawmakers questioned
its business practices and portrayed Goldman as a firm that
favors its own interests over those of its clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far, Goldman's Private Wealth Management advisers have
largely stayed put. Still, the episode has given wealthy
clients pause and made some of the firm's roughly 350 U.S.
advisers more open to considering a move, recruiters and
industry rivals said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are talking to a lot of their advisers. They are all
saying that their relationships are strong but that every
client is asking about the accusations of conflicts (of
interest) . It's a little draining," said Mindy Diamond, whose
recruiting firm, Diamond Consultants, has worked with Goldman
advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman formed its private wealth business to help retain
some of the windfalls reaped by investment bank clients. The
unit's 25,000 accounts also generate business for Goldman's
trading desks and invest in its buyout, real estate and hedge
funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet these clients -- individuals with at least $10 million
of assets as well as some family offices and foundations -- are
sensitive to conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has scrambled to reassure customers that it is
committed to their interests. Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein
recently spoke to private wealth clients in a rare conference
call, promising the firm would "analyze what we did and how we
got ourselves into this place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokeswoman Melissa Daly declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONG SHADOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has denied the fraud charges. Still, competitors
are using the Securities and Exchange Commission allegations
and the broader scrutiny of the bank's ethics to lure away some
of Goldman's deep-pocketed clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This case definitely casts a long shadow with clients,"
said a senior executive at a national high-net-worth adviser.
"It makes clients wonder about the differences in
objectivity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some Goldman clients are making inquiries about moving
parts of their holdings out of Goldman, said an executive who
runs a high-net-worth firm in the U.S. Southeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The door's more open now because (Goldman's) image is
somewhat tarnished. It's creating a tough market obstacle for
them to overcome," the executive said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attracting new clients and assets has become difficult in
this environment, according to Goldman rivals and recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank pushes advisers to constantly bring in clients,
and conducts weekly meetings where advisers must report their
efforts to bring in new assets, a former Goldman broker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boutique advisory firms contend Goldman's business model
stresses the sale of investment products, many of which are
manufactured by Goldman. That is hardly unique among Wall
Street brokers, but clients sometimes can suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They made money. I didn't," said one financial industry
executive who was a former Goldman client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, it is not easy to lure Goldman brokers away.
Historically, the bank has kept a strong hold on its brokers,
recruiters said, since many clients were loyal to the firm
rather than the individual adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clients also find it difficult to move accounts that hold
Goldman investments that cannot be quickly sold or moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHAGRINED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tight-lipped Goldman is especially secretive about its
wealth management unit. The bank does not disclose the unit's
performance and makes no mention of it in quarterly filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its latest 10-K filing, Goldman said it managed $231
billion for individuals at the end of 2009, up more than 7
percent from a year earlier. The Standard  Poor's 500 index
rose 23 percent last year, and hedge funds rose 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's asset management division, which includes private
wealth management, had $39 billion of first-quarter outflows as
it grappled with a spate of money-losing funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For now, there has been little movement among advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman people are a little chagrined by all the
visibility, to put it mildly, but so far advisers are staying
put," said recruiter Courtney Raymond of Houston-based Courtney
Raymond Consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There have been a few departures this year. Credit Suisse
Group's  (CSGN.VX) U.S. private bank in February poached seven
Goldman advisers in Atlanta. Citigroup's (C.N) Citi Private
Bank a few weeks ago hired Goldman's Rudolf Hitsch in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The former Goldman broker estimates more than 10 teams have
left the bank over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, many recruiters said Goldman's public relations
disaster will have to persist for quite a bit longer, and hit
brokers in their wallets, before the industry sees major
defections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't see advisers going out the door at this point.
It's wait and see," said Michael King of Michael King
Associates. "I do think that this puts a chink in their
armor."

About "The Sorcerer`s Apprentice" film

Walt Disney Studios, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Jon Turteltaub, the
creators of the "National Treasure" franchise, present "The Sorcerer`s
Apprentice" -- an innovative and epic comedy adventure about a sorcerer and his
hapless apprentice who are swept into the center of an ancient conflict between
good and evil. Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) is a master sorcerer in modern-day
Manhattan trying to defend the city from his arch-nemesis, Maxim Horvath (Alfred
Molina). Balthazar can't do it alone, so he recruits Dave Stutler (Jay
Baruchel), a seemingly average guy who demonstrates hidden potential, as his
reluctant prot&#233;g&#233;. The sorcerer gives his unwilling accomplice a crash course in
the art and science of magic, and together, these unlikely partners work to stop
the forces of darkness. It'll take all the courage Dave can muster to survive
his training, save the city and get the girl as he becomes "The Sorcerer`s
Apprentice." The screenplay is by Matt Lopez and Doug Miro &amp; Carlo Bernard from
a screen story by Matt Lopez and Larry Konner &amp; Mark Rosenthal.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said there are concerns that a debt crisis in the euro zone will not be restricted to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who is on an Asian visit, also spoke on Wednesday about the management shuffle within the company that will include the retirement of Robbie Bach, the company's video games and mobile phones unit head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Robbie has been thinking about the possibility of retiring and spending more time with his family. He and I thought on whether we should go ahead and announce that now or wait until after Christmas," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the consumer business it has to be way before Christmas or way after Christmas ... I'm happy to make the transition and announce it now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retirement of Bach, the 22-year veteran, credited with launching the Xbox in 2001, comes as the world's largest software maker and its mobile efforts are being brushed aside by Apple Inc's iPhone and Google Inc's Android operating system in a fast-growing, but increasingly crowded smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Robbie has interests that he wants to pursue and I wish him well on that," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Europe, Ballmer said the problems in the euro zone may not be limited to that region because the world economy is interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we all do understand that the world economy is very linked and everybody is nervous that any problems that we might see in Greece (and) Europe will not be isolated in Europe," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His remarks follow comments from the company's Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein earlier this month that Microsoft was expecting a boost this quarter from a rebound in business tech spending, which would likely outweigh the negative impact from turmoil in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before the Greek issue everyone has been saying they are more and more cautiously optimistic," Ballmer told journalists on the sidelines of a Microsoft event in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments across the globe are assessing the potential fallout from a debt crisis in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about his views on the business and security environment in China after Google's withdrawal from the market there, Ballmer said Google's move was due to censorship rather than security issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Google closed its China-based search service and began redirecting Web searchers to an uncensored portal in Hong Kong, drawing harsh comments from Beijing that raised doubts about the company's future in the world's largest Internet market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reason that Google withdrew from China has nothing to do with security. There are hackers around the world, there are hackers in every country. You cannot say 'I cannot do business in some countries because there are some hackers who live here,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it remains committed to China even after Google's decision to retreat because of censorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer added that countries such as India and Indonesia have become more attractive compared with China to Microsoft because of better intellectual property protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Harry Suhartono; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe and Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

Privileged Identity Management Suite


NEWTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Cyber-Ark Software, the leading global software provider for protecting critical
applications, identities and information, today announced details of its
participation at the Microsoft TechEd 2010 North America event. With a focus on
expanding traditional security and compliance-related definitions of "privilege"

of its Privileged Identity Management Suite v6 at booth #2301. Cyber-Ark is a
Silver sponsor of the event, which takes place June 7-10 in New Orleans. 

What: Cyber-Ark will introduce attendees to the sixth generation of its
Privileged Identity Management Suite, including the new On-Demand Privileges
Manager. The company will also demonstrate recently-announced advanced
auto-discovery capabilities to automate the detection process of all forms of
privileged accounts, including the service accounts commonly associated with
Microsoft Windows Services found on Windows servers, workstations and desktops.
Cyber-Ark proactively adds in these "discovered" accounts, as well as any new
devices and systems as they are commissioned, and delivers valuable audit
information about which of these privileged accounts are actively being managed
by the Privileged Identity Management solution, or are currently "un-managed"
and therefore non-compliant.

&lt;p&gt;Managed Services Provider to Handle Migration for One of Industry`s Largest
Exchange 2010 Deployments
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
Azaleos&#174; Corporation, the managed messaging and collaboration services company,
today announced that it has been selected by the United States Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to migrate the agency`s approximately
20,000 user email system from a hosted offsite datacenter version of Microsoft
Exchange 2003 to an on-premise deployment of Microsoft Exchange 2010, and to
manage the day-to-day administration of the new messaging platform. The CDC
deployment will be one of the largest Exchange 2010 environments outside of the
Microsoft Exchange TAP (Technical Adoption Program) and Microsoft Corporation. 

Under the terms of the contract with the CDC, Azaleos will install Microsoft
Exchange 2010, migrate email from Microsoft Exchange 2003 to Microsoft Exchange
2010, and monitor, operate and maintain the new email system. The new system
will also include BlackBerry Enterprise Server monitoring and management as well
as the deployment of large mailboxes for every user to create a `bottomless
mailbox` in place of a dedicated email archiving system. The CDC selected
Azaleos for its unique ability to deliver a managed messaging solution with
proven service levels (SLA) that is more secure than public cloud email
services. In addition to security and data control, the CDC was looking for a
low cost and flexible service that supports feature customization, integrates
with its existing IT infrastructure and can easily adapt to changing
requirements in the future. 

The CDC selected Azaleos for its proven expertise in providing Exchange
migration services and track record for maintaining rock solid availability of
the email systems it manages. The CDC is one of the first federal government
agencies to deploy Exchange 2010, and its system will be one of the world`s
largest implementations of Microsoft`s new messaging system to date. In
addition, the CDC system will take advantage of the powerful new backup
capabilities of Data Protection Manager 2010 working in conjunction with
Exchange 2010. 

"Our ability to earn the confidence and trust of a critical federal agency like
the Center for Disease Control and Prevention speaks volumes about our
expertise, technology, and ability to provide a managed service that allows
customers to leverage an on-premise cloud solution without losing control over
their data," said Phil Van Etten, CEO of Azaleos. "Clearly customers are seeing
the benefits of moving to Exchange 2010 sooner than later. For those companies
that want to take advantage of this new messaging platform without the headaches
of doing the migration themselves and training their IT staff - we provide a
compelling, cost effective option to public cloud services." 

About Azaleos Managed Exchange Services

Azaleos` Managed Exchange Services enable customers like the CDC to experience
the cost savings and support levels of a cloud-based Exchange solution while
keeping their data on-premise and under their control. Patented technology
developed by Azaleos remotely monitors Exchange systems and routinely sends
thousands of data points to its two Network Operations Centers where certified
Exchange experts proactively manage customer environments on a 24x7x365 basis. 

About Azaleos

Azaleos Corporation provides the benefits of hosted email and collaboration
services for organizations that can`t or won`t allow their data to reside
outside the datacenter. Azaleos` 24X7 managed services for Microsoft Exchange,
SharePoint, Active Directory, Office Communications Server, and BlackBerry
Enterprise Server keep information in a private cloud or on-premise location and
under IT control, while uptime, maintenance, and support is handled by experts
in its network operations centers. Hundreds of companies from Fortune 500 to
mid-market enterprises rely on Azaleos and its patented AzaleosX platform
technologies to manage their collaboration infrastructures and address issues
before users ever know they exist. Azaleos is a Microsoft Gold Certified
partner, and one of Microsoft`s top 35 NSI partners in the US. For more

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Zain Latif has swapped a career in investment banking for a niche start-up, and $100 million-plus deals in Africa for tiddlers of $3 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a banker at Goldman Sachs, Latif last year took the plunge to set up a private equity firm which sports a headcount of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an apartment in a smart block in London's West End, between budget clothing store Primark and chain restaurant Ask, Latif and his team at TLG Capital have invested in three companies in the past half-year in frontier markets -- Uganda, Ghana and Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontier markets are typically regarded as markets where market capitalization, liquidity and market-making are lower, not only than in developed, but also than in the bigger emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if these countries do not, or barely have, their own stock exchanges or bond markets?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of few ways to invest in these deep frontiers is through private equity -- buying a stake in a local company, helping it to grow, and then achieving an "exit" either through selling it on to a bigger firm, or turning it into a listed company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bigger players like Latif's former employer Goldman tend to overlook these tiny deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An investment bank will do nothing less than $100 million, five to six deals a year if that, and you are restricted to three countries -- Nigeria, Kenya, Angola, the commodity plays," Latif told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are looking at small and medium-sized businesses at a size of $3-5 million. We will go down to half a million."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLG is attracting money from private investors in the Middle East and Europe, and none of the countries in which it has invested so far even make it to the MSCI Frontier Markets index, against which many frontier market funds will be measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its first three investments are in a pharmaceuticals plant in Uganda making anti-retroviral and anti-malarial drugs, a cancer center in Ghana and a Cambodian company running cruises along the Mekong river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of TLG's pipeline projects is in the healthcare sector in Liberia, still recovering from a 1989-2003 civil war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHORT OF MONEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year less than $1.5 billion was invested in private equity projects in sub-Saharan Africa, one of the main regions for deep frontier markets, compared with around $3 billion in each of the previous two years, according to data from the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure for sub-Saharan Africa compares with over $22 billion invested in private equity in emerging markets globally last year, and $43 billion in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But private equity investment in sub-Saharan Africa has risen from $651 million in 2003, while in the United States it has fallen from $59.2 billion in the same year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity issues are a particular constraint in frontier private equity markets, where the way to make real money is, after grooming a company, to sell on the stock to what will be a relatively small pool of buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to do business, but the flipside is that if your investments pay off the returns are high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC, the development finance arm of the UK government and the biggest investor in private equity funds in Africa, made an average annual return on investments of 16 percent over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we over the medium term can achieve in the teens, that's an attractive return and that's possible," said Richard Laing, CEO of CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way to get into these markets is to be on the ground, say Latif and other private equity managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLG is adding two new staff, and all of its future projects will involve employing someone locally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We go on the boards, our value-add is providing the strategic review," said Latif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local staff from private equity firms will advise companies on how to do their accounts, how to stick to international standards of corporate governance and transparency, and help make them presentable for sale to multinationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparency is an issue in countries often considered a byword for bribery and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laing at CDC tells a story from a few years back of a Bangladeshi power station manager going to the port to pick up some imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will probably take two days because we do not pay bribes," the manager told him. As Laing says, business takes longer if you won't pay bribes, because you have to wait while your local official enjoys lunch with someone who does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 47 sub-Saharan African countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2009, 31 scored less than 3 out of 10, indicating that corruption is seen as rampant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These countries include Kenya and Uganda, although Ghana shows a slightly better performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fifty percent of the value of a company in Africa is based on its presentation, financial governance, corporate transparency," said Latif. "People pay extra for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aureos Capital, an emerging markets private equity firm with $1.2 billion under management, has nine offices in Africa, including Zambia, Ghana and Senegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many of these countries do not have good intermediaries, investment bankers, advisers, accountants -- it is not available at that level of sophistication," said Aureos chief executive Sev Vettivetpillai. Aureos' local staff help fill that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOCKED IN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity investors like TLG Capital and Aureos are concentrating on the needs of a growing middle class in frontier markets, with fast-moving consumer goods, real estate and healthcare among sectors in focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take milk -- 10 years ago there would be one product to buy, today people want choices," Aureos' Vettivetpillai said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, individual African markets are too thin to allow small companies much room for expansion, and the aim is to turn local businesses into regional ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kenya alone may not be attractive," said Vettivetpillai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But if you put Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda together, you have a sizeable market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no quick bucks in private equity, and that's even more the case in the delicate maneuvers involved in frontier markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are likely to be locked in for 10 years, compared with six or seven years in European private equity, but if they stick around they can make 30 percent on their investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In these markets you have to hold, you have to have the patience, you have to stay with it to achieve those returns," said Vettivetpillai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it won't always be possible to make those stellar returns or the elusive sale or listing, the exit. Growing the company may have to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to try to get individual exits on each asset, the reality is it's going to be difficult," said Latif, who is looking for a 10-15 percent annual return on his investment, regardless of whether he succeeds in selling or listing the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If investors get that, they are supremely happy. Where else would you get that cash return in this low interest rate environment?" (Editing by Sara Ledwith and Ian Jones)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generalleutnant Jack Stultz begeht Memorial Day und entspricht dem Wunsch eines
GE-Angestellten, der zweimal im Mittleren Osten im Einsatz stand
WAUKESHA, Wisconsin (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Vertreter von GE Healthcare haben am heutigen Dienstag anl&#228;sslich der
Memorial-Day-Feierlichkeiten im Gesundheitsinstitut des Unternehmens in Waukesha
von Generalleutnant Jack C. Stultz, dem Chef und kommandierenden General der
US-amerikanischen Armeereserve, eine ganz spezielle US-Flagge entgegengenommen. 

Im vergangenen Mai wurde diese amerikanische Flagge auf Wunsch von Chief Warrant
Officer 4 John &#8222;Jay" Coyle zu Ehren von GE Healthcare &#252;ber den Milit&#228;rst&#252;tzpunkt
Bagram in Afghanistan geflogen. Damals leistete Coyle gerade seinen zweiten
Kampfeinsatz im Mittleren Osten nach 2003, diesmal als leitender Offizier f&#252;r
Lebensmittelsicherheit. Im Zivilleben ist Coyle als Techniker im Au&#223;endienst f&#252;r
GE in Denver t&#228;tig und ist auf Computertomografiesysteme (CT) spezialisiert. 

Coyle, der seit 14 Jahren f&#252;r GE arbeitet, sagte, dass dem Unternehmen und der
Gesch&#228;ftsf&#252;hrung Anerkennung geb&#252;hre f&#252;r die hervorragende Unterst&#252;tzung von
wehrdienstleistenden Angestellten: &#8222;GE k&#252;mmerte sich bei meinen beiden Eins&#228;tzen
um meine Familie. Und bei meiner R&#252;ckkehr wartete nicht nur eine Stelle auf
mich, sondern ich wurde mit offenen Armen empfangen." 

Memorial-Day-Programm von GE Healthcare

Generalleutnant Stultz &#252;bergab die Flagge an Mark Vachon, Pr&#228;sident und CEO von
GE Healthcare in Amerika. Der Flagge lag auch eine Urkunde bei, auf der unter
anderem Folgendes steht: 

&#8222;Schenkung an GE Healthcare: Dieses Sternenbanner wurde auf Wunsch von CW4 John
Coyle als Ausdruck der Wertsch&#228;tzung Ihrer Unterst&#252;tzung am 4. Mai 2009 mit
Stolz &#252;ber das Craig Joint Theater Hospital auf dem Milit&#228;rst&#252;tzpunkt Bagram in
Afghanistan geflogen. Die Flagge spiegelt die Entschlossenheit Amerikas im
Anschluss an die Anschl&#228;ge auf das World Trade Center und das Pentagon vom 11.
September 2001 wider und bezeugt die Zerst&#246;rung der terroristischen Kr&#228;fte, die
die Freiheit der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika und der gesamten Welt
bedrohen." 

Vachon sagte: &#8222;Es ist uns eine Ehre, dass unser Engagement f&#252;r unsere
Mitarbeiter in der Armeereserve gew&#252;rdigt wird. Diese leisten nicht nur einen
gro&#223;en Beitrag f&#252;r die GE-Familie, sondern zeigen einen bewundernswerten Einsatz
f&#252;r unser Land. Wir sind privilegiert, dass wir diese mutigen Pers&#246;nlichkeiten
zu unserer Organisation z&#228;hlen d&#252;rfen." 

Auf dem Programm standen zudem zwei weitere Ehrungen mit Beteiligung von Coyle
und Mike Swinford, Gesch&#228;ftsf&#252;hrer von GE Healthcare Services in Amerika.
Zun&#228;chst &#252;bergab Coyle eine pers&#246;nliche Dankesurkunde an Swinford. Danach
erhielt Swinford zudem die Auszeichnung &#8222;My Boss Is a Patriot" (&#8222;Mein Chef ist
ein Patriot") vom Wisconsin Employer Support for the Guard and Reserve (ESGR)
Committee, f&#252;r die er von Coyle vorgeschlagen worden war.

hoy el lanzamiento del servicio de transferencia de dinero que brindar&#225; una
alternativa adicional a los consumidores que env&#237;an dinero desde los Estados
Unidos a sus familias y amigos que viven en el exterior. 

El programa comenzar&#225; este mes, y los consumidores podr&#225;n realizar una
transferencia de dinero Visa en cualquier oficina de BTS en los Estados Unidos.
Esta transacci&#243;n de transferencia de dinero Visa podr&#225; ser enviada a cualquier
cuenta Visa que cumpla con los requisitos en el mundo, y se incluyen a todos los
pa&#237;ses de destino de remesas clave. Sin embargo, el uso inicial del servicio les
permitir&#225; a los consumidores enviar fondos desde los Estados Unidos hacia pa&#237;ses
seleccionados, como El Salvador, Brasil, China y Filipinas. Por cierto, hay
planes de extender el programa para permitir remesas desde BTS hacia cualquier
pa&#237;s dentro de la red Visa. 

El nuevo programa que ofrece BTS representa una mejora para su reconocido
servicio que permite a los consumidores de los Estados Unidos enviar remesas a
todo el mundo de manera segura. BTS es una parte integral de BBVA Bancomer, la
banca subsidiaria de BBVA Group (BBVA), uno de los grupos financieros m&#225;s
exitosos del mundo. La alianza con Visa combina la confiabilidad, escala y
seguridad de la red de pagos mundial de Visa con la plataforma de transferencia
de dinero de vanguardia de BTS. Dicha plataforma enfatiza la eficacia y las
capacidades de detecci&#243;n de pr&#225;cticas de lavado de dinero y cuenta con vasta
experiencia en la industria y en el comercio. De esa manera, les brinda
comodidad, velocidad y seguridad de transferencia de dinero Visa a los
consumidores en los Estados Unidos. 

"La expansi&#243;n de la transferencia de dinero Visa para permitir el env&#237;o de
remesas desde los Estados Unidos hacia cuentas Visa que cumplan con los
requisitos en Am&#233;rica Latina es un hito importante para Visa y para nuestros
clientes", expres&#243; Jim McCarthy, director global de productos de Visa Inc.
"Nuestra alianza con BTS es un gran ejemplo de c&#243;mo Visa expande su red de
negocios para acercar comodidad y seguridad de la moneda digital Visa a m&#225;s
consumidores en m&#225;s pa&#237;ses en todo el mundo". 

El corredor de remesas m&#225;s grande del mundo

Seg&#250;n el Banco de Desarrollo Interamericano (BID), el corredor de Am&#233;rica Latina
es uno de los mercados de transferencia de dinero m&#225;s grande del mundo, con un
total de USD 58,8 mil millones transferidos en 2009. En ese a&#241;o, solo BTS
factur&#243; USD 10 mil millones en fondos de consumidores transferidos a Am&#233;rica
Latina, lo que convirti&#243; a BTS en uno de los procesadores de remesas m&#225;s grandes
de la regi&#243;n2. Otro mercado de remesas grande donde operaba BST desde los
Estados Unidos inclu&#237;a Asia, Europa y &#193;frica. 

"Como miembro del BBVA Group, estamos siempre trabajando para ayudar a la gente
a simplificar sus vidas a trav&#233;s de productos y servicios innovadores y
razonables", afirm&#243; Mois&#233;s Jaimes, presidente y director ejecutivo de BTS. "Esto
va m&#225;s all&#225; de ser un complemento para nuestros servicios de transferencia de
dinero tradicional. Nuestro trabajo con Visa fortalece nuestro compromiso con la
evoluci&#243;n de la industria de las remesas, y, al brindar una amplia gama de
servicios y canales seguros a nuestros clientes, estamos un paso m&#225;s adelante en
nuestra b&#250;squeda para atender un segmento importante en la industria de los
servicios financieros". 

Las transferencias de dinero Visa que se originen en una oficina de BTS en los
Estados Unidos son procesadas a trav&#233;s de la red segura de Visa y estar&#225;n
disponibles para los poseedores de tarjeta Visa que no necesitar&#225;n ir a una
oficina f&#237;sica para recibir el dinero. Los fondos pueden ser transferidos a las
tarjetas de d&#233;bito, cr&#233;dito y a cuentas prepagas Visa que cumplan con los
requisitos. El acuerdo con Visa le brinda a BTS acceso a la red mundial de Visa
y tiene el potencial de BTS para alcanzar m&#225;s consumidores en m&#225;s pa&#237;ses. 

"La transferencia de dinero Visa y el acuerdo de BTS es un aval serio de la
capacidad de Visa para convertirse en un canal alternativo para las compa&#241;&#237;as de
transferencia de dinero y para los bancos", coment&#243; Gwenn Bezard, director de
investigaci&#243;n de Aite Group. "El deseo de las compa&#241;&#237;as de transferencia de
dinero para permitir la transferencia de remesas directamente a cuentas
bancarias ha crecido en los &#250;ltimos a&#241;os, y Visa est&#225; posicionada para
convertirse en la utilidad elegida para ese servicio". 

De hecho, para el lanzamiento de este nuevo servicio, Visa trabaj&#243; en estrecha
relaci&#243;n con BTS y con los Servicios de Procesamiento de D&#233;bito de Visa (Visa
Debit Processing Services, DPS) para conectar de manera segura la plataforma de
transferencia de dinero de BTS con VisaNet, la red de procesamiento mundial de
Visa. DPS es el servicio de procesamiento emisor de Visa en Norteam&#233;rica que
conecta partes externas, como las instituciones emisoras financieras y los
comerciantes a VisaNet.

&lt;p&gt; * To provide tech platform for mobile banking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Talks with potential partners ongoing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Monitise shares touch three-year high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
  (Adds Monitise CEO comments, analyst reaction, shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - Credit card giant Visa (V.N) has
chosen British partner Monitise (MONI.L) for a joint venture to
develop mobile banking technology for the fast-growing Indian
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in mobile banking specialist Monitise, which has an
existing relationship with Visa, touched a near three-year high
of 25 pence, and were up 6.6 percent at 24 pence at 1013 GMT on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Philip Sparks at Evolution said it was the first
announcement to reveal how the companies would pursue
revenue-generating opportunities together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The opportunities don't get much bigger than India and we
are lifting our target price to 27 pence," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monitise Chief Executive Alastair Lukies said mobile banking
was ideal for a country with nearly 600 million mobile phone
subscriptions and a fast-growing demand for banking facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "India has a huge opportunity to establish a new payment
network for a new generation," he said in an interview on
Wednesday.
  "It's just huge kudos that Visa, 11 months into our
relationship, believes in us and our technology enough to share
what's probably their biggest growth market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks with potential launch partners were ongoing, the
companies said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both companies would contribute resources to the
joint-venture, Lukies said, and he expected to be able to
announce a timetable for the launch of services later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Shivani Singh in Bangalore and Paul Sandle in

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Ex-Goldman banker invests in frontier private equity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Market offers way into countries with few stocks, bonds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Returns can be high, but liquidity, transparency risks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Carolyn Cohn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - Zain Latif has swapped a career
in investment banking for a niche start-up, and $100
million-plus deals in Africa for tiddlers of $3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once a banker at Goldman Sachs, Latif last year took the
plunge to set up a private equity firm which sports a headcount
of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From an apartment in a smart block in London's West End,
between budget clothing store Primark and chain restaurant Ask,
Latif and his team at TLG Capital have invested in three
companies in the past half-year in frontier markets -- Uganda,
Ghana and Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frontier markets are typically regarded as markets where
market capitalisation, liquidity and market-making are lower,
not only than in developed, but also than in the bigger emerging
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what if these countries do not, or barely have, their
own stock exchanges or bond markets?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of few ways to invest in these deep frontiers is through
private equity -- buying a stake in a local company, helping it
to grow, and then achieving an "exit" either through selling it
on to a bigger firm, or turning it into a listed company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bigger players like Latif's former employer Goldman tend to
overlook these tiny deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "An investment bank will do nothing less than $100 million,
five to six deals a year if that, and you are restricted to
three countries -- Nigeria, Kenya, Angola, the commodity plays,"
Latif told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are looking at small and medium-sized businesses at a
size of $3-5 million. We will go down to half a million."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TLG is attracting money from private investors in the Middle
East and Europe, and none of the countries in which it has
invested so far even make it to the MSCI Frontier Markets index,
against which many frontier market funds will be measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its first three investments are in a pharmaceuticals plant
in Uganda making anti-retroviral and anti-malarial drugs, a
cancer centre in Ghana and a Cambodian company running cruises
along the Mekong river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of TLG's pipeline projects is in the healthcare sector
in Liberia, still recovering from a 1989-2003 civil war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHORT OF MONEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year less than $1.5 billion was invested in private
equity projects in sub-Saharan Africa, one of the main regions
for deep frontier markets, compared with around $3 billion in
each of the previous two years, according to data from the
Emerging Markets Private Equity Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The figure for sub-Saharan Africa compares with over $22
billion invested in private equity in emerging markets globally
last year, and $43 billion in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But private equity investment in sub-Saharan Africa has
risen from $651 million in 2003, while in the United States it
has fallen from $59.2 billion in the same year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liquidity issues are a particular constraint in frontier
private equity markets, where the way to make real money is,
after grooming a company, to sell on the stock to what will be a
relatively small pool of buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hard to do business, but the flipside is that if your
investments pay off the returns are high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CDC, the development finance arm of the UK government and
the biggest investor in private equity funds in Africa, made an
average annual return on investments of 16 percent over the past
five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we over the medium term can achieve in the teens, that's
an attractive return and that's possible," said Richard Laing,
CEO of CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The way to get into these markets is to be on the ground,
say Latif and other private equity managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TLG is adding two new staff, and all of its future projects
will involve employing someone locally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We go on the boards, our value-add is providing the
strategic review," said Latif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Local staff from private equity firms will advise companies
on how to do their accounts, how to stick to international
standards of corporate governance and transparency, and help
make them presentable for sale to multinationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Transparency is an issue in countries often considered a
byword for bribery and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laing at CDC tells a story from a few years back of a
Bangladeshi power station manager going to the port to pick up
some imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It will probably take two days because we do not pay
bribes," the manager told him. As Laing says, business takes
longer if you won't pay bribes, because you have to wait while
your local official enjoys lunch with someone who does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of 47 sub-Saharan African countries in Transparency
International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2009, 31 scored
less than 3 out of 10, indicating that corruption is seen as
rampant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These countries include Kenya and Uganda, although Ghana
shows a slightly better performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Fifty percent of the value of a company in Africa is based
on its presentation, financial governance, corporate
transparency," said Latif. "People pay extra for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aureos Capital, an emerging markets private equity firm with
$1.2 billion under management, has nine offices in Africa,
including Zambia, Ghana and Senegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Many of these countries do not have good intermediaries,
investment bankers, advisers, accountants -- it is not available
at that level of sophistication," said Aureos chief executive
Sev Vettivetpillai. Aureos' local staff help fill that gap.

&lt;p&gt;New company enables financial institutions and mobile network operators to meet
consumer demand for secure, mobile financial services

The new company will combine Visa`s expertise in enabling secure, globally

second largest mobile market with an estimated 584 million mobile phone
subscriptions as of 31 March 20103.

institutions, mobile network operators and technology providers, including
Monitise, to extend the benefits of digital currency to more consumers in more

security, and reliability required to make mobile money a reality for
consumers." 

Alastair Lukies, Chief Executive Officer of Monitise, said: "This exciting

range of services via a mobile device. India`s mobile market offers tremendous
growth opportunities for this joint venture and for our customers." 

Monitise delivers unique expertise that facilitates customized development of
mobile financial services for a broad range of handsets. Monitise already serves
the needs of more than 200 banks and financial institutions in the United
Kingdom and United States of America to deliver similar safe, secure mobile

The joint venture transaction will be undertaken in accordance with applicable
laws and is expected to close in June 2010. Both shareholders will be
contributing resources to the joint venture and an outstanding local team of
experts in their fields is being put together. Discussions with a wide variety
of potential launch partners are well underway.

&lt;p&gt;   * Says Europe problems may not be isolated to the continent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Google's China departure not related to security issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE May 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer said on Wednesday there are concerns
that a debt crisis in the eurozone will not remain restricted
to the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His remarks follow comments from the company's chief
financial officer Peter Klein earlier this month that Microsoft
was expecting a boost this quarter from a rebound in business
tech spending, which would likely outweigh the negative impact
from turmoil in Europe.[ID:nN14156620]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Before the Greek issue everyone has been saying they are
more and more cautiously optimistic," Ballmer told journalists
on the sidelines of a Microsoft event in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think we all have to understand that the world economy
is very lame and it is getting everybody nervous that the
problem that we are seeing in Greece (and) Europe will not be
isolated in Europe," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Governments across the globe are assessing the potential
fallout from a debt crisis in Europe. [ID:nSGE64P04M]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked about his views on the business and security
environment in China after Google Inc's (GOOG.O) withdrawal
from the market there, Ballmer said Google's move was due to
censorship instead of security issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March Google closed its China-based search service and
began redirecting Web searchers to an uncensored portal in Hong
Kong, drawing harsh comments from Beijing that raised doubts
about the company's future in the world's largest Internet
market. [ID:nN22214210]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The reason that Google withdrew from China has nothing to
do with security. There are hackers around the world there are
hackers in every country. You cannot say 'I cannot do business
in some countries because there are some hackers who live
here'," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has said it remains committed to China even after
Google's decision to retreat because of censorship.
[ID:nTOE639012]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer added that countries such as India and Indonesia
have become more attractive compared with China to Microsoft
because of better intellectual property protection.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Wall Street has long seen sense in Walt Disney Co selling or spinning off ABC, the low-rated TV network and the one piece that does not seem to fit well with the entire entertainment empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the problem is finding a buyer, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the long-debated issue resurfaced after prosecutors charged a secretary to a senior Disney executive and her boyfriend with trying to entice would-be insider traders by claiming they knew the company was in advanced discussions with private equity to sell ABC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street took notice. Disney's shares, typically steady, shot up nearly 5 percent before Disney said the claim was false. The stock then backtracked to close up 2.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some believe the timing is right amid an advertising rebound and prospective new revenue for broadcasters from transmission deals with cable operators, which should boost ABC's value. And, the costs of producing original series and running a news operation continue to climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cross-ownership restrictions and antitrust issues would make it a tough sell to rival broadcasters and natural fits like CBS, Comcast Corp -- soon to own NBC -- and News Corp, which owns Fox. Some say private equity might be the way to go, but so far no names have cropped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been anticipating a new wave of consolidation in the TV and radio broadcasting business. And the notion of Disney selling ABC fits into that picture," said Paul Kagan, chief executive officer of PK World Media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC, third of four networks in the ratings race, recently overhauled its prime-time lineup -- the second year in a row it revamped its schedule during the upfronts season, when broadcasters negotiate with advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soleil Securities' Alan Gould values the broadcast division, including ABC with 10 TV stations and its production and distribution business, at $6.4 billion.

&lt;p&gt; * Some cite skepticism about finding buyer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Others say ABC does not fit in with conglomerate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Consultant says Disney mulling ABC's long-term value&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sue Zeidler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, May 27 (Reuters) -  Wall Street has long seen
sense in Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) selling or spinning off ABC,
the low-rated TV network and the one piece that does not seem
to fit well with the entire entertainment empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the problem is finding a buyer, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, the long-debated issue resurfaced after
prosecutors charged a secretary to a senior Disney executive
and her boyfriend with trying to entice would-be insider
traders by claiming they knew the company was in advanced
discussions with private equity to sell ABC. [ID:nN26254919]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street took notice. Disney's shares, typically steady,
shot up nearly 5 percent before Disney said the claim was
false. The stock then backtracked to close up 2.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some believe the timing is right amid an advertising
rebound and prospective new revenue for broadcasters from
transmission deals with cable operators, which should boost
ABC's value. And, the costs of producing original series and
running a news operation continue to climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But cross-ownership restrictions and antitrust issues would
make it a tough sell to rival broadcasters and natural fits
like CBS (CBS.N), Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) -- soon to own NBC --
and News Corp (NWSA.O), which owns Fox. Some say private equity
might be the way to go, but so far no names have cropped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I've been anticipating a new wave of consolidation in the
TV and radio broadcasting business. And the notion of Disney
selling ABC fits into that picture," said Paul Kagan, chief
executive officer of PK World Media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC, third of four networks in the ratings race, recently
overhauled its prime-time lineup -- the second year in a row it
revamped its schedule during the upfronts season, when
broadcasters negotiate with advertisers. [ID:nN07258064].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soleil Securities' Alan Gould values the broadcast
division, including ABC with 10 TV stations and its production
and distribution business, at $6.4 billion. TV production and
distribution is valued at about $1.8 billion, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Disney released second-quarter earnings this month,
evidence of lower ratings, sliding income and ad revenue at ABC
triggered a 3.5 percent stock selloff. [ID:nN11225225]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given a reasonable valuation for ABC, we believe the
Street would be happy with the sale," said Gould. "We do not
believe ABC is strategically critical to Disney and it does not
seem to be a business where Disney has a competitive edge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CEO Bob Iger did not rule out a sale when asked outright
during an annual shareholders' meeting in March. Unlike film,
theme parks and consumer merchandise, where Disney can market a

the objectives of Disney," said one media consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The consultant said Disney could try and sell part of the

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to widespread reports on the Web, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer will not show up on stage at rival Apple's annual developer conference, Microsoft said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ballmer rumors were prompted by a research note from Wall Street analyst Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research, who told investors that a seven-minute stretch of Apple's upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote had been set aside for Ballmer to promote Microsoft's Visual Studio 2010 developer tools suite to iPhone programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple CEO Steve Jobs will take the stage at 10 a.m. PT on June 7 to kick off WWDC. Analysts expect Jobs to talk about iPhone OS 4, the company's new mobile operating system, and to unveil the next-generation iPhone .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft quashed the Ballmer rumor today in a tweet from its official Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Steve Ballmer not speaking at Apple Dev Conf. Nor appearing on Dancing with the Stars. Nor riding in the Belmont. Just FYI," the tweet read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time Apple and Microsoft executives shared a stage was in 2007, when Jobs and then-Microsoft chairman Bill Gates were interviewed jointly at the D: All Things Digital Conference .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years before that, Jobs introduced Gates at a 1997 Macworld Conference when Microsoft announced it was making a $150 million investment in Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Apple] needs help from other partners," said Jobs at the time. "Relationships that are destructive don't help anybody." The 1997 audience booed Jobs' announcement amid scattered applause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer might have been a fun fit for WWDC, if only because he has become famous for a 2000 Microsoft event in which he chanted "Developers! Developers! Developers! Developers! Developers!" while clapping his hands, pumping his fist and sweating profusely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - The amount of oil spilled by BP Plc's blown-out Gulf of Mexico well has eclipsed the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, and could be flowing at a rate nearly four times BP's recent estimates, according to findings of a U.S. government expert panel released on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 17, there were at least 130,000 barrels of oil on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, and a similar amount had been skimmed off the surface or evaporated, according to a panel of government scientists known as the Flow Rate Technical Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, made public by U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt, confirm that more oil has been spilled from BP's leaking well than the estimated 257,000 barrels that fouled Alaska's Prince William Sound by the grounding of the Exxon Valdez tanker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the panel's calculations are accurate, a total of at least 260,000 barrels of oil had spilled into the ocean by May 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-end estimate of oil on the water that day was 270,000 barrels, with a similar amount contained or evaporated, the panel found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNutt declined to confirm that the BP spill has eclipsed the Exxon Valdez, but she did not dispute it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is obviously a very, very significant environmental disaster and I think with the numbers I've given you, you can do the math," McNutt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's best estimate for the amount of oil pouring from the well is 12,000-19,000 barrels per day, though one of three measurement methods the team used returned a high-end rate of 25,000 barrels per day, McNutt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming the well has flowed 12,000 barrels (504,000 gallons/1.9 million liters) a day since April 20 -- the day the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded -- the total amount of oil released by the well is 444,000 barrels (18.65 million gallons/70.59 million liters), nearly twice the amount from Exxon Valdez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A BP spokesman declined to comment on the government's estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government's lowest estimate is over twice the estimate repeatedly cited by BP officials of about 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons/795,000 liters), though company officials have said the estimate is unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Chris Baltimore; Editing by Eric Beech)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Durbin warns against fee changes for small banks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * In letter, Durbin warns against collusion
 (Adds byline, MasterCard comment, ICBA opposition, details on
Durbin proposal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joe Rauch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHARLOTTE, N.C., May 27 (Reuters) - The author of a U.S.
Senate proposal to limit debit card network fees said "serious
antitrust concerns" could be raised if Visa Inc (V.N) and
MasterCard (MA.N) Inc punish small banks that use their payment
networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Illinois Democrat Richard Durbin sent a letter to Visa and
MasterCard's chief executives on Thursday accusing the
companies of trying to "frighten" small banks into opposing his
plan to regulate fees that merchants pay when customers pay
with their debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would caution you not to collude with your largest
member banks to change your fees and rules in an effort to
protect the big banks against competition from smaller
card-issuing banks," Durbin wrote. "Such steps would also raise
serious antitrust concerns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Durbin's limits for debit card merchant fees, included as
part of his amendment to the Senate's larger financial reform
legislation, only applies to banks with assets of more than $10
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, small banks oppose the limits because they believe
they will ultimately have to abide by them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier on Thursday, the Independent Community Bankers of
America -- the primary trade group for small U.S. banks --
asked Members of the House of Representatives to reject the
Durbin amendement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The amendment would dramatically alter the electronic
payments system and make it very difficult for card-issuing
credit unions and community banks to continue to provide a wide
array of products and services to consumers," the group said in
letter to U.S. House representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A MasterCard spokesman said small banks were opposing the
legislation independent of any pressure from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This opposition appears to be based on community banks'
and credit unions' recognition that the Durbin amendment would
turn the economics of the entire payment system on its head
with negative consequences for all participants, including
consumers," said MasterCard spokesman Jim Issokson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Visa Inc spokesman was not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CARVE-OUT MOOT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under Durbin's proposal, the Federal Reserve would receive
the authority to regulate interchange fees that merchants are
charged by banks and by payment processors like Visa and
MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fees are a key source of revenue for banks' debit card
programs and Visa and MasterCard, which operate large U.S.
payment networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Durbin's amendment also would allow merchants to provide
discounts for customers who use one payment type over another,
and allow merchants to bar debit transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if smaller banks are exempted from the provisions, the
ICBA says that Visa and MasterCard would change their fee
structures for all banks, rendering the carve-out moot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In practice, the networks and the merchants will make the
government-set rate applicable to all issuers the only
practical course of action limiting the interchange revenue on
which small issuers rely to sustain their debit card
offerings," ICBA's letter states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa and MasterCard are the dominant U.S. card transaction
processors, and would be among the most affected by Durbin's
proposed rule change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Durbin has previously said the industry's current debit
card fee structure costs too much for the service provided to
businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The amendment does not cover credit card transaction fees.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded, assigned Rating Outlooks, Loss Severity (LS)
ratings and Recovery Ratings (RRs) to several classes of J.P. Morgan Chase
Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC), commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates, series 2001-CIBC2. A detailed list of rating actions follows the
end of the release. 

The downgrades are due to an increase in expected losses on specially serviced
assets coupled with expected losses following Fitch's prospective review of
potential stresses to the transaction. The majority of the total expected losses
are associated with loans currently in special servicing. 

As of the April 2010 distribution date, the pool's certificate balance has paid
down 21.2% to $758.1 million from $961.7 million at issuance. 41 loans are
defeased (35% of the current transaction balance). 

There are 11 specially serviced loans in the pool (9.4%), including the 12th
(2%) and 15th (1.8%) largest loans. Five loans are delinquent, two are in
foreclosure, one is real estate owned (REO), and three are current or less than
one month delinquent. 

The largest specially serviced asset (2%) is a 231,253 square foot (sf) office
property located in Schaumberg, IL, a northwest Chicago suburb. The loan
transferred to special servicing in March 2009 due to imminent default. The loan
was due Sept. 1, 2009, and all funds are currently directed to the receiver and
the special servicer is working to stabilize the property. 

The second largest specially serviced asset is a 162,829 sf office building
located in Norwalk, CT. The loan transferred to special servicing in December
2009 due to the Borrower's statement that they are nearing imminent default due
to a lack of sufficient cash flow generated by the property to make the required
payments due in accordance with loan documents. The Borrower has submitted a
discounted payoff proposal for Special Servicer consideration. Debt service
coverage ratio (DSCR) as of Nov. 30, 2009 is 0.31 times (x) with occupancy at
22%. 

Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining non defeased loans by applying a
10% reduction to 2008 fiscal year end net operating income and applying an
adjusted market cap rate between 7.25% and 10% to determine value. 

Similar to Fitch's prospective analysis of recent vintage CMBS, each loan also
underwent a refinance test by applying an 8% interest rate and 30-year
amortization schedule based on the stressed cash flow. Loans that could
refinance to a debt service coverage ratio of 1.25 times or higher were
considered to payoff at maturity. Of the non-defeased or non-specially serviced
loans, seven loans (4.3% of the pool) incurred a loss when compared to Fitch's
stressed value. Fitch expects losses of 6% of the remaining transaction balance,
or $45.7 million, from loans in special servicing and loans that cannot
refinance at maturity based on Fitch's refinance test. 

Fitch has downgraded and assigned Outlooks, LS ratings and RRs as indicated: 

--$28.9 million class E to 'BBB-/LS5' from 'AA+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$12 million class F to 'BB/LS5' from 'AA'; Outlook Negative; 

--$25.2 million class G to 'CCC/RR1' from 'BBB+'; 

--$7.2 million class H to 'CC/RR3' from 'BBB-'; 

--$7.2 million class J to 'C/RR6' from 'BB'; 

--$12 million class K to 'C/RR6' from 'B+'; 

--$4.8 million class L to 'C/RR6' from 'B'; 

--$7.8 million class M to 'C/RR6' from 'B-'. 

In addition, Fitch has affirmed, maintains or revises Outlooks and assigns LS
ratings to the following classes as indicated: 

--$560.4 million class A-3 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only classes X1 and X2 at 'AAA'; 

--$38.5 million class B at 'AAA/LS4'; Outlook Stable; 

--$38.5 million class C at 'AAA/LS4'; Outlook Stable; 

--$14.4 million class D at 'AAA/LS5'; Outlook to Negative from Stable. 

Classes A1 and A2 have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the $4.2 million class
NR.

U.S. CMBS is available in the July 7, 2009 report, 'Surveillance Methodology for

(NYSE: GE). 

Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Four daily picks

tumbled -37.6% - but Zacks #1 Rank stocks gained +43.8%. 

Here is a summary of today's selected stocks that are now highly rated by Zacks:

Aggressive Growth - Carter`s, Inc.(NYSE: CRI) 

Carter`s, Inc. analysts remain bullish on the retailer, despite the current

are keeping valuations very attractive.

How to Regularly Access Top Zacks Rank Picks for
Free:http://at.zacks.com/?id=7154

Underlying the four free stock picks is a simple truth that first appeared in a
Financial Analysts Journal article published in 1979. Leonard Zacks, a Ph.D. in
Mathematics from M.I.T. found that "earnings estimate revisions are the most
powerful force impacting stock prices." Zacks #1 Rank is awarded to a stock when
analysts sharply upgrade their estimates of what the company will earn. 

Today, Zacks is promoting its stock recommendations by offering four daily picks
free to those who register at http://at.zacks.com/?id=7155.

Where To From Here?

Yesterday's washout was the kind of trading action typically seen at the bottom
of a correction. We gapped down hard in the morning, but instead of watching
investors panic and sell into the weakness we saw buyers step into the market
and steadily bring us back to even on good volume. 

It was the kind of price action that would have warranted removing our hedge
earlier in this rally, but something felt different this time. After some
review, that "something" turned out to be a major disintegration in breadth over
the past few weeks of selling. 

Let's review. 

The market hit its high towards the end of April and quickly gave up ground on
the back of Goldman (NYSE: GS) and Greece. After a short but powerful snapback
rally, the market gave out once again, eventually taking out the lows of the
Thursday panic and lending validation to the initial panic that was supposedly a
"technical" phenomenon. 

Although it seems we have found support around the 105 level of the SPDR S 500
ETF (NYSE: SPY), we have also built a formidable head-and-shoulders formation in
the process. The 115 level will likely prove tough to overcome. If you look
closely, you will also notice that the S is once again below its 200-day
moving average. Lots of no goods. 

Meanwhile, we have seen both the NYSE and Nasdaq BPIs collapse with no
turnaround in sight. 

At the same time, we have seen the number of stocks hitting new highs dry up and
the new lows list explode upward for the first time since the rally began. 

The Advance-Decline charts are the only indicators bullishly diverging from the
market, but even they do not suggest much strength. The cumulative New Highs
minus New Lows indicators are some of our favorite breadth indicators -- when
the line is rising we want to be long the market and when it's falling we want
to be short or hedged. For the first time since the March lows of 2009, the NYSE
and Nasdaq High-Low charts are both heading lower (though to the bulls credit
you could argue we're in limbo at this point). 

Still, when you look at how strongly this line was climbing for the duration of
the rally, you can't help but be concerned with the recent hesitation. 

Despite the recently found support and yesterday's reversal, removing the hedge
at this point would be premature. Today's lack of follow through is cause for
concern, along with all the weakness in breadth described above. Stay hedged for
now, but add to your long positions as strength emerges.

&lt;p&gt;Human Rights Issues, Ecuador Calamity Drive Opposition; Watson Loses Control in
Face of Criticism
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Chevron CEO John Watson was accused of violating corporate governance
requirements and other laws when he apparently lost control of Chevron`s annual
meeting yesterday, resulting in five arrests of well-known Chevron critics and a
stunning shareholder rebuke over the company`s $27 billion potential Ecuador
liability. 

Chevron selectively denied entry to its critics, said Maria Ramos, an organizer
with the Rainforest Action Network (RAN). RAN, along with Amazon Watch, had
organized a delegation of critics of Chevron to attend the shareholder meeting.
Ramos said a complaint would be filed against Chevron with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and also that the groups were exploring possible legal
action against the oil giant for conspiring with the Houston police to suppress
the Free Speech rights of the company`s critics. 

"John Watson owes an apology to the public and to all Chevron shareholders for
losing his head yesterday and letting the annual meeting degenerate into chaos
and violation of the rights of his shareholders," said Mitch Anderson, a critic
of the company who works for Amazon Watch who was arrested by the Houston police
at the meeting. 

"Chevron planned to exclude shareholders critical of its human rights violations
from its own meeting, and that is clearly illegal," said Anderson. 

Anderson was among five critics of Chevron arrested by Houston police who were
visibly working in tandem with Chevron`s private security force, including the
company`s director of global security. All five had either proxies or were
actual shareholders, but were denied entry by Chevron`s security force based on
supposed technical "defects" in the proxy statements or for no reason at all. 

Others arrested were Han Shan, also a leading Chevron critic who works with
Amazon Watch; the Rev. Kenneth Davis from Richmond, California, the site of a
Chevron refinery that local residents say causes pollution; and Juan Parras, a
Houston-based organizer who has confronted Chevron over pollution at its
refineries in Texas. All said the arrests were prompted by Chevron`s security
force, which summoned the arresting officers. 

Anderson identified Chris Butner, a Chevron attorney, as the individual who
carried out Chevron`s plan to fabricate reasons to exclude critics and provoke a
confrontation that led to the arrests. 

"Butner, a person with whom I had been in contact, could give no reason to deny
me entry," said Anderson. "He saw me try to enter the meeting as a shareholder
and asked security to have me removed from the premises. The man lied to me." 

The arresting officers from the Houston police force admitted they were brought
to the meeting by Chevron to serve as their "heavies" in the event Chevron
security wanted people arrested. "We were clearly told by the Houston police who
arrested us that Chevron wanted them to be their `heavies` and that they were
brought in by Chevron`s private security for that purpose," said Shan. 

"This was Chevron`s version of the poll tax - fabricate technical issues to
prevent unwanted people from going to the polls to register complaints about the
company`s atrocious human rights policies," said Ramos, the RAN organizer. "Then
call in the police to drive the point home. This is no different than what poll
watchers used to do in Alabama to prevent blacks from voting. 

"Chevron`s Board needs to investigate Watson to determine his role in this
sordid behavior by a company that touts itself as modern and progressive," said
Ramos. 

Inside the meeting, Chevron`s management team suffered a humiliating rebuke when
shareholders aggressively supported a resolution stemming from the company`s
massive potential liability in Ecuador with a whopping 26% of the vote,
representing an estimated $38 billion in shareholder value. 

The resolution, which called for the company to appoint a director with
environmental expertise, was co-sponsored by the Pennsylvania State Treasury,
Trillium Asset Management Corporation, and Amnesty International USA. Risk
Metrics, an influential investment advisory group, advised shareholders to
support the resolution. 

The $38 billion in shareholder vote represents an increase of nearly 400% over
previous resolutions associated with the Ecuador problem. 

"The increase in votes cast in defiance of Watson`s recommendation helps explain
they the company is jittery and feels like it needs to violate the law to
suppress its critics," said Anderson. "Chevron`s business model profits from
human rights violations and we threaten that model." 

Watson`s efforts were frustrated by the sheer number of shareholder resolutions
challenging the company`s stance on human rights and environmental issues. No
fewer than 5 of the 6 separate shareholder resolutions on this year`s ballot
called for action on various human rights and environmental issues, and
management opposed each of them. 

All told, more than $106 billion in votes were cast which defied company
management.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rallied on Thursday as investor worry was eased after China refuted a report that it was reviewing its euro-zone bond holdings due to the region's debt crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday's gains marked the largest advance for the SP 500 on a percentage basis since May 10, although volume was below average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's denial was enough of a catalyst to entice buyers into the volatile equity market, which fell sharply from April highs as investors worried that Europe's debt woes would spiral into a larger financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As you look through it, Europe is not getting worse," said Tim Holland, co-portfolio manager of the Aston/TAMRO Diversified Equity Fund in Alexandria, Virginia. "Trees don't grow to the sky, but did the market deserve to be off 15 percent in three weeks?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People's Bank of China said a Financial Times report that Beijing was concerned about its euro-zone exposure was groundless. The report had short-circuited a rally in the previous session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) climbed 4 percent to $26, a day after ceding its position to Apple (AAPL.O) as the largest technology company by market cap.

The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX advanced 35.11 points, or 3.29 percent, to 1,103.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC jumped 81.80 points, or 3.73 percent, to 2,277.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology stocks also rebounded after having been battered recently as a result of their higher concentration of overseas sales. The PHLX Semiconductor index .SOXX jumped 5.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You get a macro stimulus and you look for those areas that have pulled back hard and can give you some quick returns. And that's what you're seeing today," said Williams Financial Group analyst Cody Acree, about Thursday's chip rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 closed above the 1,090 level it has failed to breach in the last week, which is seen as technical resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also being eyed by analysts as a significant indicator would be a close above the 200-day moving average, which now stand right above the 1,104 mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, or VIX, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, fell 15.3 percent to 29.68, continuing its pattern of large swings since the SP hit its April high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a debate in the markets going on right now whether we are experiencing this sort of correction in a longer term bull market in equities or are we having a sea change in business prospects around the world -- the volatility demonstrates that debate," said Michael Cuggino, portfolio manager at Permanent Portfolio Funds in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data showing the U.S. economy grew at a slower pace than expected in the first quarter was not enough to keep investors from grabbing bargains after major indexes dropped more than 10 percent over the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other data released on Thursday, new applications for state jobless benefits dropped to 460,000 last week from 474,000 in the previous week, the Labor Department said, pointing to a gradual labor market recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow component Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) rose 1.7 percent to $15.37 after the drugmaker said it would stop recruiting patients for a clinical trial for its heart drug Inspra because the study reached its main efficacy goal early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In earnings news, both Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Tiffany  Co (TIF.N) reported quarterly profits that beat expectations. Tiffany also raised its outlook. Costco advanced 4.9 percent to $58.74. Tiffany shot up 7.5 percent to $46.86.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A late flurry of activity pushed volume up to 9.88 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, slightly above last year's estimated daily average of 9.65 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advancing stocks handily outnumbered declining ones on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of about 13 to 1, while on the Nasdaq, about seven stocks rose for every one that fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Additional reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Durbin warns against fee changes for small banks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * In letter, Durbin warns against collusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, N.C. May 27 (Reuters) - The author of a U.S.
Senate proposal to limit debit card network fees said Visa Inc
(V.N) and MasterCard (MA.N) Inc could raise "serious antitrust
concerns" if they punish small banks that use their payment
networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Illinois Democrat Richard Durbin sent a letter to Visa and
MasterCard's chief executives accusing the companies of trying
to "frighten" small banks into opposing his plan to cap fees
that merchants pay when customers pay with their debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would caution you not to collude with your largest
member banks to change your fees and rules in an effort to
protect the big banks against competition from smaller
card-issuing banks," Durbin wrote. "Such steps would also raise
serious antitrust concerns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Durbin's amendment to a broader financial reform bill would
also make it easier for merchants to favor some forms of
payment over others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa and MasterCard are the dominant U.S. card transaction
processors, and would be among the most affected by Durbin's
proposed rule change.

&lt;p&gt;VANCOUVER May 27 (Reuters) - Chevron Inc (CVX.N) is
investigating evidence of groundwater contamination at its
refinery near Vancouver, but the incident is having no impact
on operations, a company official said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Testing found no sign of a leak at the plant so the
contamination detected in a monitoring well may be from past
activity in a section of the facility that was added in 1954,
spokesman Ray Lord said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Burnaby refinery, which began operations on the shore
of Burrard Inlet in 1935, has a production capacity of between
50,000 and 55,000 barrels a day, according to Chevron's
website.

 (Updates to late afternoon, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose sharply on
Thursday as investor worry was eased after China refuted a
report that it was reviewing its holdings in euro-zone
sovereign bonds due to the region's debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The People's Bank of China said a Financial Times report
that Beijing was concerned about its euro-zone exposure was
groundless. The report had short-circuited a rally in the
previous session. For details, see [ID:nTOE64Q04P]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It just means China is going to continue to be a sensible
investor -- because of events in Europe, they are not going to
change their basic investment strategy," said Hugh Johnson,
chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors in
Albany, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With every passing day, more and more investors are
reaching the conclusion that although events in southern
Europe will affect the European and U.S. economy, they will
not derail the current recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) climbed 3.8 percent to $25.98, a
day after ceding its position to Apple (AAPL.O) as the largest
technology company by market cap, as FBR Capital Markets
upgraded the Dow component to "outperform," citing improving
fundamentals and recent share underperformance.
[ID:nSGE64Q0CS]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 231.03
points, or 2.32 percent, to 10,205.48. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX climbed 29.71 points, or 2.78 percent, to
1,097.66. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC jumped 71.53
points, or 3.26 percent, to 2,267.41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology stocks also rebounded after having been
battered recently as a result of their higher concentration of
overseas sales. The PHLX Semiconductor index .SOXX jumped
4.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By late afternoon, the SP 500 was trading above the 1,090
level it has failed to breach in the last week, which is seen
as technical resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also being eyed by analysts as a  significant indicator
would be a close above the 200-day moving average, which now
stand right above the 1,104 mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data showing the U.S. economy grew at a slower pace than
expected in the first quarter was not enough to keep investors
from grabbing bargains after major indexes dropped more than
10 percent over the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other data released on Thursday, new applications for
state jobless benefits dropped to 460,000 last week from
474,000 in the previous week, the Labor Department said,
pointing to a gradual labor market recovery. [ID:nN27259780]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow component Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) rose 1 percent to $15.26
after the drugmaker said it would stop recruiting patients for
a clinical trial for its heart drug Inspra because the study
reached its main efficacy goal early. [ID:nN27245149]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In earnings news, both Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and
Tiffany  Co (TIF.N) reported quarterly profits that beat
expectations. Tiffany also raised its outlook. Costco advanced
4.7 percent to $58.63. Tiffany shot up 5.4 percent to $45.96.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Thursday it is halting recruitment of patients into a heart failure clinical study involving its drug Inspra because the study reached its main efficacy goal early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An independent committee monitoring the study found in a second interim analysis that patients taking Inspra plus the current standard of care had a significant reduction in risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization compared with those on the placebo plus standard of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EMPHASIS-HF trial, which was to enroll about 3,100 participants, involved patients with mild chronic systolic heart failure. Hearts of such patients have enlarged lower chambers -- called ventricles -- which fill with blood but are too weak to pump enough blood to satisfy the body's needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is now approved for a fairly narrow population of patients typically with more serious heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pfizer spokesman declined to comment when asked if the company aims to ask regulators for permission to market the medicine to a broader group of patients, in view of favorable data from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The EMPHASIS-HF trial had an estimated end-date around October 2011, so to have met the pre-defined efficacy endpoints early is certainly a positive outcome," Faiez Zannad, a cardiologist at the University of Nancy in France and co-chair of the trial's steering committee, said in a press release from Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspra, also known as eplerenone, is a relatively small seller for Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker. It is a member of the family of treatments called aldosterone blockers and was introduced in 2002. It is also approved in the United States and many overseas markets for treating high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 1 percent at $15.26, amid strong gains for the broad stock market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Ransdell Pierson, editing by Gerald E.

 (Updates to early afternoon)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ryan Vlastelica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - Major U.S. indexes advanced
on Thursday as investors were soothed after China denied a
report that it was reviewing its holdings in euro-zone
sovereign bonds due to the region's debt crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The People's Bank of China said a Financial Times report
that Beijing was concerned about its euro-zone exposure was

to hear problems from the region, the crisis has passed," said
Paul Kasriel, senior vice president of Northern Trust in
Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are coming to the realization that the global
recovery doesn't hinge on Greece, Portugal and Spain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) also lifted markets, rising 4
percent to $26.01 after FBR Capital Markets upgraded the Dow
component to "outperform," citing improving fundamentals and
recent share underperformance. [ID:nSGE64Q0CS]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI shot up 195.36

it fails, it's going to fail spectacularly," said Richard
Ross, global technical strategist at Auerbach Grayson in New

said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy shares, among the casualties in a recent sell-off,
rose sharply, with the SP energy index .GSPE up 3 percent,
the top percentage gainer among SP sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; July crude futures gained 3.9 percent to $74.30 a barrel,
tracking equities and lifting Chevron Corp (CVX.N) 2.8 percent

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft shares jumped 5 percent on Thursday, helping the Nasdaq higher, on renewed investor optimism over personal computer spending and its new Internet browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jump made up for a 4 percent dip in the stock on Wednesday, as archrival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) surpassed Microsoft's market value for the first time since 1989, making the iPhone maker the world's most valuable tech company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking in India, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said he was not concerned with the reversal and was focused on making profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBR Capital Markets raised its rating on Microsoft to "outperform" from "market perform" early on Thursday, citing a strong corporate PC refresh cycle that should benefit the company throughout 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In London, a Microsoft executive talked up the prospects for the next version of its Internet Explorer browser, due out next year, which could win back share from rivals Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Mozilla Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose $1.20, or 4.8 percent, to $26.22 in late morning trading on Nasdaq. The shares were still down 14 percent so far this year, compared with a less-than 1 percent drop in the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * BP spill could be nearly twice the size of Exxon Valdez&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * US estimates BP well spewing at least 12,000 barrels/day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Flow rate at least twice the size of BP estimates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chris Baltimore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, May 27 (Reuters) - The amount of oil spilled by BP
Plc's (BP.L) blown-out Gulf of Mexico well has eclipsed the
1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, and could be flowing at a rate
nearly four times BP's recent estimates, according to findings
of a U.S. government expert panel released on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On May 17, there were at least 130,000 barrels of oil on
the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, and a similar amount had
been skimmed off the surface or evaporated, according to a
panel of government scientists known as the Flow Rate Technical
Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The findings, made public by U.S. Geological Survey
Director Marcia McNutt, confirm that more oil has been spilled
from BP's leaking well than the estimated 257,000 barrels that
fouled Alaska's Prince William Sound by the grounding of the
Exxon Valdez tanker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the panel's calculations are accurate, a total of at
least 260,000 barrels of oil had spilled into the ocean by May
17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The high-end estimate of oil on the water that day was
270,000 barrels, with a similar amount contained or evaporated,
the panel found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McNutt declined to confirm that the BP spill has eclipsed
the Exxon Valdez, but she did not dispute it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is obviously a very, very significant environmental
disaster and I think with the numbers I've given you, you can
do the math," McNutt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The team's best estimate for the amount of oil pouring from
the well is 12,000-19,000 barrels per day, though one of three
measurement methods the team used returned a high-end rate of
25,000 barrels per day, McNutt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Assuming the well has flowed 12,000 barrels (504,000
gallons/1.9 million litres) a day since April 20 -- the day the
Deepwater Horizon rig exploded -- the total amount of oil
released by the well is 444,000 barrels (18.65 million
gallons/70.59 million litres), nearly twice the amount from
Exxon Valdez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A BP spokesman declined to comment on the government's
estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government's lowest estimate is over twice the estimate
repeatedly cited by BP officials of about 5,000 barrels
(210,000 gallons/795,000 litres), though company officials have
said the estimate is unreliable.

 (Updates to midday, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ryan Vlastelica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced more
than 2 percent on Thursday after China denied a report that it
was reviewing its holdings in euro-zone sovereign bonds due to
the region's debt crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The People's Bank of China said a Financial Times report
that Beijing was concerned about its euro-zone exposure was
groundless. The report had cut short a rally in the previous
session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Reports from the front suggested that investors might
become frightened that China could do something drastic," said
Douglas Peta, an independent market strategist in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Getting some assurance that Chinese sales of European
sovereign debt isn't imminent is making everyone feel
better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) also lifted markets, rising 4.7
percent to $26.18 after FBR Capital Markets upgraded the Dow
component to "outperform," citing improving fundamentals and
recent share underperformance. [ID:nSGE64Q0CS]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 214.02
points, or 2.15 percent, at 10,188.47. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX was up 25.31 points, or 2.37 percent, at
1,093.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 59.82
points, or 2.72 percent, at 2,255.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 was trading in late morning above the 1,090
level it has failed to breach in the last week, which is seen
as technical resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Short-term, that's probably a level that traders are
sitting on, trying to play that from the short side, but when
it fails, it's going to fail spectacularly," said Richard
Ross, global technical strategist at Auerbach Grayson in New
York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he said a more signifiant indicator would be a close
above the 200-day moving average, now right above 1,104.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow jumped back above 10,000 and the CBOE Volatility
Index .VIX fell 13 percent to levels seen in the middle of
May before investors got rattled over the fragility of the
European banking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data showing the U.S. economy grew at a slower pace than
expected in the first quarter was not enough to keep investors
from grabbing bargains after major indexes dropped more than
10 percent over the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other data released on Thursday, new applications for
state jobless benefits dropped to 460,000 last week from
474,000 in the previous week, the Labor Department said,
pointing to a gradual labor market recovery. [ID:nN27259780]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No one wants to see GDP revised lower, and the labor
market isn't going to improve in a day, but it is encouraging
to see concrete signs of improvement," Peta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy shares, among the casualties in a recent sell-off,
rose sharply, with the SP energy index .GSPE up 3 percent,
the top percentage gainer among SP sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; July crude futures gained 3.7 percent, or $2.62, to $74.13
a barrel, tracking equities. In sync with the spike in oil
prices, Chevron Corp (CVX.N) rose 2.8 percent to $73.58.
Chevron gave the Dow its top boost, while Microsoft was the
percentage leader and the Nasdaq's most actively traded stock.
[ID:nSGE64Q05U]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fellow Dow component Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) rose 1.5 percent
to $15.33 after the drugmaker said it would stop recruiting
patients for a clinical trial for its heart drug Inspra
because the study reached its main efficacy goal early.
[ID:nN27245149]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In earnings news, both Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and
Tiffany  Co (TIF.N) reported quarterly profits that beat
expectations while Tiffany also raised its outlook. Costco
advanced 4.7 percent to $58.60 while Tiffany shot up 5.6
percent to $46.05. [ID:nN27255167] and [ID:nN27257094]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the downside, Monsanto Co (MON.N) slumped 7.6 percent
to $48.67 after it cut its 2010 profit outlook.

&lt;p&gt;    * IE chief sees hardware acceleration, HTML5 boosting IE9 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * 1 million downloads of test-drive platform &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * HTML5 seen cohabiting with Flash, Silverlight &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Georgina Prodhan &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) could regain the edge over rivals Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Mozilla Firefox with its new Web browser due to be launched next year, the head of Microsoft Internet Explorer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Ryan Gavin said in an interview Microsoft was generating a high level of interest in Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) from the external software developers who are key to its success, thanks to new capabilities and a new, more open approach towards such third parties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft, which was overtaken on Wednesday by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as the world's most valuable technology company, has seen Internet Explorer's market share dwindle to 60 percent from about 95 percent in the early 2000s. [nN26182337] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    U.S. and European regulators have helped rival browsers like Google Chrome to flourish by loosening the ties between Internet Explorer and Microsoft's Windows operating system that runs 90 percent of the world's personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Google is developing a rival operating system based on its Chrome browser, which is intended to be leaner and more Web-friendly than Windows, as well as being free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft is betting IE9 will provide a far superior visual experience to currently available browsers by harnessing the power of the computer's graphics processor via Windows to accelerate the software process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With HTML5, a new Web standard gaining in popularity, it also hopes to be able to deliver powerful visuals via a single mark-up language readable by all browsers, simplifying the life of developers and improving the user experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    HTML5 makes possible rich applications like video on the Web that are currently enabled by Adobe's (ADBE.O) Flash and Microsoft's own, far less widely used Silverlight technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ALL IN   HTML5 is already at the centre of a public row between Adobe and Apple, which has rejected Flash on the iPhone and iPad in favour of HTML5.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are putting HTML5 at the centre of IE9. We are all in with HTML5," Gavin told Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Today, if developers want to use the exact same markup, they use plug-ins -- Silverlight and Flash -- to do that. HTML5 is going to give developers that capability for things like graphics and video in the future." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Asked how long he thought it would be until HTML5 made Flash and Silverlight redundant, Gavin said: "I think the plug-in model with standards is a thing that's going to continue to cohabit (with HTML5)". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With IE9, Microsoft has decided to engage developers openly at a far earlier stage than usual by releasing a test-drive platform containing its basic components, to create excitement and iron out bugs. (ie.microsoft.com/testdrive) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We started with a new model with IE9, it's the first time we've ever done it," Gavin said. "It's basically a way for developers to see in a highly secure, well-tested environment what are the new capabilities we're building." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He said the platform had been downloaded about a million times since the first version was published in March. Microsoft is updating it once every eight weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Responses from developers on the Microsoft IE blog &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(blogs.msdn.com) have been mixed. Many welcome the new possibilities, but many also complain IE9 requires the latest Windows 7 or Vista software to run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "You guys have turned around a 10 year sinking torpedo," writes James Tiedt on the blog. But AlfonsoML asks the blunt question: "What good is a browser if most of the people keep using XP and won't be able to use it?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nine-year-old XP still has 63 percent of the total operating-system market, according to Web analytics firm Net Applications. Vista has 16 percent and Windows 7 has 12 percent, with non-Windows systems on 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by David Holmes) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((georgina.prodhan@thomsonreuters.com; +4420 7542 7954; Reuters Messaging georgina.prodhan.reuters.com@reuters.net))   Keywords: MICROSOFT/INTERNETEXPLORER  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2010.

&lt;p&gt;Alice Comes Home on Disney Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital Copies Available June 1
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Tim Burton`s epic fantasy adventure "Disney`s Alice in Wonderland" reached a
historic milestone today, passing the $1 billion dollar mark in global box
office. "Alice" becomes only the sixth title to join this exclusive list and the
third most popular non-sequel in motion picture history behind only "Titanic"
and "Avatar." 

"We feel incredibly fortunate to be able to showcase such an amazing 3D film
from visionary director Tim Burton and the creative talents of Johnny Depp, Mia
Wasikowska, Helena Bonham Carter, and Anne Hathaway," said Rich Ross, Chairman
of The Walt Disney Studios. "Our marketing teams joined with our exhibition
partners to find every opportunity to bring this creative masterpiece to fans
around the world." 

"Alice" began setting records during its opening weekend (March 5-7), becoming
the biggest March opening in industry history, the biggest 3-D opening ever and
biggest career opening for director Tim Burton. It also became The Walt Disney
Studios` biggest opening for a non-sequel. 

Domestically, "Disney`s Alice in Wonderland" has surpassed $332 million at the
box office and is officially the third highest-grossing film in The Walt Disney
Studios' history, behind only "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man`s Chest" and
"Finding Nemo." It currently ranks as the 19th most successful film in domestic
box office history. 

Simultaneously, "Alice" began to conquer audiences around the globe, tallying
more than $667 million to date, en route to becoming Disney`s biggest overseas
release of all-time. In Japan alone, "Alice" has maintained its #1 position for
six weeks, resulting in more than $108 million to date. The United Kingdom added
more than $64 million, while France, Russia and Italy all have topped $42
million. Germany, Australia, China and Mexico have surpassed the $30 million
mark, while Spain and Brazil`s cumulative totals each exceeded $25 million. The
movie continues to entertain theatrical audiences in many countries throughout
the world. 

Just as the film crosses the $1 billion global theatrical box office threshold,
consumers will now be able to own this historic film for themselves. "Disney`s
Alice in Wonderland" makes its home entertainment debut as a Disney 3-Disc
Blu-ray Combo Pack (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy), 1-Disc Blu-ray and 1-Disc DVD
on Tuesday, June 1, 2010 in North America, Russia, China, Mexico and Italy.
Availability in other international markets will occur throughout June, July and
August starting with Belgium (June 2), the Netherlands (June 2), the United
Kingdom (June 4) and Argentina (June 9).

&lt;p&gt;"Wavin` Flag - Coca-Cola Celebration Mix" Is a Certified Number One Hit in
China, Mexico and Germany and Continues Rise on Music Charts Around the World

"Coca-Cola Celebration Radio" -- First Digital Radio Station Created by a Brand
Debuts Featuring Playlist of Hundreds of Songs and Audio Blogs by K`NAAN


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
`Wavin` Flag - Coca-ColaCelebration Mix`, the uplifting soundtrack recorded by
K`NAAN for Coca-Cola and its sponsorship of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, has already
broken into the top ten on music charts in eleven countries including peaking at
number one in China, Mexico, Germany, Canada, Austria, Switzerland and
Luxembourg. Building on the success of this music collaboration, Coca-Cola today
debuted a digital radio station, "Coca-Cola Celebration Radio," available free
to anyone around the world online and features a playlist of "celebration"
songs, actual disc-jockeys and daily audio blogs by K`NAAN updating his
experience from South Africa during the FIFA World Cup. 

K`NAAN, as the official programmer of the station, personally selected many of
the tracks played on Coca-Cola Celebration Radio based on their upbeat tempo,
celebratory style and inclusion of African artists. Listeners will also hear
K`NAAN`s personal take on the celebration in South Africa as he provides daily
"audio blogs" from the tournament during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The radio
station, believed to be the first digital radio station entirely supported by a
single brand and created for Coca-Cola by GOOM Radio, can be downloaded as a
widget and placed on social media sites, blogs and websites. Coca-Cola
Celebration Radio is available at http://celebrations.coca-cola.com. K`NAAN`s
Coca-Cola anthem will be featured prominently on the radio station. 

The single has been released in more than 150 markets around the world and is
used as the anthem for all elements of the global Coca-Cola marketing campaign
in support of its FIFA World Cup sponsorship in more than 160 countries. The
song is heard on television commercials, the digital campaign website
www.youtube.com/coca-cola, a broadcast documentary about the history of goal
celebrations sponsored by Coca-Cola and has been performed live by K`NAAN at
more than 20 stops of the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola including
concerts in Mexico City, Rome, London, Paris and Tokyo. The track is even part
of the music for the EA SPORTS 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa videogame title.


K`NAAN, a native of Somalia, has collaborated with some of the world`s hottest
recording artists to create a dozen local-language versions of the song. Artists
include Thai chart-toppers Tattoo Colour, multi-platinum Lebanese singer Nancy
Ajram and China`s most popular female artist Jane Zhang. 

The track is a remix of K`NAAN`s `Wavin Flag`, which originally appeared on his
hit 2009 album `Troubadour`. K`NAAN reworked the song for the Coca-Cola campaign
which invites football fans to express their optimism and passion for football
through dance celebrations in the run-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South
Africa. 

"It`s great to have a hit song in all four corners of the world," commented
K`NAAN. "Wavin` Flag is a beautiful, uplifting song and I hope it captures the
feeling of unity and celebration the FIFA World Cup brings to people all across
the planet. It is a time for all of us to wave our flags." 

K`NAAN will also perform the song at Coca-Cola sponsored events in South Africa
during the FIFA World Cup including Trophy Tour events and appearances at
official "Fan Fests" where people will gather for public viewing of matches.
Fans at matches of the FIFA World Cup will also hear the song`s memorable
five-note chorus in the stadium before each game and at half-time and be
prompted to chant along to the "Oh, oh, oh-oh, ohhh" refrain and wave their
flags via video board messages. 

"Music plays a central role in this campaign," explained Emmanuel Seuge, group
director, worldwide sports and entertainment marketing, The Coca-Cola Company.
"We`ve collaborated with K`NAAN to create a song that expresses the celebration
and optimism that connects everyone during the FIFA World Cup. We believe it
will be one of this summer`s biggest hits. And we have built on the success of
the single by playing it in the stadiums during the matches and creating a
digital radio station to carry that song as well as others directly to fans
around the world."

&lt;p&gt;   * PC refresh cycle to boost Microsoft's desktop products &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Shares rise 2.3 percent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 27 (Reuters) - FBR Capital Markets raised its rating on Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to "outperform" from "market perform," citing a strong corporate PC refresh cycle and multiple product cycles across all divisions that could benefit the company throughout 2011. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of the world's biggest software maker rose 2.3 percent in trading before the bell Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The stock presents an attractive risk/reward, given its recent underperformance and improving fundamentals, the brokerage said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft shares are down 14 percent since the start of the year, trailing the broader S 500 index .SPX, which is down 4 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On Wednesday, market researcher Gartner said it expects global PC shipments to rise 22 percent this year, up from its March forecast of 20 percent, driven by strong consumer demand and companies replacing aging computers. [nN26206972] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft is expected to be a key beneficiary of this growth, given its operating system runs on more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe we are in the early stages of the corporate PC cycle refresh that should provide a boost to the company's flagship desktop offerings," analyst David Hilal said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft desktop products include Windows 7, the latest version of its operating system, and the Office 2010 software suite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The upgrade comes a day after rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) overtook Microsoft to become the world's biggest technology company based on market value. [nN26182337] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft shares were up 58 cents at $25.59 in trading before the opening bell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by S.

St. PAUL, Minnesota--(Business Wire)--
St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE:STJ), soci&#233;t&#233; internationale de dispositifs
m&#233;dicaux, a annonc&#233; aujourd`hui &#224; EuroPCR qu`elle allait &#233;valuer la rentabilit&#233;
incr&#233;mentielle d`un traitement guid&#233; par la r&#233;serve coronaire (Fractional Flow
Reserve (FFR)) pour les patients atteints de coronaropathie multi-vaisseaux au
Royaume-Uni, en Allemagne, en France, en Italie, en Suisse, en Belgique et au
Canada. Cette analyse va &#233;galement d&#233;terminer l`impact sanitaire et budg&#233;taire
potentiel de FFR pour chacun de ces sept pays. 

Les mesures FFR indiquent la s&#233;v&#233;rit&#233; des blocages du flux sanguin dans les
art&#232;res coronaires. Cette mesure physiologique utilisant PressureWire Aeris ou
PressureWire Certus aide les m&#233;decins &#224; mieux identifier la ou les l&#233;sions
sp&#233;cifiques responsables chez le patient de l`isch&#233;mie, qui est une d&#233;ficience
du flux sanguin vers le c&#339;ur caus&#233;e par un blocage du sang. 

L`analyse d&#233;taill&#233;e sera bas&#233;e sur les r&#233;sultats de l`&#233;tude FAME (Fractional
Flow Reserve (FFR) vs. Angiography in Multivessel Evaluation), sur les
statistiques des registres d`intervention coronaire percutan&#233;e (ICP) sp&#233;cifiques
&#224; chaque pays et sur la litt&#233;rature publi&#233;e &#224; ce sujet. 

Les recherches indiqueront pour chaque pays :

* Si l`utilisation d`une approche guid&#233;e par FFR envers l`ICP est susceptible de

* S`il y a un impact sur la sant&#233; de la population subissant une ICP

L`&#233;tude phare FAME, &#233;galement commandit&#233;e par St. Jude Medical, a compar&#233; un
traitement guid&#233; par FFR &#224; une angiographie standard chez plus de 1 000 patients
atteints de coronaropathie multi-vaisseaux et d&#233;termin&#233; qu`outre des r&#233;sultats
cliniques sup&#233;rieurs (avec une r&#233;duction de 34 % des d&#233;c&#232;s et des crises
cardiaques), la strat&#233;gie d`intervention guid&#233;e par FFR avait r&#233;duit les co&#251;ts
des soins d`environ 2 000 USD par patient, soit 14 %, aux &#201;tats-Unis. 

L`analyse d&#233;taill&#233;e sera r&#233;alis&#233;e par le professeur Uwe Siebert, M.D., MSc,
M.P.H., ScD, investigateur de l`&#233;tude FAME. Des conseillers cliniques locaux
seront &#233;galement disponibles dans chaque pays pour contribuer &#224; valider la
mod&#233;lisation des donn&#233;es. 

&#171; La technologie de mesure FFR PressureWire constitue une opportunit&#233; m&#233;dicale
unique, en ce sens qu`un produit am&#233;liore les r&#233;sultats cliniques tout en
&#233;conomisant de l`argent &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Frank Callaghan, pr&#233;sident de la division
cardiovasculaire de St. Jude Medical. &#171; St. Jude Medical va continuer &#224;
effectuer des &#233;valuations et &#224; parrainer la recherche afin de mieux comprendre
l`impact &#233;conomique et sanitaire g&#233;n&#233;ral potentiel de FFR &#187;. 

EuroPCR est le congr&#232;s officiel de l`EAPCI (European Association of Percutaneous
Cardiovascular Interventions), cours international de premier plan pour les
sp&#233;cialistes cardiovasculaires interventionnels. 

&#192; propos de l`&#233;tude FAME

L`&#233;tude FAME est un essai randomis&#233;, prospectif et multicentrique regroupant 1
005 patients souffrant de coronaropathie multi-vaisseaux. L`&#233;tude FAME a compar&#233;
les r&#233;sultats pour les patients dont le traitement &#233;tait guid&#233; par la r&#233;serve
coronaire &#224; ceux dont le traitement &#233;tait uniquement guid&#233; par une angiographie
&#224; l`aide de la technologie PressureWire Certus de St. Jude Medical,
exclusivement pour la mesure FFR. Les r&#233;sultats sur 12 mois, publi&#233;s dans
l`&#233;dition du 15 janvier 2009 du New England Journal of Medicine, ont d&#233;montr&#233;
que les cas d`&#233;v&#233;nements cardiovasculaires ind&#233;sirables majeurs (ECIM), y
compris la mort, l`infarctus du myocarde ou une revascularisation r&#233;p&#233;t&#233;e,
avaient &#233;t&#233; r&#233;duits de 28 % pour les patients dont le traitement avait &#233;t&#233; guid&#233;
par FFR compar&#233; &#224; une angiographie standard seule. 

Les r&#233;sultats obtenus sur deux ans et pr&#233;sent&#233;s en tant qu`essai clinique de
derni&#232;re heure &#224; la conf&#233;rence TCT (Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics)
2009 ont d&#233;montr&#233; que les patients qui avaient suivi un traitement guid&#233; par FFR
continuaient d`afficher des r&#233;sultats am&#233;lior&#233;s au fil du temps, y compris une
r&#233;duction de 34 % du risque de d&#233;c&#232;s ou d`infarctus du myocarde (crise
cardiaque). Le traitement guid&#233; par FFR s`est &#233;galement av&#233;r&#233; rentable au bout
d`un an, avec une diff&#233;rence d`environ 2 000 USD, soit 14 %, par patient entre
le co&#251;t total des soins pour le groupe guid&#233; par FFR et le groupe trait&#233; par
l`angiographie seule. Cette r&#233;duction du co&#251;t des soins est le r&#233;sultat d`une
baisse des co&#251;ts des interventions, d`une baisse des co&#251;ts de suivi pour les
&#233;v&#233;nements cardiaques ind&#233;sirables majeurs et d`une r&#233;duction des dur&#233;es des
s&#233;jours &#224; l`h&#244;pital.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Walt Disney Co employee and her boyfriend have been charged with a "brazen" insider trading scheme in which they said the media conglomerate was in advanced talks to sell its ABC TV network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney quickly said that claim was false. But the incident, which came to light on Wednesday after a months-long FBI undercover sting operation, is an irritant for a company known for a carefully spun image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Disney leapt as much as 4.7 percent before backtracking after the denial to end the day up 2.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors accuse Bonnie Hoxie, an assistant to Disney's corporate communications chief, and Yonni Sebbag of trying to sell insider information to over 30 hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a total embarrassment for Disney, but it can happen to any company," said Alan Gould, an analyst with Soleil Research. "What's far more interesting from the share value perspective is if they are selling ABC."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors have been cracking down on insider trading but this investigation is not part of the closely watched probe that ensnared Galleon hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and 20 others last year from Wall Street to Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court documents said Hoxie and Sebbag conspired from March through May 25 of this year to try to profit off confidential information available to her as assistant to a top executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoxie is accused of giving information about Disney's earnings to Sebbag, who in turn tried to sell it to U.S. and European hedge funds, according to criminal and civil charges filed in New York on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assistant and Sebbag -- also known as Jonathan Cyrus -- were arrested by FBI agents in Los Angeles and arraigned in Los Angeles federal court on Wednesday. Hoxie was released on $50,000 bail and ordered to a hearing in New York on June 3. Sebbag was deemed a flight risk and was detained. He will be transported to New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Hoxie and Sebbag kicked off their effort by sending cold emails to hedge funds, many of whom then went straight to federal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an undercover dragnet, agents contacted Sebbag, who in one email said he learned Disney was in talks to sell ABC, a long-standing subject of speculation on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bob Iger is in serious and advanced negotiations with two private equity firms to sell them the ABC network but no price has been determined yet," Sebbag wrote in the email, according to the criminal complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney responded: "The reference in the complaint to conversations regarding the ABC Network were and are false."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE STING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear from the complaints what motivated the pair. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission complaint, Hoxie -- on the day she sent confidential earnings information -- told her boyfriend she had her eye on a $700 Stella McCartney designer handbag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here is the bag you are going to get for me - thank," Hoxie was quoted as writing in an email with an attached photo of the item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Sebbag replied: "I may be able to (buy) u 2 of them, lol."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In that case, I also love love these shoes," she is said to have responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges, saying the pair sent anonymous letters to U.S. and European hedge funds, offering a pre-release of Disney second-quarter 2010 results in exchange for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal complaint filed in Manhattan federal court in New York charged Hoxie, 33, and Sebbag, 29, with conspiracy and wire fraud in allegations of illegal insider trading. The charges carry a maximum possible sentence of 20 years' imprisonment should they be found guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is being prosecuted in New York rather than in Los Angeles because the pair contacted several hedge funds in New York. Sebbag stayed at a Manhattan hotel during a trip to collect payment for the sale of the confidential information about Disney, the complaints said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that meeting on May 14 with two putative traders, in reality FBI agents, Sebbag was paid $15,000 in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sebbag, with an envelope containing $15,000 in his grasp, revealed his true identity to the supposed traders and discussed building their relationship by providing more confidential Disney information in future, the complaints said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recording of the meeting, Sebbag told the undercover FBI agents his source at Disney was an assistant to one of the top five executives at the company. He said she had access to emails about sensitive business information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not (a one-time deal)," Sebbag said, according to the criminal complaint. "For as long as (the Tipper) is in place, we're continuing. And I'll make sure that that person stays in place, in her position ... because some chunk of my money, I'm going to give it to her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v Bonnie Hoxie et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York No. 10-mag-1113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sue Zeidler and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Grant McCool in New York; Editing by Edwin Chan, Tim Dobbyn, Matthew Lewis, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acknowledged on Friday that it used an inaccurate number to represent research company IDC's sales forecast for the upcoming Windows Phone 7 platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a presentation at the ReMix conference in Paris this week, Microsoft showed a slide that said IDC had forecast 30 million Windows Phone 7 devices would be sold by the end of 2011. The MobileTechWorld blog posted a photo of the French-language slide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, IDC had said no such thing about the future operating system, on which many observers believe Microsoft's mobile-phone future depends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the research company forecast 2011 sales of 32 million devices running all Windows mobile operating systems. This includes expected sales of devices with Windows Mobile 6.5, which is already on the market. IDC has not given any sales estimate for Windows Phone 7, which Microsoft has said will be available in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the ReMix conference in Paris, Microsoft presented a slide projecting the number of Windows Phone 7 [devices] to be sold in 2011.  This slide was inaccurate, and intended to represent an analyst's assessment of the market opportunity," Microsoft said in a prepared statement. The company added that it has not provided any sales forecasts of its own for the OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDC won't be able to forecast sales of Windows Phone 7 devices until the OS is on sale and it has been able to talk with mobile operators and hardware vendors, mobile analyst Will Stofega said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has lagged in the fast-moving smartphone market as Apple's iPhone and Google's Android OS have captured the limelight. IDC's report showed about 16 million Windows Mobile devices shipped in 2009, with a forecast of 22 million this year and 32 million next year. Windows Mobile is in fourth place among phone operating systems, behind Symbian, BlackBerry and Mac OS X, and will remain there until 2014, when it will surpass Mac OS X, IDC believes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 7, a significant departure from today's Windows Mobile OSes, showed promise in demonstrations at the Mobile World Congress trade show in February, Stofega said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step was to ... redo Windows Mobile so it was more responsive, better (user interface), everything everyone complained about, and more up-to-date with the competitors," Stofega said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDC commented on those demonstrations in its report but did not go so far as to forecast sales specifically for the future product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now they have to ship, and they have to get (Windows Phone 7) into the hands of their OEM partners quickly, and that's the challenge," Stofega said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(IDC is owned by International Data Group, the parent company of IDG News Service.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) move to shake up the leadership of its mobile and games division this week -- giving Chief Executive Steve Ballmer direct control over the push to catch up with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google Inc (GOOG.O) in the exploding smartphone market -- revealed its determination to ride the next wave of computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few expect a change of management to turn the entertainment and devices unit into an iPhone-killing, Wii-slaying profit machine overnight. But Microsoft -- known for its deep pockets and ability to assimilate new technology -- won't stop pouring money into the mobile and gaming sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Failure is not an option," said Sid Parakh, technology analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen in Seattle. "Android and the iPhone have got so far ahead, it's going to be a hard, uphill battle. But it's something they have to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, Microsoft pinned its future on what it called "three screens and a cloud" -- the television, personal computer and phone, all connected by the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mobile is a critical piece of that," said Parakh. "We are all doing more and more on our handheld devices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software firm has work to do to regain its place in the smartphone market, having sunk to fifth place worldwide, behind Google's Android, Apple's iPhone, Research in Motion Ltd's BlackBerry RIM.TO and Nokia's (NOK1V.HE) Symbian system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new Windows Phone 7 system, which will start appearing on phones this holiday season, could be the last chance for Microsoft to keep its place in consumers' hearts and minds as new ways of computing take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are doing more on their non-Windows smartphones and less on their largely Windows PCs. Apple's iPad -- rolled out to nine more countries on Thursday -- is a hit and hardware makers are rushing out competing tablet devices, mostly on non-Windows platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Microsoft's old ally Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) is striking out on its own, buying Palm Inc PALM.O to use its operating system on its forthcoming 'slate' devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is their last chance. If they are not successful this time, it's not going to matter," said Jack Gold at tech research firm J. Gold Associates. "But they've got a big war chest. They can stay in this space forever if they choose to, if they want to subsidize it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHAKING THINGS UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retirement of 48-year-old Robbie Bach, the long-time leader of the entertainment and devices unit, means that the executives in charge of games and phones -- Don Mattrick and Andy Lees respectively -- will report directly to Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer is likely to be pushing them every inch of the way. Launching Windows Phone 7 in Barcelona this year, he underlined the importance of the market to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We talk about a strategy that says three screens and a cloud, and the phone is absolutely one of the critical screens," he said in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entertainment business is in a stronger position, providing most, if not all, of the $851 million operating profit the unit made in the first nine months of Microsoft's current fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has sold 40 million of its Xbox 360 consoles and says it has 23 million paying subscribers for its Xbox Live network, letting users play each other in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After considerable investment, Xbox Live is now the best example of a genuine money-making "cloud" computing business Microsoft has, Parakh said, and has gone some way to fulfilling its vision of Xbox as the hub for living room entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Xbox division has been on fire since Don Mattrick got there," said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. "Xbox Live is really wildly profitable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox still lags Nintendo Co's 7974.OS Wii console in monthly sales, but Microsoft hopes to change that when its hands-free, motion-sensing Natal comes out this holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all analysts support Microsoft's push. Entertainment and devices is only the fourth biggest of Microsoft's five operating units, behind its Windows, Office and server units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though on track to post more than $8 billion in revenue this fiscal year, that's still under a tenth of Microsoft's $62 billion or so annual revenue. Last quarter, it contributed only 3 percent of the company's operating profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would be better off dumping the unit to focus on its core Windows and Office units, say some shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The error is even if they do succeed, there's almost zero chance of it being a large enough business to impact a company the size of Microsoft," said Bill Smead, chief executive of Seattle-based Smead Capital Management, whose funds hold about $10 million worth of Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the view on Wall Street seems to be that Microsoft needs to keep working at the consumer business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are not many adjacent areas of tech that can help Microsoft meaningfully add to its $62 billion annual revenue. Consumer electronics is one of the few that could move the needle for them," Katherine Egbert at Jefferies  Co said in a note to clients this week. "We don't expect Microsoft to abandon the consumer market and play only defense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Franklin Paul in New York; Editing by Edwin Chan and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * Software maker raises focus on phones, games unit &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Faces struggle to catch up with Apple, Google &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Natal could boost Xbox sales &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Bill Rigby &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SEATTLE, May 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) move to shake up the leadership of its mobile and games division this week -- giving Chief Executive Steve Ballmer direct control over the push to catch up with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google Inc (GOOG.O) in the exploding smartphone market -- revealed its determination to ride the next wave of computing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Few expect a change of management to turn the entertainment and devices unit into an iPhone-killing, Wii-slaying profit machine overnight. But Microsoft -- known for its deep pockets and ability to assimilate new technology -- won't stop pouring money into the mobile and gaming sectors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Failure is not an option," said Sid Parakh, technology analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen in Seattle. "Android and the iPhone have got so far ahead, it's going to be a hard, uphill battle. But it's something they have to do." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Several years ago, Microsoft pinned its future on what it called "three screens and a cloud" -- the television, personal computer and phone, all connected by the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Mobile is a critical piece of that," said Parakh.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Watson Files Renvela ANDA

Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NYSE: WPI) recently announced that it is seeking to
launch a generic version of Genzyme`s (Nasdaq: GENZ) Renvela (sevelamer
carbonate). The company is seeking approval from the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the phosphate binder that is approved for the control
of serum phosphorus in chronic kidney disease patients who are on dialysis. 

In response to the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) filed by Watson,
Genzyme has filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the US District Court for the
District of Maryland. This means that Watson will not gain final approval for
its generic version of Renvela for up to 30 months or until the court delivers a
final decision, whichever occurs earlier. 

We note that Watson is not the only company seeking to launch a generic version
of the drug. Generic players like Lupin and Impax Laboratories are also looking
to launch generic versions of Renvela. According to IMS Health, Renvela
delivered US sales of $200 million in the past 12 months ending March 31, 2010. 

Watson has initiated several new patent challenges this year. The company
recently filed abbreviated new drug applications for Eli Lilly`s (NYSE: LLY)
Evista, Abbott`s (NYSE: ABT) Simcor and TriLipix, Pfizer`s (NYSE: PFE) Rapamune,
among others. 

At the end of the first quarter of 2010, Watson had 100 ANDAs pending approval
with the FDA. New product launches over regular intervals should help drive the
generics business. Watson expects generic segment sales in the range of $2.25 -
$2.4 billion in 2010. 

We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Watson. We believe that the
company`s cost savings initiative and new product launches, both branded and
generic, will help drive growth. We also view the company`s acquisition of Arrow
as a smart strategic move. This acquisition should help boost Watson`s product
portfolio and expand its footprint in ex-US territories.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) as the Bull of the
Day and American Oriental Bioengineering (NYSE: AOB) the Bear of the Day. In
addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Hewlett-Packard Company
(NYSE: HPQ), International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and 3Com Corporation
(Nasdaq: COMS). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) looks forward to widening its market share through
its accelerated product transformation plan: "One Ford." Incorporating key
objectives such as shifting focus from trucks to small cars, delivering more
vehicles from fewer core platforms and implementing cost reduction efforts, the
plan could have a positive impact on the stock. 

In 2009, the plan had already turned in a profit after 4 years. Furthermore, it
helped the automaker gain market share in the U.S. 

In addition, favorable net pricing, structural cost reductions and improved Ford
Credit results are driving Ford's earnings. These have led us to upgrade the
recommendation on shares from Neutral to Outperform with a target price of $13. 

Bear of the Day: 

American Oriental Bioengineering's (NYSE: AOB) first quarter earnings per share
came in at $0.04, well below both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.07 and
$0.10 reported in the year-ago period. 

Although revenues recorded a 16.7% year-over-year increase to $53.7 million, we
remain concerned about the declining operating margin. Prescription drug sales
should continue their growth trajectory as China aims to reform its health care
sector to incorporate unaddressed rural markets. 

However, in the highly fragmented Chinese pharmaceutical industry, AOB's
expenses are likely to increase given the need to stay ahead of its competitors
and to meet stringent manufacturing norms. We maintain our Underperform
recommendation on the stock. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

HP Leads the Server Market

Everything seems to be going in favor of the largest computer manufacturing
company Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ). As per the recent report published
by the technology research firm Gartner, HP generated $3.4 billion in server
revenue during the first three months of the current year, up 16.0% compared to
the year-ago period. 

On the other hand, during the same period, the server revenue of International
Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) dipped 2.1% to $3.05 billion. 

The performances of the two companies in the last quarter put HP in the
leadership position, with a 31.5% market share, exceeding IBM`s market share of
28.4%. 

After overtaking all its competitors in the PC market, the tech major has now
taken aggressive measures and ended up grabbing the top slot in the server
business. The company has already strengthened its networking line of business
by grabbing another networking company 3Com Corporation (Nasdaq: COMS). 

Enterprise Storage and Servers (ESS) is the largest business within the
Technology Solutions Group (TSG). The segment has benefited from its move to
Industry Standard Servers (ISS), changing the product mix within the ESS group. 

During the second quarter of 2010, ESS revenue increased 31.0% year over year,
driven by the increase in Industry Standard Server revenue, which moved up 54%
year over year. We believe that with the revival in the macroeconomic scenario,
and strengthening of IT spending, this segment should perform well in the
ensuing quarters.

&lt;p&gt; * Salesforce says profit could be hurt for one quarter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Doesn't believe overall financial health to suffer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft filed lawsuit on May 18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Salesforce says it has discussed matter with Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Salesforce says analyzing merit of Microsoft claims
 (Adds details from Salesforce, background on lawsuit)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, May 28 (Reuters) - Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) said
a recent lawsuit by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) could hurt
Salesforce's profits for one quarter, though the litigation is
unlikely to derail the company's overall financial health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft filed a complaint on May 18, charging that
Salesforce's web-based software for managing sales activities
infringes nine of its patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software giant alleged that Salesforce.com was using
its technology in software menus, toolbars and graphical
interface features, as well as in the way that it obtains data
from remote computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Salesforce said on Friday that it was still investigating
the merits of the claims, though the two companies had
discussed the matter since Microsoft filed its suit last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company continues to analyze the potential merits of
these claims, the potential defenses to such claims and
potential counter claims," Salesforce said in a 10-Q quarterly
regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's suit was filed in federal court in Seattle,
close to the headquarters of the world's biggest software maker
in Redmond, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is: Microsoft Corp v Salesforce.com Inc, case
number 2:10-cv-00825, in the U.S. District Court, Western
District of Washington at Seattle.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - The amount of oil spilled by BP Plc's blown-out Gulf of Mexico well has eclipsed the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, and could be flowing at a rate nearly four times BP's recent estimates, according to findings of a U.S. government expert panel released on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 17, there were at least 130,000 barrels of oil on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, and a similar amount had been skimmed off the surface or evaporated, according to a panel of government scientists known as the Flow Rate Technical Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, made public by U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt, confirm that more oil has been spilled from BP's leaking well than the estimated 257,000 barrels that fouled Alaska's Prince William Sound by the grounding of the Exxon Valdez tanker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the panel's calculations are accurate, a total of at least 260,000 barrels of oil had spilled into the ocean by May 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-end estimate of oil on the water that day was 270,000 barrels, with a similar amount contained or evaporated, the panel found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNutt declined to confirm that the BP spill has eclipsed the Exxon Valdez, but she did not dispute it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is obviously a very, very significant environmental disaster and I think with the numbers I've given you, you can do the math," McNutt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's best estimate for the amount of oil pouring from the well is 12,000-19,000 barrels per day, though one of three measurement methods the team used returned a high-end rate of 25,000 barrels per day, McNutt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming the well has flowed 12,000 barrels (504,000 gallons/1.9 million liters) a day since April 20 -- the day the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded -- the total amount of oil released by the well is 444,000 barrels (18.65 million gallons/70.59 million liters), nearly twice the amount from Exxon Valdez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A BP spokesman declined to comment on the government's estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government's lowest estimate is over twice the estimate repeatedly cited by BP officials of about 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons/795,000 liters), though company officials have said the estimate is unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Chris Baltimore; Editing by Eric Beech)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's mobile barcode technology, Tag, has exited the beta testing phase, and a final release is available for download, the company said in a blog post on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a user points a mobile code camera on a barcode the Tag client will interpret the code, and link to a variety of content. For example, Golf Digest has been using tags to let their readers access video lessons on smartphones. In Amsterdam, visitors can go on a Tag-led tour, with tags on monuments, museums, restaurants, bars, and other landmarks, according to Microsoft. In its simplest form, Tag links directly to a Web page, the blog post said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tags can also be used to dial a phone number -- when the user scans the tag a phone number is automatically dialed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is hoping that as many phones as possible will use the technology, so besides Microsoft's OS, the Tag client is available for Android, BlackBerry, the iPhone, Symbian and PalmOS. A Java-based version, which would open the door for running the application on cheaper phones, is under development, as well.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1 billion tags have been printed since Tag was launched about 18 months ago, according to Microsoft. Future plans for the technology include advanced reporting and analytics and real-time location services, the blog post said.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS May 28 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust
regulators are seeking third party views regarding Visa Europe's
(V.N) offer to cut its debit card fees to stave off a possible
fine before deciding whether to accept the proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The credit and debit card network last month proposed to cap
fees at 0.2 percent for cross-border transactions and for
domestic purchases in nine countries where it sets the charges
directly.
The offer came after the European Commission, the EU
antitrust watchdog, told Visa Europe in 2009 that its fees
curbed competition between banks. The fees are a key source of
revenue for banks and indirectly for the payment networks.
The U.S. senate earlier this month passed legislation that
would restrict debit card fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission said its market test, launched on Friday,
would last a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If, after a positive market test, the Commission concludes
that the commitments are suitable to remedy its competition
concerns regarding debit cards, the Commission would close the
proceedings on this particular issue," the EU executive said in
a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa Europe's offer would then be legally binding on the
company for four years. European retail lobby body Eurocommerce
has slammed the proposals, saying they did not address
"unjustified fees" on credit and commercial cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The regulator is still investigating Visa Europe's fees for
credit and deferred debit cards.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, May 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney today issued the
following statement.

    Canada has the highest regard for India, its government
institutions and processes. Our friendship as democratic nations who
operate under the rule of law grows ever stronger and we share a common
bond of ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity. Our economic and
trade ties continue to strengthen both of our economies.

    Furthermore, at a time when global security continues to be a cause
for concern, Canada values the increasing ties and cooperation with India
in the fields of defence, security and counter-terrorism. Each year,
Canada welcomes about 131,000 Indian residents on both a temporary and
permanent basis, including many individuals from the various Indian
security forces.

    The Government of Canada therefore deeply regrets the recent
incident in which letters drafted by public service officials during
routine visa refusals to Indian nationals cast false aspersions on the
legitimacy of work carried out by Indian defence and security
institutions, which operate under the framework of democratic processes
and the rule of law.

    This language, or the inaccurate impression it has created, in no
way reflects the policy or position of the Government of Canada. While,
under Canadian law, admissibility to Canada is determined by a number of
different criteria, candidate assessments should in no way question
Indian institutions which operate under the rule of law and within a
democratic framework.

    As to the decision process itself, decisions on visa applications
are made on a case-by-case basis by non-partisan public servants
following an independent process based on Canada's immigration law as it
currently stands. However, this unfortunate incident has demonstrated
that the deliberately broad legislation may create instances when the net
is cast too widely by officials, creating irritants with our trusted and
valued international allies. For this reason the admissibility policy
within the legislation is under active review at this time.

&lt;p&gt;Coke Vending Machine Delivers Coke and a Smile, Recognized for its Innovative
Concept and Execution


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Since January 12, 2010, hidden camera footage of smiling students getting more
than they bargained for from a Coke vending machine has been viewed by more than
2.2 million people on YouTube. Last night, the Coca-Cola "Happiness Machine" was
awarded CLIO`s prestigious Gold Interactive Award at the 51st annual awards
dinner held in New York City. A CLIO award is one of the world`s most recognized
industry accolades for advertising, design and communications. 

The "Happiness Machine" video, the result of a collaboration between Coca-Cola
and integrated interactive marketing agency Definition 6, features a Coca-Cola
vending machine transformed to deliver surprising "doses" of happiness to
unsuspecting college students. Shot on location at the Queens, NY, campus of St.
John's University, the outwardly typical Coke machine, was placed in the center
of the student cafeteria, in full view of five strategically placed hidden
cameras. What ensued was totally unscripted. 

Over 2 days of filming, the hidden cameras captured the spontaneous reactions of
the students as the machine dispensed an array of goodies including, flowers,
pizzas, sunglasses, a twelve-foot `hero` sub and a seemingly never ending supply
of Coca-Cola. 

"Happiness is contagious. When you see people smiling, you want to smile," said
Wendy Clark, SVP, Integrated Marketing Communications and Capabilities, The
Coca-Cola Company. "This human truth is at the heart the idea. In the video, you
see genuine surprise and delight on the students` faces when they interact with
the Coca-Cola `Happiness Machine` and witness the generosity that ensues as they
come together to share in the moments of happiness. It is such a simple yet
compelling concept and one that so accurately portrays Coca-Cola for what it
ultimately is; one of life`s simple pleasures." 

Earlier this week, the "Happiness Machine" video reached its biggest audience
yet as a 30-second edit of the footage debuted during American Idol`s season
finale. 

"Coke's goal to inspire consumers through small, surprise moments of happiness
served as the ideal creative motivation to us," said Paul Iannacchino Jr.,
Creative Director, Definition 6. "Our strategy was to deliver doses of happiness
in an unexpected, innovative way to engage not only the students, but the
audience at large. Whether you were present during the shoot or experiencing the

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA May 31 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the
biggest oil producer in Indonesia, has signed a final supply
deal to buy natural gas from ConocoPhillips (COP.N) on Sumatra
island, the head of Indonesia's energy watchdog, BPMIGAS, said
on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips has agreed to two separate deals, amending
terms to an existing deal after some politicians complained
that the deal was unfair because of the rise in oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will supply a total of 77.9 trillion British thermal
units of gas during a four-year period, and an additional 1,177
trillion British thermal units over a 12-year period, Priyono,
BPMIGAS chief, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips will supply the gas from its fields in South
Sumatra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gas deal will replace a previous agreement under which
Chevron swapped about 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil
from Duri for about 400 million cubic feet per day of natural
gas from ConocoPhillips' gas field in South Sumatra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This final deal will guarantee long-term gas supply to
support Chevron's operations in Sumatra," Priyono said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron needs the gas to support technology used to coax
more oil from its Duri field in Central Sumatra. The
technology, known as steamflood, can enhance recovery on oil
fields where output is declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Priyono said that Chevron currently produces about 370,000
barrels per day of crude oil, including Minas and Duri, from
its operation in Central Sumatra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has turned into a net importer of crude in recent
years, as production has slumped after a failure to tap new
fields fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Southeast Asia's biggest economy produced about 1.5 million
bpd about a decade ago, but production has now slumped to below
1 million bpd.

&lt;p&gt; * Price tag seen at $50 mln - source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Divestment a first under China anti-monopoly law
 (Add details and comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Donny Kwok&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, May 31 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's
biggest drugmaker, is selling its swine vaccine business in China
to Harbin Pharmaceutical Group (600664.SS) for $50 million, a
source with direct knowledge of the deal said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman from Pfizer's Singapore office confirmed the
divestment of its China swine vaccine business to Harbin
Pharmaceutical but gave no details on the value of the deal or
further comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer did indeed divest," the spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harbin Pharmaceutical officials were not immediately
available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The disposal was required by the Anti-Trust Bureau of China's
Ministry of Commerce as a condition for approval of Pfizer's $68
billion merger with Wyeth, which closed last October, said the
source, speaking on condition of anonymity because the deal had
not been officially announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal marked the first time China had ordered a foreign
company to divest a locally-based business as a condition for
approval of a merger with another foreign company, as part of a
review under the country's anti-monopoly law that took effect in
August 2008, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's will sell its China operations to manufacture its
RespiSure and RespiSure-One swine mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MH)
vaccines in the country, to Harbin Bio-Vaccine, an animal health
unit of Harbin Pharmaceutical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Business Development Asia (BDA), Clifford Chance, and King 
Wood advised Pfizer on the deal, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other bidders for the asset included Novartis (NOVN.VX), Eli
Lilly (LLY.N), Boehringer Ingelheim, and Agenix (AGX.AX), the
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harbin Pharmaceutical, which counts Warburg Pincus [WP.UL]
among its major shareholders, manufactures and distributes
generic antibiotics in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Harbin Pharmaceutical have risen 21 percent so far
this year, compared with a 19 percent drop in the key Shanghai
Composite Index .SSEC. The stock was down 1.11 percent by 0542
GMT on Monday.
