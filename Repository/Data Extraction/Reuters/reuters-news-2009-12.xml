&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today denied that its November Windows updates are causing a widespread "black screen" lock-out of users' PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has investigated reports that its November security updates made changes to permissions in the registry that are resulting in system issues for some customers," Christopher Budd, Microsoft's security spokesman, said in an e-mail. "The company has found those reports to be inaccurate and our comprehensive investigation has shown that none of the recently released updates are related to the behavior described in the reports."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report Budd referred to stemmed from a blog post by U.K.-based security vendor Prevx last week that claimed recent Windows updates changed Access Control List (ACL) entries in the registry, preventing some installed software from running properly. The result, said Prevx, is a black screen, sometimes dubbed "black screen of death" in an allusion to the "blue screen of death" that Windows puts up after a major system crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since that initial report, Prevx has called out a pair of updates, one in late November and the other from last July, as the cause of the black screen lock-out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The conditions under which the actual black screen is triggered are spasmodic," admitted Dave Kennerley of Prevx's support team in an update to the original blog post of last week. "Some test systems always trigger the condition, others are less consistent. The windows patches which seem common to the issue arising are  KB915597 and KB976098 ."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennerley's use of the word "spasmodic" is a turn-about from his initial post of last Friday, which was headlined "Black Screen woes could affect millions on Windows 7, Vista and XP."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searches of Microsoft's support forums by Computerworld have found only one "black screen" thread with posts from last month. Since yesterday, several additional users have reported that their PCs have been afflicted with a black screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Received a patch on Nov 24 or 25. Upon reboot the computer has a totally black screen," said a user identified only as "General Zod" in a message added to the thread around 2:30 p.m. ET today. "Not even the BIOS startup stuff appears."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennerley also said that the flaw was in the WinLogon Shell registry entry for Explorer.exe, the name of Windows' file manager. "The entry exists perfectly in the registry but is unusable/inaccessible and is therefore ignored by the OS resulting in the desktop and task bar not being loaded," Kennerley added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some outsiders were skeptical today of Prevx's contention that the black screen problem was due to the two updates Kennerley cited. Rafael Rivera, who writes the Within Windows blog -- and most recently took Microsoft to task for lifting code from an open-source project for the company's Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (WUDT) -- said his investigation pointed toward November's Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) update. MSFT, which is upgraded and delivered to users automatically via Windows Update, detects and deletes malware that Microsoft has identified as pervasive and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those particular updates don't, gleaned from limited testing, touch the Shell registry entries," said Rivera in an interview conducted via instant messaging today. "I believe the only update that touched this part of the registry recently is the Malicious Software Removal Tool for November."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivera pointed to one of MSRT's two malware detection updates last month as the most likely culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft was adamant that it was not at fault for any black screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've conducted a comprehensive review of the November security updates, the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool, and the non-security updates we released through Windows Update in November," Budd added. "That investigation has shown that none of these updates make any changes to the permissions in the registry. Thus, we don't believe the updates are related to the 'black screen' behavior described in these reports."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budd also said that Microsoft's technical support teams are "not seeing 'black screen' behavior as a broad customer issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer's market share ebbed again last month, a Web measurement firm said today, more proof that Microsoft's release of Internet Explorer 8 (IE8) hasn't stopped desertions to rival browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla's Firefox, Google's Chrome and Opera Software's Opera all posted solid gains, according to Calif.-based Net Applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, IE dropped to a 63.6% share, a new all-time low, as it lost just over 1 percentage point of market share. November marked the third straight month Microsoft's browser has declined by a point or more; in the last year, IE has fallen 8 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only bright spot for Microsoft is that it's made some headway in an unsubtle campaign to convince users to abandon the eight-year-old IE6 for this year's edition, IE8. When Net Applications accounts for IE8's "compatibility view" -- a feature that lets users display sites as rendered by the older, and often Web standard-incompatible IE7 and IE6 -- Microsoft's newest browser accounted for 22.1% of all browsers, a virtual dead heat with IE6 and several points above IE7's 16.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been aggressively promoting IE8 for several months, most famously last August when Amy Bazdukas, the general manager for IE, said " Friends don't let friends use IE6 ." Yesterday, Microsoft continued that campaign as it touted IE8 as a safer browser than the earlier editions for holiday online shopping. "We'll say it before and we'll say it again, to advance the Web we need to move people to a modern version of Internet Explorer," said Ryan Servatius, a senior product manager in the IE group, during an interview Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with calls to action like those, Microsoft has had trouble retaining the users who have ditched IE6 and IE7. By Net Applications' tally, IE6 has lost 3.2 percentage points in the last three months, and IE7 has fallen 4.2 points; IE8, however, has gained only 4.2 percentage points in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seemingly inexorable slide in IE's share has left the door open for rivals, including Firefox, Chrome and Opera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Firefox added about 0.7 of a percentage point to its share, finishing November with 24.7%. Chrome grew by 0.4 of a percentage point and Opera increased by 0.1 of a percentage point, to end the month at 3.9% and 2.3%, respectively. All three browsers' shares were records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most notable were the gains by Firefox and Chrome. Firefox neared the 25% milestone, which it should pass this month, and Google's browser closed in on Apple's Safari, which lost market share for the first time since last April. If the trend from the past three months continues, Chrome will pass Safari and take the No. 3 browser spot in January 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrome's growth is impressive, in part because it's been fueled almost exclusively by the Windows version, the only edition that has made it out of developer and beta testing. Google plans to issue a beta of the Mac version this month , which could add even more to its momentum going into the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera also gained ground on Safari last month, and now accounts for more than half the market share controlled by Apple's browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has enjoyed additional success in migrating its users to Firefox 3.5, the upgrade launched last June, although its uptake pace continued to slow. In November, Firefox 3.5 increased its share by another 1.3 percentage points to 15.2%, in line with October's 1.25-point increase but dramatically less than the 3.8-point surge of September. Firefox 3.0 slipped 0.7 of a percentage point to end at 8.1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firefox 3.0 users face the retirement of their browser in January 2010, when Mozilla will stop serving up security updates for the 18-month-old application. Before then, Mozilla should have wrapped up Firefox 3.6, a minor upgrade that Mozilla said last week is still on track for a 2009 ship date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE, however, remains the browser to watch, if only to track its decline, which Microsoft has not managed to stem with the March 2009 release of IE8. Since then, IE has lost 4.8 percentage points, almost as much as the 5.8 points it fell in the same eight months of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projecting IE's slide using Net Applications' data, Computerworld estimates that IE will slip under the 50% share mark in December 2010 if the loss trend of the last three months holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net Applications measures browser usage by tracking the machines that visit the 40,000 sites it monitors for clients, which results in a pool of about 160 million unique visitors per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;November's browser data is available on Net Applications' site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer CEO says supports healthcare reform&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says supports Senate finance panel bill, not House bill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Opposes provisions that could lead to price controls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Toni Clarke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) Chief
Executive Jeffrey Kindler said on Tuesday that while he
supports healthcare reform he would be opposed to any
provisions that could lead to price controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking after a lunch sponsored by the Boston College
Chief Executives' Club, Kindler said the $80 billion the
pharmaceutical industry has agreed to contribute to pay for the
cost of reform exceeds any benefit the industry will receive
from the addition of new patients to the insurance rolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said he prefers the bill that came out of the Senate
Finance Committee to the one that emerged from the House. The
Finance Committee bill was combined with a proposal from the
Senate's health committee and is now being debated by the full
Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would not like to see Congress adopt provisions that
would interfere with the doctor/patient relationship unduly or
that would impair the ability of companies to invest in
innovation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Specifically, he is opposed to anything that could lead to
price controls -- such as giving the government the ability to
directly negotiate with drugmakers for products it subsidizes
under the Medicare Part D drug benefit program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such negotiating power is given to the U.S. health
secretary under the House bill that passed in early November
but is absent in the full Senate's proposal currently under
consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would oppose, in particular, provisions that would take
the form of price controls, that would affect the ability to
make the risky and costly investments in treatments and
research. That is not the way to achieve healthcare reform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It remains to be seen whether the $80 billion price tag
agreed to by drugmakers sticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's still in discussion. It's not definite," Senate
Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus told reporters in
Washington. "It could be more, but that has yet to be
determined."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drugmakers struck the $80 billion deal in late June with
Baucus' committee and the Obama administration to help fund
lawmakers' bid to expand health insurance access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some Wall Street analysts have said that the most recent
Senate bill, released earlier this month, would cost
pharmaceutical companies up to $100 billion.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Dec 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) Chief
Executive Rex Tillerson will receive a 7 percent increase in
salary in 2010, but the U.S. oil major's board of directors cut
his 2009 bonus nearly in half in a year of sharply lower
profits, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tillerson is due to receive $2.2 million in salary next
year, down from $2.06 million in 2009, a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year, Tillerson was granted a bonus of $2.4 million,
down 40 percent from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steep declines in crude oil prices and the global
recession's toll on fuel demand have hurt the earnings of Exxon
and other integrated oil companies. For example, in the third
quarter, the Irving, Texas company's profit tumbled 68 percent
and fell short of Wall Street expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon ended up 1.3 percent, or 97 cents, at
$76.04. So far this year, the stock has fallen about 5 percent,
underperforming an 18 percent gain in the Chicago Board Options
Exchange index of oil companies .OIX.

&lt;p&gt;IBM has opened a business analytics center in London to focus on services for the U.K.'s financial sector, which drives a major portion of the nation's economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM said the center's initial focus will be on tracking risk positions across markets and assets classes. The center, opened on Tuesday and located at IBM's South Bank offices, will employ 400, although IBM said that number could double as demand for analytics services increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center will eventually provide services for energy and utility industries as they move into smart metering and grid technologies, IBM said. Other areas it will serve in the future include the public sector, for transportation and public safety programs, as well as pharmaceutical firms working on new drug development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center will work with IBM's Hursley software laboratory in Winchester, England. IBM said the center will also be using technology from IBM acquisitions such as the business intelligence company Cognos, iLog and SPSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London center is one of several that IBM has opened this year. Since June, the company has opened analytics centers in Berlin, Tokyo, New York, Washington, D.C. and Bangalore. The company expects to hire or retrain employees for some 4,000 analytics consultant positions in those centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, IBM said it would restructure its Global Business Services and create a Business Analytics and Optimization services practice, using the company's mathematicians and analytics experts from its research division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Protalix eligible to milestone payments of up to $55 mln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Protalix to retain marketing rights to drug in Israel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Protalix shares fall as much as 15 percent
 (Adds Pfizer, Protalix comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Esha Dey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGALORE, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said it
would acquire worldwide rights to Protalix BioTherapeutics
Inc's (PLX.A) experimental Gaucher disease drug, Uplyso, for an
upfront payment of $60 million, disappointing investors who
were expecting the Israeli biotech company to be acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protalix shares fell as much as 15 percent to $8.41 on the
American Stock Exchange, while Pfizer shares were up 3 percent
at $18.73 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is some immediate-term disappointment that Protalix
wasn't outright acquired, but I don't think this precludes the
potential for them to be acquired down the line," Oppenheimer
and Co analyst Brian Abrahams said, mentioning Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) TEVA.O and Pfizer as
potential buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, analysts said the deal is a validation of
Protalix's drug technology and would eventually boost the
company's value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For Protalix, this is proof that their platform technology
works. And that is more important than a few million (dollars)
here or there," WBB Securities analyst Steve Brozak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protalix's drug for the rare disease is derived from cells
taken from carrots, giving it a potential safety advantage over
traditional biotechnology medicines derived from animal cells
by avoiding the possibility of contamination from mammal
viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Genzyme Corp's GENZ.O top-selling Gaucher treatment,
Cerezyme, with which Uplyso would compete, is derived from
cells from Chinese hamster ovaries. Genzyme recently suffered a
major supply disruption at its Boston manufacturing plant due
to a viral contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shire Plc (SHP.L) is also developing a treatment for
Gaucher, an arena that Genzyme has had much to itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gaucher disease is a rare genetic disorder in which
patients are deficient in an enzyme that breaks down a certain
type of fat molecule, leading to potentially deadly organ
damage. It affects about 5,000 people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protalix CEO David Aveizer said in addition to potential
safety advantages, the plant-cell technology is far more cost
efficient than traditional biotech production methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have the ability to make this protein in a much less
expensive way," Aveizer said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite that ability, Pfizer declined to say whether its
drug would be sold for substantially less than Genzyme's
product, which is considered to be one of the world's most
expensive medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protalix is also using its plant-cell culture technology,
called ProCellEx, to develop drugs for the treatment of Fabry
disease, a rare genetic disorder, and a biosimilar version of
Amgen Inc's (AMGN.O) rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said the deal does not include potential future
drugs developed using the Protalix technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This initial deal is focused on and limited to the
Gaucher's product, but our discussions and understanding of the
technology platform ... is just beginning," David Simmons, head
of Pfizer's established products unit said, calling it "the
first step in the partnership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The viral contamination at Genzyme's plant caused severe
shortages of Cerezyme, which prompted the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to allow Protalix and Shire to supply patients
with their drugs before they received official approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protalix said it plans to file for U.S. approval this
month. Uplyso is also currently being provided to Gaucher
patients in the European Union under a "compassionate use"
protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Genzyme's plant is now operational and the company said on
Tuesday it has started shipping vials of newly produced
Cerezyme. [nWNAB0928]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are in combat now," WBB's Brozak said of Genzyme.
"For Genzyme it means an absolutely well-funded competitor in
the marketing sphere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under Tuesday's deal, Protalix is eligible to receive
additional milestone payments of up to $55 million and will
retain the marketing rights to the drug in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer and Protalix will share future revenue and expenses
for the development and marketing of the drug on a 60
percent/40 percent basis respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oppenheimer's Abrahams expects 2013 worldwide sales of
Protalix's drug to exceed $180 million, while Brozak sees 2012
sales of $360 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protalix shares were off their earlier lows, down $1.13, or
11.5 percent, at $8.73 in afternoon trading.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Reports that News Corp and Microsoft were in talks for an exclusive deal that would exclude Google are overblown, a source close to the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There had been reports that Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corp, was considering removing the company's news from Google's Web search results, and was talking to Microsoft about listing the stories with its Bing search engine instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would pay for the privilege, sources previously told Reuters, but it was not clear how much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a source said on Tuesday the financial basis for a deal may not be as strong as previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the companies have a common interest, the economics do not seem to be there for the common arrangement initially rumored to be under discussion," said the source who was close to the situation but not authorized to speak on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential deal had been seen as a way for news organizations, many of whom are a shell of their former selves due to advertising cutbacks, to profit from the content that they produce. Newspaper owners resent Google and other aggregators because the Internet companies make money from the advertisements that they display next to news search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murdoch said on Tuesday that his Wall Street Journal had one million paying subscribers, and that News Corp intended to expand the subscription model to all of the company's papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he disagreed with those who said that people would not pay for an Internet subscription. "I believe they will," he told a U.S. Federal Trade Commission conference on the future of journalism in the Internet age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not mention the discussions with Microsoft in his prepared remarks and declined to take questions after his speech. Representatives for News Corp could not be immediately reached and Microsoft declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people find their news on Google, which has 65 percent of the U.S. search market according to comScore. Microsoft had a 10 percent share of the U.S. search market in September, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has said it provides news organizations about 100,000 clicks a minute. It has said it would not pay to index news content on the grounds that copyright law permits indexing as a part of fair use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Murdoch says to extend Internet subscription model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Diane Bartz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Reports that News Corp
(NWSA.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) were in talks for an exclusive
deal that would exclude Google (GOOG.O) are overblown, a source
close to the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There had been reports that Rupert Murdoch, chairman and
chief executive of News Corp, was considering removing the
company's news from Google's Web search results, and was

may not be as strong as previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While the companies have a common interest, the economics
do not seem to be there for the common arrangement initially
rumored to be under discussion," said the source who was close

&lt;p&gt; * Older strategies like value, momentum getting overcrowded&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Eyes newer areas of event-driven, catastrophe reinsurance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Laurence Fletcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PARIS, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Computer-driven hedge funds must
hunt for new areas to exploit as some areas of making money have
become so overcrowded they may no longer be profitable,
according to Goldman Sachs (GS.N) Asset Management.
Robert Litterman, managing director and head of quantitative
resources, said strategies such as those which focus on price
rises in cheaply-valued stocks, which latch onto market momentum
or which trade currencies, had become very crowded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead he said opportunities could come in areas such as
event-driven strategies -- which focus on special events such as
mergers or restructuring -- and catastrophe reinsurance,
although he added they can just as quickly disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also pointed to credit, emerging markets, volatility
trading and commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You have to adapt your process," Litterman said at the
Quant Invest 2009 conference. "What we're going to have to do to
be successful is to be more dynamic and more opportunistic and
focus especially on more proprietary forecasting signals ... and
exploit shorter-term opportunistic and event-driven types of
phenomenon."
Computer-driven or quantitative hedge funds attempt to make
money by quickly exploiting trends or anomalies in markets such
as equities, government bonds or currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, some funds such as Goldman's controlled a large
share of some markets in summer 2007 and many were caught in a
vicious circle of selling.
"I think the world has fundamentally changed for quants," he
said, adding that his funds now allocate a greater share of
assets to newer strategies since that crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're putting together data that's not machine-readable,
finding databases that haven't been explored nearly as well as
others, identifying linkages across companies and industries and
finding patterns in the data that are not as well known."

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Dec 1 (Reuters) - Mexico's antitrust watchdog
is fining media giant Televisa almost $4 million for refusing
to let a cable operator transmit its channels, the latest in a
push to boost competition in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Federal Competition Commission decided at a meeting
last month to fine Televisa, which controls cable operator
Cablevision (CABLECPO.MX), but has not yet published details of
the ruling, an official at the commission who is not authorized
to speak on the record told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N), controlled by billionaire
Emilio Azcarraga Jean, controls about 70 percent of the
broadcast television market share in Mexico, with TV Azteca
TVAZTCACPO.MX accounting for most of the rest. That puts any
cable company that cannot offer Televisa's programming at a
disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa, which may appeal the resolution, had no immediate
comment. The company has stakes in two other cable companies in
Mexico.

&lt;p&gt;Solution Enables the Offload of the Macro Network and Delivery of New Next-Gen
Services
ACTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Tatara Systems, the leader in SIP-based femtocell convergence, today announced
the selection of the IBM BladeCenter product line as the hardware platform for
the Tatara Convergence Server (TCS), a SIP-based femtocell integration solution
that offloads the mobile traffic to a converged IP network to curtail
investments in the legacy mobile core and enable the delivery of new IP services
and applications. 

The Tatara Convergence Server solution enables the interconnection of femtocells
and other advanced technology IP-based radio network elements with the legacy
macro wireless network, providing the full mobile voice, messaging and data
experience in an IP environment supporting both VoIP and IMS networks. The TCS
capabilities include authentication of the mobile subscribers, handoff between
femtocells and the macro network, emergency and supplementary services, as well
as delivering new IP-based applications to existing mobile handsets without
modifying or disrupting the existing macro network. The TCS is available in a
CDMA or GSM/UMTS variant. 

The IBM BladeCenter fulfilled Tatara Systems` need for a high availability
solution that met operators` strict requirements for service, deployment and
reliability as well as providing a common architecture that would allow Tatara
to specifically tailor a solution to match a customer`s distinct infrastructure
requirements. 

"We are thrilled to work with IBM, a long standing, recognized leader in
technology," stated Marc Cremer, executive vice president of operations for
Tatara Systems. "The IBM BladeCenter technology, with its impressive features
and proven track record of success among operators, will assist Tatara in
addressing pivotal challenges faced by the industry due to the current evolution
to next generation networks and services. Tatara`s solutions seamlessly blend
the legacy and next generation networks together, thereby assisting service
providers in achieving exemplary utilization of all network assets and an
advantageous return on investment." 

"Tatara Systems understands the importance of standards-based solutions and the
complex challenges faced by service providers during this shift to a new
converged IP world," said Alex Yost, vice president, IBM Systems &amp; Technology
Group. "We are excited Tatara Systems has chosen the IBM BladeCenter platform to
deliver versatile, best-in-class, customized solutions to meet their customers'
unique needs, while also driving the complexity out of the implementation
process." 

About Femtocell Technology:

Femtocells have the potential to extend the reach of a mobile operator`s network
into homes and enterprises, positively impacting the customer experience for
millions of subscribers by enhancing coverage and providing capacity for
bandwidth hungry applications. Tatara has staked out an early leadership
position in this market, as the first vendor to deliver a SIP-based solution for
femtocell network integration. As noted by most industry analysts, IP-based
femtocell deployment is the only method that offloads the legacy mobile core
infrastructure, thereby providing the capacity needed for 3G service delivery
and enabling operators to recognize substantial cost savings through OPEX and
CAPEX optimization. 

About Tatara Systems:

Tatara Systems is the leader in SIP-based femtocell convergence, supporting both
IMS and pre-IMS standards based architectures. Tatara`s cost-effective, highly
scalable and future-proof approach to femtocell deployment provides seamless
integration with the legacy network plus enables operators to deliver
next-generation residential and business services without re-engineering the
incumbent mobile core. The Tatara Convergence Server solution provides service
interworking; delivers unified voice, messaging and data services; and provides
uniform calling and feature plans across diverse networks. Tatara is working
with its customers and partners to speed the deployment of femtocells worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;Companies Achieve Successful Transition to SBIR Phase III
WOBURN, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
KaZaK Composites, Inc., a premier provider of high value-added composite
engineering and design, today announced that the company has teamed up with
Raytheon IDS and has completed the design phase of the composite ballistic
screen for integration onboard the Zumwalt-class destroyer (DDG 1000). KaZaK
recently joined Raytheon and the U.S. Navy to celebrate as the technology
formally transitioned to Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase III
production - a critical milestone for an SBIR program. 

"The Phase III production contract is a big win for the entire KaZaK team," said
John Schickling, EVP/COO of KaZaK Composites, Inc. "The engineering team worked
closely with Raytheon IDS to come up with a solution that achieved their goal of
providing ballistic screens for the Zumwalt-class destroyer that was both
effective and cost efficient." 

The pre-SBIR concept design for the Zumwalt-class destroyer ballistic screens
utilized ceramics and a composites molding process that were not cost effective
for this application. "KaZaK's use of the pultrusion manufacturing process
contributes to significant cost savings for the U.S. Navy," said Jerome Fanucci,
President/CEO of KaZaK. "We were able to design the ballistic screens to the
specifications set forth by the U.S. Navy in a cost effective manner through the
use of proprietary KaZaK manufacturing processes that are less labor intensive,
thereby reducing the overall cost of the new design." 

Working closely with the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) acquisition team,
KaZaK and Raytheon initiated an accelerated design, prototyping and test program
in 2008. The prototype and subsequent full-scale designs were iterated and
validated through successful live-fire testing in 2008 and 2009. NAVSEA provided
a prime contract modification to Raytheon for mission systems equipment. This
enabled a SBIR Phase III subcontract award to KaZaK in September 2009 for
long-lead material to produce the ballistic screens for the first two Zumwalt
ship sets. It is estimated that KaZaK`s contributions could potentially save the
U.S. Navy an estimated $10 million per ship.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has launched a microblog-style service in China based on Windows Live Messenger, expanding the social-networking functions linked to the chat software in a country where it is a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new service, which is called MSN Juku and is now in beta, lets users post 140-character messages to an update screen that slowly scrolls old messages to the right. The service automatically links users with people on their Live Messenger contact lists, whose updates also appear on the scrolling timeline. Posts are also stacked top-to-bottom and display only their first few words when they appear close together. Pointing the mouse at a condensed message shows its full version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSN China, the Microsoft joint venture that developed the new product, insisted it is not a microblog service. "Juku is a local innovation developed by MSN China ... based on Windows Live Messenger networks," a company representative said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Juku, whose name uses the Chinese characters for "gathering" and "cool", is similar enough to a microblog site that one local media report called it a "bandit" version of Plurk, a Twitter-like service popular in Asia. The Chinese term for "bandit" is slang for a product similar to that of an established brand and is most often used to describe knock-off mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new MSN service also lets users play simple games and earn prizes such as new face icons to post in messages. Users can upload a profile picture, visit the pages of other users and add them as friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Twitter-style services have appeared in China in recent months as social-networking sites grow increasingly popular. About 124 million people, or one in three of China's Internet users, currently use social-networking sites, according to the country's domain registry agency. Microblogging in particular is also growing, though Twitter and some of its Chinese rivals have been blocked by the country's Internet authorities for months. Half of China's social-network users post microblog entries online at least once a day, according to the domain registry, though that figure likely includes messages similar to the status updates that can be sent on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new MSN service is likely an effort by Microsoft to win more users for its social-networking products as well as its instant-messaging service, said Ashley Liu, an analyst at In-Stat. Windows Live Messenger is popular in China, especially among office workers, but rival instant-messaging program QQ is also widely used and has gotten a boost from value-added services built around it, Liu said. Tencent, the owner of QQ, has had major success selling users upgrades to their accounts and virtual goods such as weapons for online games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users appear unable to buy virtual goods on the new MSN service. For now Microsoft may be foraying into social networking just to lower its dependence on its instant-messaging program in China, Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Vertical Format Captures Cardholder Attention 
BROOKFIELD, Wis.--(Business Wire)--
Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV), the leading global provider of financial services
technology solutions, now offers the new vertical-format Visa&#174; card - an
innovative design option that displays all card information vertically rather
than horizontally. This breakthrough look captures cardholder interest and
provides a new way to showcase an issuer`s logo. 

"Fiserv is continually innovating to deliver product and service enhancements

increased usage."

Pay-as-you-go ordering eliminates inventory carrying expense and risk of
obsolescence. 
* MyCardCreationSMmakes it simple and affordable for cardholders to create cards
with their own pictures on them. 
* Contactless Cards can speed up checkout and maximize convenience by enabling a
cardholder to simply hold the card near a terminal or tap the terminal instead
of swiping the card.

"The key to increasing transaction revenue is giving cardholders the kinds of
cards they`ll reach to use over and over," said Diaz. "Fiserv continues to add
equipment, processes and technology to provide innovative solutions - like the
exciting new vertical cards - to please cardholders and help our clients achieve
their card program goals."

&lt;p&gt;December 8 Webinar to Showcase BDNA SMS Normalization Capabilities and How
Enterprises Save Time and Money With Quick Access to Meaningful Data


MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
BDNA, the leading provider of agentless IT inventory solutions, today announced
BDNA SMS Data Normalization, a new solution that quickly and accurately
transforms IT asset data discovered with Microsoft SMS into usable, relevant and
actionable information. Using the industry`s richest IT catalog, BDNA Catalog,
discovered products are normalized and categorized in common taxonomy, saving
enterprises considerable time and resources. 

Whether responding to a vendor software audit, looking to rationalize or
consolidate data centers or servers or simply wanting to effectively manage IT
assets, the starting point is getting a comprehensive understanding of IT
inventory. Microsoft SMS is a powerful solution used by enterprises worldwide
for everything from remote control, patch management and software distribution.
Despite substantial investments in the deployment and maintenance of their SMS
implementations, IT organizations often find it both difficult and
labor-intensive to interpret and comprehend the massive amount of raw IT asset
data generated by SMS. Unlike normalization solutions from CMDB vendors, BDNA`s
SMS solution provides output in a documented, open format that can be exported
into any third-party product. 

"Tracking IT assets has never been more critical. Are you equipped to survive an
audit, and do you have a complete and accurate record of all assets
enterprise-wide?" asks Ido Sarig, chief evangelist and vice president of
marketing at BDNA. "The new BDNA SMS normalization solution, coupled with the
industry`s most comprehensive catalog, gives enterprises the tools they need to
leverage existing investments in SMS to quickly and reliably transform millions
of lines of data code into usable, actionable IT asset information that will be
invaluable in the event of an audit." 

Key features and benefits of the BDNA SMS Data Normalization solution include:

* Normalizes data so different variants of the same name will be rolled into the
same category, each product is categorized in the taxonomy;

&lt;p&gt;  IRVINE, CA, Dec 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Vision Solutions, a leading high availability and disaster recovery
solutions provider in IBM Power Systems markets, today announced its
second annual "State of Resilience" report, a detailed overview of
disaster recovery expectations, technologies and the overall state of
resilience among IBM Power Systems users. The report is based on a
year-long study including survey data from more than 3,500 technical
professionals and executives involved with the management of IBM i
(i5/OS) and AIX environments on IBM Power Systems.

    "This report clearly demonstrates the urgency for companies of all sizes
to ensure they have an effective data protection and business continuity
plan in place," says Edward Vesely, Vision Solutions' senior vice
president of marketing. "Such strategy undoubtedly involves the right
combination of high availability, systems management and disaster
recovery solutions; however, many firms still lack the appropriate
technologies to meet their overall objectives."

    According to Vesely, the report explains how a range of business
resiliency and optimization technologies benefit businesses of all sizes
-- from the emerging SMB to the multinational enterprise.

    Several notable findings emerging from the survey include:

    -- A trend toward even more aggressive recovery time and recovery point
objectives across the platform -- both IBM i and AIX

    -- Many firms do not have appropriate technologies in place to meet their
recovery objectives

    -- Investment in disaster recovery technologies have outpaced High
Availability

    -- Continuous Data Protection (CDP) "data rewind" capabilities are
gaining support across companies of all size

    "We encourage all businesses to implement a progressive IT strategy for
planned and unplanned downtime, which can cost companies millions of
dollars per year," said Mark Shearer, IBM Systems &amp; Technology Group's
vice president of marketing, communications and sales support. "To
minimize those costs, it is imperative that companies implement proven
high availability and disaster recovery solutions that protect critical
business applications from outages, both planned and unplanned."

    Vision Solutions and IBM will host a free "State of IBM Power Systems
Technology and Resilience" webcast Tuesday, Dec. 8, 2009 at 11 a.m. EST.
The event will feature IBM's Mark Shearer and Vision's Edward Vesely who
together will present recent Power Systems technology and market
developments, and findings from Vision's exclusive market report.

    Topics covered during the 60-minute webcast:

    -- How the new Power Systems platform will benefit your organization

    -- IBM's New Power Equation, Dynamic Infrastructure and Smarter Planet
initiatives

    -- The State of Resilience (HA and DR) on Power Systems -- exclusive
research

    Participants registered for the Dec. 8 webcast will receive an advance
copy of the second annual "State of Resilience" report. Register today at

&lt;p&gt;New Drug Application (NDA) expected to be filed with FDA for novel enzyme
replacement therapy with Fast Track Orphan Drug designation
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Protalix (NYSE-Amex: PLX) today announced that they have
entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize taliglucerase alfa, a
plant-cell expressed form of glucocerebrosidase (GCD) in development for the
potential treatment of Gaucher`s disease. Under the terms of the agreement,
Pfizer will receive exclusive worldwide licensing rights for the
commercialization of taliglucerase alfa, while Protalix will retain the
exclusive commercialization rights in Israel. Taliglucerase alfa is the first
enzyme replacement therapy derived from a proprietary plant cell-based
expression platform using genetically engineered carrot cells. 

With the successful completion of Phase III clinical studies, Protalix is
preparing to complete a rolling New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation and
Fast Track status, facilitating the development and expediting the review of
drugs to treat rare conditions or diseases, as well as an Emergency Use
Authorization. The FDA has also requested, and subsequently approved, an
Expanded Access Program (EAP) treatment protocol. Taliglucerase alfa is
currently being provided to Gaucher`s patients in the U.S. under the EAP
protocol, as well as to patients in the European Union under a compassionate use
protocol. 

"We are excited about this collaboration, which represents a significant step
towards bringing, for the first time, a plant-based enzyme replacement treatment
option to patients affected by Gaucher`s disease," commented Dr. David Aviezer,
president and CEO of Protalix. "By joining our advances in biologics
manufacturing and protein development with Pfizer`s global strengths in patient
services and reimbursement we expect to help make taliglucerase alfa an
important and cost-effective treatment choice for Gaucher`s patients throughout
the world." 

Under the agreement, Pfizer will make an upfront payment of $60 million to
Protalix. In addition, Protalix is eligible to receive additional regulatory
milestone payments of up to $55 million. Pfizer and Protalix will share future
revenues and expenses for the development and commercialization of taliglucerase
alfa on a 60 percent/40 percent basis respectively. 

"By combining our respective strengths to advance this innovative therapy,
Pfizer and Protalix expect to quickly deliver an alternative treatment for
people suffering from Gaucher`s disease," said David Simmons, president and
general manager of Pfizer`s Established Products Business Unit. "This agreement
supports our goal to meet the needs of many patient populations, including those
affected by rare diseases, and brings the best minds together to challenge the
most feared diseases of our time." 

Peter L. Saltonstall, President and CEO, National Organization for Rare
Disorders (NORD) stated, "NORD is always pleased when treatment options are
expanded for people with rare diseases. We welcome Pfizer`s commitment to the
rare disease arena, and look forward to working with both Pfizer and Protalix in
support of increased options for patients and families affected by rare
diseases." 

About Gaucher`s disease

Gaucher`s disease, an inherited condition, is the most prevalent lysosomal
storage disorder, with an incidence of about 1 in 20,000 live births. People
with Gaucher`s disease do not have enough of an enzyme, &#946;-glucosidase
(glucocerebrosidase) that breaks down a certain type of fat molecule. As a
result, lipid engorged cells (called Gaucher cells) amass in different parts of
the body, primarily the spleen, liver and bone marrow. Accumulation of Gaucher
cells may cause spleen and liver enlargement, anemia, excessive bleeding and
bruising, bone disease and a number of other signs and symptoms. 

About Protalix

Protalix is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of proprietary recombinant therapeutic proteins expressed
through its proprietary plant cell based expression system. Protalix`s
ProCellEx(TM) presents a proprietary method for the expression of recombinant
proteins that Protalix believes will allow for the cost-effective,
industrial-scale production of recombinant therapeutic proteins in an
environment free of mammalian components and viruses. Protalix is also advancing
additional recombinant biopharmaceutical drug development programs.
Taliglucerase alfa is an enzyme replacement therapy in development under a
Special Protocol Assessment with FDA for Gaucher`s disease.

&lt;p&gt;New Drug Application (NDA) expected to be filed with FDA for novel enzyme
replacement therapy with Fast Track Orphan Drug designation
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Protalix (NYSE-Amex: PLX) today announced that they have
entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize taliglucerase alfa, a
plant-cell expressed form of glucocerebrosidase (GCD) in development for the
potential treatment of Gaucher`s disease. Under the terms of the agreement,
Pfizer will receive exclusive worldwide licensing rights for the
commercialization of taliglucerase alfa, while Protalix will retain the
exclusive commercialization rights in Israel. Taliglucerase alfa is the first
enzyme replacement therapy derived from a proprietary plant cell-based
expression platform using genetically engineered carrot cells. 

With the successful completion of Phase III clinical studies, Protalix is
preparing to complete a rolling New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation and
Fast Track status, facilitating the development and expediting the review of
drugs to treat rare conditions or diseases, as well as an Emergency Use
Authorization. The FDA has also requested, and subsequently approved, an
Expanded Access Program (EAP) treatment protocol. Taliglucerase alfa is
currently being provided to Gaucher`s patients in the U.S. under the EAP
protocol, as well as to patients in the European Union under a compassionate use
protocol. 

"We are excited about this collaboration, which represents a significant step
towards bringing, for the first time, a plant-based enzyme replacement treatment
option to patients affected by Gaucher`s disease," commented Dr. David Aviezer,
president and CEO of Protalix. "By joining our advances in biologics
manufacturing and protein development with Pfizer`s global strengths in patient
services and reimbursement we expect to help make taliglucerase alfa an
important and cost-effective treatment choice for Gaucher`s patients throughout
the world." 

Under the agreement, Pfizer will make an upfront payment of $60 million to
Protalix. In addition, Protalix is eligible to receive additional regulatory
milestone payments of up to $55 million. Pfizer and Protalix will share future
revenues and expenses for the development and commercialization of taliglucerase
alfa on a 60 percent/40 percent basis respectively. 

"By combining our respective strengths to advance this innovative therapy,
Pfizer and Protalix expect to quickly deliver an alternative treatment for
people suffering from Gaucher`s disease," said David Simmons, president and
general manager of Pfizer`s Established Products Business Unit. "This agreement
supports our goal to meet the needs of many patient populations, including those
affected by rare diseases, and brings the best minds together to challenge the
most feared diseases of our time." 

Peter L. Saltonstall, President and CEO, National Organization for Rare
Disorders (NORD) stated, "NORD is always pleased when treatment options are
expanded for people with rare diseases. We welcome Pfizer`s commitment to the
rare disease arena, and look forward to working with both Pfizer and Protalix in
support of increased options for patients and families affected by rare
diseases." 

About Gaucher`s disease

Gaucher`s disease, an inherited condition, is the most prevalent lysosomal
storage disorder, with an incidence of about 1 in 20,000 live births. People
with Gaucher`s disease do not have enough of an enzyme, &#946;-glucosidase
(glucocerebrosidase) that breaks down a certain type of fat molecule. As a
result, lipid engorged cells (called Gaucher cells) amass in different parts of
the body, primarily the spleen, liver and bone marrow. Accumulation of Gaucher
cells may cause spleen and liver enlargement, anemia, excessive bleeding and
bruising, bone disease and a number of other signs and symptoms. 

About Protalix

Protalix is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of proprietary recombinant therapeutic proteins expressed
through its proprietary plant cell based expression system. Protalix`s
ProCellEx(TM) presents a proprietary method for the expression of recombinant
proteins that Protalix believes will allow for the cost-effective,
industrial-scale production of recombinant therapeutic proteins in an
environment free of mammalian components and viruses. Protalix is also advancing
additional recombinant biopharmaceutical drug development programs.
Taliglucerase alfa is an enzyme replacement therapy in development under a
Special Protocol Assessment with FDA for Gaucher`s disease.

&lt;p&gt;  PLANO, TX, Dec 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Invensys Operations Management, a global provider of technology systems,
software solutions and consulting services to the process and
manufacturing industries, today announced that its flagship
Avantis.PRO(TM) enterprise asset management (EAM) software is now more
tightly integrated with Microsoft Dynamics(R) AX(TM) enterprise resource
planning (ERP) software. The integration of these leading software
packages provides a powerful, easy-to-use solution that ensures financial
and enterprise-planning decisions are made using timely, reliable
information about the health and operation of all assets within a
manufacturing facility or organization.

    The Avantis.PRO solution is among the industry's most comprehensive EAM
offerings, and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009 is a leading business management
and ERP solution, facilitating business functions such as general ledger,
accounts receivable and asset value reporting. The integrated package is a
standard, scalable architecture that will appeal to information
technology, business operations and plant managers alike.

    "As manufacturers seek to drive more and more value from their existing
assets, EAM technology is becoming increasingly more strategic to their
business and is equally strategic to ours," said Mike Ehrenberg,
distinguished engineer, Microsoft Corp. "The Avantis.PRO EAM software from
Invensys has a stellar reputation for quality and for the service that
stands behind it. Together with Microsoft Dynamics ERP, we strengthen the
combined value we deliver to our customers, providing a powerful,
easy-to-use asset optimization solution that can grow and change with them
for many years to come."

    The software integration can be easily implemented, and it supports
enterprise planning and decision making, improves financial and operating
controls and facilitates interdepartmental collaboration. Expected
benefits include:

    -- Greater enterprise-wide data access, which improves asset availability
and utilization by providing financial systems with timely access to
asset-related data, such as maintenance planning and schedules, projected
failure rates and equipment service histories.

    -- Seamless coordination and automation of business processes, improving
efficiency, increasing accuracy and eliminating data entry errors.

    -- Faster, easier connectivity through the use of predefined connections
and standards-based integration concepts and frameworks.

    -- Lower costs, by implementing a scalable, out-of-the-box solution that
can be upgraded as the business requires.

    -- Higher reliability, based on implementation of proven, heavily tested
software from trusted sources.

    "EAM systems can provide demonstrable results in a relatively short time
frame," said Bill Polk, director of research at AMR Research, in the June
2009 AMR research report Asset Management Algebra: EAM = ROI. "In today's
environment, where budgets are tight and freeing up or conserving working
capital is paramount, developing and implementing a robust EAM solution
can help deliver incremental profit to the bottom line."

    Invensys is a Microsoft Gold solutions partner and is in the process of
becoming "Certified for Dynamics" via the Microsoft CfmD Program. Invensys
and Microsoft are also exploring other integration opportunities,
including an active project for the integration of Invensys' Wonderware(R)
Manufacturing Execution System technology with the Microsoft Dynamics ERP.

    "This latest collaboration is a product of a long and successful business
relationship that Invensys and Microsoft have enjoyed, not just with
Avantis(R), but with many of our products," said Sudipta Bhattacharya,
president and chief executive officer, Invensys Operations Management.
"Augmenting Microsoft's open development and applications environment with
our experience in building solutions that address the intricacies of
production environments significantly reduces risk, maximizing return not
only on software investment, but on all assets."

&lt;p&gt; * To integrate Wyeth's Japan operations by Sept 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * To add more sales representatives in the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOKYO, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's
largest drugmaker, will start selling generic drugs in Japan
sometime after 2010, its unit in the country said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will detail next year our plan to sell generic drugs,
including when and how many products will be sold," Pfizer Japan
director Hiroshi Matsumori told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Japan had said on Nov. 19 that the U.S. company might
start selling generic drugs in Japan from 2011 as part of efforts
to diversify its operations. [ID:nT240518]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA.TA), the
world's largest generic drug maker, has also said that it will
start selling its products in Japan via a joint venture,
targeting a market share of 10 percent by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, Takeda Pharmaceutical (4502.T), Japan's largest
drugmaker, said on Monday it was not interested in launching a
generic drug business in Japan, but that it may enter generic
markets abroad. [ID:nT53116]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following its merger with Wyeth in the United States, Pfizer
Japan chairman Hiromitsu Iwasaki told the news conference that
the two firms will complete the merger of their Japanese
operations by September next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The merged unit will increase its number of sales
representatives from a total combined size of nearly 2,900 to
facilitate the launch of new products in Japan, Pfizer Japan
president Ichiro Umeda added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer and Wyeth together have seven new products, including
cancer and rheumatism drugs, under review by Japanese regulators
for marketing approval.

 (Adds details, share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bharghavi Nagaraju&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MUMBAI, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Cipla Ltd (CIPL.BO) is in talks
with a host of global drug makers, including Pfizer Inc
(PFE.N), to supply generic products, a top official of the
Indian drug maker said, sending its shares up more than 3
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yes, we are talking to some companies," Cipla's joint
managing director, Amar Lulla, said. "Nothing has been signed
yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to give a timeline when a deal would be
announced or a forecast for the revenue expectation from such a
deal. Lulla denied a TV report Cipla may sell a stake as part
of the drug supply pact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 12:06 p.m. (0636 GMT), shares in Cipla, which has a
market value of $5.5 billion, was trading 2.7 percent higher at
328.70 rupees while the main Mumbai market .BSESN was nearly
1 percent. The stock had gained as much as 3.6 percent earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global drug makers such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and
Pfizer are increasingly looking to low-cost destinations like
India to tie up supplies as they battle falling prices and
increasing generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demand for generic drugs from Indian producers such as
Cipla, Dr Reddy's Laboratories (REDY.BO) (RDY.N) and Ranbaxy
Laboratories (RANB.BO) is booming as nations battle rising
healthcare costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In June, Dr Reddy's entered into a pact with
GlaxoSmithKline under which Glaxo will get access to its drugs
and supply them in emerging markets such as Africa, the Middle
East, and Latin America. [ID:nLF635888]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like other drugmakers, Pfizer is also grappling with
growing risks of a slump in earnings on patent expirations over
the next two years, coupled with rising regulatory and
scientific hurdles for bringing next-generation drugs to the
market.

&lt;p&gt;Companies running applications on Amazon Web Services can now monitor their environments using IBM&#8217;s Tivoli Monitoring software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re now providing enterprise-class resource monitoring for products that are launched on the Amazon cloud,&#8221; said Dave Mitchell, director of strategy and emerging business for IBM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM already offered several other products on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), including DB2, WebSphere Portal and IBM Mashup Center. On Monday, it said customers can also fire up Tivoli Monitoring as an Amazon Machine Image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can monitor systems, applications and databases, Mitchell said. Like most resources accessible in the cloud, users will pay for Tivoli Monitoring based on time and how much of the resource they use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three pricing tiers based on the number of virtual cores being monitored, ranging from 50 cores on the low end to 600 on the top end. Users pay to access the monitoring software by the hour, depending on which tier the application they&#8217;re monitoring falls into. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies can start using Tivoli Monitoring by searching for a Tivoli AMI in their AWS console, Amazon said. IBM is offering scripts for data collection agents and help guides, Amazon said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is likely to add more of its products to the Amazon cloud over time, Mitchell said. &#8220;Moving forward we&#8217;ll be driven by what our partners and customers want us to put there,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering its software on the Amazon cloud is part of IBM&#8217;s strategy to deliver its products in any way that customers want them. &#8220;It&#8217;s an exciting opportunity for us to provide tools to companies of all sizes to administer and manage and monitor these hybrid environments,&#8221; Mitchell said. He is seeing a trend toward a hybrid approach, where companies use hosted clouds for certain functions while maintaining internal environments for other software and services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, research firm Gartner released a PC sales forecast that initially sounded like good news for Microsoft and its hardware partners, but likely indicates trouble ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because even though more PCs are predicted to ship this year and in 2010, the PC prices will head downward, thanks to the continued popularity of inexpensive netbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gartner originally forecasted a 2 percent decline year-over-year in worldwide PC shipments for 2009, but after consumers purchased more computers than expected in the third quarter, Gartner flipped its forecast to a 2.8 percent increase in PC shipments, equating to 298.9 million PCs. For 2010, Gartner predicts PC shipments will grow 12.6 percent year-over-year to 336.6 million PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system -- including hands-on reviews, video tutorials and advice on enterprise rollouts -- see CIO.com's Windows 7 Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's the rub: the average selling prices for PCs in 2009 will experience a year-over-year decline of 10.7 percent, with only a slight increase of 2.6 percent predicted for 2010, according to Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Windows 7 in Pictures: The Coolest New Hardware&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect PC ASP [average selling price] declines to slow as the market recovers, but given the market's competitive dynamic, we don't see PC ASPs rising any time soon," said George Shiffler, research director at Gartner, in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Won't Budge on Windows Pricing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts agree that falling PC prices hurt Windows hardware makers more than Microsoft. The price Microsoft charges PC makers for Windows 7 Professional is the same as what it charged for Vista's business version, though Microsoft actually cut what it charges PC makers for Windows 7 Home Premium as compared to Vista's home version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet at the same time, PC price drops have exceeded expectations. In the past year the average selling price of all Windows portable PCs has fallen from $659 in Oct. 2008 to $519 in Oct. 2009, according to research firm NPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another point of contention: Microsoft is charging PC makers $50 for entry-level Windows 7 Starter on netbooks, compared to the $15 the company had been charging for Windows XP on netbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as there is an uptick in demand for PCs, there's no incentive for Microsoft to lower the prices of Windows 7 licenses that it charges PC makers," says Tim Bajarin, president of tech consulting firm Creative Strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, PC makers such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard will have to pay Microsoft the same amount for Windows licenses, even as their Windows laptop prices dip into the $500 range and their profit margins shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Netbooks have been the catalyst for this," says Bajarin. "They reset expectations for what PCs should cost. It's a great time for consumers, but OEMs are getting killed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will increase the existing tension between OEMs and Microsoft, says Bajarin, and PC makers will be forced to look elsewhere to save money as Microsoft stands its ground on Windows pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC makers will look to trim costs on items such as keyboards and screens, adds Bajarin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC Makers Need to Get Creative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, declining PC prices could also be an opportunity for hardware makers, says Richard Shim, PC analyst with research firm IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With ASPs coming down, PC makers can sell more units to consumers. They can create bundle deals, and maybe include Geek Squad-like tech support for a fee. There is a chance here for PC makers to be more creative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shim says that Microsoft is protected by rising PC demand, but is still not immune to falling prices. Even though the software giant is not going to risk revenue loss by lowering Windows license costs, it may be pressured into shelling out some marketing dollars, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft will have to deal with OEMs complaining, and one area it can appease them is by providing them with more marketing money to promote Windows 7."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Chrome Tame the Windows Bully?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware makers could threaten to move to a more affordable operating system. But with only the option being the myriad flavors of the open-source Linux OS, this is not an approach many will take, says Bajarin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At least today, Microsoft has control of the operating system," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could change as Google's current Android mobile OS runs on more netbooks and its pending Linux-based Chrome OS comes to market in 2010 and matures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the next few years, Bajarin says, the Windows ecosystem and compatibility will be too hard to compete with, especially at businesses that are built around Exchange servers and the Office productivity suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time Chrome could become a richer OS and compete with Windows as Microsoft is forced from a user-based profit model to a Web-based model," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is taking aim at one of Google's most popular services, Google Maps, with a richer version of its own online mapping service that was released in beta on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Bing Maps service uses Microsoft's Silverlight multimedia technology to provide a smoother way to zoom in and out of cityscapes that appear as 3D-like images. The beta service also includes Microsoft's answer to Google Street View, which it calls Streetside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing Maps is also getting an Application Gallery for layering data on top of maps. One of the first is a Twitter application that uses the geolocation data recently added to Twitter, so that tweets can be displayed over a map in the locations they were sent from. That might help people get real-time updates on a local news event, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another application, Local Lens, indexes local blogs using clues from what is written in the posts, and tries to layer them over the map in the appropriate location as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are a few of the enhancements to Bing that Microsoft unveiled to reporters in San Francisco on Wednesday. Others included enhancements to its core search service, such as "task pages" that list information designed to help people complete what they set out to do with their Bing search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updates continue Microsoft's efforts to attract more users to Bing, which it launched in June and has been marketing heavily ever since. Microsoft has increased its share of the search market from 8 percent to 9.9 percent since Bing's launch, according to figures from ComScore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are encouraging for Microsoft but it still has a lot of work to do, said Satya Nadella, the senior vice president for Microsoft's online services division. Google retains a commanding lead, with 65 percent of the search market, while Yahoo's share has declined slightly to 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no confusion where we still stand," Nadella said. "We have a long road ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bing Maps beta requires users to download Microsoft's free Silverlight plug-in. The existing version, which uses AJAX (asynchronous Javascript and XML), is still available, but Microsoft will focus its efforts into the Silverlight version moving forward, Nadella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(More to come)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. security company that started a firestorm after claiming recent Windows security updates caused a widespread "black screen" lock-out of users' PCs has retracted its claims and publicly apologized to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that our original blog post has been taken out of context and may have caused an inconvenience for Microsoft," Mel Morris, the chief executive of U.K. security firm Prevx, said in an entry on the company's blog Wednesday . "This was never our intention and we have already apologized to Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris' blog post was the second in two days that included an apology to Microsoft . The first, written yesterday by Jacques Erasmus, Prevx's director of research, said that Microsoft's patches were not to blame; he instead pinned responsibility for the black screens on malware infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brouhaha began last Friday when Prevx said the Windows security updates issued in November changed Access Control List (ACL) entries in the registry, preventing some installed software from running properly. The result, said Prevx, was a black screen, sometimes dubbed the "black screen of death" -- a reference to the "blue screen of death" that Windows puts up after a major system crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Microsoft said it was investigating the reports, but by Tuesday it was denying that its updates caused black screens . Moreover, said Microsoft, its technical support teams were not fielding any appreciable number of customer calls on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft turned up the heat on Prevx yesterday in other ways, as well. Roger Halbheer, Microsoft's chief security advisor for the company's European, Middle Eastern and African operations, argued that the black screen news was causing customers to delay deploying Windows security updates . "You should now make your risk assessment and decide which source you want to trust," said Halbheer on a Microsoft blog Tuesday. "For me, the ultimate source for information you should build your assessment on is neither Twitter nor your brother's sister-in-law's father's brother, but our Web site."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris' contention that Prevx's original blog had been taken out of context doesn't jibe with the comments he made to IDGNews' reporter Jeremy Kirk, who first reported on the black screen claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Morris told Kirk that Microsoft's latest patches appeared to make changes to those registry keys that caused the black screens. "It's one of those things that happens from time to time when you have a dynamic operating system," Morris said then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dust-up won't irrevocably damage Prevx's reputation as a security provider, said John Pescatore, Gartner's primary security analyst. "A single incident doesn't do damage, but a general pattern of this will," he said. "But if a company gets a reputation for doing this kind of thing again and again, people will ask, 'Are you doing ambulance chasing, or are you causing accidents by ambulance chasing?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the lesson to be learned from Prevx's misstep was something completely different, Pescatore continued. "Corporate blogging carries a lot of risk," he said. "A lot of smaller vendors think blogging is a cheaper way to reach their audience than traditional public relations, but we caution clients about doing that. Corporate PR goes through a lot of review, but blogs often don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Companies have to treat blog posts like their do PR, or have some other process to monitor blogs," Pescatore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as there's a generally-understood policy related to responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities -- alerting the affected vendor prior to publicly releasing information about the bug -- there has to be something similar for blog posts by security companies, Pescatore argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevx didn't seem to follow that advice; Morris admitted to Kirk on Monday that Prevx had not contacted Microsoft prior to posting its initial blog last Friday. Only after reports spread on the Web about Prevx's claims -- including allegations that a pair of Microsoft updates were the likely culprits of the black screens -- did Prevx reach out to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pescatore's final advice was similar to that often offered to people thinking about firing off an inflammatory e-mail. "Did you count to 10 before you pushed the button?" Pescatore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevx declined to comment on the black screen issue, and referred Computerworld to Morris' Wednesday blog post, which a company spokesperson said would "help clarify further Prevx's position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds debt movement, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Dec 2 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso soared to a
one-year high on Wednesday and stocks hit their highest in 18
months after JPMorgan raised its local stock rating on bets
strong U.S. growth will fuel an economic rebound in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Government bond prices fell by the most in more than four
months after the central bank sharply raised its 2010 inflation
forecast, increasing concerns the bank could raise interest
rates more than expected next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The peso MXN= MEX01 gained as much as 0.84 percent to
12.7425 per U.S. dollar, after touching 12.73, its strongest
since mid-November 2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IPC stock index .MXX rose 1.16 percent to 32,119
after also setting a new intraday high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan analysts raised Mexico to "overweight" from
"neutral,"' saying stronger-than-consensus growth in the United
States will spur Mexico's economy to rebound after slumping
around 7 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico's factories are closely tied to the economy of the
United States, which buys around 80 percent of Mexican exports,
and JP Morgan sees U.S. manufacturing growing 4.5 percent in
2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This drives a forecast 11-point Mexico GDP swing into next
year, the second highest globally and arguably with upside
risks," JPMorgan strategists Adrian Mowat and Ben Laidler
wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miner Grupo Mexico (GMEXICOB.MX), one of JPMorgan's picks,
rose 0.4 percent to 31.16 pesos a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wal-Mart de Mexico (WALMEXV.MX) gained 2.83 percent to
55.97 pesos after Bank of America-Merrill Lynch raised its
price target on the stock to 65 pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yield on the government's benchmark 10-year peso bond
MX10YT=RR bid up 13 basis points to 7.95 percent as its price
was bid down 0.885 of a point to 103.554, its biggest one-day
drop since July 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexican central bank Gov. Guillermo Ortiz said on Wednesday
consumer prices will likely rise between 4.75 and 5.25 percent
in the 12 months through the fourth quarter of 2010 due mostly
to the impact of recently approved taxes. For details, see
[ID:nN0228998].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The JPMorgan upgrade also helped the peso, traders said,
which is beginning to catch up with gains made in other
emerging market currencies after Fitch Ratings issued a
widely-expected downgrade of Mexico's debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worries about a downgrade had caused Mexico's peso to lag
gains seen in other emerging market currencies this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The peso has been unable to decisively break below the
12.80 level since the currency lost around one-quarter of its
value late last year during the global credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are seeing big flows. The news from JPMorgan helped
give the peso a good start, if we can close below 12.77 we
could be looking at a new range," said a trader in Mexico
City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Increasing confidence that Mexico's economy will recover
next year has helped fuel a more than 5 percent surge in the
peso against the dollar since early November.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Dec 2 (Reuters) - Mexico's Televisa is
launching an aggressive online initiative to cover the upcoming
2010 soccer World Cup, including the live streaming of key
matches, which could mean up to $15 million in advertising
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Broadcaster Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N), the world's

Wednesday it will air 30 soccer matches for free in Mexico on
its sports website, TelevisaDeportes.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All 64 matches from the South Africa-hosted tournament will
be streamed to the rest of Latin America, except for Brazil and
Argentina, at no cost too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soccer fans will be able to download the matches on their
PCs, laptops or even mobile phones. Most matches will happen
between 6 a.m. (1200 GMT) and 4 p.m. (2200 GMT) local time,
guaranteeing wide audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa has said it is interested in launching a cellphone
network in Mexico, and is expected to participate in frequency
auctions next year in a renewed effort to expand outside its
core broadcast television services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's cable and satellite units together earn revenues
nearly as high as its core broadcast services and have grown at
a double-digit pace for the past year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings takes various rating actions on J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Corp., Series 2005-LDP5, commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press
release. 

The downgrades are the result of loss expectations and reflect Fitch's
prospective views regarding commercial real estate market value and cash flow
declines. Fitch forecasts potential losses of 3.9% for this transaction, should
market conditions not recover. Today's rating actions are based on losses of
3.8%, including 100% of the losses associated with term defaults and any losses
associated with maturities within the next five years. Fitch's actions account
for 25% of the losses associated with maturities beyond five years. The bonds
with Negative Outlooks indicate classes that may be downgraded in the future. 

To determine potential defaults for each loan, Fitch assumed cash flow would
decline by 10% from year-end 2008. That is consistent with the analysis used in
its review of recent vintage transactions whereby cash flow was assumed to
decline 15% from year-end 2007 projected over a three-year period. If the
stressed cash flow would cause the loan to fall below 0.95 times (x) debt
service coverage ratio (DSCR), Fitch assumed the loan would default during the
term. To determine losses, Fitch used the above stressed cash flow and applied a
market cap rate by property type, ranging between 7.5% and 10%, to derive a
value. If the loan balance at default is less than Fitch's derived value, the
loan would realize that amount of loss. These loss estimates were reviewed in
more detail for loans representing 62.8% of the pool and, in certain cases,
revised based on additional information and/or property characteristics. Loss
expectations attributed to loans reviewed in detail represent approximately 82%
of the 3.7%. 

Approximately 81.1% of the mortgages mature within the next five years as
follows: 10.9% in 2010, 1.5% in 2011 and 2.9% in 2012 and 62% in 2015. 

Fitch identified 21 Loans of Concern (14%) within the pool, eight of which
(7.8%) are specially serviced. Of the specially serviced loans, two (4.9% of the
pool) are current. Three of the Fitch Loans of Concern (8.1%) are within the
transaction's top 15 loans, and two (5.9%) are specially serviced. 

One of the Loans of Concern (2.1%) within the top 15 loans is assumed to default
during the term, with a loss severity of approximately 35%. Fitch expects that
the remaining 14 of the top 15 loans may default at maturity based on an
insufficient accrued equity position as calculated in Fitch's refinance test. A
loan would pass the refinance test if the stressed cash flow would achieve a
1.25x DSCR as calculated based on a 30-year amortization schedule and an 8%
coupon. 

The largest contributors to loss are as follows: DRA-CRT Portfolio (3.3%),
Hanover Mall (2.1%) and Raleigh Office Centre (0.8%). 

The DRA-CRT portfolio is collateralized by a portfolio of 30 office properties
located in Orlando, FL, Jacksonville, FL and Memphis, TN. The portfolio has a
broad mix of national and regional tenants. Property performance has declined
since issuance. As of June 30, 2009 the portfolio was 78.9% occupied compared to
88.3% at issuance while DSCR declined to 1.65x compared to 1.73x at issuance.
The decline in DSCR does not yet reflect the full effect of the vacancies. Fitch
expects that the loan may default at maturity in October 2010 based on its
refinance test which stresses the cash flow and assumes amortization and an 8%
coupon versus the 5.35% interest rate in place. 

The Hanover Mall transferred to the special servicer in November 2009 for
imminent default when the borrower informed the servicer that it would cease
making payments. The loan is currently 30 days delinquent. The loan is
collateralized by a 706,005 square foot (sf) anchored retail center located in
Hanover, MA. Property performance has declined over the past year. Circuit City,
KB Toys, Ritz Camera, and Zale's Jewelers all filed bankruptcy and closed their
stores at the property during the first half of 2009. Revenues have also been
under pressure from tenants requesting rental rate concessions to keep their
stores open at the property. As of third-quarter 2009 (3Q'09) DSCR and occupancy
were 1.14x and 92.8%, respectively, compared to 1.20x and 98.2% at issuance. As
of the 3Q'09 rent roll, base rental revenues have declined approximately 22%
compared to issuance underwriting. 

The Raleigh Office Centre loan is collateralized by a 289,279 sf office property
in Southfield, MI. As of 2Q'09, occupancy and DSCR were 67% and 0.71x,
respectively. The property has struggled with occupancy levels since issuance
and has never performed above a 1.0x DSCR. The largest tenant at the property,
Metropolitan Life Insurance (40% of net rentable area [NRA]) has a lease which
expires at year-end (YE) 2009. A renewal is currently being negotiated; however,
Metropolitan Life's current rental rate is approximately 33% above market
according to the CBRE 3Q'09 Detroit MarketView Report. Due to the depressed
economic conditions in the area it is likely that the property will continue to
struggle.

&lt;p&gt;RALEIGH, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Diversified industrial manufacturer Eaton Corporation (NYSE:ETN) today announced
it is providing power management support for IBM`s Portable Modular Data Center
(PMDC). A broad range of Eaton`s power quality and power distribution components
integrate with IBM`s fully functional modular data center. The PMDC can be
shipped and rapidly deployed with a complete physical infrastructure in any
environment.

"Eaton has a long history of working with Information Technology (IT) managers
and chief information officers (CIOs) to achieve cost savings and execute
sustainable strategies with its industry-leading advances in power distribution,
power quality and enterprise software solutions," said Jerry R. Whitaker,
president, Electrical Sector - Americas. "Power usage represents a significant
cost when operating a facility. The ability to plan, build and maintain a highly
energy-efficient data center is essential to meet business objectives."

Eaton`s energy-efficient solutios provide high power density with space-saving
design as an integral part of IBM`s PMDC. The Eaton 9395 uninterruptible power
system (UPS), for example, is an ideal power protection solution for IBM`s PMDC;
it has the smallest footprint and lowest weight of any UPS in its class and the
ability to achieve 99 percent efficiency with Eaton`s Energy Saver System.

"IBM`s PMDC is part of our strategy to deliver a cost-effective and flexible
family of modular data center solutions to businesses facing significant capital
and operational costs," said Steve Sams, IBM vice president, Global Site and
Facilities Services. "Eaton has been working with IBM since the launch of
Project Big Green and continues to develop innovative products that
significantly reduce energy consumption while still achieving critically high
standards for power quality."

IBM and Eaton already have experience working together on IBM`s PMDC solutions
such as the PMDC containers installed at an IBM data center location in Europe
which features an Eaton 550 kVA UPS, N+1 configuration, with 20 minutes of
battery runtime, and associated switchgear. This installation also features a 1
megawatt diesel generator as part of the electrical infrastructure.

In 2007, IBM launched Project Big Green and committed $1 billion per year to
deliver technologies that help clients dramatically increase the level of energy
efficiency in their data centers. IBM introduced the PMDC as part of the second
phase of Project Big Green to drive modular data center design solutions to
allow clients to pay as they grow reducing capital and operating costs.

IBM will showcase some of Eaton`s energy-efficient UPSs and electrical solutions
as part of IBM`s PMDC demonstration unit during the Gartner 28th Data Center
Conference in Las Vegas, Dec. 1-4.

&lt;p&gt; * Proposed derivatives rules a concern - analysts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Bank sees revenue falling as much as $3 billion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares down 1.3 percent
 (Adds details on proposed regulations, data from OCC, CDS
spreads)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 2 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
estimates revenue could fall as much as $3 billion next year if
new regulations force most of its derivative transactions onto
an exchange, according to research firm Sanford C. Bernstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank, the largest derivatives dealer on Wall Street,
could take an earnings hit of 13 cents to 20 cents per share in
2010 if proposed derivatives rules becomes law, the analysts
estimated after speaking Tuesday with Steve Black, executive
chairman of JPMorgan's investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The calculations are based on the bank's worst-case
scenario for additional regulation and the bulk of its
privately traded derivatives contracts moving to an exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernstein's current estimate for JPMorgan's 2010 earnings
is $3.20 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. bank has reported record revenue
from fixed income, commodities and currencies this year but
believes such results will be difficult to repeat in 2010, the
analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, Black believes the fourth-quarter slowdown in
trading volumes may be worse than usual this year as investors
look to protect gains after a volatile year, the analysts, led
by John McDonald, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's bumper $3.6 billion third-quarter profit was
largely driven by its fixed income unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, the bank is investing in emerging markets --
particularly in Asia and Latin America -- as well as its
commodities and equities businesses to bolster earnings,
according to the analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LEGISLATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawmakers and regulators have proposed requiring that
certain transactions in the $450 trillion over-the-counter
derivatives market go through exchanges or similar platforms,
as part of wider reform proposals aimed at fixing the financial
system and preventing another credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, in testimony on
Wednesday, said it was imperative that regulators have the
power to require central clearing of any derivatives.
[ID:nN02546952]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks and other financial participants want to keep as much
of the derivatives market unregulated as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, with $79.9 trillion in notional derivatives
exposure, has the largest position among the four major banks
that control over 90 percent of the U.S. derivatives market,
according to the most recent data from the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares fell as much as 1.75 percent to $41.48 in
morning trading but recovered to $41.67 in afternoon dealings,
down 1.3 percent. There was no move in the bank's credit
default swap price.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/d8402c/procter_gamble) has announced
the addition of the "Procter &amp; Gamble: Pipeline, Products, Performance and
Potential" company profile to their offering. 

Procter &amp; Gamble focuses on marketing over 300 branded products in more than 160
countries worldwide. The Health Care division develops pharmaceuticals, oral and
personal health care products and is a major component of P's Beauty and
Health Global Business Unit. 

Actonel (risedronate), a third-generation, once-daily bisphosphonate, is P's
only major pharmaceutical product. P and sanofi-aventis formed The Alliance
for Better Bone Health in May 1997, to develop and market Actonel, with the
companies co-promoting it in North America and in select key markets in Europe. 

The Health Care division contributed 17.5 per cent of total sales in fiscal
2008, with Pharmaceuticals forming a significant proportion of Health Care
revenue. However, P has stated that long-term focus will be concentrated on
the Hair and Oral Care divisions of the Beauty and Health GBUs. The October 2005
acquisition of Gillette signalled a further deflection of focus from
Pharmaceuticals and has led to a complete reorganisation of the company's
structure. 

With the exception of Asacol, all of P's major pharmaceutical products have
lost their patent protection or face patent litigation. The launch of
Roche/GlaxoSmithKline's Boniva seems to have generated strong pressure for P's
flagship pharmaceutical, Actonel. Furthermore, the R pipeline is limited to
only one in-licensed compound, pexelizumab, which failed to meet its primary

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) has estimated its revenue could fall as much as $3 billion next year if, as a result of legislation, most of its derivative transactions are forced onto an exchange, Sanford C. Bernstein analysts wrote on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank could take an earnings hit of 13 cents to 20 cents per share in 2010 if proposed derivatives legislation becomes law, the analysts estimated after speaking Tuesday with Steve Black, executive chairman of JPMorgan's investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calculations are based on the bank's estimate of a worst-case scenario that sees additional regulation for derivatives and the bulk of its privately traded derivatives contracts moving to an exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein's current estimate for JPMorgan's 2010 earnings is $3.20 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. bank has reported record revenue from fixed income, commodities and currencies this year but believes such results will be difficult to repeat in 2010, the analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Black believes the fourth-quarter slowdown in trading volumes may be worse than usual this year as investors look to protect gains after a volatile year, the analysts, led by John McDonald, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, JPMorgan is investing in emerging markets -- particularly in Asia and Latin America -- as well as its commodities and equities businesses to bolster earnings, according to the analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares fell as much as 1.75 percent to $41.48 in morning trading but recovered to $41.80 at midday, down 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

freely in their native languages," said Cronan. "I am thrilled to join
Mojofiti`s board of directors and be part of this ambitious undertaking to
create a world without language barriers."

Mojofiti`s vision to foster collaboration between people in all countries, from
all walks of life, and look forward to joining this board of highly talented

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group announced today an investment of $61
million to support the preservation of more than 500 affordable rental homes for
low-income New Yorkers. The investment will go to the New York Equity Fund
(NYEF) and represents the largest single investment in the fund`s history. 

NYEF is a joint venture between the Department of Housing Preservation and
Development (HPD), Enterprise Community Investment, Inc. (Enterprise) and the
Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC). For the past 20 years, NYEF has
invested $1.6 billion to support New York City`s efforts to build and preserve
affordable rental housing. NYEF has created 24,000 homes for residents earning
less than 60% of the area median income, or less than $46,800 for a family of
four. Goldman Sachs` investment will support revitalization efforts in Harlem,
Brooklyn and the Bronx. 

"Preserving the City`s affordable housing stock is a critical component in our
efforts to stabilize and strengthen New York neighborhoods," said HPD
Commissioner Rafael E. Cestero. "This investment by Goldman Sachs will help us
provide the funding and other resources we need to make homes decent and safe
while preserving their affordability for these families." 

Goldman Sachs` participation in NYEF builds on the firm`s investments to
catalyze urban revitalization and promote comprehensive community development.
Founded in 2000, the Urban Investment Group deploys the firm`s capital though
investments and loans that benefit low- and moderate-income people and
communities. 

"Through this investment, Goldman Sachs is facilitating the rehabilitation of
568 units of much-needed affordable housing in New York City," said Alicia Glen,
Managing Director and Head of the Urban Investment Group at Goldman Sachs. "We
remain committed to working with local leaders and public agencies to help meet
the needs of these communities." 

Enterprise and LISC, two of the country`s leading affordable housing
organizations, worked with the development capital made available through
Goldman Sachs to developers of affordable housing. Enterprise and LISC also
provide expertise and technical assistance to the development of these
affordable housing projects. 

Charlie R. Werhane, president and CEO, Enterprise Community Investment, Inc.
said, "Enterprise applauds Goldman Sachs` significant investment in affordable
housing through its participation in the New York Equity Fund. We are proud to
partner with Goldman Sachs, LISC and the City of New York on this incredibly
effective program." 

"At a time when economic pressure has constrained city resources and impacted so
many families, the Goldman Sachs investment will have a clear and immediate
impact," said Michael Rubinger, President and CEO of LISC.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds detail, comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Dec 2 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso strengthened
to a one-year high on Wednesday and stocks hit their highest
level in 18 months after JPMorgan raised its rating on local
stocks on bets that strong U.S. growth will fuel an economic
rebound in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The peso MXN= MEX01 gained as much as 0.95 percent to
12.73 per U.S. dollar, its strongest since mid-November 2008,
while the IPC stock index .MXX rose 1.44 percent to 32,207.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan analysts raised Mexico to "overweight" from
"neutral,"' saying stronger-than-consensus growth in the United
States will spur Mexico's economy to rebound after slumping
around 7 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico's factories are closely tied to the United States,
which buys around 80 percent of Mexican exports, and JP Morgan
sees U.S. manufacturing growing 4.5 percent in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This drives a forecast 11-point Mexico GDP swing into next
year, the second highest globally and arguably with upside
risks," JPMorgan strategists Adrian Mowat and Ben Laidler
wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miner Grupo Mexico (GMEXICOB.MX), one of JPMorgans picks,
rose 1.74 percent to 31.59 pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wal-Mart de Mexico (WALMEXV.MX) gained 1.98 percent to
55.51 pesos after Bank of America-Merrill Lynch raised its
price target on the stock to 65 pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The JPMorgan upgrade also helped the peso, traders said,
which is beginning to catch up with gains made in other
emerging market currencies after Fitch Ratings issued a
widely-expected downgrade of Mexico's debt.

&lt;p&gt;LiquiCool&#174; Helps IBM Clients Increase Energy Efficiency, Reduce Space, Cut
Capital and Operating Costs
PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--(Business Wire)--
Vette Corp, a leading global provider of data center thermal management
solutions, has been selected by IBM (NYSE: IBM) as a global partner in providing
an energy efficient, sustainable cooling solution for the IBM Portable Modular
Data Center (PMDC). 

IBM`s PMDC provides a fully functional data center in a shipping container with
complete physical infrastructure including systems for power, cooling and remote
monitoring. It has all the elements of secure operating environments found in
traditional "raised-floor" data centers, including fire protection, smoke
alerts, humidity control, physical security, external environmental isolation
and temperature controls. PMDC can support multiple technology and system
vendors in an industry-standard rack environment and IBM`s unique PMDC design
enables complete access to both the front and rear of IT equipment from within a
closed, secure container without operational disruptions or downtime. 

The IT equipment within the PMDC can be cooled using Vette Corp`s LiquiCool Rear
Door Heat Exchangers rather than with traditional air cooling. Vette`s LiquiCool
Rear Door Heat Exchanger is a water cooled door that mounts to the back of IT
enclosures and cools computer equipment exhaust air before it re-enters the data
center operating environment. The Rear Door Heat Exchanger utilizes a low
impedance fin and tube heat exchanger that does not have fans, moving parts or
electrical connections, resulting in a dramatic reduction of cooling energy
consumption and an increase in efficiency gains and cost savings. When compared
to traditional air-cooled solutions, Vette`s Rear Door Heat Exchanger may permit
up to 5 times more compute power per IT enclosure and reduce electrically active
white space by up to 84%. 

Vette`s LiquiCool Rear Door Heat Exchanger went head-to-head with leading
competitor liquid cooling products in a "Chill-Off" competition sponsored by the
Silicon Valley Leadership Group (SVLG). The results are publically available and
provide third party validation that Vette`s Rear Door Heat Exchanger solution
delivers top performance in efficiency and cooling capacity. 

The low profile of the Rear Door Heat Exchanger and the ability for it to be
used on a wide variety of IT enclosures supports the PMDC`s goal of supporting
multiple system vendors while optimizing the use of available data center power
and space. The Rear Door Heat Exchanger is now available to be deployed on
leading brands of enclosures by AFCO Systems, APC, Chatsworth Products, Damac,
Data Center Resources, Dell, Electrorack, Great Lakes, HP, IBM, IMS Engineered
Products, NER, Rittal, SMC and Wright Line. 

"IBM is pleased to partner with Vette Corp to provide an energy and space

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Electronic Trading (GSET) announced today the release of the
latest version of REDIPlus, Goldman Sachs` award-winning execution management
system. Version 9.1 features significant enhancements to options and futures
trading as well as portfolio trading, and also introduces flexible solutions for
clients using the BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL&#174; service. 

"Version 9.1 is the latest release in our long history of innovative execution
management solutions for traders," said Rishi Nangalia, Managing Director and
global head of GSET Business Development. "We continue to focus on global
execution strategies and workspace usability to meet the diverse needs of our
clients." 

Key features of 9.1:

* Clients have the ability to streamline their desktop workflow by launching
Bloomberg screens from REDIPlus. Clients who utilize both applications on the
same PC will be able to click within REDIPlus and select from a menu of
functions on the BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL service. REDIPlus users can also create
custom "hotkeys" that can be clicked to open up a particular screen or access a
particular function on the BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL service. 
* Options traders can take advantage of the introduction of a TWAP
(Time-Weighted Average Price) algorithm, which complements the existing nine
advanced options strategies available in REDIPlus. TWAP leverages the
previously-launched "Strike" order type to minimize market impact while
accessing liquidity. 
* Additional functionality includes Active Limit Options Analytic Charting, a
REDIPlus chart that displays a real-time graphical representation of a
Volatility or Delta Adjusted order limit price and executions relative to the
current market. 
* Clients trading futures now have the ability to submit futures calendar spread
orders from an order management system (OMS) via FIX. Strategy orders received
via FIX can then be worked using all of the existing REDIPlus trading
functionality, including algorithms. Executed orders are "dropped" back into the
customer's order management system for post trade processing. 
* Customers trading US and Canadian shares can access the SIGMA inter-listed
router, which simultaneously scans US and Canadian market venues and routes
orders to the market where there is the best opportunity for optimal execution. 
* Clients trading portfolios of stocks will be able to measure the performance
of their list against historical benchmarks. This enhancement to performance
analysis of portfolios is offered in addition to previously available intra-day
performance benchmarks, such as bid, ask, last, open, and prior close.

"REDIPlus` enhanced user-friendly interface and absolute flexibility help
clients achieve their execution goals, whether they utilize algorithmic
strategies for US listed options or trade portfolios of stocks across the
European markets," said Nangalia. 

About REDIPlus and Goldman Sachs

The REDIPlus trading platform allows clients to trade equities, options,
futures, foreign exchange and synthetics from a single application. Clients can
use REDIPlus to access Goldman Sachs algorithmic strategies in the U.S., Canada,
Europe and Asia. Additionally, clients can user REDIPlus to route orders through
our SIGMA smart router and post orders directly to the SIGMA X crossing network.
Clients trading portfolios of securities benefit from integrated portfolio and
spread trading functionality and an embedded suite of pre-, during, and
post-trade analytics.

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Matrix42 (www.matrix42.com), the leading provider of IT-Commerce solutions, has
launched a connector for Microsoft`s System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM).
Microsoft customers benefit from effective and automated IT service provisioning
and a maximum degree of cost transparency achieved through the interaction of
both programs. 

The Matrix42 IT-Commerce for SCCM suite uses the new customer-tested connector
to leverage SCCM`s software distribution and inventory capabilities, which
evolve and enhance SCCM from a systems management software solution to a
complete IT-Commerce solution. The Matrix42 suite allows customers to present
their IT services in a unique, web-based Service Catalog. It accepts users'
orders, takes care of the approval process and initiates delivery, directly
interacting with SCCM and achieving 100 percent IT business automation, from
requests to subsequent cost allocation, with only minor configuration. 

SCCM provides the Matrix42 solution with the necessary data for corporate
compliance. Inventory data flows seamlessly into the Matrix42 license management
system, providing a high degree of visibility on licenses, assets, contracts and
costs. IT executives know which licenses are actually required and where they
can leverage additional savings. Automatic notifications inform the responsible
decision maker on contract data and license violations in a timely manner. 

For the first time, the combined usage of Microsoft SCCM and Matrix42`s
IT-Commerce Solution gives users the ability to use the Service Catalog to
return services and software they no longer require. This feature lets companies
transfer expensive software licenses to other users with no manual intervention
required. 

With the new connector, the Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager
becomes an automated service solution - the first true IT-Commerce platform. For
more information, visit www.matrix42.com/sccm. 

About Matrix42

Matrix42 combines client lifecycle management and IT service management into
IT-Commerce. This combination gives Matrix42`s customers and potential customers
the ability to have a single pane of glass for management of the endpoints and
servicing of IT customers. IT-Commerce Suite lets Matrix42 redefine how IT
departments interact with their customers, the customer is no longer helpdesk
dependent to fulfill software requests or other IT related services. Based on
Microsoft Workflow Engine, IT departments can now automate many tasks that today
are labor intensive. Matrix42 is reshaping how IT departments manage the
environment by aligning the IT department to their company goals and objectives
to reduce cost and enhance the level of services.

&lt;p&gt;BARCELONA Dec 2 (Reuters) - Global gas demand is likely to

Cordano said LNG would continue to grow, to make up 10 percent
of total gas demand by the end of the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect continued robust growth in LNG, with volumes
expected to grow by 40 percent by 2020 to nearly 40 bcf a day."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it could find no evidence that recent security updates were causing problems with its new Windows 7 operating system, which some have dubbed the "black screen of death."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, which has caused a small number of users to see a completely black screen after logging on, was identified by British software security firm Prevx last week, and received widespread attention after a report by the BBC on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevx had claimed that changes to Microsoft's operating system's registry -- the database that stores configuration settings -- were the most likely cause of the error, but Microsoft denied that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has investigated reports that its November security updates made changes to permissions in the registry that are resulting in system issues for some customers," said Microsoft representative Christopher Budd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company has found those reports to be inaccurate and our comprehensive investigation has shown that none of the recently released updates are related to the behavior described in the reports," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Microsoft's support teams were not seeing this as a big issue for users, but urged Microsoft customers to contact support for free assistance in the event of problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today said it will deliver six security updates on Tuesday, including one that will patch a vulnerability in Internet Explorer (IE) the company admitted only last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updates will patch a total of 12 flaws in Windows, IE and Microsoft Office, the company said in a follow-up entry to its security response center's blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the top of the patch list, even Microsoft's own, will be an update for IE 5.01, IE6, IE7 and IE8 that has been pegged as "critical," the firm's highest severity rating in its four-step scoring system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update will address an IE zero-day vulnerability that Microsoft confirmed Nov. 23 in a security advisory. "I want to point out that Internet Explorer 8 is not affected on any platform and that running Protected Mode in Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Vista mitigates this issue," said Jerry Bryant, a spokesman for the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), in a blog post announcing the advisory last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's advisory was its reaction to proof-of-concept attack code that had gone public several days before, when it was posted to the popular Bugtraq security mailing list. The sample code exploited a flaw in IE's layout parser, and could be used to hijack fully-patched Windows machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next Tuesday's update, however, will quash bugs in all still-supported versions of IE, not just IE6 and IE7, a fact Microsoft confirmed today . "We want to make customers aware that we will be addressing the vulnerability discussed in Security Advisory 977981 in the IE bulletin on Tuesday," Bryant said in another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory Bryant called out was the one Microsoft issued last week. "We know that customers are concerned about this issue and we are also aware that Proof of Concept (PoC) code is available publicly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's advance notification spelled out the significance of the problem with IE: All versions of its browser contain one or more flaws when run on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Vista, Server 2003 and even Windows 7. Only the company's newest server products -- Server 2008 and Server 2008 R2 -- are somewhat safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that doesn't mean IE 5.01 and IE8 are suddenly vulnerable to last week's zero-day exploit, said Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security. Microsoft confirmed to Storms that the IE update contains fixes for multiple vulnerabilities; it's not unusual for Microsoft to quash several bugs in a single update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last week's zero-day is still not applicable to IE8," Storms said after he consulted with MSRC. "Some other bug is also being patched in the same bulletin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack code that went public Nov. 20 was not only unreliable, according to security experts who dived into the exploit, but was touted as only affecting IE6 and IE7 on Windows XP. Later, Microsoft said that Vista users would be protected to a degree not enjoyed by XP customers because the former's "sandbox" would limit the ability of the exploit to compromise the PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most outside security researchers, including Storms, were pessimistic last week when asked whether Microsoft could scramble fast enough to fix the flaw in IE6 and IE7. Today, he was impressed. "I would have wavered last week [on] whether they would fix it," he admitted. "But given the impact [of the vulnerability] and the fact that there's code out there, I'm not surprised that they managed it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other updates slated for release on Dec. 8 include patches for bugs in Windows; Office 2000 and Office 2003; and Microsoft Project 2000, 2002 and 2003. Three of the six updates will be tagged critical, while the remaining trio will carry the "important" label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Frankly, the rest don't matter at this point," said Storms, referring to the non-IE updates. "IE is the top of the news for Microsoft today, and will be next week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bright spot, said Storms, is that Microsoft keeps ladling more information onto its pre-Patch Tuesday notification , a preview customers rely on to plan their patching strategy for the following week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're blogging and telling us the number of vulnerabilities and the [affected] applications now, which is great," Storms said, applauding Microsoft's moves. "They continue to increase the amount of information they provide. They're setting a real trend here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release the six updates at approximately 1 p.m. ET on Dec. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   (Changes headline, adds details and background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Al Yoon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. is
preparing a $500 million commercial mortgage-backed security
backed by retail properties of the Inland Western Retail Real
Estate Trust, according to a term sheet shown to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The issue, which is not eligible for the Federal Reserve's
emergency funding program, brings to three the bolt of CMBS in
the past month that have revived issuance of the securitized
assets after a more than one-year freeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also shows large banks are beginning to offer lending in
the market for office, apartment and retail buildings that has
suffered from the economic recession and lack of credit.
Difficult refinancing on properties which have lost a third or
more of their values has resulted in soaring defaults this
year, and the problem is seen worsening in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan originated a $625 million 10-year loan to Inland
Western, a company which owns 299 shopping centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The loan includes a two-part $125 million mezzanine debt,
according to the term sheet reviewed by Reuters. Properties
include 55 retail buildings across 23 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Inland Western, the new loan addresses nearly all its
2009 maturing debt and a "substantial portion" of that due in
2010, Chief Executive Officer Steven Grimes said in a statement
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terms of the Inland Western loan are far more conservative
than in years past. It was a similar case with a $400 million
five-year CMBS for Developers Diversified Realty Corp. sold in
November and a seven-year $460 million bond backed by
properties owned by private equity giant Fortress Investment
Group., sold earlier on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $500 million first loan for Inland Western represents
58.9 percent of the properties' appraised values, compared with
loan-to-value ratios that often ran 75 percent or higher during
the real estate boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oak Brook, Illinois-based Inland Western has refinanced,
paid down or eliminated $1.3 billion in debt. It aims to extend
$401 million in loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new issue is not eligible for financing under the
Federal Reserve's emergency Term-Asset Backed Securities Loan
Facility (TALF,) suggesting investors are confident with the
collateral and want to forego the cost of Fed financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Less than a quarter of the Developers Diversified issue, so
far the only new CMBS eligible for TALF, was funded that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In another first, the Inland Western bond is rated by
Realpoint, a rating company dedicated to commercial mortgages.
Underwriters sought ratings from Standard  Poor's, but not
Moody's Investors Service or Fitch Ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Al Yoon; Editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((albert.yoon@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646-223-6347; Reuters

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc's (V.N) shares, already on a roll this year, could ascend to fresh record highs in coming months, helped by an uptick in consumer spending and a surge in the use of debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest payment network could easily beat earnings expectations, analysts said, suggesting that its growth potential and earnings momentum made it more comparable to a fast-growing tech stock than a troubled bank or insurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visa can get mentioned in the same breath as an Apple (AAPL.O) or a Google (GOOG.O)," said Greg Smith, an analyst at investment bank Duncan Williams, who has a "buy" recommendation on the stock and a price target of $90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's that kind of rare large company that is already large but is still growing pretty rapidly. There aren't many companies like that around, period."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa shares have risen almost 60 percent so far this year, closing on Wednesday at a 17-month high of $83.40. The 60 percent gain this year compares with 23 percent increase of the SP 500 index .SPX over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that kind of share price growth, the stock is hardly cheap. Visa shares trade at about 22.35 times analysts' estimated 2010 earnings, well above rival MasterCard Inc's (MA.N) ratio of 18 times, and the average for the Standard  Poor's 500 of 15 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts say that a premium valuation is reasonable, and could expand even more. Visa has more debit card business than MasterCard, which is where the growth in the payment processing industry is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's price-to-earnings multiple could expand to 25, said Bob Napoli, an analyst at Piper Jaffray in Chicago. Based on analysts' average estimates, that multiple would imply a price of $90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the credit and debit card network touched an all-time high of $89.83 in May 2008, two months after their debut on the New York Stock Exchange, but the financial meltdown sank the stock to a record low of $41.78 in January. On Thursday, Visa's shares closed at $80.03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's fairly possible to get back to the old high," Napoli said. "The catalyst is that you continue to get a gradual global economic rebound, and spending gradually improves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EARNINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another catalyst could be the company's next quarterly results, due in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa is expected to show an acceleration of transaction growth, helped by an increase in the use of debit cards, a lower decline in the use of credit cards, and a more intensive use of cards abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa has about 75 percent of the debit card market in the United States. Analysts are forecasting that debit cards will increase their share of the total volume of transactions in the industry to 22 percent by 2012 from around 15 percent today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is partly insulated from the credit crisis because it processes transactions rather than lend funds. It makes money every time a customer swipes its card, and transaction volumes have continued to go up during the recession thanks to a secular shift from cash to electronic payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, not every analyst is bullish on the stock -- some believe it may have jumped too far, too fast. Weak consumers and higher unemployment could have an impact on the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa forecast net revenue will grow at the lower end of an 11 percent to 15 percent range and annual diluted class A common stock earnings per share will go up more than 20 percent in its fiscal 2010 year, which started in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On a relative basis, I would rather own MasterCard over Visa" because MasterCard looks cheaper, said Roger Smith, an analyst at Fox-Pitt. "For the most part, I think a lot of the good news is priced into the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa declined to comment for this report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts believe more good news is coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The street has underestimated earnings. They beat earnings expectations pretty consistently and we frankly expect that to continue in 2010," said Duncan Williams' Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Various job listings posted online this November have hinted at when Microsoft plans to shift its focus to Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most early adopters of Microsoft's latest offering, Windows 7, are still getting settled into the month-old OS, and discovering what the highly favored current version of Windows can do. However, it seems the guys up in Redmond aren't just hanging around, as this past month alone Microsoft has posted seven job openings in the hopes of finding folks to work on Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology site Ars Technica discovered the job listings over on Microsoft's official careers page. Some of the listings have since been edited or removed, but Ars Technica still has the original listings available in full on their site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what tidbits of Windows 8 knowledge can we glean from the vacancies listed? We already know from a recent product roadmap that Microsoft's next OS could pack in 128-bit support, and  is expected to hit retail some time in 2012. But these fresh vacancies, which include an assortment of positions such as testers, project management personnel, and launch leads,    hint that Microsoft is planning to shift its internal focus to Windows 8 as they "head into Fy11". The fiscal year for 2011 begins in July of 2010, which gives Microsoft two years to perfect Windows 8 before it's expected 2012 debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would you like to see in Windows 8? Let us know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow  GeekTech  and Chris Brandrick on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/183586&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vidyo Delivers Industry`s Lowest Latency and Highly Interactive Video
Conferencing on the Desktop


HACKENSACK, NJ--(Business Wire)--
Vidyo Inc., the first company to deliver personal telepresence, today announced
support for Microsoft Office Communicator (MOC), allowing MOC client users to
quickly and easily initiate and participate in HD multiparty Vidyo conferences.
With Vidyo`s award-winning, patented technology which is based on the new H.264
SVC (Scalable Video Coding) standard, MOC users now have access to telepresence
on the desktop with latency at less than 250 ms, and consistent picture quality
on their PCs via a standard Internet connection. 

"Businesses are finally beginning to understand the role of video within unified
communications and the value proposition of deploying communications platforms
such as Microsoft`s Office Communications Server (OCS) with Microsoft Office
Communicator (MOC)" said Krithi Rao, Industry Analyst, Information and
Communication Technologies, Frost &amp; Sullivan. "Consequently, along with UC, they
want the choice of deploying video technology that best suits their visual
needs. `One click` integration of multiparty HD/low-latency video conferencing
such as that provided by Vidyo, with UC platforms such as OCS with MOC, will
increase the usage of video at the desktop, and increase the overall value
proposition of the UC platform as well." 

"Up until now, MOC users have been limited in their video conferencing options
to standard desktop performance" said Ofer Shapiro, Vidyo CEO. "Vidyo`s
application adds Personal Telepresence to the MOC client, enabling users, for
the first time, to experience the same low latency and consistent picture
quality traditionally restricted to Telepresence rooms. Vidyo`s economics and
architecture make it easy for companies to scale deployment of video
conferencing to service everyone in the organization." 

Vidyo`s Innovative Approach

Vidyo`s plug-in connects MOC with the VidyoDesktop client, providing end-users
with the ability to initiate Vidyo conferences using their MOC-based contacts.
Instant Messaging sessions can be escalated to Vidyo conference in the same
manner that MOC video chat is launched. The Vidyo conference is initiated by
clicking the "VidyoConferencing" button from a pull-down menu on a given
contact. The contact is automatically invited to the user`s meeting room, and a
"guest hyper-link" is provided if the contact is not a registered Vidyo user. 

Vidyo has also simplified scheduling and guest participant invitations with a
separate plug-in for Microsoft Outlook. While generating a calendar invite for a
meeting, users can simply click the VidyoConferencing button on their Outlook
tool bar to add a URL that takes invited guests directly into the user`s virtual
meeting room, providing easy one-click access for invitees. 

The Vidyo Plug-in for MOC supports both R1 and R2 versions of Microsoft Office
Communicator 2007. Information regarding MOC 2007 can be found at
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/communicator

Since all Vidyo technology and products deliver superior IP network error-
resiliency, the Vidyo platform accessed through the plug-in enables IT managers
deploying OCS with MOC to eliminate the costly dedicated networks and equipment
necessary to achieve high-quality, multi-party video conferences with other
video solutions. VidyoConferencing also enables teleworking or traveling
participants to be included from outside the corporate network using just the
Internet, and through firewalls with the VidyoProxy. 

Availability

The Vidyo Plug-In for MOC is currently available through the Vidyo reseller
network.

Linda Sanchez, Environmentalist Trudie Styler &amp; Human Rights Activist Kerry Kennedy Criticize Chevron For Failing to Address Ecuador Disaster and Challenge Chevron To Act</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Three leading female environmental and human rights advocates - Congresswoman
Linda Sanchez (D-CA), Trudie Styler, co-founder of the Rainforest Foundation
with husband Sting, and Kerry Kennedy, President of the Robert F. Kennedy Center
for Justice and Human Rights - have issued independent calls for Chevron to
clean up the company`s Ecuador environmental disaster on the eve of a court
judgment where the oil giant faces a potential $27 billion liability. 

The three leaders in recent weeks have used high-profile settings such as the
United Nations General Assembly and the U.S. Congress to blast Chevron`s failure
to clean what experts believe is the worst oil-related contamination on earth.
Texaco (which Chevron bought in 2001) is accused of deliberately dumping more
than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into the Ecuador`s Amazon rainforest when
operating more than 350 well sites from 1964 to 1990, or 30 times more oil than
was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident. 

A final judgment is expected in 2010 in an Ecuador legal case brought against
Chevron by dozens of indigenous and farmer communities living in the area of the
Amazon impacted by the oil company`s contamination. A court-appointed Special
Master estimated damages at up to $27.3 billion, making the case potentially the
largest environmental damages matter ever. 

The lawsuit asserts that the contamination has decimated the traditional
cultures of five indigenous groups and that more than 900 toxic waste pits built
by Texaco continue leaking poisons into streams and groundwater relied on by the
local population for drinking water. The contamination created severe adverse
health consequences for women in particular, including a dramatic rise in
uterine cancer and spontaneous miscarriages, according to evidence at trial. 

Styler received sustained applause from hundreds of diplomats in the U.N.
General Assembly after a stirring speech on climate change in which she singled
out Chevron`s Ecuador problem as an example of how irresponsible behavior can
devastate the environment and contribute to global warming. 

Speaking Nov. 19 in support of the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference, Styler
accused Chevron of destroying what was once a "paradise on Earth" in Ecuador by
employing drilling practices which had been outlawed in the United States since
the 1930s. Styler, who has partnered with UNICEF to deliver clean water to the
Amazon communities, was accompanied on the dais by UN Secretary General Ban
Ki-moon. 

"That region [of Ecuador where Chevron operated] is now described by independent
assessors as one of the most contaminated industrial sites in the world," Styler
said. "On my visits to the region, I have spoken to mothers who know that the
water they give their children to drink is poisoned but they've simply had no
choice. 

"I met Maria Garafolo, a 38-year-old mother, who has cancer of the uterus. Her
18-year-old daughter, Sylvia, has cancer of the liver. They showed me the stream
where they collect their water. It stinks of petroleum. Nothing grows there. The
animals they rear to sell at market die in the toxic environment." 

Rep. Sanchez blasted Chevron in testimony before a committee of the U.S.
Congress on Nov. 17 for engaging in a political campaign to quash the Ecuador
legal case. She noted that Chevron has hired lobbyiststo persuade the Congress
to cancel Ecuador`s trade preferences as "punishment" for allowing its citizens
to sue Chevron in their own courts. 

Sanchez said the area where Texaco operated in Ecuador "struggles to deal with
an environmental and humanitarian crisis" and cited evidence that more than
1,400 residents have died of cancer due to the contamination. 

"&#8230;Birth defects are prevalent, and the region suffers from water contamination,
rainforest deforestation, and ecosystem degradation," she said 

"Instead of allowing this case to come to a conclusion, embarking on clean-up
efforts, or even seeking mediation, Chevron has engaged in a lobbying effort
that looks like little more than extortion. Apparently, if it can`t get the
outcome it wants from the Ecuadorian court system, Chevron will use the U.S.
government to deny trade benefits until Ecuador cries uncle," Sanchez testified.


Kennedy, who visited the affected area this past October and who debated a
Chevron spokeswoman on CNN, wrote in the Huffington Post: "I had heard about
what has been called `Chevron's Chernobyl in the Amazon` for years. But nothing
could prepare me for the horror I witnessed. 

"I met a man who told me his two children died after swimming in contaminated
water. One died within 24 hours," wrote Kennedy, who is chair of the Amnesty
International USA Leadership Council. "The other writhed in agony for six months
before his poor body gave way. 

"I saw a poisonous pit abandoned by Texaco in 1974 and never used by any other
company. The pipes leading from that pit have clear liquid running from them.
When I put that liquid to my nose, it smelled like gasoline. It runs directly
into an adjoining stream, which is the main source of drinking water for people
who live along its banks. 

"Texaco knew people would die because of what they were doing, and they ignored
it&#8230; This is an issue of human rights - clear violations [by Chevron] of the
indigenous Ecuadoreans' rights to life, security, and self-determination."

&lt;p&gt; * Sees oil prices rising to $110/barrel in 2011

 * Lowers 2010 price forecast for natural gas

 * Goldman's first major oil price outlook since June

 (Recasts, adds details and prices) 

 NEW YORK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
expects oil prices to rise to an average $90 a barrel next year, before
increasing to $110 in 2011, as strong growth in emerging market economies
boosts crude demand.

 In its first major oil price outlook since June, Goldman maintained on
Thursday its earlier 2010 forecast for West Texas Intermediate futures CLc1
at $90 a barrel, citing factors such as slower-than-expected fuel demand
recovery in developed economies, which has kept global crude stocks high.

 Goldman expects oil prices to rise to $110 a barrel in 2011 as supplies are
drawn down amid strong demand from emerging markets. The bank did not offer an
outlook for 2011 oil prices in earlier reports this year.

 "Overall, we leave our 2010 WTI crude oil forecasts largely unchanged at an
average price of $90/bbl, but with lower prices at the start of the year and
higher prices at the end," the bank said in a report.

 U.S. crude futures fell 33 cents a barrel to trade at $76.27 as of 12:01
p.m. EST (1701 GMT).

 Goldman, which is among the most profitable commodities traders on Wall
Street, lowered its 2010 price forecast for NYMEX natural gas futures 0#NG:
to $6 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), down from a previous forecast
of $7.30. The bank expects natural gas prices to rise to $6.50/mmBtu in 2011.

 NYMEX January natural gas futures NGF0 were trading around $4.50/mmBtu on
Thursday.

 To explain the downward revision for 2010 natural gas prices, Goldman cited
higher-than-expected production of unconventional gas that has lifted supplies
in spite of recently flagging investment in drilling.

 Goldman also raised its forecast for metals prices, including copper and
gold [ID:nGEE5B225X], and sees grain and oilseed prices trending higher.

&lt;p&gt;Investments in supply chain to enable transition to 100 percent HFC-free
equipment by 2015
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Days before the United Nations summit on climate change begins in Copenhagen,
The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners today announced that 100 percent
of their new vending machines and coolers will be hydrofluorocarbon-free
(HFC-free) by 2015. Coca-Cola is committing to use its scale to aggregate demand
and encourage supply as a means of accelerating the transition to HFC-free
refrigeration equipment. This announcement is a direct result of work with
Greenpeace that began in 2000, and a demonstration that phasing out the use of
HFCs is a tangible and near-term action corporations can take to protect the
climate. 

The transition to HFC-free refrigeration will reduce the equipment`s direct
greenhouse gas emissions by 99 percent. A recent peer-reviewed report by top
scientists shows that HFCs will be responsible for between 28 percent and 45
percent of carbon-equivalent emissions by 2050 if society reduces carbon dioxide
while leaving HFCs unchecked. Eliminating HFCs in the commercial refrigeration
industry would be equivalent to eliminating the annual greenhouse gas emissions
of Germany or Japan. 

"Climate change is real and the time to act on solutions is now," said Muhtar
Kent, Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. "Greenpeace has played a
critical role in raising our awareness about the need for natural refrigeration.
Our announcement today demonstrates a commitment to use our influence in the
marketplace to drive innovation and help shape a low-carbon future." 

This step by Coca-Cola will help accelerate a market shift in commercial
refrigeration away from HFCs. The Coca-Cola Company has invested more than $50
million in research and development to advance the use of climate-friendly
cooling technologies. In 2010, The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners
will purchase a minimum of 150,000 units of HFC-free equipment, effectively
doubling the current rate of purchase to enable alignment with an interim goal
to purchase 50 percent of all new coolers and vending machines without HFCs by
2012. 

The Company and its bottling partners have approximately 10 million coolers and
vending machines in place today around the world, comprising the largest element
of the Coca-Cola system`s total climate impact. As a result of the commitment to
eliminate the use of HFCs in this equipment, carbon emission reductions will
exceed 52.5 million metric tons over the life of the equipment - the equivalent
of taking more than 11 million cars off the road for one year. 

"We welcome Coca-Cola`s commitment to help tackle climate change; large
enterprises have both an opportunity and responsibility to change the game and
Coca-Cola`s action leaves no excuse for other companies not to follow," said
Kumi Naidoo, Executive Director, Greenpeace International. 

Coca-Cola currently utilizes two HFC-free solutions. Hydrocarbon refrigeration
is used in smaller refrigeration equipment and carbon dioxide (CO2) is used in
larger equipment. CO2 is a safe, reliable and energy efficient alternative with
positive characteristics as a refrigerant. It does not deplete the ozone layer
and it is 1,430 times less damaging to the climate than a typical HFC. 

Already, as a direct result of Coca-Cola`s supply chain engagement, a major
supplier has communicated its intention to build a dedicated CO2 compressor
production facility, helping to meet the growing demand for HFC-free
refrigeration options throughout the industry. 

"Addressing climate change requires leadership and collaboration," said Dr.
Rajendra Pachauri, Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
"Just days away from the negotiations in Copenhagen, this announcement by
Coca-Cola and Greenpeace demonstrates that investments in low-carbon
technologies can make business sense." 

This announcement is a direct result of discussions with Greenpeace that began
in the run-up to the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Greenpeace challenged Coca-Cola to go
HFC-free in all of the equipment it supplied to the Games. By the Torino Games
in 2006 and the Beijing Games in 2008, the Company was using all HFC-free
technology at Olympic venues. For the past five years, the relationship between
Greenpeace and Coca-Cola has become increasingly cooperative as both sought a
cost-effective alternative to HFCs. 

"At Coca-Cola, we are deploying our scale and working with suppliers to deliver
cost effective alternatives to HFC, for us and for others," said Rick Frazier,
Vice President, Supply Chain, The Coca-Cola Company. 

"Greenpeace increasingly works with businesses to make fundamental manufacturing
and sourcing changes by connecting regulation, economies of scale and supply
chain security," said Amy Larkin, Director of Greenpeace Solutions. "Coca-Cola`s
commitment today runs ahead of regulation and takes some fear out of rapid
change." 

Coolers and vending machines impact the climate in three ways: through direct
energy use (operating the machine), through chemicals used in the machine's
insulation foam, and by leakage or improper end-of-life disposal of the
refrigerant gas used in the cooling system. In addition to its refrigerant gas
commitment, Coca-Cola developed a proprietary energy management system (EMS)
that delivers energy savings of up to 35 percent and has placed over 1.7 million
of these units around the world. In 2006, the Company completed the transition
to HFC-free insulation foam for all new purchases of refrigeration equipment.
Together, HFC-free insulation and HFC-free refrigerant will generate 99 percent
fewer direct greenhouse emissions than traditional equipment.

for this announcement. Kumi Naidoo took over from Dr. Leipold on November 15,
2009. Dr. Leipold should be referred to as former Greenpeace International
Executive Director. 

3. HFC`s were invented to replace the ozone-depleting chemicals, CFCs, but have
a very high global warming impact. Scientists have projected that we need to cap
greenhouse gas emissions within the next decade, then rapidly reduce emissions
by mid century to stabilize the atmosphere and avoid dangerous climate change.
Uncontrolled HFC consumption and emissions growth would make it much more
difficult to reach those goals. Yet alternatives for virtually every application
of HFC exist today. 

4. Natural refrigerants, as the name suggests, are refrigerants that occur in
nature that can be used in refrigerators and air-conditioners. They don`t
significantly harm the ozone layer or the climate, they are often cheaper and
more energy efficient than their fluorinated-gas (F-gas) counterparts, and they
have been proven to work in virtually all applications. The three main natural
refrigerants in use are hydrocarbons, ammonia and carbon dioxide.

In the early 1990s, Greenpeace set out to find climate-friendly alternative
technologies, convinced that there was a way to avoid the HFC route proposed by
the chemical industry. The result was the creation of GreenFreeze technology (3)
which is now used in over 350 million domestic refrigerators worldwide.
Greenpeace open-sourced the GreenFreeze technology, that uses hydrocarbons. The
organisation then marketed, gathered orders, and pre-sold 70,000 refrigeration
units (in three weeks) for an East German manufacturer in order to make the
retooling of its factory worthwhile. Since March 15, 1993, when the first
GreenFreeze refrigerator rolled off the assembly line, 350 million units have
been sold in Europe, Russia, Asia and South America by leading brands including
Whirlpool, Bosch, Panasonic, LG, Miele, Electrolux, and Siemens. Greenpeace`s
achievement was recognized by the United Nations Environment Program in 1997,
when GreenFreeze received the prestigious UNEP Ozone Award. Greenpeace has
received no financial remuneration or royalty for developing the product. 

6. To maintain absolute independence, Greenpeace does not accept money from
companies, governments or political parties. The organization depends on the
donations of its supporters to carry on its nonviolent campaigns to protect the
environment.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Shares of Shoretel (SHOR.O) rose nearly 11 percent after JP Morgan upgraded the internet telephony service provider to "overweight" from "underweight" citing potential share gains in a stabilizing enterprise IP voice market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brokerage, which set a price target of $8 on the stock, projects the enterprise IP telephony market to grow 3 percent in calendar year 2010 to $6.2 billion following a 25 percent decline in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view employment levels as the key underlying driver of phone system demand," analyst Steven O'Brien wrote in a note. Declining initial jobless claims is a positive indicator for a turnaround in demand, O'Brien said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT managers, who were delaying upgrades to preserve capital, are increasingly seeing the potential for ongoing operating expenses savings as worth the initial investment, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Brien said the bankruptcy of Canada's Nortel further enchances the potential for market share gains as vendors such as Shoretel try to attract some Nortel's of existing customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoretel shares were trading up 6.3 percent at $5.91 Thursday on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mansi Dutta in Bangalore; Editing by Vikram S Subhedar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 3 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) maintained on Thursday its previous $90-a-barrel
2010 price forecast for West Texas Intermediate crude futures,
but predicted the NYMEX crude futures would rise to $110 a
barrel in 2011, on rising demand from emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a research report, Goldman Sachs lowered its 2010 price
forecast for NYMEX natural gas futures to $6 per million
British Thermal Units (MMBTU), down from a previous forecast of
$7.30. The bank expects natural gas prices to rise to
$6.50/MMBTU in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Overall, we leave our 2010 WTI crude oil forecasts largely
unchanged at an average price of $90/bbl, but with lower prices
at the start of the year and higher prices at the end," the
bank said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Reporting by Matthew Robinson and Joshua Schneyer.)

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said on Thursday it
had revised up its forecasts for copper for 2010 because of a
tighter supply picture and that it expects low U.S. interest
rates to support gold this year and next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Specifically, given the anticipated strong pick-up in the
global economy in the first half of 2010 and correspondingly
more buoyant investor sentiment, we expect base metals to
make new highs by the middle of next year," it said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, as we also expect U.S. inflation to remain
subdued, we expect gold prices to come under significant
downward pressure once the US economic recovery strengthens and
the US Federal Reserve begins to raise interest rates."

&lt;p&gt; * Greek banks worst performers on DJ Euro Stoxx Bank index&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Traders cite Goldman Sachs report, profit-taking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds Goldman quote, shares, detail)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ATHENS, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Greek bank stocks .FTATBNK shed
as much as 4.6 percent in late Athens trading on Thursday, with
some traders citing a Goldman Sachs report forecasting a
difficult couple of years for the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The main reason behind the drop is the Goldman Sachs
report, which voices concern over the profitability growth rate
of Greek banks for 2010 and 2011," said Takis Zamanis,
Athens-based trader at Beta Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs said in a report that Greek lenders would face
headwinds because lending volumes would slow and their funding
would become more expensive after the ECB unwinds its current
liquidity support measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The outlook for Greek banks is challenging," Goldman Sachs
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greece's four biggest lenders, National (NBGr.AT), EFG
Eurobank EFGr.AT, Alpha (ACBr.AT) and Piraeus (BOPr.AT) topped
losers on the DJ Euro Stoxx Bank Index .SX7E at 1437 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Piraeus, the country's No.4 lender, was down 6.7 percent at
10.08 euros. Goldman Sachs cut its price target for the bank to
8.10 euros from 9.20 euros, maintaining its "sell"
recommendation on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other analysts cited profit-taking as the drop's reason.
Greek bank shares have been volatile since last week as concerns
over their liquidity and a massive fallout from Dubai's debt
problems spiked, and then ebbed.

&lt;p&gt;JACKSONVILLE, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
DynamicsWorld.co.uk recently listed RF-SMART Enterprise Mobile Solutions as one
of their "Top 12 Add-ons" to Microsoft Dynamic AX, one of Microsoft`s flagship
enterprise software (ERP) solutions. 

DynamicsWorld.co.uk editors developed the top add-ons list to help end users,
consultants and Dynamics AX channel resellers identify solutions that are proven
in the Dynamics community. The objective is to help them weed through the
clutter of solutions in the market and make discerning business decisions that
minimize product risk. 

The DynamicsWorld.co.uk organization worked with a pool of more than 500 experts
in developing the Top 12 list and other lists helpful for Dynamics customers and
partners. The top criteria they used for selecting solutions for the Top 12 list
were: 

1.Proven integration with little to no technology footprint within Microsoft
Dynamics AX

2.Real client experience that contributes to the product`s maturity, which is
"invaluable in the delivery of the add-on"

3.Measurable, well-defined ROI benefits

4.Supplements Microsoft Dynamics AX functionality

"We are honored to be listed as a Top 12 Microsoft Dynamics AX add-on solution
by professionals who routinely help companies take full advantage of their
Microsoft Dynamics investments," said Adrian Thomas, President and CEO of ICS,
the developer of RF-SMART. 

RF-SMART remains the only RF data collection solution to achieve Certified for
Microsoft Dynamics (CfMD) status. Solutions that are Certified for Microsoft
Dynamics AX demonstrate development quality and compatibility with Microsoft
Dynamics AX and are successfully in use by customers who publicly recommend the
product. 

The CfMD designation provides companies a reliable decision criterion. According
to Ben Hancock, IT Director for Britax Australia: "It was vital that the
integration between the RF solution and our ERP was fully certified by
Microsoft." 

"We found RF-SMART to fill our needs on three points," said Sam Rubin, Senior
Operations Manager, Thorlabs. "One, RF-SMART has a small, less intrusive
footprint into Microsoft Dynamics AX. Two, it is a product fully maintained by
RF-SMART`s developers and RF-SMART support. And, three RF-SMART allows maximum
use of the Microsoft Dynamics AX built-in warehouse features we already owned." 

Supplemental functionality that RF-SMART adds to Microsoft Dynamics AX includes
Carton Packing and Pallet Shipping. Using these value-added functions and
RF-SMART standard functionality, RF-SMART customers achieve measurable ROI in
inventory and picking accuracy, and productivity.

has struck its first deal to purchase liquefied natural gas,
agreeing to buy 2 million tonnes per year for 20 years from
ExxonMobil's (XOM.N) Papua New Guinea project, Sinopec Group
said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gas will go to a planned LNG terminal at Qingdao in
Shandong province, which will have an annual capacity of 3
million tonnes in its first phase, rising to 5-6 million tonnes
a year in a later second phase, the state-owned parent company,
Sinopec Group, said on its website www.sinopecgroup.com.cn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  It did not give a detailed agenda for the start-up of the
Qingdao LNG terminal or say when the sales would begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sinopec has planned the Qingdao terminal for several years
but it had made little progress as it has not been able to
secure LNG supplies, lagging behind rivals CNOOC (0883.HK) and
PetroChina (0857.HK), which already have three and two
terminals respectively, at various states of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sinopec also plans to build a terminal in the southern city
of Zhuhai but has yet to get a green light from the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China is struggling to supply enough gas and suffered
widespread shortages after unexpectedly heavy snows across the
country last month. The shortages prompted the energy companies
to cut supplies to industrial customers to ensure there was
enough to cover residential needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China is pushing gas as a relatively clean fuel which will
cause less pollution than coal. As well as building LNG
terminals, it is rushing to increase its own supplies and plans
to import gas via pipelines from Russia, Myanmar and
Turkmenistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a factbox about China's LNG import deals, please click

the beginning of November. [ID:nSYD537366]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil holds 41.5 percent of the shares in the LNG
venture, while Australia's Oil Search Ltd (OSH.AX) and Santos
Ltd (STO.AX) have 34 percent and 17.7 percent stakes
respectively. Nippon Oil Corp 5001.T and PNG landowners hold
the remaining shares.

&lt;p&gt;By 12:43 p.m. (0713 GMT/2:13 a.m. EST), the share was trading up 6.9 percent at 97.50 rupees after hitting 100, with 7.9 million shares traded, the most on the Bombay Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan set a price target of 140 rupees by June next year and said in a note on Wednesday the stock's sharp price underperformance in the last three months had made risk reward favorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sharp control on costs and pro-active head count reduction continue to reinforce our belief that Satyam can achieve margins in line with its peer group over the next 12-18 months," analysts Manoj Singla and Nishit Jasani said in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They forecast revenues to grow 18 percent and 19 percent in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 respectively, after a 36 percent decline in fiscal year 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahindra Satyam, earlier known as Satyam Computer Services, was acquired by Tech Mahindra (TEML.BO) in April after the company was hammered by India's biggest corporate fraud, which came to light in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ami Shah; Editing by Ranjit Gangadharan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is taking aim at one of Google's most popular services, Google Maps, with a richer version of its own online mapping service that was released in beta on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Bing Maps uses Microsoft's Silverlight multimedia technology to provide a smoother way to zoom in and out of cityscapes that appear as 3D-like images. The beta service also includes Microsoft's answer to Google Street View, which it calls Streetside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing Maps is also getting an Application Gallery for layering data on top of maps. One of the first is a Twitter application that uses the geolocation data recently added to Twitter, so that tweets can be displayed over a map in the locations they were sent from. That might help people get real-time updates on a local news event, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another application, Local Lens, indexes local blogs using clues from what is written in the posts, and tries to layer them over the map in the appropriate location as well. Most of the applications today are from Microsoft, but it wants third-party developers to create more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are a few of the enhancements to Bing that Microsoft unveiled to reporters in San Francisco on Wednesday. Others included updates to its core search service, such as "task pages" that list information designed to help people complete what they set out to do with their Bing search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updates continue Microsoft's efforts to attract more users to Bing, which it launched in June and has been marketing heavily ever since. Microsoft has increased its share of the search market from 8 percent to 9.9 percent since Bing's launch, according to figures from ComScore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are encouraging for Microsoft but it still has a lot of work to do, said Satya Nadella, the senior vice president for Microsoft's online services division. Google retains a commanding lead, with 65 percent of the search market, while Yahoo's share has declined slightly to 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no confusion where we still stand," Nadella said. "We have a long road ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bing Maps beta requires users to download Microsoft's free Silverlight plug-in. The existing version, which uses AJAX (asynchronous Javascript and XML), is still available, but Microsoft will focus its efforts on the Silverlight version moving forward, Nadella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is betting that people want help completing tasks, like buying a concert ticket or checking the status of a flight, rather than just being presented with links to information, he said. It's a direction Google and Yahoo have been taking as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are using search engines for increasingly complex tasks, Nadella said. Search queries nowadays tend to involve three words rather than two, and more than half of search sessions last longer than 30 minutes, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the most interesting insight we've been digging into over the last couple of years, and it led to the feature innovations in Bing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Task pages, and a related feature called entity cards, are examples of this. They have been part of Bing for a little while already, but are being expanded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entity cards exist for places, people and things. When a user searches for Miami, for example, the entity card at the top of the results page groups together information such as a slide show of the city, a weather report and a link to the city's official Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below that are links to the task pages, which show information about local events and neighborhoods. Bing will generate task pages specific to each city, according to Nadella, so a search for Atlanta will include a task page for checking flight times, because Atlanta is a major airline hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is creating more entity cards for brands and large stores, which will display things such as customer service phone numbers. It is also making one for each of the top U.S. universities, to show data about tuition fees and admissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entity cards rely on some human editing at Microsoft, which will affect how far and how quickly it can scale them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also developing a tool that pulls in data from a person's Facebook account, allowing them to view their friends as a page of images within Bing, with status updates and information about upcoming birthdays and the like. There's a similar tool in the works for tracking Twitter users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update to Bing Maps service was probably the most significant development, however. Microsoft has loaded a whopping 300 terabytes of images and other data into the maps application in just the past few months, according to Blaise Aguera y Arcas, a Microsoft partner architect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who download Silverlight can zoom in from a satellite view to a city-level view and finally to Streetside in a way that looks much smoother than in the previous Bing Maps. It uses Microsoft's Photosynth software, which stitches photographs together to create a fairly realistic 3D landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streetside covers the largest 100 or so cities in the U.S. today, so Microsoft has some work to do catching up with Google Street View, which is already available for many of the largest cities worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says it has 83.3 million unique users for Bing, up 16 percent from when it launched five months ago. The fastest-growing demographic for Microsoft is younger people, aged 18-34, who tend to do the most searching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have definitely been able to get connected with a new kind of user that traditionally was not using us," Nadella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was asked to comment on reports that Microsoft has been trying to reach a deal that involves paying for exclusive content from News Corp., as a way of competing with Google. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wouldn't rule that out as a possibility, but said Microsoft is more focused on the quality of its search results. "I'm not going to speculate on any speculation," Nadella said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo have finalized the terms of a broad search and advertising agreement intended to help them compete more effectively with Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies announced the agreement, in which Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine would power Yahoo&#8217;s search results and Yahoo would provide premium search-advertising services for both companies, in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had hoped to finalize the deal in late October but needed more time to work out the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Friday, the companies said they hope that the transaction will close in early 2010 and that they welcome the broad support the deal has gotten from key players in the advertising industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, four ad executives and the president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice in support of the agreement. The DOJ is still reviewing the deal for possible antitrust concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement was nearly a year-and-a-half in the making, during which time Yahoo rejected acquisition offers from Microsoft. The stated goal of the arrangement is to offer stronger search competition to Google, which has about 70 percent market share. Combined, Microsoft and Yahoo make up most of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has published the Microsoft Security Bulletin Advance Notification for December 2009. According to the notice, Microsoft will release a total of six new security bulletins next Tuesday for the final Patch Tuesday of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the upside for Microsoft, that will bring the total for the year to 74 security bulletins--four fewer than the 78 security bulletins released in 2008. Of course, some patches correct multiple flaws and vulnerabilities, so the number of security bulletins is not an exact measure of the number of vulnerabilities patched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's take a quick look at what to expect from Microsoft next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critical Updates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three security bulletins rated as Critical, and three rated as Important. The Critical security bulletins affect Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, and Internet Explorer, while the Important security bulletins impact only Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five of the security issues could potentially be exploited to allow remote execution of malicious code. Translated, that means the attacker could take control of the vulnerable PC over the Internet and install additional malicious software and tools. Several will require that the PC be rebooted to complete the installation of the applicable updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One security bulletin, rated as Important, affects Microsoft Office, including older versions such as Office XP and Office 2003. This security bulletin also impacts Microsoft Works 8.5 and the Office Converter Pack, which provides some backward file-viewing compatibility with the older Office 97 suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 In the Clear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that Windows 7 is not affected by any of the six security bulletins. The security bulletin that addresses the Internet Explorer 8 zero-day flaw discovered after last month's Patch Tuesday has a peripheral impact on Windows 7, but the operating system itself is not targeted by any of the upcoming patches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent KSOD (this is the acronym adopted for the "black screen of death" issue because BSOD is already part of the technology lexicon as "blue screen of death") issue hyped by Prevx is not addressed by any of the security bulletins. Microsoft is still investigating the root cause of the issue and may release a patch at a later date if it determines that the problem is a flaw in the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next week will wrap up 2009 for the Microsoft security bulletins--barring any out-of-band updates that are sometime released on an emergency basis when a vulnerability is having a pervasive and immediate impact. It will be interesting to see what 2010 has in store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 is the most secure desktop operating system Microsoft has yet developed. With Windows 7 assuming the throne as the de facto flagship desktop operating system, it will be interesting to see what impact that will have on security in general and what sort of new methods attackers will come up with to try and circumvent the controls in Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have Automatic Updates turned on in Windows, make sure you check Windows Update next Tuesday to download and install the patches and updates appropriate for your PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bradley tweets as @PCSecurityNews, and can be contacted at his Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/183743&lt;/p&gt;

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) today announced
that the companies are planning to submit an application for regulatory approval
of apixaban in Europe for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after
orthopedic surgery in the first half of 2010. The application will be supported
by ADVANCE-2 and ADVANCE-3, two clinical trials that evaluated apixaban versus
the European dosing regimen of enoxaparin for prevention of VTE in patients
undergoing orthopedic surgery. Results of ADVANCE-2 were first presented in July
2009 at the 22nd Congress of the International Society on Thrombosis and
Haemostasis in Boston. The ADVANCE-3 data will be submitted for publication and
presentation in 2010. 

Apixaban is a novel, oral, highly selective Factor Xa inhibitor, a new class of
agents being studied for the potential to prevent and treat blood clots in the
veins and arteries.

&lt;p&gt; * Financing guru comes to fore amid recession dealmaking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Credited with inventing loan syndication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Called focused, driven, but polarizing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Elinor Comlay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
veteran rainmaker James Lee this week cemented his status as a
go-to man, particularly for complex deals at a time of
lingering recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the banker behind Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) acquisition
of NBC Universal from General Electric Co. (GE.N), Lee, 57,
managed to shepherd through delicate negotiations that nearly
collapsed several times along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee, widely credited with inventing the major loan
risk-sharing business known as syndication, has a head for
pulling off tricky financing. At JPMorgan, he also has the
backing of the second-largest balance sheet on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Comcast deal culminated negotiations that began months
ago, involved difficult talks with Vivendi SA (VIV.PA) over its
stake in NBC Universal, a complicated joint venture structure
and provisions allowing GE to exit over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee and JPMorgan also worked on GMAC's restructuring of
mortgage firm ResCap and satellite radio company Sirius'
acquisition of rival XM Satellite Radio in 2008. Before that,
Lee was behind News Corp's purchase of Dow Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is not somebody that clients turn to to get just an
MA transaction done, they turn to him to put the financing
package together to get it done," said a former investment
banker who worked for a rival firm and asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beyond Lee's credit smarts and a tenacious dedication to
completing deals -- a 2000 Forbes article said he would talk on
two cell phones at once and carry spare batteries to prevent
getting cut off -- he has the advantage of working at
JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end of September, the bank topped rankings for debt
and equity underwriting and, scored the most in fees worldwide
MA, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, which acquired investment bank Bear Stearns Cos
and the assets of failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual
during the financial crisis, is seen as one of the strongest
survivors of the last two years' carnage on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan is a shortlist lender in every major deal now ...
it's a great setup for him in an environment like this," said
the former investment banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan declined comment and Lee was not available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POLARIZING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along with his reputation for being a savvy and persistent
negotiator, Lee is seen by some as brash and even abrasive. He
is something of a polarizing character -- but perhaps that is
inevitable in someone who has survived more than three decades
on Wall Street, starting with Chemical Bank, a predecessor of
JPMorgan Chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former employees and clients have praised his loyalty to
them, as well as his drive to complete deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When Jimmy gives his word, the deal is done," said Robert
Tillis, CEO of Inner Circle Sports, a merchant bank in New York
focused on the sports industry, who worked for Lee for 10 years
and who described him as focused, driven and "affable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not everyone is such a fan, however. One banker, who asked
not to be identified, said Lee leaves many feeling
intimidated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He's a master of the universe, a 'Bonfire of the Vanities'
kind of guy," the banker said of Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee's contacts, experience and the backing of JPMorgan,
inevitably put him in a position of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For several decades, he's known how to get a deal done ...
He's in the right job," said the former investment banker.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Hibbett Sports (Nasdaq: HIBB) as the Bull of
the Day and Smith International (NYSE: SII) the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on CVS Caremark Corp. (NYSE: CVS),
Energizer Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ENR) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We are changing our recommendation on Hibbett Sports (Nasdaq: HIBB) from Neutral
to Outperform as we anticipate it to perform well above the market. Hibbett's
sharp focus towards midsized and smaller markets and strategic mix of branded as
well as localized merchandise provide an edge over rivals in a highly
competitive specialty retail industry. 

Hibbett's management is also committed towards expanding the store network and
keeping a strict control over expenses, which drove performance during the third
quarter of fiscal 2010. Moreover, the company's debt-free balance sheet and full
availability under credit facilities bode well for future operating performance.


However, macroeconomic headwinds may continue to affect the U.S. discretionary
spending environment and limit the above-market performance of the company. 

Bear of the Day: 

Smith International (NYSE: SII) reported weaker-than-expected third quarter
results, weighed down by a challenging North American natural gas market that
contributed to continued pricing pressure within the domestic operations of the
Distribution and Oilfield segments. 

We believe that Smith will continue to struggle to leverage its international
expansion to cross-sell its acquired W-H Energy product lines (mostly
unconventional gas drilling). The W-H Energy acquisition has exhibited a
materially different strategic outlook that has burdened returns in the interim
for the prospects of growth. 

Additionally, we expect margins to remain under pressure in the coming quarters,
given an eroding pricing power. Our six-month target price is $23 per share. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Energizer in Trouble?

According a recent news report, CVS Caremark Corp. (NYSE: CVS) said that it will
stop selling Energizer Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ENR) alkaline batteries at its
stores from 2010. The report also said that CVS will sell Procter &amp; Gamble`s
(NYSE: PG) Duracell alkaline batteries instead. However, the company will
continue sell Energizer`s lithium batteries in all of its stores until the end
of this year. 

The consumer products industry is highly competitive with Procter &amp; Gamble as a
formidable competitor in the battery (Duracell), blade (Gillette) and feminine
products categories. Energizer batteries lag behind Duracell batteries in market
share in the U.S. -- 41.6%, followed by Energizer's 27.8%. This is according to
Information Resources Inc., a Chicago-based market research firm. 

Energizer`s competitors have significantly larger financial resources. We expect
mass retailers to pressure prices, both through negotiations and shift to larger
pack sizes, which carry lower margins. 

Therefore, Energizer Holdings must constantly develop, introduce and promote new
products. As a result, advertising and marketing expenditures have almost
doubled in 2008, which may pressure margins.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Exxon: Upstream Growth Continues

ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) on Tuesday said it has found hydrocarbons
while drilling on the Dabakan-1 well in Service Contract 56 in the Sulu Sea off
southern Philippines. 

The data captured by Exxon stated that the company encountered reservoir sands
and hydrocarbons at the time of drilling the well. The company expects the well
to be drilled further to a total depth of approximately 5,000 meters. Upon
completion, this will be the deepest well in the Philippines. Exxon plans to
drill another well in Dabakan shortly. The estimated drilling cost of each well
is $100 million. 

On the other hand, Exxon has started development drilling at the large Point
Thomson gas and condensate field, located 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.
It has spent $300 million on this project till date and expects a total
expenditure of $1.3 billion for completion. The company is on track to have the
project online in 2014. 

Exxon expects a production of 10,000 barrels per day of condensates by 2014. BP
plc (NYSE: BP), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP)
are partners with ExxonMobil in the project. 

Production from the company`s ongoing projects will play a leading role in
upstream growth, going forward. Exxon`s diversified portfolio of assets, both in
terms of businesses as well as geographic locations, helps it produce stable
results throughout the commodity price cycle. 

Ford Hikes Prices in U.K.

Ford Motor (NYSE: F) has decided to raise prices by an average of 2.7% of its
vehicles sold in the U.K. for the fourth time of the year. The decision was
backed by the continuous depreciation in the value of pound with respect to euro
(30% compared to 2007) as the automaker sources most of its component parts,
other than smaller capacity engines and Transit vans, from Europe. 

The hike, which will take effect beginning this month, will raise prices between
&#163;250 ($412) and &#163;500 ($82) for popular models such as the Ka, Fiesta, Focus,
C-MAX, Kuga and Mondeo and to &#163;600 ($990) for S-MAX and Galaxy. 

In October, Ford showed its best monthly performance in more than a decade by
posting a staggering 12.8% rise in sales in its 19 European markets. With this,
the automaker also outperformed the 6.8% gain in sales for the overall industry.

&lt;p&gt; * Pulling brands from stations in several states&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Undertaking worldwide restructuring of marketing arm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Dec 4 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said
on Friday it had decided to stop supplying 1,100 independently
owned filling stations in the eastern United States as part of
its a review of its global downstream operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stations in Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, North
Carolina, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, D.C., and parts
of Tennessee would stop carrying the Chevron and Texaco brands
by the middle of 2010. Those stations account for 8 percent of
U.S. sales volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for San Ramon, California-based Chevron, which
bought Texaco in 2001, said the review took into account
Chevron's market share in those states as well as proximity to
its nearest major refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fuel markets in these states are well served and
should not be affected by our withdrawal," the second-largest
U.S. oil company said in an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron will continue supplying more than 5,000 stations in
the eastern United States under the two brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pullout follows Chevron's exit this year from marketing
operations in Brazil and a handful of countries in Africa in an
effort to save $300 million.

&lt;p&gt;Says Private Interests of One Company Should Not Trump U.S. Policy
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The Los Angeles Times editorial page has blasted Chevron by urging Congress to
ignore the company`s multi-million dollar lobbying campaign to deny trade
preferences for Ecuador in retaliation for the $27 billion oil contamination
lawsuit brought by Amazon communities. 

"If &#8230; Chevron has its way, Congress will instead punish Ecuador because its
government refuses to halt a private lawsuit against the oil giant&#8230;. to force a
favorable outcome in a private claim would justly generate international
outrage," wrote the Los Angeles Times, the largest newspaper in Chevron`s home
state of California, in Thursday`s editions. 

"Halting the trade agreement at Chevron's behest would harm broader U.S.
interests," the paper opined. "&#8230;.Ecuador has demonstrated a willingness to work
with the U.S. That should be the test for an extension of trade benefits, not
the private interests of one corporation." 

Chevron has hired numerous high-level lobbyists in Washington to try to persuade
the Congress to cancel the preferences, which Ecuador`s government says produce
350,000 jobs. The lawsuit, which in 2002 was moved to Ecuador from U.S. federal
court at Chevron`s request, includes a damages assessment of $27.3 billion. 

The suit accuses Chevron of poisoning an area of the Amazon the size of Rhode
Island, decimating indigenous groups and leading to an outbreak of cancers and
other diseases that have cost thousands of lives. Texaco, bought by Chevron in
2001, operated a large oil concession in the area from 1964 to 1990. 

The editorial argued that ending the trade preferences for Ecuador would "throw
farmers out of legitimate business ventures and into the arms of cocaine
traffickers" and would create "needless ill will in a region where President
Obama has promised to end North American bullying and begin a new era of
rapprochement." 

Previous attempts by Chevron to lobby the U.S. government over the lawsuit have
been rebuffed by officials in both the Bush and Obama Administrations. Just last
year, four Senators signed a letter to the United States Trade Representative
urging the government to reject Chevron`s arguments and extend the preferences,
which happened. 

The trade agreement allows reduced-duty or duty-free exports to the U.S. of
goods such as clothing, tuna and cut flowers. It has created more than 130,000
jobs in Ecuador and an estimated 37,400 in the U.S., according to the editorial.


A final judgment in the legal case is expected in 2010.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Bing site was offline Thursday night. Relatively speaking, the outage didn't last very long, but any outage is a bad outage when you are introducing new features and trying to win market share from a dominant competitor like Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No time is a good time for a site outage. It was particularly bad timing for Microsoft, though, considering that it just unveiled an array of changes and updates and there has been a lot of attention focused on the beta rollout of the new Bing Maps this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users were unable to use Bing from around 6:30pm to 7:00pm (give or take 10 minutes on either side) Pacific time. Initially the site was simply unresponsive or returned partial search results. Eventually Microsoft published an error page explaining that the site was unavailable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To its credit, Microsoft responded rather quickly and leveraged social networking tools like Twitter to communicate the current status with users. Satyam Nadella, Microsoft senior vice president of the online services division, wrote a blog post about the outage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella explained that "The cause of the outage was a configuration change during some internal testing that had unfortunate and unintended consequences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella also used the blog post to indicate Microsoft's commitment to ensuring issues like this don't occur again. "We strive to maintain a high standard of operational excellence at Bing. We are running a post mortem to find out how our software and processes need to be improved to prevent anything like this from happening again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has suffered a variety of outages and service interruptions, but not with the actual bread and butter Google search site. Gmail and Google News have had occasional issues and the public sentiment always seems to be a mixed response between "Google should never have outages--how can we trust Google or the cloud if Gmail goes down" and "Google is providing all of these services at no cost-what do you expect for free."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be familiar with the bumper sticker wisdom that "stuff" happens. Or, to borrow a phrase from the cult classic movie Breakfast Club "screws just fall out all the time, the world is an imperfect place." Either way, although we expect sites like Bing and Google to be online 24/7/365, sometimes things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I actually find it more comforting that it was human error or a configuration flub that took Bing down. Had the outage been the result of usage overwhelming server capacity, or from a malicious attack of some sort my faith in Bing would be more shaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not to suggest that outages resulting from human error are OK. I expect Microsoft to investigate the root cause and implement some additional change controls to ensure this sort of thing doesn't happen again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple mistake is a tidy problem that is easily addressed and has less impact on my overall opinion of the service. Human error is somehow more acceptable than not being able to survive an attack or handle traffic capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bradley tweets as @PCSecurityNews, and can be contacted at his Facebook page .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/183711&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Ecuador asks U.S. court to block Chevron arbitration

 * Part of 16-year-old environmental damage dispute

 NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The government of Ecuador has
asked a U.S. judge to stop Chevron Corp (CVX.N) from pursuing
an international arbitration claim in response to allegations
of environmental pollution in Ecuador.

 The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court in New York
on Thursday, follows a Sept. 23 arbitration claim by the
second-largest U.S. oil company, Chevron, which opened a new
front in its defense of a $27 billion lawsuit over accusations
of Amazon rain forest and river pollution. [ID:nN23418073]

 Chevron has complained of government interference in the
16-year-old case, in which indigenous communities have accused
Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, of damaging the environment
and their health while operating petroleum facilities in the
region.

 The new court papers said Ecuador is entitled to an order
and judgment "preliminarily and permanently enjoining Chevron
Corp and TexPet from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute the
UNCITRAL (United Nations Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards) arbitration."

 Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said in an email statement
that the company believed Ecuador was trying to evade
contractual obligations.

 "The government of Ecuador is simply seeking to delay the
arbitration and avoid ever having to own up for its abrogation
of the rule of law and violation of its treaty obligations to
the United States," the statement said.

 Chevron had cited violations by Ecuador under the
U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. The company claims
Ecuador breached the treaty by not forcing an Ecuadorean court
to dismiss the environmental lawsuit. The suit alleges that
Texaco caused the pollution.

 The new case is Republic of Ecuador v Chevron Corp and
Texaco Petroleum Company, U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York, No. 09-9958.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has revamped the browser ballot screen demanded by European Union antitrust regulators and may get final approval as early as Dec. 15, a source familiar with the case told Computerworld today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As first reported Thursday by the Bloomberg news service , Microsoft modified the ballot screen after rivals, including Opera Software and Mozilla, demanded changes. Last month, Opera, Mozilla and Google, which make the Opera, Firefox and Chrome browsers, respectively, submitted change requests to the European Commission, asking that the order of the browsers be randomized and that the ballot be displayed in its own application, not in Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU's antitrust case, which kicked off last January, had been sparked by complaints filed by Opera in December 2007 , when the Norwegian browser maker accused Microsoft of shielding IE from real competition by bundling it with Windows. To level the playing field, the commission wants Microsoft to let consumers decide which browser they use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Microsoft had tweaked the ballot to gain the commission's preliminary approval in October. Microsoft first agreed to the ballot approach last July as a way to resolve the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the source, who asked not to be identified because the terms of the settlement have not been officially approved, the top five browsers -- IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Apple's Safari -- will appear in random order each time the ballot is displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla had been the most vocal about how the ballot would display choices. Last month, for example, Jenny Boriss, a Firefox user experience designer, denigrated the ballot's layout and said that it gave IE more than three times the space than rivals' browsers because the ballot would be displayed within Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hakon Wium Lie, Opera's chief technology officer, agreed with Mozilla that randomizing the browsers on the ballot would be a better solution than Microsoft's original idea, which was to list them alphabetically by maker, a move that would put Apple's Safari in the preferred left-hand position. "Alphabetizing would just lead to opportunistic naming," Lie said in early November. "We could call ourselves AAA Browser Maker and get the first spot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lie also supported other changes, including removing the ballot from the framework of IE -- Microsoft's proposal would craft an HTML page to display the ballot, which would then appear inside its own browser -- and assurances that Microsoft would disable any security warning when people picked a browser to download and install. "The general security warning that you get prior to a binary download should not appear," Lie said last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear what other changes, if any, have been made to the ballot as proposed in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal may be finalized as early as Dec. 15, when EU commissioners meet to vote on a number of issues, the source told Computerworld . If the date is accurate, Microsoft would begin pushing the ballot to European users of Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 in mid-February. The company's must release the ballot via Windows Update eight weeks after officials sign off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ballot screen is approved and then delivered to PCs, users will be offered a choice of browsers only if they have set IE as the default Web application. New PCs sold in the EU will also include the ballot screen, which will appear the first time the owner tries to go on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ballot was not Microsoft's first choice. Last June, the company said it would ship Windows 7, then still in development, to European customers minus a browser , and leave it up to computer manufacturers, or OEMs, to decide which browser, if any, they installed. In August, Microsoft abandoned the idea , claiming it faced resistance from OEMs and corporate customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla and Opera declined to comment on the reports of changes and an impending agreement. Google spokesman William Echikson said in an e-mail today that his company believes "more competition in the browser space will mean greater innovation on the Web and a better user experience for people everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, Microsoft still controls a majority of the browser market , although its share has tumbled in the last several years. IE accounted for 63.6% of all browsers online in November, according to U.S.-based Net Applications, while Firefox had 24.7%, Safari 4.4%, Chrome 3.9% and Opera 2.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irish metrics firm StatCounter, however, found IE's share last month was 56.6%, while Firefox'had 32.2%, Chrome 4.7%, Safari 3.7% and Opera 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

Results from Studies in Early Breast Cancer and Advanced Disease to be Presented
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Oncology announced today that it will be presenting study findings
evaluating several compounds including those from its newly expanded breast
cancer portfolio following the recent acquisition of Wyeth, focusing on the
needs of multiple breast cancer patient populations at the CTRC-AACR San Antonio
Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) being held December 9 - 13. Presentations will
highlight results from long-term follow-up of Aromasin&#174; (exemestane tablets) in
an adjuvant switch study of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer; data
on neratinib, an investigational, orally administered, pan-ErbB inhibitor in
patients with HER2 (also known as ErbB2) positive breast cancer; as well as
findings on Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate) in metastatic breast cancer. 

"As the needs of the breast cancer community continue to evolve, we are working
diligently to develop novel treatment options to help a variety of patient
populations," said Maria Koehler MD, PhD, Vice President, Women`s Cancers
Strategy for Pfizer Oncology. "At this important meeting, we are pleased to
share research from our expanded pipeline, including neratinib and sunitinib,
which builds upon our strong heritage in breast cancer research with Aromasin." 

Pfizer will present an exploratory analysis from the updated 91-month median
follow-up data of the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES) study (Oral #12;
December 10). IES, a landmark trial with the longest follow-up of endocrine
treatment in the adjuvant switch setting, is a randomized, double-blind,
multinational trial of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. IES
evaluates the clinical benefits of switching 2,352 patients to Aromasin after
two to three years of tamoxifen versus continuing 2,372 patients on tamoxifen
for a full five years of therapy. 

Pfizer will also present data relating to the efficacy and safety of neratinib,
an orally administered, irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB-1 (EGFR), ErbB-2
(HER2) and ErbB-4 (HER4) kinases. Data presentations at the meeting include the
evaluation of the safety and efficacy of neratinib in combination with
paclitaxel in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (Poster #5081; December
12), as well as data on gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety profiles
based on a Phase 2 study of neratinib monotherapy in patients with advanced HER2
positive breast cancer (Poster #5096; December 12). 

Final results will be presented from the Phase 3 SUN 1107 trial evaluating
single-agent sunitinib versus single-agent capecitabine in patients with HER2
negative advanced breast cancer after failure of standard treatment. Earlier
this year, at the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee
(DMC), the trial was stopped after the DMC determined that sunitinib would be
unable to reach the primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival
compared to capecitabine, in the study population. 

"We are working to improve our understanding of the mechanisms and biology of
breast cancer to facilitate better matching of patients to treatments, with the
goal of increased benefits from selected therapies," added Dr. Koehler. "Whether
it is through studying the addition of new compounds into existing regimens, or
pursuing novel treatment strategies, we strive to improve outcomes for breast
cancer patients worldwide." 

In ongoing support of the breast cancer community, new data from the BRIDGE
(Bridging Gaps, Expanding Outreach - Metastatic Breast Cancer Patient) survey, a
wide-reaching assessment of the needs, experiences and attitudes of women living
with metastatic breast cancer (Poster #3085; December 12) will be presented. The
survey was expanded to include 392 additional participants from four additional
countries - Brazil, Venezuela, Canada and Australia. The survey now spans 13
countries across five continents, with a total of 1,342 respondents. 

Additional Pfizer Data Presentations

* New analyses from the TEAM (Tamoxifen, Exemestane, Adjuvant, Multicenter)
trial will also be presented at SABCS, comparing five years of exemestane as
initial therapy to tamoxifen followed by exemestane for five years: The TEAM
trial, a prospective, randomized, Phase 3 trial in postmenopausal women with
hormone-sensitive early breast cancer (Oral #11; December 10). 
* Safety and efficacy of neratinib in combination with vinorelbine in ErbB2+
metastatic breast cancer (Poster #5095; December 12) 
* Safety of neratinib in combination with capecitabine in patients with solid
tumors: a phase 1/2 study (Poster #5108; December 12)

About Aromasin (exemestane tablets)

Aromasin is the only aromatase inhibitor indicated for sequential therapy in
postmenopausal women with HR positive early breast cancer after two to three
years of tamoxifen for a total of five years of adjuvant therapy. The use of
Aromasin in this setting is supported by the landmark IES trial. Aromasin is
also indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal
women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. 

Important Aromasin (exemestane tablets) Safety Information

Aromasin should not be used in women who are premenopausal, are nursing or
pregnant, have a known hypersensitivity to the drug, or are taking
estrogen-containing agents. Dose modification is recommended for patients who
are receiving certain medications, including strong CYP 3A4 inducers. In
patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving Aromasin than
either tamoxifen or placebo. Reductions in bone mineral density over time are
seen with the use of Aromasin. 

About Sutent (sunitinib malate)

Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or
intolerance to imatinib mesylate and for advanced / metastatic renal cell
carcinoma (RCC). 

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important Sutent (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in advanced RCC and GIST clinical trials were
fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia,
abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin
discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important Sutent (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in advanced RCC and GIST clinical trials were
fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia,
abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin
discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt;Agreement Also Provides Utility a Stake in Gas Fields, Processing Plant in
Northwestern Australia
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced that its subsidiary, Chevron
Australia Pty Ltd, has signed a Heads of Agreement (HOA) with the Tokyo Electric
Power Company (TEPCO) to deliver 4.1 million tons per annum (MTPA) of liquefied
natural gas (LNG) for up to 20 years from the Wheatstone Project in northwestern
Australia. 

Under the agreement, TEPCO also intends to acquire 15 percent of Chevron`s
equity share in the Wheatstone field licenses and an 11.25 percent interest in
the Wheatstone natural gas processing facilities to be developed onshore near
Onslow in northwestern Australia. 

"We are pleased to welcome TEPCO as a foundation customer and equity partner in
the Wheatstone project as we move the development forward. This HOA further
demonstrates that Wheatstone is well positioned to deliver energy to the
Asia-Pacific region," said George Kirkland, executive vice president, Chevron
Global Upstream and Gas. 

"TEPCO is among the most experienced LNG buyers in the world. Their commitment
to secure long-term LNG supplies from Wheatstone is a strong demonstration of
their confidence in Chevron and represents another important step forward for
the project," said John Gass, president, Chevron Global Gas. 

The initial phase of the Wheatstone project will have the capacity to process
8.6 MTPA of LNG and will include a domestic gas plant. A final investment
decision is expected in 2011. 

In October, Chevron announced it had signed a binding agreement with Apache
Julimar Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the Apache Corporation, which will assume a
16.25 percent equity interest in the Wheatstone project, and KUFPEC Australia
(Julimar) Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration
Company k.s.c., which will assume a 8.75 percent interest in the project. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today that the co-venturers have
agreed to proceed with the development of the Papua New Guinea (PNG) liquefied
natural gas (LNG) project, pending completion of sales and purchase agreements
with LNG buyers and finalization of financing arrangements with lenders. 

At a ceremony at the PNG National Parliament House in Port Moresby, Peter
Graham, managing director of Esso Highlands Limited, an ExxonMobil subsidiary,
announced that pending completion of these sales and financing arrangements,
significant project activity will commence in 2010. Esso Highlands is the
operator of the project. 

"With global demand for LNG forecast to nearly triple by 2030, the PNG LNG
Project will be an important supply source to meet this future demand,
particularly for the economies in the fast growing Asia Pacific region," said
Neil Duffin, president of ExxonMobil Development Company. "The supply of
cleaner-burning natural gas will also be critical in helping reduce global
emissions. The co-venturer approval of the PNG LNG Project is a significant
milestone. We look forward to applying our world-class execution capabilities
and continuing to work together cooperatively with the PNG government to bring
this resource to production." 

PNG Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare presided over the announcement ceremony,
attended by PNG government ministers and governors. Somare said, "Project
operator ExxonMobil and our other private sector development partners have shown
significant confidence in our country. Cooperation between the public and
private sectors will create value for the Papua New Guinea society as a whole
and will grow our economy in the future." 

The PNG LNG Project is an integrated development that includes gas production
and processing facilities, onshore and offshore pipelines and liquefaction
facilities with capacity of 6.6 million tons per year. Participating interests
include affiliates of ExxonMobil (including Esso Highlands Limited as operator,
33.2 percent), Oil Search Limited (29.0 percent), Independent Public Business
Corporation (PNG Government, 16.6 percent), Santos Limited (13.5 percent),
Nippon Oil Exploration (4.7 percent), Mineral Resources Development Company (PNG
landowners, 2.8 percent) and Petromin PNG Holdings Limited (0.2 percent). 

ExxonMobil is currently participating in LNG production in Qatar and Indonesia
with a combined gross capacity of over 50 million tons per year, supplying
markets in Asia, Europe and North America. The company is also participating in
the development of LNG in Australia. Global LNG demand is expected to grow about
4 percent per year through 2030, at which time LNG is expected to meet about 15
percent of the world`s demand for natural gas. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Statements in this release relating to future plans,
expectations, events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual
results, including project plans, the impact of new technologies, and demand
growth, could differ materially due to changes in long-term oil or gas prices or

changes; actions of competitors; timely completion of development projects; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; and other factors discussed under the
heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" on the "Investors" section of our
website (www.exxonmobil.com) and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's most recent 10-K.
References to volumes of natural gas include amounts that are not yet classified
as proved reserves but that we believe will ultimately be produced.

&lt;p&gt; * Gas sale to pressure rivals to clinch deals fast
 (Adds analysts' comments, TEPCO PNG purchase, link to table of
LNG export projects)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Fayen Wong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PERTH, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) A$90
billion ($82.5 billion) sale of Wheatstone liquefied natural
gas to Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T) is set to add pressure on
rival Australian projects in their race to find customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal, which would see Japan's top utility take almost
half of Wheatstone's annual output, pushes the project up the
rankings in terms of feasibility among the long list of planned
LNG ventures in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The deal with TEPCO has put Wheatstone on the map as a
very credible competitor against other LNG projects that are
marketing their gas," said Mark Greenwood, an energy analyst at
JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And while this is fantastic for Chevron, it will no doubt
be negative for other players like Woodside (WPL.AX), Santos
(STO.AX) and Origin (ORG.AX)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Woodside Petroleum, Santos and Origin Energy all harbour
ambitious growth plans for their LNG business and are each
involved in LNG projects that are in varying degrees of
progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale would perhaps deal the strongest blow to
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Origin's planned LNG project on
Australia's east coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has not yet clinched any sales and Conoco was likely to
have been targetting TEPCO as a potential customer given their
existing relationship in the Conoco-operated Darwin LNG project
in Australia, said Greenwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Longer term, the demand will be there but we think there's
certainly a market window for operators to sign with customers,
or face delays in their projects," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Projects that are sanctioned at a later date could also see
LNG prices come under pressure and erode their profitability,
Di Brookman, an energy analyst at CLSA Asia Pacific, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a table of LNG export projects planned in the
Asia-Pacific region, click on [ID:SYD409340]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TEPCO, which consumes about 20 million tonnes of LNG a
year, has signed a deal to buy 3.1 million tonnes of LNG from
Wheatstone a year for 20 years, plus it has bought a 15 percent
equity stake in the project that could give it another 1
million tonnes. [ID:nT460706]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This marks the second supply deal TEPCO has clinched in
just a few days. The utility also finalised a purchase
agreement with ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) to buy 1.8 mtpy of LNG
from the Papua New Guinea LNG project for a period of 20 years.
[ID:nSYD429282]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ASIAN DEMAND STILL ROBUST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the global economic downturn, the recent raft of
gas deals signed by utilities across China, Japan and South
Korea are being done at near parity to oil prices, analysts
said -- a sign that buyers remain concerned about supply
uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There may be a lot of large projects in Australia but the
questions on buyers' minds will be which ones are promising to
come through and when," said John Harris, director of global
LNG at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LNG projects are costly to get off the ground, with
approved developments prone to delays and cost overruns, while
proposed ones often remain stuck on the drawing board for years
due to factors such as the inability to prove up gas reserves,
a lack of capital for costly engineering studies and
difficulties in getting all partners on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While energy firms continue to be bullish about LNG's
global long-term demand, some analysts have also cautioned that
demand from China and India are the biggest wildcards that
could threaten the commonly touted growth forecast for LNG
demand to double to 400 mtpy by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With as many as seven major Australian LNG projects aiming
to reach a final investment decision by 2011, operators also
need to secure the first-mover advantage in order to capture
the country's limited workforce, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've been hearing a lot from companies about the manpower
shortage in Australia. It is a very real issue confronting the
LNG industry and projects that come in at a later date will
risk facing much higher costs," said an energy analyst from a
major investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said it expected to sign up more customers for
Wheatstone in coming months, but would not specify what level
of production would need to be pre-sold before it would be
comfortable in granting final development approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) has said that it was interested to
buy gas from Wheatstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wheatstone gas processing plant, located in western
Australia, will have an initial output of 8.6 mtpy in the first
phase. It is scheduled for final approval in 2011 ahead of
production starting in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nikkei newspaper reported on Sunday that TEPCO will
invest more than 300 billion yen ($3.34 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Western Australian state government said on Monday the
contract is worth A$90 billion ($82.5 bln) and is the largest
Australian LNG supply agreement ever signed. Chevron declined
to comment on the value.

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon finalises gas deal with TEPCO for PNG LNG project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * TEPCO to buy 1.8 mtpy for 20 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Project to get final green light on Tuesday-govt source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PERTH, Dec 7 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm ExxonMobil Corp
(XOM.N) has finalised a gas sales contract with Japan's Tokyo
Electric Power (9501.T) for its project in Papua New Guinea,
putting the $15 billion development on track for approval on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TEPCO, Japan's largest utility, has entered a binding
agreement with project partners for the purchase of 1.8 million
tonnes per year (mtpy) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for a
period of 20 years, Exxon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The contracted volume includes the plant's recently
expanded output of 0.3 mtpy, which means all of the project's
6.6 mtpy capacity has now been contracted, project partner Oil
Search (OSH.AX) said in a separate statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and partners have not yet finalised two other gas
sale agreements with Taiwan's CPC Corp and Japan's Osaka Gas
Ltd 9532. ahead of a self-imposed deadline of Dec. 8 for the
project's final investment decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, a government official told Reuters that the
project will still be approved by project partners on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government and partners will be sanctioning the
project in an official signing ceremony on Tuesday morning,"
said a Papua New Guinea government official who requested
annoymity because he was not authorised to disclose the
information ahead of the official release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the government is set to sign off on the project's
10 development licenses and to reach a revenue sharing
agreement with landowners for the Hides gas field by Monday
evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have long considered the PNG LNG project to be a
forerunner amongst the raft of nearly 16 planned LNG projects
in the Asia-Pacific region after Exxon swiftly secured deals to
underpin its full capacity earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture includes Australia's Oil Search Ltd (OSH.AX),
Santos Ltd (STO.AX), Japan's Nippon Oil Corp 5001.T and PNG
land.

Comcast to Pay $13.75B for NBC

Comcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is expected to pay $13.75 billion in cash
and assets to gain control of NBC Universal from General Electric Company (NYSE:
GE). 

The new NBC Universal also is expected to borrow $9.1 billion, part of which
will be used to cover the $5.8 billion that GE is paying for Vivendi SA's 20%
stake in NBC Universal. That company includes the flagship NBC TV network, the
Telemundo Spanish-language network, Universal Pictures and theme parks, and
about two dozen cable channels such as Bravo and CNBC. 

GE has the option to sell half of its 49% stake in the new NBC Universal three
and a half years after the deal closes. It may sell the other half after seven
years. 

This week, GE convinced Vivendi to sell its stake in NBC Universal, and paved
the way for Comcast to buy the entertainment company. 

Comcast is pursuing the transaction because of its desire to control both
content and distribution, a strategy that hasn't been successful in the media
industry. If the deal gets approved by regulators, Comcast would oversee assets
with revenue of $51 billion in 2008, more than Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX), Walt
Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) or News Corporation (Nasdaq: NWS). 

General Electric Company operates as a technology, media, and financial services
company worldwide. GE`s NBC Universal segment engages in the production and
distribution of films and television programs, operation of television stations
and cable/satellite television networks, as well as theme parks. 

We currently have a Neutral recommendation on General Electric.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Unemployment Duration Still Rising

Long-term unemployment is a very different thing than just being out of work for
a few weeks. Short-term unemployment is more like an unscheduled vacation,
particularly if you know your old job will be coming back soon (as was the
typical pattern in earlier recessions, Ford [NYSE: F] might lay people off in a
downturn, but the UAW members knew they would be going back to the same job as
soon as auto sales picked up). That started to change in the early 1980`s
downturn, when many of the plants were shut for good. 

Partly as a result, even in good times the average length of unemployment has
been getting longer with each expansion since the 1960`s. In fact, at the peak
of the last expansion, the average length of unemployment far exceeded the worst
levels of the 1948 recession. The 1948 recession was the only previous one to
come near this one in terms of the total percentage of jobs lost to the economy.


Financially, long-term unemployment is devastating. When people are first laid
off they will cut back their spending a little bit. Some of those savings are
easy, or almost automatic. If you are no longer going to work each day, your
commuting expenses go away, you might not need to go to the dry cleaners as
often, and you no longer have lunch at a restaurant. However, other
discretionary spending is at least partially locked in, and it does not make
that much sense to pull little Jane or Jimmy out of their ballet or karate
lessons. If you are a member of a country club, you don`t resign your membership
right away. You don`t cancel HBO -- heck, you finally have some time to watch
it. 

Regular unemployment benefits provide you with some income, generally about 60%
of what you were making before you got laid off (this varies by state). This is
not enough for most people, so they start to draw down savings and run up their
credit card balances. However, the vast majority of people have very little in
the way of savings, outside of retirement accounts (IRAs and 401-Ks) and tapping
those is not an attractive option since they get hit with a tax penalty of 10%,
in addition to having to pay income tax on what they take out. 

As unemployment drags on, more and more cuts have to be made. Eventually, the
savings run out and the credit cards get maxed out. These people are then at a
huge risk of declaring bankruptcy. The big credit card companies like American
Express (NYSE: AXP) and Capital One (NYSE: COF) recognize this and have been
very busy lately either cancelling people's cards or reducing their credit
limits. From their point of view, it is much better if someone defaults on their
cards when they max out at $5,000 rather than letting them run up the balance to
$20,000 before they default. 

In the past if they were homeowners, they could tap the equity in their houses
by refinancing or taking out a second mortgage. But with so many homeowners
already underwater on their houses, or close to it, that option is simply no
longer available. 

Under normal circumstances, regular state unemployment benefits run out after 26
weeks, although during recessions, the federal government will usually step in
with extended benefits. That has happened this time around, and there are almost
as many people on federal extended benefits (4.457 million) as there are on
regular state benefits (5.465 million). 

Keep in mind that median number of 20.1 weeks in the context of the 26 weeks of
regular benefits. Put another way, 38.3% of all the unemployed in November had
been out of work for more than 26 weeks, up from 35.6% in October. The chart
below tracks the unemployed by the length they have been out of work back to
1960. Note that historically, short-term unemployed (pink and light blue lines)
tend to far exceed long-term unemployed (yellow and especially the dark blue
lines). Short-term unemployment tends to be very stable over time (the numbers
are not population adjusted, so there should be a slight upward secular tilt
over time to all the lines, but the cyclical influences are stronger). 

It is the number of long-term unemployed that really make the difference between
boom and bust. Note that we have already started to see the numbers in the
shorter-term groups start to decline, while the dark blue line of the very
long-term unemployed continues its rocket shot higher. 

For those who dare make the claim that the Stimulus Bill has not made a
difference, I would tell them to go talk to the more than 4.4 million Americans
(and their families) that would have been left with no income at all if it had
not been for the bill. Those are people who would have to do their banking at
the local food bank, not at JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). They would be hard
pressed to do their holiday shopping at Goodwill, let alone Wal-Mart (NYSE:
WMT). If they could not spend, then those businesses would have had to lay off
more people, creating a self-reinforcing downward spiral.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union and Microsoft are likely to end a decade-long dispute next week when EU antitrust regulators will accept the U.S. software company's amended offer on allowing consumer choice on Internet browsers, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three people familiar with the situation said the European Commission was expected to approve on Tuesday Microsoft's plan to make it easier for consumers to choose rival browsers on the firm's Windows operating system, which is used on a majority of personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision would allow Microsoft to avoid another hefty penalty, after it had been fined a total of 1.68 billion euros ($2.5 billion) by the Commission over charges it breached EU antitrust rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft amended its proposals for the second time after rivals such as Norwegian browser market player Opera and Google complained to the Commission, the EU's executive arm, that the remedy announced on October 7 would not be effective. [ID:nL7701914] "A decision could come as early as next week during the last meeting of the college of commissioners for this year," one of the people told Reuters on Monday, adding Microsoft had made two changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The order of the browsers will be randomly presented instead of alphabetically in the original proposal. The presentation of the ballot screen is as neutral as possible," the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were down 0.4 percent to $29.87 in mid-session on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said it was assessing Microsoft's commitments to take into account the market test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission will not accept any commitments unless consumers are ensured a real, viable choice," Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission had until November 7 sought feedback from Microsoft's rivals, computer makers and other interested parties on the company's proposed ballot screen, amended after an informal market test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera, whose 2007 complaint on Microsoft's tying of its Internet Explorer browser to its Windows operating system had triggered the Commission's probe, said the changes would benefit users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those two changes, if indeed it appears to be the case, are an improvement on the previous proposal. They are significant and would be helpful to users," Opera's Chief Technology Officer Hakon Wium Lie told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Rupert Winchester)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.6720 euro)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Commission to accept Microsoft's browser offer next week&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft faced rivals' pressure over browser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Opera says changes are significant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft shares down 0.4 percent

 (Adds Opera comments, Microsoft shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRUSSELS, Dec 7 (Reuters) - The European Union and Microsoft
(MSFT.O) are likely to end a decade-long dispute next week when
EU antitrust regulators will accept the U.S. software company's
amended offer on allowing consumer choice on Internet browsers,
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three people familiar with the situation said the European
Commission was expected to approve on Tuesday Microsoft's plan
to make it easier for consumers to choose rival browsers on the
firm's Windows operating system, which is used on a majority of
personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision would allow Microsoft to avoid another hefty
penalty, after it had been fined a total of 1.68 billion euros
($2.5 billion) by the Commission over charges it breached EU
antitrust rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft amended its proposals for the second time after
rivals such as Norwegian browser market player Opera (OPERA.OL)
and Google (GOOG.O) complained to the Commission, the EU's
executive arm, that the remedy announced on Oct. 7 would not be
effective. [ID:nL7701914]
"A decision could come as early as next week during the last
meeting of the college of commissioners for this year," one of
the people told Reuters on Monday, adding Microsoft had made two
changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The order of the browsers will be randomly presented
instead of alphabetically in the original proposal. The
presentation of the ballot screen is as neutral as possible,"
the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares were down 0.4 percent to $29.87 in
mid-session on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission said it was assessing Microsoft's commitments
to take into account the market test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Commission will not accept any commitments unless
consumers are ensured a real, viable choice," Commission
spokesman Jonathan Todd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission had until Nov. 7 sought feedback from
Microsoft's rivals, computer makers and other interested parties
on the company's proposed ballot screen, amended after an
informal market test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Opera, whose 2007 complaint on Microsoft's tying of its
Internet Explorer browser to its Windows operating system had
triggered the Commission's probe, said the changes would benefit
users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Those two changes, if indeed it appears to be the case, are
an improvement on the previous proposal. They are significant
and would be helpful to users," Opera's Chief Technology Officer
Hakon Wium Lie told Reuters.

JPMorgan Chase receives top marks in banking industry peer group as Owners
Research Group releases investor consensus data on BAC, C, GS, JPM, MS &amp; WFC
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Owners Research Group (ORG) today highlighted several points from its recently
completed Investor Consensus Study of the U.S. banking industry. These reports
represent the views of 10% of the institutional shareholders of BAC, C, GS, JPM,
MS and WFC, managing median assets of $125 billion. 

When asked if satisfied with the executive compensation at each bank,
shareholders` responses had the following distribution from highest to lowest:

 1.    JPMorgan Chase:       Over 85% were satisfied  
 2.    Morgan Stanley:       Over 79% were satisfied  
 3.    Goldman Sachs:        Over 62% were satisfied  
 4.    Wells Fargo:          Over 53% were satisfied  
 5.    Citigroup:            Over 33% were satisfied  
 6.    Bank of America:      Over 27% were satisfied  


"Our goal is to facilitate better communications and understanding among
shareholders, directors and executives," said Eli Danziger, ORG Co-founder and
Managing Director. "Executive compensation is a highly polarizing issue in the
public discourse. Our data suggests that shareholders have a diverse, yet
measured view as it relates to compensation. We provide Boards with a powerful
tool to incorporate shareholder views when developing their remuneration plans."


These reports also reveal detailed insights on TARP repayment strategies, Board
and management performance and key corporate governance issues.

&lt;p&gt; * Financial downturn hits unit's valuation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Greg Roumeliotis and Jonathan Gleave
AMSTERDAM/MADRID, Dec 7 (Reuters) - A JP Morgan (JPM.N)
infrastructure fund is in talks to buy only parts of Dragados
SPL rather than the whole ports division of Spanish builder ACS
(ACS.MC), two people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
 The economic downturn has highlighted the disparity in value
of some of the port unit's assets, with JP Morgan now only
trying to acquire some of them, the sources said, adding the
talks were still continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JP Morgan is looking to buy some of Dragados's most
attractive assets, such as its terminal in Valencia," said one
of the sources, who did not wish to be named because the
transaction is private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ACS declined to comment and JP Morgan was not immediately
available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ports have suffered badly among infrastructure assets in the
financial crisis as their falling revenues, driven by a decline
in world trade, have affected their valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result, the sale of Dragados ports has dragged on since
ACS first received indications of interest for the unit last
January. [ID:nLN241185]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the time, media reports had suggested ACS could fetch up
to 1.4 billion euros ($2.08 billion) for Dragados SPL, but the
sources said this was now unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In October ACS said it was still in talks with several
interested parties and that it hoped the sale would take place
in the next few months. [ID:nLU347188]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) is advising JP Morgan while
Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Mediobanca (MDBI.MI) are advising
ACS, sources said.

&lt;p&gt;Ordering Begins Thursday for Capt. Nemo`s Nautilus, Inspired by Disney`s Classic
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea 


BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney fans will soon be able to add an element of epic adventure to their
collections: On Thursday, December 10, eFX Inc. begins accepting orders at

the Sea. 

Shipping is anticipated to take place in spring 2010 for the Nautilus, the first

the Nautilus placed prior to December 31, 2009, will receive an early pre-order
price of $1,699.

for the holidays. (Certificates for holiday giving can be guaranteed only for

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft yanked its $150 Windows 7 Family Pack from the U.S. market last week, saying that the limited time offer had expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page dedicated to the Family Pack now reads: "Thank you for your interest in Windows 7. The Windows 7 Family Pack offer has ended."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sellers have taken advantage of Family Pack's disappearance to jack up prices of their remaining copies of the three-PC upgrade by as much as 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The special offer, which debuted shortly before the Oct. 22 retail launch of Windows 7, let buyers upgrade as many as three PCs from Windows XP or Vista to Windows 7 Home Premium. The $149.99 price of the Family Pack represented a savings of $210 over three separate copies of Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade, which lists for $119.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it announced Family Pack, Microsoft said that the deal would run only while supplies lasted , but declined to specify how many copies it would push into the market or when it would end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family Pack wasn't the only discount that Microsoft has offered for a short time. Last summer, it pre-sold Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade at $49.99 for just two weeks in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although blogger Paul Thurrott first noted the demise of Family Pack last Friday, searches of search engine caches showed that Microsoft pulled the edition as early as Dec. 1, while users reported online that they had had trouble finding the discounted upgrade the week before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As of 11-26-09, the Microsoft Store does not offer the Family Pack," said a user identified as "Jen" in messages on About.com . "Their website doesn't have it and I also called and spoke with a rep who confirmed this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 1, someone tagged as "Mark A" echoed Jen's comment. "Yesterday [Microsoft's site] linked me stores around my area that were suppose to sale [sic] it. However, several trips to local outlets was futile. I then called the Microsoft Store and they claimed they had been out of stock for past 2 weeks and can't sale [sic] it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden disappearance of Family Pack raised hackles. "[I] am frustrated as I had planned on picking up the Family Pack in December. As others have pointed out, there was no warning that the deal was about to expire," said "TonyB" on the same Answer.com thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several sellers affiliated with Amazon.com still listed Family Pack as of Sunday, but had marked up the price between 70% and 90%, to between $255 and $285.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 60 sellers were also offering Family Pack on eBay Sunday, with Buy It Now prices as low as $225 and as high as $255. Other sellers were taking bids on the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minus the Family Pack, consumers wanting to upgrade multiple Windows XP or Vista PCs to Windows 7 must purchase individual licenses. Sunday, Amazon priced an upgrade to Home Premium at $109.49, a 9% mark-down. Wal-Mart's Web site has the same software for $109.82, while Newegg.com sells it for $109.99. At Amazon's price, it would cost $328.47 to upgrade three PCs, or more than double the price of the now-discontinued Family Pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several prominent bloggers have blasted Microsoft for pulling Family Pack. ZDNet's Ed Bott, for example, called it a "dumb move" in a Friday tweet and "stupid and short-sighted" in a later entry on his Windows Expertise blog. BetaNews' Joe Wilcox, meanwhile, said, "I've got a new spelling for 'Scrooge.' M-i-c-r-o-s-o-f-t," in a Saturday post .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Thurrott and Wilcox compared Microsoft's limited-time offer to Apple's permanent discount for its Mac OS X operating system. Apple sells a Snow Leopard upgrade for $29, and a five-license Family Pack for $49, a $96 savings over five separate upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The already intense Google -Microsoft rivalry heated up considerably last month with the long-expected release of Google Inc.'s Chrome operating system to the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say that if the new Linux-based operating system catches on quickly after it becomes generally available late next year, Google's effort to convince corporate users that its hosted Google Apps offering is a viable alternative to Microsoft Corp. 's Office suite could get a huge boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This really is a fight to the death for Google and Microsoft," said Jim McGregor, an analyst at In-Stat. "It is a fight between business models for software, applications, advertising and the Internet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a press conference held in mid-November to demonstrate the capabilities of the new operating system, Google officials made it clear that Chrome OS can't fully replace Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new offering only runs Web-hosted applications and only supports peripherals that comply with specific hardware designs. For example, Google officials said that Chrome will support solid-state disk drives, and not hard disk drives, to ensure speedy PC start-up times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when Chrome OS-based netbooks hit the market at the end of 2010, Google expects them to be "companion" devices that users will run alongside conventional PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are applications today that aren't available on the Web," said Sundar Pichai, Google's vice president of product management. "We're really focused. We expect that most people who buy [Chrome netbooks] next year ... [will] have another machine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company built Chrome OS to offer users "a delightful experience on the Web," Pichai added. "There will be some things this will not be able to do. If you're a lawyer planning to spend your entire day editing contracts back and forth, this isn't the right machine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Chrome users have to be very comfortable with cloud computing and its basic premise of keeping their data and applications in third-party data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For most people most of the time, the PC is just a Web player," said Ezra Gottheil, an analyst at Technology Business Research Inc. "Google is leveraging its Web expertise to strip away a lot of the stuff that people don't use as much anymore, and delivering an OS optimized for the Web. This makes business sense for Google. Getting in Microsoft's grill is just gravy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who evaluate Chrome using criteria commonly applied to conventional desktop operating systems are missing the point, said Gartner Inc. analyst Ray Valdes. "Some people have been asking, 'Can I run full-fledged Photoshop or full-fledged Excel on Chrome OS?' and 'What about all the device drivers and peripheral cards?' These were never part of the mission," Valdes said. "That war was fought and won long ago, mostly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valdes said that to succeed, Chrome OS will have to revitalize the netbook market, which has been slowing down as conventional laptops have become cheaper. It will also be critical for hardware vendors to make a genuine commitment to the Chrome OS and not just use it as a bargaining chip to get better prices on Windows licenses from Microsoft, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrome's unveiling came less than six months after Microsoft released its refurbished search engine, Bing, to take on Google's eponymous search tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The war between Microsoft and Google will play out over several years," said Dan Olds, an analyst at Gabriel Consulting Group Inc. "We won't see an absolute winner or loser, but more trench warfare, with each gaining temporary advantages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft downplayed Google's impact on the operating system market, at least for the near term. Chrome OS "appears to be in the early stages of development," a spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perez is a reporter for the IDG News Service. Computerworld's Eric Lai and Lucas Mearian contributed to this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

Gaylord Texan Resort. Gregg Willhoit, chief architect of the Progress(R)
DataDirect(R) Shadow(R) mainframe integration platform, is a featured
speaker with two presentations on the event agenda.

    "There's a lot of confusion in the marketplace right now regarding the
exploitation of the IBM specialty engines by independent software
vendors," said Gregg Willhoit. "In both the exhibitor presentation and
vendor training sessions, I'll examine the differences between proven
methods for zIIP utilization and those that fail to meet IBM's customer
agreement for authorized use. Attendees are certain to walk away with
clarity and actionable advice to use immediately with their measurement,
quantitative analysis and forecasting activities."

    Both sessions examine the use of cutting-edge mainframe middleware
products, like the DataDirect Shadow platform, that allow processing
associated with SOA integration, events and data queries to be diverted
from the mainframe General Purpose Processor (GPP) to the low-cost
specialty processors. By moving computationally intensive workloads to the
System z Integration Information Processor (zIIP) and System z Application
Assist Processor (zAAP) organizations can more effectively manage MIPS
capacity usage, defer upgrades and dramatically lower mainframe
Total-Cost-of-Ownership (TCO).

    The DataDirect Shadow platform provides a proven method for unlocking the
zIIP engine to run additional workloads beyond DB2. Internal benchmark
testing has shown the DataDirect Shadow product is capable of offloading
up to 99 percent of process intensive SOA, event publishing and data
workloads from the mainframe GPP to the non-restricted, more economic
zIIP specialty engine and is the only product of its kind to offer an
ANSI SQL-92 mainframe engine for non-relational data to leverage the zIIP
specialty processor for lowering mainframe TCO.

    Presentation Details


Exhibitor Presentation: "Taking the zIIP Beyond DB2: A Holistic Approach to
Lower Mainframe TCO"
Time: Tuesday, Dec. 8th at 5:15 p.m.
Room Location: Grapevine 3

Vendor Training: "Keeping it Legal: Techniques for Maximizing TCO with
zIIP"
Time: Thursday, Dec. 10th at 8:00 a.m.
Room Location: Fort Worth 7

    
Technological advancements like SOAs, Web services, ANSI-92 SQL and
XML Events address many of the challenges of mainframe integration, but
cost still remains a primary concern. For CMG members, conference
attendees and other IT professionals interested in quantifying the daily
and annual savings in dollars and MIPS capacity that can occur by
exploiting the zIIP, Progress Software offers the Shadow Mainframe TCO
Calculator. Developed in partnership with WinterGreen Research, the
calculator measures the impact of Web services, SOA and SQL data
processing on mainframe capacity; the cost benefit of zIIP offload; and
can help organizations ease the software and hardware procurement process
by providing real-time ROI analysis and strategic support for improving
control over mainframe costs. Visit Progress Software and the DataDirect
offerings on the exhibition floor at booth #101. To learn more about the
DataDirect Shadow TCO Calculator and to schedule a demonstration, go to

&lt;p&gt;Water Index Will Offer Most Comprehensive Measure of Corporate Risks and
Opportunities
TREVOSE, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
The World Resources Institute (WRI), in partnership with General Electric (NYSE:
GE) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), has launched an initiative to measure
water-related risks facing companies and their investors. The initiative will
develop a Water Index as a standardized approach to identify and mitigate
water-related corporate risk. 

The Index will offer one of the most expansive measures of water risks currently
available. It will aggregate nearly 20 weighted factors capturing water
availability, regulations, water quality and reputational issues. 

As water resource constraints affect nearly all industries, the Water Index will
be widely applicable. The Index will allow companies and investors to
transparently and adequately capture the various components of water-related
risk and will enable business leaders to make more well-informed investment
decisions. 

The Water Index will draw on publicly available data regarding physical scarcity
and water quality and overlay important factors including the regulatory regime
and social and reputational issues that have not previously been incorporated
into water risk measurement. Ultimately, this mapping tool will allow users to
combine and compare different components of the water risk assessment. 

"In many regions around the world, water scarcity from climate change and
pollution is starting to impact a company`s performance, yet few analysts
account for water-related risks," says Jonathan Lash, president of WRI. "WRI
hopes that investors will begin `pricing in` these under-appreciated risks,
driving investments to support more hydrologically efficient designs and
technologies." 

From the perspective of General Electric and Goldman Sachs, the Water Index will
allow each firm to better advise customers and clients on water-related risks
and opportunities. 

"From a technology perspective, solutions to enable water reuse and mitigate
risk already exist," said Heiner Markhoff, president and CEO-water and process
technologies for GE Power &amp; Water. "Advanced solutions, such as membrane
technology and water-efficient cooling technologies, are available to manage the
risks once these are identified and measured, which is what the Water Index aims
to do. We are thrilled to work with WRI and Goldman Sachs on this project." 

"Many environmental factors, including water, pose both challenges and
opportunities for investors and businesses," says Tracy Wolstencroft, global
head of environmental markets for Goldman Sachs. "The Water Index will provide
valuable insights that can inform investment decisions and will help identify
new opportunities across sectors and geographies."

&lt;p&gt;  LITTLETON, MA, Dec 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Increasingly, Microsoft(R) SharePoint Server implementations are now
critical applications in which any downtime can cause significant
business disruptions and productivity losses. But Microsoft's solution
for high availability protection requires a six-server SharePoint farm
that still leaves the indexing role unprotected. Marathon Technologies
will explain a simplified approach to SharePoint high availability that
only requires two servers and reliably protects the whole SharePoint
environment -- including the indexing service.

    Topic: A Simpler Approach to SharePoint High Availability

    Date: Wednesday, December 9 at 2:00pm EST/11:00am PST

    Sign up: Register online: https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/226547689

    In this live webcast, Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer Tom Reed will
highlight:

    -- How SharePoint can be fully protected, using as few as two servers

    -- How Marathon's everRun(R) automated high availability software reliably
protects all three architecture tiers -- including the indexing service

    -- A real-world SharePoint availability deployment at a large financial
services company in Canada

    SharePoint implementations follow a three-tier architectural model with a
front-end Web server based on Internet Information Services (IIS), a
middle-tier application server based on SharePoint Server roles and a
back-end database server based on SQL Server. Each of these tiers must be
protected from data loss, corruption, site failures or disasters.
Marathon's everRun software reliably protects all elements of the three
tiers and delivers higher levels of availability than traditional failover
solutions.

    Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 is an integrated suite of server
capabilities that can help companies improve organizational effectiveness
by providing comprehensive content management and enterprise search,
accelerating shared business processes, and facilitating
information-sharing across boundaries for better business insight.

&lt;p&gt;Complete Support for XPe Simplifies and Automates Patching for a Host of Thin
Client Devices Common to Retail, Hospitality and Entertainment Industries
ST. PAUL, Minn.--(Business Wire)--
Shavlik Technologies, LLC, a market leader in simplifying and automating
critical-to-perform and manage IT operations, today debuted a new agentless
solution that delivers complete and comprehensive patch management for Windows
XP Embedded (XPe) devices commonly used in hundreds of applications. The
solution makes Shavlik the industry's only patch management provider with full
support of XPe devices to secure these devices against viruses, worms, and
hackers. 

Windows XPe devices use a stripped down version of the Windows XP operating
system on a thin client device like a kiosk or point-of-sales (POS) device.
Because the XPe uses thin clients, many of the services and components used in
the full version of the Windows XP operating system have been disabled or are
not available. An agent-based approach to patching these machines often doesn't
work because there's limited disk space or services required by an agent are not
enabled. 

"The number of XPe devices used by consumers and individuals every single day
that may have never been patched is staggering," said Nancee Melby, director,
product marketing, Shavlik Technologies. "The agent-based approach is
impractical for patching the vast majority of these devices, so they simply
remain unpatched and an entry point for hackers. Shavlik's agentless approach
eliminates the obstacles to patching Windows XPe devices and leaves no footprint
other than the patches themselves." 

According to Melby, Windows XPe devices can include retail POS cash registers,
slot machines, airport or train station kiosks, gas station self service pumps,
ATM-styled kiosks at movie theaters and more. "POS devices have traditionally
received little attention because an attack on a single system would yield
little data; they were viewed as insignificant," Melby added. "But breaches at
Hannaford Brothers and Dave &amp; Buster`s shattered the illusion that these devices
are not a reason for concern." 

Shavlik's new XPe support not only provides a means to easily and effectively
patch these devices, but also helps organizations using XPe devices to be fully
PCI-compliant. The PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) requires that XPe devices
that process electronic payments meet certain standards for patch management and
vulnerability assessments. This includes requiring all systems to use the most
recently released software patches to protect against insider threats as well as
external hackers and viruses.

&lt;p&gt;PERTH (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) A$90 billion ($82.5 billion) sale of Wheatstone liquefied natural gas to Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T) is set to add pressure on rival Australian projects in their race to find customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal, which would see Japan's top utility take almost half of Wheatstone's annual output, pushes the project up the rankings in terms of feasibility among the long list of planned LNG ventures in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal with TEPCO has put Wheatstone on the map as a very credible competitor against other LNG projects that are marketing their gas," said Mark Greenwood, an energy analyst at JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And while this is fantastic for Chevron, it will no doubt be negative for other players like Woodside (WPL.AX), Santos (STO.AX) and Origin (ORG.AX)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodside Petroleum, Santos and Origin Energy all harbor ambitious growth plans for their LNG business and are each involved in LNG projects that are in varying degrees of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale would perhaps deal the strongest blow to ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Origin's planned LNG project on Australia's east coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has not yet clinched any sales and Conoco was likely to have been targeting TEPCO as a potential customer given their existing relationship in the Conoco-operated Darwin LNG project in Australia, said Greenwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Longer term, the demand will be there but we think there's certainly a market window for operators to sign with customers, or face delays in their projects," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects that are sanctioned at a later date could also see LNG prices come under pressure and erode their profitability, Di Brookman, an energy analyst at CLSA Asia Pacific, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a table of LNG export projects planned in the Asia-Pacific region, click on ID:SYD409340&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TEPCO, which consumes about 20 million tonnes of LNG a year, has signed a deal to buy 3.1 million tonnes of LNG from Wheatstone a year for 20 years, plus it has bought a 15 percent equity stake in the project that could give it another 1 million tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks the second supply deal TEPCO has clinched in just a few days. The utility also finalized a purchase agreement with ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) to buy 1.8 mtpy of LNG from the Papua New Guinea LNG project for a period of 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASIAN DEMAND STILL ROBUST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the global economic downturn, the recent raft of gas deals signed by utilities across China, Japan and South Korea are being done at near parity to oil prices, analysts said -- a sign that buyers remain concerned about supply uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There may be a lot of large projects in Australia but the questions on buyers' minds will be which ones are promising to come through and when," said John Harris, director of global LNG at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LNG projects are costly to get off the ground, with approved developments prone to delays and cost overruns, while proposed ones often remain stuck on the drawing board for years due to factors such as the inability to prove up gas reserves, a lack of capital for costly engineering studies and difficulties in getting all partners on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While energy firms continue to be bullish about LNG's global long-term demand, some analysts have also cautioned that demand from China and India are the biggest wildcards that could threaten the commonly touted growth forecast for LNG demand to double to 400 mtpy by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With as many as seven major Australian LNG projects aiming to reach a final investment decision by 2011, operators also need to secure the first-mover advantage in order to capture the country's limited workforce, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been hearing a lot from companies about the manpower shortage in Australia. It is a very real issue confronting the LNG industry and projects that come in at a later date will risk facing much higher costs," said an energy analyst from a major investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it expected to sign up more customers for Wheatstone in coming months, but would not specify what level of production would need to be pre-sold before it would be comfortable in granting final development approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) has said that it was interested to buy gas from Wheatstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wheatstone gas processing plant, located in western Australia, will have an initial output of 8.6 mtpy in the first phase. It is scheduled for final approval in 2011 ahead of production starting in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei newspaper reported on Sunday that TEPCO will invest more than 300 billion yen ($3.34 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Western Australian state government said on Monday the contract is worth A$90 billion ($82.5 bln) and is the largest Australian LNG supply agreement ever signed. Chevron declined to comment on the value. (Reporting by Fayen Wong; Editing by Michael Urquhart)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERTH (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) has finalized a gas sales contract with Japan's Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T) for its project in Papua New Guinea, putting the $15 billion development on track for approval on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TEPCO, Japan's largest utility, has entered a binding agreement with project partners for the purchase of 1.8 million tonnes per year (mtpy) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for a period of 20 years, Exxon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contracted volume includes the plant's recently expanded output of 0.3 mtpy, which means all of the project's 6.6 mtpy capacity has now been contracted, project partner Oil Search (OSH.AX) said in a separate statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and partners have not yet finalized two other gas sale agreements with Taiwan's CPC Corp and Japan's Osaka Gas Ltd 9532. ahead of a self-imposed deadline of December 8 for the project's final investment decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a government official told Reuters that the project will still be approved by project partners on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government and partners will be sanctioning the project in an official signing ceremony on Tuesday morning," said a Papua New Guinea government official who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose the information ahead of the official release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the government is set to sign off on the project's 10 development licenses and to reach a revenue sharing agreement with landowners for the Hides gas field by Monday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have long considered the PNG LNG project to be a forerunner amongst the raft of nearly 16 planned LNG projects in the Asia-Pacific region after Exxon swiftly secured deals to underpin its full capacity earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venture includes Australia's Oil Search Ltd (OSH.AX), Santos Ltd (STO.AX), Japan's Nippon Oil Corp 5001.T and PNG land.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today patched 12 vulnerabilities in Windows, Office and Internet Explorer (IE), including three critical bugs in the company's newest browser, IE8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 12 flaws fixed in Tuesday's six security updates, seven were rated "critical," the highest severity ranking in Microsoft 's four-step scoring system. Four of the remaining flaws were pegged as "important," one step lower on the scale, while the final vulnerability was labeled "moderate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security researchers unanimously voted MS09-072 , the five-patch update for IE, as the one that demands immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's certainly the one to watch," said Andrew Storms, the director of security operations at nCircle Network Security. "You can't focus enough attention on the IE update. It trumps the bunch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richie Lai, the director of vulnerability research at security company Qualys, echoed Storms. "MS09-072 affects IE, which is a big attack surface," said Lai, "and the vulnerabilities are primed to be exploited by classic drive-by attacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Definitely take a look at that one," chimed in Jason Miller, the security and data team manager for patch management vendor Shavlik Technologies. "Browser attacks are the most prevalent of all attacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the five fixes included in the IE update addressed the zero-day vulnerability that Microsoft confirmed last month after sample attack code that exploited a flaw in IE's layout parser went public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms applauded Microsoft's speed in quashing the bug. "That was record time for Microsoft, to patch in just two weeks," he said, adding that it usually takes the company a month or more to ready a fix. "The holiday online shopping season had to increase the pressure to patch, but then again, it looks like Microsoft already knew about the bug," said Storms, referring to the credit that Microsoft gave to VeriSign iDefense for reporting the flaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the big news today, said Storms, Lai and Miller, was the fact that of the five IE vulnerabilities in MS09-072, three affect the newest edition of the browser, IE8. Two of those three affect IE8 only; Microsoft's other browsers were immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can bet that engineers at Microsoft are as depressed about these bugs as much as we are," Storms said of the IE8 vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question is why they're there," Storms continued. "It would be easier to explain if both IE8 and IE7 were vulnerable, as is the case with one of the vulnerabilities. But the fact that two are IE8-only makes us wonder if Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle is working." Security Development Lifecycle, or SDL, is the term Microsoft's given to a development process that stresses security testing as a piece of software is being written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[The flaws] could be in new code or old code, but we don't know where they were brought into the process," Storms said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Storms, Lai and Miller all bet that the fault lay in new code Microsoft crafted for IE8. "I'd say it was in new features," said Lai. "Microsoft made a lot of HTML updates to IE8 to reach standards compliance, so I'm pretty sure the bugs are in the new code base."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"New features means more code to be reviewed, and more likelihood of something slipping through," Storms noted. "Old code, you would expect has been reviewed more than once already."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sometimes code is dropped [from a program] and new code is used instead," said Miller. "They're in the brand-new code and the new technologies in IE8."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attackers will likely come up with working exploits for the IE vulnerabilities patched today, Microsoft said, giving four of the five bugs an exploitability index rating of "1." That means reliable attack code will probably appear in the next 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining five security updates, which patched an additional seven vulnerabilities -- just two of them considered critical -- are also-rans in Storms' mind. "All the rest of them have some kind of mitigation," he said, ranging from a requirement to have authenticated access to a wireless-only attack vector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lai's colleagues at Qualys didn't agree with Storms. " MS09-070 needs attention," said Amol Sarwate, the manager of Qualys' vulnerability research lab, pointing to the bulletin that patched two vulnerabilities in Microsoft's Active Directory, a critical component within enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfgang Kandek, Qualys' chief technology officer, added MS09-073 to the list of apply-now updates. The bulletin patches WordPad, the minimalist text editor included with all versions of Windows, and the text converters used by Microsoft's Office suite to parse Word 97 documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"File format vulnerabilities tend to be downplayed," acknowledged Kandek, "but everyone has WordPad. Although an exploit won't exactly be easy, [attackers] won't have trouble finding out how to do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bright spot on this Patch Tuesday was the immunity of Microsoft's newest operating system, Windows 7 , to any of today's updates, said the researchers. "Except for the IE8 bugs, there were none for Windows 7," said Miller. "So that's a good sign."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's too early to call Windows 7 a resounding security success, Miller cautioned. "Remember, Vista was much the same when it came out," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also released a pair of security advisories today that spelled out additional tactics for users and company administrators to further protect Windows against attacks already disclosed, or that have actually been used in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month's security updates can be downloaded and installed via the Microsoft Update and Windows Update services, as well as through Windows Server Update Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and data storage company NetApp Inc. today announced a three-year agreement that cements what had already been years of product collaboration and technical integration. The deal also extends worldwide joint sales and marketing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, the two companies will collaborate to deliver technology that includes virtualization, private cloud computing as well as storage and data management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For data center administrators, that will mean a more tightly consolidated view for managing both server and storage infrastructure. "It allows them to discover their storage resources, do performance monitoring and health monitoring of the whole infrastructure," said David Greschler, Microsoft's director of virtualization strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft and NetApp have not had a formal joint development agreement in the past, the companies have collaborated for years to more tightly integrate their products. "Does this alter or change any development plans or road map?" Greschler said. "No. We've been working on these for some time already, but this is a more formal and public commitment. That's the importance and significance of the announcement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Microsoft and NetApp will focus their collaboration on virtualized infrastructure technology based on Windows Server 2008 R2, Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008 R2, Microsoft System Center and NetApp storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Rogers, vice president of solutions and alliances for NetApp, said the collaboration effort will move toward enabling better management of public and private cloud infrastructures, where -- once virtualization is well established -- workloads can be dynamically moved around for better utilization of assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's no longer about thinking about workloads tied to specific servers, and, of course, storage plays a big role in that whole model of private cloud," Rogers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the companies will integrate storage and data management software for Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server and Microsoft SQL Server to improve communications and collaboration and accelerate software development and testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the management layer, integrating with Microsoft Systems Center has been a very big focus for us," Rogers said.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft dismissed recently-disclosed threats to its BitLocker disk-encryption technology as "relatively low risk," noting that attackers must not only have physical access to a targeted PC, but must manipulate the machine two separate times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's move was prompted by a paper published by five German researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (Fraunhofer SIT), a Darmstadt, Germany-based security company. In the paper, the researchers spelled out multiple attack scenarios criminals could use to access files protected by BitLocker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BitLocker, which Microsoft debuted in higher-end versions of Windows Vista, is included only in Windows 7 Ultimate and Windows 7 Enterprise , available only to companies and organizations that buy Windows licenses in volume, as well as Windows Server 2008 and Server 2008 R2. The software encrypts disk volumes and locks them with a PIN, USB-based key device or, if the computer includes one, a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fraunhofer SIT researchers spelled out five attack possibilities, including one where the attacker boots the PC from a flash drive and replaces the BitLocker bootloader with a substitute bootloader that spoofs the PIN request process, then snatches the PIN and saves it to disk or sends it elsewhere using the computer's wireless connection. Later, the attacker must revisit the PC to use the purloined PIN to access the BitLocker-protected data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft scoffed at such scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This sort of targeted attack poses a relatively low risk to folks who use BitLocker in the real world," said Paul Cooke, a senior director at Microsoft who looks after the operating system's security features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a post to the Windows Security blog, Cooke acknowledged that the Fraunhofer SIT researchers were right. "Even with BitLocker's multi-authentication configurations, an attacker could spoof the pre-OS collection of the user's PIN, store this PIN for later retrieval, and then reboot into the authentic collection of the user's PIN. The attacker would then be required to gain physical access to the laptop for a second time in order to retrieve the user's PIN and complete the attack scheme."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooke downplayed the threat and argued that that research broke no new ground. "These sorts of targeted threats are not new and are something we've addressed in the past; in 2006 we discussed similar attacks, where we've been straightforward with customers and partners that BitLocker does not protect against these unlikely, targeted attacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fraunhofer SIT five-some admitted that the attacks they outlined were essentially useless in what they called "opportunistic" attacks, which they defined as "easily obtained under common real-world conditions." Instead, the attack vectors they detailed required physical access to the targeted machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noted that their attack scenarios didn't exploit an actual vulnerability in BitLocker. "Our attack demonstration does neither imply a bug in BitLocker, nor renders it Trusted Computing useless," said two of the researchers in an entry on the Fraunhofer SIT blog . "BitLocker still works as well as other disk encryption products, it only fails to fulfill an unrealistic, yet common, expectation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair also posted a video demonstrating the spoofed bootloader attack on the blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co sees additional losses on credit cards and home loans next year although there are some signs the rate of losses is settling and it may not need to build credit reserves much further, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. bank is seen as one of those that has best survived the credit crisis, but as the recession lingers it is facing rising losses across its large consumer loan portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's home lending portfolio may shrink 10 percent to 15 percent to about $240 billion in 2010, and $200 billion in 2011 at current production and run-off levels, according to Dimon's presentation at an analysts' conference in New York. That decline would reduce 2010 net interest income in the portfolio by about $1 billion from this year's levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losses on its Chase portfolio of credit cards could reach 11 percent by the first quarter of 2010. Losses on the Washington Mutual card portfolio could rise to 24 percent over the next several quarters, according to Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, however, had expected near-term consumer losses broadly to reach the levels laid out in the presentation and the bank has prepared by adding to credit reserves in previous quarters, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If these numbers are accurate we won't need to do much more reserving," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is of course uncertainty surrounding the level of losses in JPMorgan's credit card and home loan portfolios if unemployment remains at around 10 percent longer term, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are some initial signs of stability in consumer delinquency trends, the bank is not sure these will continue, according to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon reiterated that the bank would like to increase its quarterly dividend -- currently at 5 cents -- but that this will not happen until there is clear improvement in the economy. "I would view that as unemployment really comes down," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acquired the assets of failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual last year. It acquired investment bank Bear Stearns last March and in recent quarters, profits at JPMorgan's investment bank have helped offset losses on its consumer businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're very proud of the investment bank," said Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares closed down 4 cents to $41.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay, editing by Maureen Bavdek and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Dec 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department
said on Tuesday it will auction off warrants to buy stock in
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Treasury said the auction of warrants, which it
received in return for pumping taxpayer capital into the
company, would be on Thursday, with Deutsche Bank Securities as
the sole book-running manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramirez  Co., The Williams Capital Group and Utendahl
Capital Group will co-manage the offering, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Treasury said bidders would be able to place bids at
any price in increments of $0.25 at or above the minimum bid
price of $8.00 per warrant. Further details would be provided
in a preliminary prospectus to be filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Treasury had announced on Nov. 19 that it would auction
off the warrants it had received in JPMorgan, Capital One
Financial Corp and TCF Financial Corp because it was unable to
reach an agreement over their value with the institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10-year warrants were meant to allow taxpayers to share
the upside as banks that received public funds recover. All
three of the banks have already repurchased preferred stock
they had issued the Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The proceeds of this sale will provide an additional
return to the American taxpayer from Treasury's investment in
the company beyond the dividend payments it received on the
related preferred stock," the Treasury said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, seeking to extricate itself from the government's
bailout program, had said in July that the Treasury was
demanding too high a price for the warrants and that it wanted
them auctioned off.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co, the second-largest U.S. bank, sees additional losses on credit cards and home loans next year in spite of some signs the rate of losses is settling, according to a presentation published on its website on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank is seen as one of those that has best survived the credit crisis, but as the recession lingers it is facing rising losses across its large consumer loan portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's home lending portfolio may shrink 10 percent to 15 percent to about $240 billion in 2010, and $200 billion in 2011 at current production and run-off levels, according to the presentation slides. That decline would reduce 2010 net interest income in the portfolio by about $1 billion from this year's levels, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losses on its Chase portfolio of credit cards could reach 11 percent by the first quarter of 2010. Losses on the Washington Mutual card portfolio could rise to 24 percent over the next several quarters, according to the presentation, which the bank was due to give to analysts later on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are some initial signs of stability in consumer delinquency trends, the bank is not sure these will continue, according to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acquired the assets of failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual last year. It acquired investment bank Bear Stearns last March and in recent quarters, profits at&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's investment bank have helped offset losses on its consumer businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay, editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RUEIL-MALMAISON, France--(Business Wire)--
The European research project COCATE, just being signed and starting in January
2010, tackles the problems of rolling out a shared transportation infrastructure
capable of connecting geological storage sites with various medium size
CO2-emitting industrial facilities located within a close geographical
proximity. Led by IFP (France), the project brings together eight other research
and industrial partners: the Le Havre Region Development Agency (France),
Geogreen (France), Accoat (Denmark), SINTEF Energy Research (Norway), DNV
(Norway), TNO (Netherlands), Port of Rotterdam NV (Netherlands) and SANERI
(South Africa). 

COCATE's objective is to analyze the conditions for transporting the flue gases
emitted from several CO2-emitting industrial facilities with a view to pooling
the capture process, and for exporting large quantities of captured CO2 to
storage areas. While major industrial facilities can be fitted with their own
CO2 capture and transport installations, this does not apply to units that emit
less CO2 - from a few tens of thousands to several hundred thousand metric tons
- and for which the investment required would be uneconomic. They must pool the
CO2 capture and transportation system in order to cut costs and to make CCS an
affordable technology. 

The Le Havre region and the Port of Rotterdam have been selected as test sites
for the research work conducted by the partners involved in the COCATE project.
The transportation infrastructure being considered includes two types of
network: 

- a local low-pressure network to collect the flue gases emitted by various Le
Havre-based industrial companies and transport it to various capture centers, 

- and a high-pressure network to transport the captured CO2 to the Port of
Rotterdam, for storage in depleted North Sea oil and gas fields. 

Transport by pipe scenarios (CO2 in supercritical state above 74 bars) or
transport by boat scenarios (CO2 transported in refrigerated liquid form (-50&#176;C,
7 bar or -30&#176;C, 15 bar)) will be considered, as will different storage
locations. 

COCATE will review the technical limitations specific to each of these networks:


- Concerning the upstream low-pressure collection network, the flue gases will
be transported as they are to the treatment unit. It will be important to ensure
that such transportation is technically and economically feasible (corrosion,
instability, dimensioning aspects). 

- Concerning the high-pressure network transporting the captured CO2, the R
work will focus more particularly on the effect of the impurities that are
contained in the captured CO2 . 

Depending on the type of capture technology and fuel, various types of
impurities can be found in the gas to be transported. The aspects concerning
fluid mechanics, corrosion and the inner lining of the pipes will be
incorporated. 

This work will be supplemented by a risk analysis that will provide data to a
safety management tool and by the production of a business model relating to
cost optimization and the phase-in of the investment policy. 

This three-year project has a total budget of &#8364;4.5 million, nearly &#8364;3 million of
which is contributed by the European Commission. 

So far, all the R projects in the CO2 transportation field have been
exclusively focused on the CO2 emitted by the major emitting industries, in
particular power stations. As the first project dedicated to the issue of pooled
CO2 treatment, COCATE should allow medium-sized production sites located in the
same geographic area to cut their CO2 emissions in the same way as major
industrial facilities.

&lt;p&gt;* Grant to support local community assistance programs 
* Irving Cares selected as fourth recipient of the annual Chairman`s Gift

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil
Corporation, today presented Irving Cares with a $50,000 grant in support of the
nonprofit organization`s work with Irving residents in need of employment
services, food and financial assistance. Irving Cares is the fourth nonprofit
organization to receive ExxonMobil`s annual Chairman`s Gift. 

"Irving Cares is making a marked difference for our neighbors in need and it is
an honor to award such a deserving recipient with the Chairman`s Gift,"
Tillerson said today at a ceremony at Irving Cares. "We look forward to
continuing our partnership with Irving Cares as they help residents during the
holiday season and beyond." 

Irving Cares provides a food pantry, emergency assistance with rent, utilities
and prescriptions, and transportation to medical facilities for Irving residents
experiencing financial hardship. Due to the economic decline, client requests at
Irving Cares have increased at least 20 percent in every program as families
struggle with reduced wages and unemployment. 

Tillerson toured the facilities with Teddie Story, executive director of Irving
Cares, and had a chance to visit case worker`s offices, which were painted by a
group of ExxonMobil employees during the annual 2009 United Way Day of Caring in
September. 

"With the holidays in full swing and 2010 just around the corner, ExxonMobil`s
investment in our organization is greatly appreciated," said Story. "We work to
provide the residents of Irving a safe place to receive financial and employment
assistance and a variety of other services. With this generous gift, we will be
starting the new year off on a positive note." 

Tillerson established the Chairman`s Gift in 2006 to provide a local nonprofit
organization with a donation during the holiday season. Since the gift`s
inception, Tillerson has selected St. Philip`s School and Community Center, Lena
Pope Home, Vogel Alcove and Irving Cares as recipients. 

In addition to its selection as this year`s Chairman`s Gift recipient, Irving
Cares has been previously supported by ExxonMobil and its employees through
United Way Day of Caring projects and the ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs
Program, which places college interns with qualifying nonprofit organizations
each summer.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
As economias mundiais em crescimento aumentar&#227;o a demanda de energia por volta
de 35% em 2030, em compara&#231;&#227;o a 2005, exigindo trilh&#245;es de d&#243;lares em
investimentos e um compromisso com a inova&#231;&#227;o e a tecnologia, disse hoje a Exxon
Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) no lan&#231;amento da nova edi&#231;&#227;o do Outlook for Energy:
A View to 2030.

"Na nossa perspectiva energ&#233;tica, vemos muitos fatores positivos, recupera&#231;&#227;o e
crescimento econ&#244;mico, melhores padr&#245;es de vida e redu&#231;&#227;o da pobreza, al&#233;m de
novas tecnologias promissoras", disse Rex W. Tillerson, presidente do conselho e
diretor executivo. "Mas n&#243;s tamb&#233;m vemos um desafio enorme, que &#233; o de atender
&#224;s crescentes necessidades de energia do mundo e reduzir o impacto do uso
energ&#233;tico no meio ambiente." 

Tillerson disse que deve-se ampliar as provis&#245;es de todas as fontes econ&#244;micas
de combust&#237;vel para satisfazer os aumentos projetados para a demanda energ&#233;tica
global e garantir energia confi&#225;vel e econ&#244;mica a fim de atender aos desafios
sociais, econ&#244;micos e ambientais. 

A ExxonMobil observa que tanto o crescimento econ&#244;mico quanto populacional at&#233;
2030 continuar&#225; a impulsionar a demanda global por energia. A popula&#231;&#227;o mundial
deve aumentar para quase oito bilh&#245;es, criando novas demandas de energia para
necessidades pessoais, como combust&#237;veis para autom&#243;veis e eletricidade para os
lares, mas tamb&#233;m energia que &#233; consumida indiretamente para atender mais
amplamente &#224; sociedade e &#224; economia. 

O Outlook inclui uma avalia&#231;&#227;o de como pol&#237;ticas potenciais de redu&#231;&#227;o das
emiss&#245;es de carbono afetar&#227;o a demanda futura de energia e impactar&#227;o a mistura
de combust&#237;vel. Por exemplo, a imposi&#231;&#227;o de custos mais altos para as emiss&#245;es
de carbono impactaria os pre&#231;os da energia e incentivaria uma mudan&#231;a para
combust&#237;veis com menor intensidade de carbono, como o g&#225;s natural, o que
ajudaria a atender &#224; crescente demanda por eletricidade e a reduzir as emiss&#245;es
da gera&#231;&#227;o de energia em at&#233; 60% em compara&#231;&#227;o com o carv&#227;o. 

Entre as constata&#231;&#245;es desse ano:

* O r&#225;pido crescimento econ&#244;mico dos pa&#237;ses em desenvolvimento que n&#227;o fazem
parte da Organiza&#231;&#227;o para Coopera&#231;&#227;o e Desenvolvimento Econ&#244;mico (OCDE)
aumentar&#225; a demanda por energia por volta de 65% at&#233; 2030, em compara&#231;&#227;o com
2005. Ao contr&#225;rio, nos pa&#237;ses da OCDE, a demanda por energia deve ser
essencialmente baixa at&#233; 2030, apesar de essas economias crescerem mais de 50%
em m&#233;dia. 
* Espera-se que os ganhos de efici&#234;ncia acelerem entre 2005 e 2030, em
contraposi&#231;&#227;o &#224;s tend&#234;ncias hist&#243;ricas. Os ganhos de efici&#234;ncia energ&#233;tica
conter&#227;o o crescimento da demanda por energia at&#233; 2030 em cerca de 65%. 
* Haver&#225; uma expans&#227;o do fornecimento de g&#225;s natural, especialmente nos Estados
Unidos, onde o fornecimento de g&#225;s n&#227;o convencional deve satisfazer mais de 50%
da demanda por g&#225;s at&#233; 2030. 
* A gera&#231;&#227;o de energia &#233; o setor de demanda energ&#233;tica de maior crescimento, e
representa 55% do crescimento total da demanda at&#233; 2030. Nessa &#233;poca, a gera&#231;&#227;o
de energia ser&#225; respons&#225;vel por quase 40% da demanda prim&#225;ria total de energia. 
* Os combust&#237;veis f&#243;sseis - &#243;leo, g&#225;s natural e carv&#227;o - continuar&#227;o a atender &#224;
maioria das necessidades mundiais durante esse per&#237;odo, porque nenhuma outra
fonte energ&#233;tica combina disponibilidade, versatilidade, acessibilidade
econ&#244;mica e escala. O combust&#237;vel de mais r&#225;pido crescimento dessas categorias
ser&#225; o g&#225;s natural, refletindo sua abund&#226;ncia, versatilidade e vantagens
econ&#244;micas como um combust&#237;vel eficiente e de queima limpa para a gera&#231;&#227;o de
energia. 
* As energias e&#243;lica e solar e os biocombust&#237;veis crescer&#227;o intensamente at&#233;
2030, em m&#233;dia cerca de 10% ao ano. No entanto, como est&#227;o come&#231;ando com uma
base pequena, sua contribui&#231;&#227;o at&#233; 2030 continuar&#225; relativamente pequena, por
volta de 2,5% da energia total.

IRVING, Texas (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Bis 2030 wird der Energiebedarf auf der ganzen Welt aufgrund wachsender
Volkswirtschaften rund 35 Prozent h&#246;her sein als im Jahr 2005. Dies macht
Investitionen in Billionenh&#246;he sowie Innovationen und technologische
Fortschritte n&#246;tig, wie die Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) anl&#228;sslich der
Ver&#246;ffentlichung der Neuauflage ihres &#8222;Energieausblicks 2030" (Outlook for
Energy: A View to 2030) heute mitgeteilt hat. 

&#8222;In unserem Energieausblick sehen wir viel Hoffnung auf uns zukommen -Erholung
und Wachstum in der Wirtschaft, Steigerungen bei den Lebensstandards, weniger
Armut und vielversprechende neue Energietechnologien", sagte Rex W. Tillerson,
Chairman und Chief Executive Officer. &#8222;Doch wir sehen auch eine enorme
Herausforderung, n&#228;mlich, wie der wachsende Energiebedarf gedeckt und
gleichzeitig die Auswirkungen des Energieverbrauchs auf die Umwelt reduziert
werden k&#246;nnen." 

Tillerson sagte, die Versorgung mit allen wirtschaftlich sinnvollen
Energietr&#228;gern m&#252;sse ausgeweitet werden, um die prognostizierte Zunahme des
weltweiten Energiebedarfs zu decken und die gesellschaftlichen, wirtschaftlichen
und umweltpolitischen Herausforderungen mit zuverl&#228;ssigen und bezahlbaren
Energiequellen angehen zu k&#246;nnen. 

ExxonMobil h&#228;lt fest, dass der globale Energiebedarf aufgrund von Bev&#246;lkerungs-
und Wirtschaftswachstum bis 2030 weiter steigen wird. Die Weltbev&#246;lkerung d&#252;rfte
auf knapp 8 Milliarden ansteigen, wodurch neuer Energiebedarf f&#252;r pers&#246;nliche
Zwecke wie Autotreibstoff und Strom f&#252;r Wohnungen entsteht, aber auch der
indirekte Energieverbrauch zur allgemeinen Versorgung von Gesellschaft und
Wirtschaft ansteigt. 

Der Ausblick enth&#228;lt eine Einsch&#228;tzung der Auswirkungen von m&#246;glichen
politischen Ma&#223;nahmen zur Senkung von CO2-Emissionen auf den zuk&#252;nftigen
Energiebedarf und Treibstoffmix. Die Erhebung h&#246;herer Kosten f&#252;r CO2-Emissionen
beispielsweise w&#252;rde sich auf die Energiepreise auswirken und einen Anreiz zur
Umstellung auf weniger CO2-intensive Treibstoffe wie Erdgas bieten, was zur
Deckung des wachsenden Strombedarfs und bei der Stromerzeugung im Vergleich mit
Kohle zur Senkung von Emissionen um bis zu 60 Prozent beitragen kann. 

Einige der diesj&#228;hrigen Befunde:

* Rasantes Wirtschaftswachstum in Entwicklungsl&#228;ndern, die nicht zur OECD
(Organisation f&#252;r wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung) geh&#246;ren, wird
deren Energiebedarf bis 2030 im Vergleich mit 2005 um rund 65 Prozent erh&#246;hen.
Im Gegensatz dazu d&#252;rfte der Energiebedarf in OECD-L&#228;ndern im Zeitraum bis 2030
im Wesentlichen konstant bleiben, obwohl deren Volkswirtschaften im Durchschnitt
um 50 Prozent wachsen werden. 
* Effizienzsteigerungen d&#252;rften zwischen 2005 und 2030 gegen&#252;ber historischen
Vergleichswerten zunehmen. Steigerungen bei der Energieeffizienz werden den
Energiebedarf bis 2030 um rund 65 Prozent eind&#228;mmen. 
* Eine Zunahme der Versorgung mit Erdgas wird besonders in den USA stattfinden,
wo bis 2030 voraussichtlich mehr als 50 Prozent des Gasbedarfs durch
unkonventionelle Gasvorkommen gedeckt werden. 
* Stromerzeugung ist der gr&#246;&#223;te und wachstumsst&#228;rkste Sektor in Bezug auf
Energiebedarf und macht 55 Prozent der gesamten Bedarfssteigerung bis 2030 aus.
Zu jenem Zeitpunkt wird die Stromerzeugung rund 40 Prozent des gesamten Bedarfs
an Prim&#228;renergie ausmachen. 
* Fossile Energietr&#228;ger - Erd&#246;l, Erdgas und Kohle - werden in diesem Zeitraum
weiterhin den Hauptanteil des weltweiten Bedarfs decken, weil deren
Verf&#252;gbarkeit, Vielseitigkeit, Erschwinglichkeit und Vorkommen von keinem
anderen Energietr&#228;ger erreicht werden. Der wachstumsst&#228;rkste dieser
Energietr&#228;ger wird Erdgas sein, was auf dessen reichhaltige Verf&#252;gbarkeit,
Vielseitigkeit und dessen wirtschaftliche Vorteile als effizientem und sauberem
Kraftstoff bei der Stromerzeugung zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren ist. 
* Wind- und Solarkraft sowie Biokraftstoffe werden bis 2030 rasant zunehmen, und
zwar um durchschnittlich knapp 10 Prozent pro Jahr. Da diese jedoch momentan
erst einen geringen Anteil ausmachen, wird ihr Beitrag zur Gesamtenergie mit
rund 2,5 Prozent auch im Jahr 2030 noch relativ klein sein.

Der &#8222;Energieausblick" wird j&#228;hrlich aktualisiert, um die Gesch&#228;ftsplanung bei
ExxonMobil zu unterst&#252;tzen und den Kenntnisstand der &#214;ffentlichkeit in Bezug auf
den weltweiten Energiebedarf und die damit zusammenh&#228;ngenden Herausforderungen
zu erh&#246;hen. Der Ausblick wird anhand einer detaillierten Analyse von rund 100
L&#228;ndern, 15 Wirtschaftssektoren und 20 Energietr&#228;gern erstellt und durch
Wirtschafts- und Bev&#246;lkerungsprognosen sowie durch in Aussicht stehende
technologische Fortschritte und wesentliche Verbesserungen bei der
Energieeffizienz untermauert.

Warnhinweis: Der Ausblick und diese Mitteilung enthalten zukunftsgerichtete
Aussagen. Die tats&#228;chlichen zuk&#252;nftigen Gegebenheiten (wie die wirtschaftlichen
Gegebenheiten, der Energiebedarf, die Energiequellen und die
Effizienzsteigerungen) k&#246;nnen aufgrund von Ver&#228;nderungen bei Vorschriften und
anderen politischen Ereignissen, aufgrund technologischer Ver&#228;nderungen, der
Entwicklung neuer Bezugsquellen, demografischer Ver&#228;nderungen und anderer
Faktoren, die im Ausblick sowie in Abschnitt 1A auf dem neusten Formblatt 10-K
von ExxonMobil beschrieben werden, erheblich davon abweichen.

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Die Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) hat heute bekannt gegeben, dass die
Mitunternehmer &#252;bereingekommen sind, mit der Planung des Fl&#252;ssigerdgasprojekts
(LNG) in Papua-Neuguinea (PNG), bei dem der Abschluss der Verkaufs-
beziehungsweise Kaufvertr&#228;ge mit den LNG-K&#228;ufern sowie die endg&#252;ltige Festlegung
der Finanzierungsvereinbarungen mit den Kapitalgebern noch ausstehen,
fortzufahren. 

Im Rahmen einer Zeremonie im National Parliament House von Papua-Neuguinea in
Port Moresby gab Peter Graham, Gesch&#228;ftsf&#252;hrer von Esso Highlands Limited, einer
Tochtergesellschaft von ExxonMobil, bekannt, dass der ausstehende Abschluss
dieser Verkaufs- und Finanzierungsvereinbarungen 2010 beginnen wird. Esso
Highlands ist der ausf&#252;hrende Unternehmer des Projekts. 

&#8222;Laut Prognosen wird sich die weltweite Nachfrage nach Fl&#252;ssigerdgas bis zum
Jahr 2030 fast verdreifachen. Damit wird das PNG-LNG-Projekt zu einer wichtigen
Bezugsquelle bei der Erf&#252;llung dieser zuk&#252;nftigen Nachfrage, insbesondere in den
L&#228;ndern des schnell wachsenden Wirtschaftsraums Asien-Pazifik", sagte Neil
Duffin, President der ExxonMobil Development Company. &#8222;Die Lieferung von
sauberer verbrennendem Erdgas wird dar&#252;ber hinaus dazu beitragen, die weltweiten
Emissionen zu minimieren. Die Genehmigung des PNG-LNG-Projekts durch die
Mitunternehmer ist ein bedeutender Meilenstein. Wir freuen uns darauf, unsere
ma&#223;geblichen Kompetenzen bei der Projektdurchf&#252;hrung anwenden zu k&#246;nnen und
gemeinsam mit der Regierung von PNG daran zu arbeiten, diese Reserven zu
erschlie&#223;en und zu f&#246;rdern." 

Der Premierminister von PNG, Sir Michael Somare, hatte den Vorsitz &#252;ber die
Zeremonie, an der Minister und Gouverneure der Regierung von PNG teilnahmen.
Somare sagte: &#8222;Der Projektbetreiber ExxonMobil und unsere anderen
Entwicklungspartner aus dem Privatsektor haben erhebliches Vertrauen in unser
Land gesetzt. Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen dem &#246;ffentlichen und dem privaten
Sektor wird f&#252;r die Gesellschaft von Papua-Neuguinea insgesamt wertvoll sein und
zum zuk&#252;nftigen Wachstum unserer Wirtschaft beitragen. 

Das PNG-LNG-Projekt ist ein integriertes Vorhaben, das Gaserzeugungs- und
Verarbeitungsanlagen, Onshore- und Offshore-Pipelines sowie
Verfl&#252;ssigungsanlagen mit einer Kapazit&#228;t von 6,6 Millionen Tonnen pro Jahr
umfasst. An dem Projekt beteiligt sind Zweiggesellschaften von ExxonMobil
(einschlie&#223;lich Esso Highlands Limited als Projektbetreiber, 33,2 Prozent), Oil
Search Limited (29,0 Prozent), Independent Public Business Corporation
(Regierung von PNG, 16,6 Prozent), Santos Limited (13,5 Prozent), Nippon Oil
Exploration (4,7 Prozent), Mineral Resources Development Company
(Grundeigent&#252;mer in PNG, 2,8 Prozent) und Petromin PNG Holdings Limited (0,2
Prozent). 

ExxonMobil beteiligt sich derzeit an der LNG-Erzeugung in Katar und Indonesien
mit einer Gesamt-Bruttokapazit&#228;t von &#252;ber 50 Millionen Tonne pro Jahr, womit die
M&#228;rkte in Asien, Europa und Nordamerika bedient werden. Dar&#252;ber hinaus beteiligt
sich das Unternehmen an der LNG-Gewinnung in Australien. Die Weltweite
LNG-Nachfrage wird bis 2030 voraussichtlich j&#228;hrlich um 4 Prozent steigen. Es
wird erwartet, dass LNG bis dahin etwa 15 Prozent der weltweiten Nachfrage nach
Erdgas decken wird.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase announced today that Dr. Jacob Frenkel will join the firm as
Chairman of JPMorgan Chase International, and will become a member of the
JPMorgan Chase Executive Committee and the International Council. 

Dr. Frenkel is the Chairman of the Group of Thirty (G30), a private, nonprofit
consultative group on international economic and monetary affairs, and plays
leadership roles in a number of other leading international organizations. From
1991 to 2000, he served for two terms as the Governor of the Bank of Israel,
where he is credited with reducing inflation, liberalizing Israel`s financial
markets, removing foreign exchange controls, and integrating the Israeli economy
into the global financial system. He most recently was a Vice Chairman of AIG,
and previously was Chairman of Merrill Lynch International, Inc. Earlier in his
career, he was Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Inter-American
Development Bank (IADB), and was also Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Dr. Frenkel has had
a distinguished academic career and was the David Rockefeller Professor of
International Economics at the University of Chicago. He was also the Economic
Counselor and Director of Research at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 

"I have known Jacob for many years and have had great respect and admiration for
him," said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. "He will be a
tremendous asset to our entire firm. I look forward to his partnership and
benefiting from his insight and advice. " 

"Few people have as much global experience in the financial industry, government
and academia as Jacob," said Jes Staley, CEO of the Investment Bank. "We are
confident his views and expertise will add great value to our company, and we
are pleased to have him join our team." 

In this new role, Dr. Frenkel will serve the firm on a number of important
fronts. He will work with senior management of JPMorgan Chase to help craft its
international strategy and advise on key macro trends and issues in the global
economy. Partnering with other leaders at the firm, he will liaise with global
regulatory and monetary authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the ECB,
other Central Banks, as well as supra-national financial institutions. He will
represent JPMorgan Chase at the Group of Thirty (G30), the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), Institute of International Finance (IIF), and other
organizations. In addition, he will also be a senior client executive with
international clients, including Central Banks, large financial institutions,
and Sovereign Wealth Funds, and will serve JPMorgan Chase on select
International Advisory Boards. He will report to Jes Staley. 

"I am delighted by the opportunity to join the superb team at JPMorgan Chase,"
said Dr. Frenkel. "I have admired the management team, financial performance and
the great global business that they've built. For me, this is an exciting time
to join the firm. The performance of the financial sector will be key to a
sustained economic recovery and few firms have the ability to play as much of a
leadership role in that turnaround as JPMorgan Chase. I look forward to the
opportunity to contribute to this important goal."

&lt;p&gt;* Energy demand to be about 35 percent higher in 2030 than it was in 2005 as
economies grow and living standards improve worldwide 
* Meeting demand will require trillions of dollars of investment and a

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Growing world economies will increase energy demand by about 35 percent in 2030
compared to 2005, requiring trillions of dollars in investment and a commitment
to innovation and technology, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) said today as
it released its new edition of Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030.

"In our energy outlook, we see many hopeful things - economic recovery and
growth, improved living standards and a reduction in poverty, and promising new
energy technologies," said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive
officer. "But we also see a tremendous challenge, and that is how to meet the
world`s growing energy needs while also reducing the impact of energy use on the
environment." 

Tillerson said supplies of all economic fuel sources need to be expanded to
satisfy projected increases in global energy demand and ensure reliable and
affordable energy to meet social, economic and environmental challenges. 

ExxonMobil notes that together, population and economic growth through 2030 will
continue to drive global energy demand higher. The world`s population is
expected to rise to almost 8 billion, creating new demands for energy for
personal needs such as fuels for cars and electricity for homes, but also energy
that is consumed indirectly to serve the broader society and economy. 

The Outlook includes an assessment of how potential carbon emission reduction
policies will affect future energy demand and impact the fuel mix. For example,
imposing higher costs for carbon emissions would impact energy prices and
provide an incentive to switch to less carbon-intensive fuels such as natural
gas, which can help meet growing electricity demand and help reduce power
generation emissions by up to 60 percent versus coal. 

Among this year`s findings:

* Rapid economic growth in developing countries that are not part of the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will increase
their energy demand by about 65 percent through 2030 compared to 2005. By
contrast, in OECD countries, energy demand is expected to be essentially flat
over the period to 2030, even though their economies will be more than 50
percent larger on average. 
* Efficiency gains are expected to accelerate between 2005 and 2030 versus
historical trends. Gains in energy efficiency will curb energy demand growth
through 2030 by about 65 percent. 
* There will be an expansion of natural gas supply, particularly in the United
States where unconventional gas supplies are expected to satisfy more than 50
percent of gas demand by 2030. 
* Power generation is the largest and fastest growing energy-demand sector and
represents 55 percent of the total growth in demand through 2030. At that time,
power generation will account for about 40 percent of total primary energy
demand. 
* Fossil fuels - oil, natural gas and coal - will continue to meet most of the
world`s needs during this period because no other energy source can match their
availability, versatility, affordability and scale. The fastest-growing of these
fuels will be natural gas, reflecting its abundance, versatility and economic
advantages as an efficient, clean-burning fuel for power generation. 
* Wind, solar, and biofuels will grow sharply through 2030, at nearly 10 percent
per year on average. However, because they are starting from a small base, their
contribution by 2030 will remain relatively small at about 2.5 percent of total
energy.

The Outlook for Energy is developed annually to assist ExxonMobil`s business
planning and to increase public understanding of the world`s energy needs and
challenges. The Outlook is developed through a detailed analysis of
approximately 100 countries, 15 demand sectors and 20 fuel types and is
underpinned by economic and population projections and expectations of
significant energy efficiency improvements and technology advancements.

Cautionary Statement:The Outlook and this release contain forward-looking
statements.Actual future conditions (including economic conditions, energy
demand, energy supply sources, and efficiency gains) could differ materially due
to changes in regulation and other political events, changes in technology, the
development of new supply sources, demographic changes, and other factors
discussed in the Outlook and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's latest Form 10-K.

&lt;p&gt;IBM is offering a hosted version of its Tivoli monitoring software for companies that would rather pay a subscription fee than license the product for on-premise use, IBM was set to announce Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service, called Tivoli Live Monitoring Services, lets companies keep tabs on between 25 and 500 IT resources, such as servers, operating systems, virtual machines and applications. It is targeted mainly at midsized companies, as well as departments within larger organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses need to be warned if an important application is about to crash or slows down, and services like this aim to achieve that by sending an alert to IT staff when server memory gets low, for example, or the response time for a Web page drops below a certain level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM service comes in two versions. One uses software agents to monitor operating systems, virtual machines and applications such as databases or packaged software such as Microsoft Exchange. That service costs US$58 per month for each resource monitored, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other is an agentless service, priced at $44 per resource per month, for monitoring hardware devices, operating systems, Web sites and SNMP alerts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both services carry a one-time setup fee of $6,500 per customer. IBM is also offering an optional reporting service, for a monthly fee of $15 per resource, which provides historical data for tasks such as troubleshooting and predicting capacity needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all about delivering enterprise-grade monitoring capabilities to clients without them having to deploy hardware or configure software," said Dennis Quan, director of development for autonomic computing with IBM's software group. "They can sign up for Tivoli Live Monitoring Services and all the monitoring smarts live up in the IBM cloud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM started offering the service in the U.S. last month, according to a company blog post, although it didn't announce it until Tuesday. The service is also being offered in other markets, starting with Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Africa and the Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the latest move by IBM to try to boost sales of its software through the cloud. IBM offers several products on Amazon Web Services, and last week it made Tivoli Monitoring available on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud to track instances of its software running on that service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM officials have admitted that their Tivoli Express products for the midmarket "haven't done as well as they could have," and the on-demand model provides IBM with another way to reach smaller businesses, RedMonk analyst Michael Cot&#233; wrote in a blog post about the new service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenge for Tivoli (and IBM in general) is always moving down-market and understanding how to get their fingers deep enough in that pie," he wrote. He commended IBM for being open about its pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several smaller companies already offer hosted monitoring services, such as Accelops, InteQ and ManageEngine, which is part of Zoho. Larger vendors, including Microsoft and BMC Software, are also developing services or have them already, Cot&#233; said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM products behind the services are Tivoli Monitoring 6.2.1, Tivoli Monitoring for Microsoft Applications 6.2, and Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Applications 6.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERTH (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) and partners gave final approval on Tuesday to a $15 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Papua New Guinea, adding to the tens of billions of dollars that energy majors are betting on Asia's appetite for gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widely expected approval, just three months after the A$43 billion ($39 billion) Chevron Corp (CVX.N)-led Gorgon LNG project was given the go-ahead, will allow shipments to start in 2014 to customers in Japan, China and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will also pave the way for Exxon and partners, including Australia's Oil Search Ltd (OSH.AX) and Santos Ltd (STO.AX) and Japan's Nippon Oil Corp 5001.T, to seek additional gas to expand the plant's initially planned 6.6 million tonnes per year capacity, which could significantly boost its profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With global demand for LNG forecast to nearly triple by 2030, the PNG LNG project will be an important supply source to meet this future demand, particularly for the economies in the fast growing Asia Pacific region," Neil Duffin, president of ExxonMobil Development Company, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said that the approval was pending completion of sales agreements with LNG buyers and finalization of financing arrangements, expected by early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venture has already signed binding agreements for the sale of a total 3.8 million tonnes per year (mtpy) of LNG to China's Sinopec Corp (0386.HK) and Japan's Tokyo Electric Power Co.

So those that are moving forward would have an edge and naturally be able to find buyers more easily because of the supply certainty," said John Harris, director of LNG at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the region already seeing a raft of LNG projects, analysts said many of them would probably not get off the ground, due to factors such as the inability to prove up gas reserves, a lack of capital for costly engineering studies and difficulties in getting all partners to commit to a project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=1.091 Australian Dollar)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Fayen Wong; Editing by Michael Urquhart)&lt;/p&gt;

be in construction, with the building of a 710-kilometre
pipeline across a mountainous tropical rainforest being the
largest risk to development costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The pipeline cost for the PNG development will be
significant and is probably the largest uncertainty in the
estimate of development costs," said Neil Beveridge, a senior
analyst at Bernstein Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, most analysts are confident that Exxon's track
record in building LNG projects on time and on budget would
mitigate such risks, adding that the recent upward revision of
the project cost would have already built in a reasonable
contingency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture is looking to prove up at least 2 trillion
cubic feet of gas needed to support a third production train,
with Oil Search already embarked on an aggressive drilling
programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said that any new capacity would not be a tough

reserves, a lack of capital for costly engineering studies and
difficulties in getting all partners to commit to a project.

Reruns will air in place of the occasional third-party movie where mobile rights haven't been secured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm doesn't reveal details of the financial relationships it has with the Big Four networks, but "there are parallels you can draw between our deals and affiliate deals," said Jonathan Barzilay, senior vice president of programing and advertising at FLO TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With ABC and Disney Channel, FLO TV's core offering expands to 17 channels; ATT Mobile Television and Verizon V Cast offer an additional couple of exclusive channels for their basic products.&lt;/p&gt;

 (Updates with analyst comments, details from SC statement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR Dec 8 (Reuters) - Malaysia has given U.S.
investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) licences to set up fund
management and advisory operations in the country, as the
Southeast Asia nation competes for foreign investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The licences were given as part of the liberalisation
measures announced by Prime Minister Najib Razak earlier this
year, the country's securities regulator, Securities Commission
Malaysia (SC), said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs' entry "demonstrates the group's confidence
in the growth opportunities available in the Malaysian capital

management industry was "very positive," said Tim Leissner,
co-President of Southeast Asia for Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We look forward to playing a larger role in their
development," Leissner said in the SC statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Malaysia in June unveiled a raft of measures to boost
investment in the slumping economy and lift a laggard stock
market, including waiving the condition that local companies
should reserve 30 percent of any post-IPO share sale to Malay
investors. [ID:nKLR467124]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corporate activity in Malaysia is expected to rise next

country's biggest mobile provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Malaysia is the worst-performing market in Asia so far this
year, up just 44 percent, compared to Indonesia's .JKSE more
than 80 percent gain and Thailand's .SETI 56 percent rise.

&lt;p&gt;IBM is introducing new Linux-focused mainframe bundles that it says will provide discounts of up to 80% over previous offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to really bury a mainframe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's mainframe business has struggled in 2009, with year-over-year revenue declines of 26% in the third quarter and 39% in the second quarter. But Linux has been a bright spot, with 70% of IBM's top 100 mainframe customers running Linux, according to Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to boost falling sales, IBM has taken several steps to lure new customers and capitalize on interest in consolidating Linux workloads on mainframes using IBM's virtualization technology. In August IBM released seven hardware, software and services packages which are known as the "Solution Edition Series" and are aimed at specific application workloads like data warehousing and SAP software. IBM also cut prices nearly in half for some specialty Linux processors known as Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In IBM's latest move, announced Tuesday, the company is releasing a new mainframe bundle called the Enterprise Linux Server, which starts at a little more than $200,000. The least expensive version includes two IFL processors, plus memory, I/O connectivity, licenses for the z/VM mainframe virtualization software, and three years worth of maintenance. The business class version can scale up to 10 IFLs, while the enterprise class machine can scale up to 64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savings per processor improve the more a customer buys, and can cost as much as 80% less than previous mainframe offerings, according to IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic $200,000 machine with two IFL processors can run about 50 Linux-based virtual machines, says Reed Mullen, IBM's System z virtualization strategy manager. IBM partners Novell and Red Hat are offering discounted Linux licenses when purchased with the Enterprise Linux Server. IBM hopes to lure customers away from competing platforms such as Itanium and Sun's Solaris, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has been successful in selling more capacity to existing Linux-on-mainframe customers, but has had trouble convincing new organizations of the economic benefits of putting Linux on System z, Mullen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to target not just existing mainframe clients with this solution, we also want to target non-mainframe clients who are waking up to some of the realities of large-scale server consolidation," he says. "We believe those who have yet to embrace Linux on the mainframe are ready to do so more aggressively."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Enterprise Linux Server, IBM is releasing two new Solution Edition bundles, one for Linux and one for Chordiant CRM software. While the Enterprise Linux Server is a stand-alone mainframe for new deployments, the Solution Edition bundles add capacity to existing machines, according to Mullen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because IBM mainframe's division is struggling, now is a good time for customers to negotiate with Big Blue, Gartner analyst Mike Chuba recently said. The Solution Edition bundles represent some of the best deals IBM has offered to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're going to go into a negotiation with IBM right now and want to get the best price, the first two words out of your mouth should be 'solution edition,'" Chuba said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Notes on William Dudley Speech

"On the liquidity front, there are a host of initiatives underway. For starters,
the Federal Reserve is now supervising most of the holding companies of the
systemically important financial institutions. That was not true at the start of
the crisis. So, for example, the holding companies of Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS),
Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Merrill Lynch, which is now a subsidiary of Bank
of America (NYSE: BAC), are now under our direct supervision. We are making sure
that they have appropriate liquidity buffers and capital.

"Second, the Federal Reserve is working with a broad range of private sector
participants, including dealers, clearing banks and tri-party repo investors to
dramatically reduce the structural instability of the financial system
utilities, such as the tri-party repo system.

"Third, the Basel Committee is working on establishing international standards
for liquidity requirements. There are two parts to this. The first is a
requirement for a short-term liquidity buffer of sufficient size so that an
institution that was shut out of the market for several weeks would still have
sufficient liquidity to continue its operations unimpaired. The second is a
liquidity standard that limits the degree of permissible maturity transformation
-- that is, the amount of short-term borrowing allowed to be used in the funding
of long-term illiquid assets. Under these standards, a firm`s holdings of
illiquid long-term assets would need to be funded mainly by equity or long-term
debt."

Mismatches between long-term assets and short-term liabilities can always create
problems, but it is also a big part of the economic function of banks. Banks
make most of their money (at least traditionally) by borrowing at low interest
rates for short-term money (checking deposits for example) and lending at high
rates long-term (a 30-year mortgage, for example). 

"There is also work underway on the problem of how to ensure that financial
institutions have compensation structures that curb rather than encourage
excessive risk-taking. This issue of compensation is obviously a hugely potent
one, as there is a fundamental unfairness in what has happened over the past few
years.

"The actions taken by the Federal Reserve and others to stabilize the financial
system had the effect of rescuing many of the same financial institutions that
contributed to this crisis. Many of those financial institutions are now
prospering, and many of their employees will be highly compensated. This
situation is unfair on its face. But it is even more galling in an environment
in which the unemployment rate is 10 percent and many people are struggling to
make ends meet.

"Despite the fundamental unfairness of the situation, I don`t think it is
feasible or practical for the Federal Reserve, or any other supervisory entity,
to attempt to determine the level of compensation at individual firms on an
ongoing basis. A better approach is for supervisors to ensure that a firm`s
compensation regime is consistent with an institution`s safety and soundness and
with broader financial stability.

"That can and should have important implications for the level of individual
compensation. For example, a trader should not be paid solely on the basis of
this year`s accounting profits if those profits are based on the valuation of
illiquid assets held on the bank`s books that could easily go down considerably
in value before they are liquidated."

I agree that that level of micro-management is not appropriate. However, the Fed
and other regulators should be able to make sure that there are not perverse
incentives for bankers to take on too much risk by setting up "heads I win,
tails I break even and someone else loses" compensation structures. As far as
the overall level of pay is concerned, a progressive income tax is probably the
best tool in that regard. 

"The Fed is in the process of implementing a framework that will embed
compensation practices more deeply into the supervisory process. We have made it
clear to the major banks and dealers that 2009 compensation should be consistent
with the recently developed Financial Stability Board principles on
compensation, which emphasize the importance of appropriate incentives.

"Finally, there is considerable work underway on the 'too big to fail' problem.
On this front, there are two main strands of work. First, we must improve the
resolution mechanisms for large complex bank holding companies and nonbank
financial firms that become troubled, and to complement that initiative with
efforts to strengthen the financial market infrastructure. If regulators had at
their disposal an effective resolution mechanism for large financial firms and
the financial system was made more resilient to shocks, then the number of firms
that were indeed 'too big to fail' would be significantly reduced.

"Second, after building such a resolution mechanism, we must still act to ensure
that no special advantage persists from being perceived by creditors,
counterparties and investors as 'too big to fail.' After all, it will be hard to
build a resolution mechanism that credibly ensures that any firm will be allowed
to fail under any circumstance. If there is a chance that a firm may be too big
to fail, then there should be an explicit quid pro quo for that status in the
form of higher capital and liquidity requirements. For example, contingent
capital could be made a part of any additional regulatory capital requirements
for 'too-big-to-fail' firms."

The real solution to "too big to fail" is that if a firm becomes that big it
really is too big to exist. Tax-free spin-offs to shareholders would be the
fairest way of going about this. I would in particular like to see a return to
something more like the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial banks
from investment banks. 

However, the crisis moved us 180 degrees in the other direction as J.P. Morgan
(NYSE: JPM) ended up owning Bear Stearns and Bank of America ended up with
Merrill Lynch. Unscrambling that egg will be tough to do. Having a resolution
mechanism for such institutions is critical, so there is some path between
paying everyone off at 110 cents on the dollar (for example, what happened with
the AIG [NYSE: AIG] counter-parties) and letting the institution collapse.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former senior IBM executive denied being involved in a sprawling hedge fund insider trading case and asked the court to dismiss a civil complaint by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Moffat, who was replaced as head of the IBM hardware division on October 30, did admit to speaking to co-defendant Danielle Chiesi but "denies that he provided material nonpublic information" on IBM, Sun Microsystems and Advanced Micro Devices, according to a filing in Manhattan federal court by his lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffat was arrested on civil and criminal charges on October 16. He was accused of passing on insider information in a case that ensnared Galleon Management LP hedge fund, its billionaire founder Raj Rajaratnam and a score of traders and employees, most of them with expertise in tech stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chiesi traded on behalf of the New Castle hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Defendant Moffat demands judgment dismissing the amended complaint and such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper," said the filing by his lawyers in Manhattan federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Bob Iger said on Wednesday he felt "really good" about the improving advertising front, saying sales for last-minute TV spots were up in the mid-20s percent range versus longer-term deals signed by marketing customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iger's comments at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference reflect an uptick from the 20 percent increase cited by Disney just last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His remarks added to a growing perception that the advertising market has begun to improve after one of the worst stretches in decades, when the recession combined with the auto industry's troubles caused a major drop in marketing budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the media conference this week, CBS Corp Chief Executive Les Moonves and Discovery Communications Chief Executive David Zaslav also said advertising spending was on the upswing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I noted with interest Les Moonves' comment about scatter running 25 percent above upfront.

 By Sue Zeidler

 LOS ANGELES, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) Chief
Executive Bob Iger said on Wednesday he felt "really good"
about the improving advertising front, saying sales for
last-minute TV spots were up in the mid-20s percent range
versus longer-term deals signed by marketing customers.

 Iger's comments at the UBS Global Media and Communications
Conference reflect an uptick from the 20 percent increase cited
by Disney just last month.

 His remarks added to a growing perception that the
advertising market has begun to improve after one of the worst
stretches in decades, when the recession combined with the auto
industry's troubles caused a major drop in marketing budgets.

 At the media conference this week, CBS Corp (CBS.N) Chief
Executive Les Moonves and Discovery Communications (DISCA.O)
Chief Executive David Zaslav also said advertising spending was
on the upswing.

 "I noted with interest Les Moonves' comment about scatter
running 25 percent above upfront. We have a similar
experience," Iger said on Wednesday, using standard industry
terms to refer to the last-minute market, known as scatter, and
the advance market, known as upfront.

 "In some cases, we're writing scatter business that is
substantially higher than that, but I think it would be safe to
assume that, generally speaking, it's running in the mid-20s
above upfront," he said.

 Even in the newspaper business, which faced a one-two punch
of the recession and a drop in circulation, advertising appears
to be creeping back.

 Media General Inc (MEG.N), owner of newspapers and TV
stations, said on Wednesday that "spending patterns have
firmed" this quarter. The New York Times Co (NYT.N) and
McClatchy Co (MNI.N) issued similar assessments at the
conference.

 Executives noted that advertising is bouncing from
depressed levels, and has a way to go before a full recovery.
Other parts of the media business are not yet out of the woods
either.

 At Disney, Iger said bookings and attendance in its theme
parks division were "reasonably OK" although the company was
still discounting to get those levels.

 "In a tough economy with some uncertainty out there and
consumer confidence still relatively low, it would be premature
for us to say that we're seeing a strong rebound," he said.

 When asked if Disney, which is in the process of completing
its $4 billion acquisition of comic-book giant Marvel
Entertainment, was looking into video-game acquisitions, Iger
sidestepped the question, noting that Disney needs to remain
flexible due to changes in that sector.

 "I'm not going to suggest we're looking for a big
acquisition in that area. Maybe that is what you wanted me to
confirm. I think we have to really be flexible," he said.

 Earlier, he said the growth of casual games was enormous
and compelling. "There's definitely going to be a migration
from physical goods to goods that are delivered digitally or
online," said Iger.

 Shares of Disney were steady, trading up 3 cents at $30.71
on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;IBM has expanded its server lineup with a new mainframe system designed just for Linux that may be aimed, in particular, at higher-end x86 systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new system uses IBM's specialty Linux processor and runs either Novell SUSE or Red Hat systems. It does not use the mainframe operating system z/OS but includes mainframe management software as well as IBM's z/Virtual Machine system. Together, they constitute the company's latest "solutions edition," or what IBM says are lower-cost, integrated stacks for the mainframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two servers in the Enterprise Linux Server line, and the starting price on the lower-end model, with two processors, is $212,000; it scales up from there. This system is intended to be competitive with large multicore systems used for virtualization consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Linux-specific line is IBM's latest effort to reduce the cost of its mainframe. It's high-end z10 Enterprise Class system can cost millions. But several years ago, IBM started producing a smaller model, the z10 Business Class , which was initially offered at about $100,000, to compete with a broader range of enterprise servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reed Mullen, the System z virtualization lead product planner, said that potential customers include companies that want to virtualize a lot of systems but aren't necessarily mainframe customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the arguments that IBM will make for this system is its ability to dynamically add capacity in a running environment, Mullen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM expects to upgrade its z10 next year , in keeping with its three-year upgrade cycle. IBM's mainframe sales have been off 26% in the most recent quarter compared with the same quarter last year, and server sales have been flat across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Day, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., said IBM has been working to reduce the cost of its mainframe software, which can account for half the cost of a mainframe, including personnel, energy and maintenance. With this new hardware, IBM likely wants to compete with x86 systems with 16 processor cores and above, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything that lowers the life-cycle cost of the system is critical, and by focusing on Linux, IBM is "putting meat to where most of the workloads are going," Day said. "About half of the new growth of applications on mainframe is led by Linux."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 9 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. has drawn
more orders for the largest commercial mortgage bond since
mid-2008 than can be filled at proposed prices, suggesting firm
demand for new conservative securities in an otherwise sketchy
market, according to an offering document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The $500 million issue backed by retail properties of the
Inland Western Retail Real Estate Trust is oversubscribed in
the top two, AAA-rated, portions, according to the document
reviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inland Western's top-rated bonds are being marketed at
yields that are 1.5 to 2.2 percentage points over an
interest-rate benchmark, about a third current levels on
existing CMBS made at the height of the real estate boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The demand is also notable because it is the first time
underwriters have asked investors to purchase CMBS with a
10-year maturity since the market seized up in mid-2008 when
the credit crunch and recession took hold. The most recent
issue, a seven-year CMBS backed by Fortress Investment Group
properties, sold at a 2.25 percentage point premium over a rate
benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yield premiums on old CMBS have declined amid expected
demand from federal programs. But overhanging those issues are
rising defaults as the recession cuts revenue needed to service
the debt, a dearth of equity relative to the loans and a lack
of credit needed to refinance maturing mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like the Fortress issue, underwriters bet demand for the
Inland Western issue is strong enough to sidestep use of a
Federal Reserve's emergency program. The first CMBS since
mid-2008, a $400 million bond from Developers Diversified
Realty Corp., on Nov. 16 sold with marginal help from
Fed-funded investors.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may begin collecting royalties again for licensing some protocols because clear technical documentation is now available, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change comes after the DOJ issued its latest joint status report regarding its 2002 antitrust settlement with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement required Microsoft to make available technical documentation that would allow other vendors to make products that are interoperable with Microsoft's Windows operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program, called the Microsoft Communications Protocol Program (MCPP), allowed vendors to license certain protocols from Microsoft. But Microsoft and the DOJ disagreed over the quality of the documentation, and Microsoft engineers had to rewrite large tracts of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ said the plaintiffs now regard the documentation as "substantially complete" although "a small number of documents require substantial rewriting or reorganization," the DOJ said. Also, test suites for Windows 7 protocols must be written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, 55 companies are licensing patents for communications protocols. Forty-two of those companies would be required to pay royalties. Some protocols are available for free from Microsoft, and the DOJ said documents describing protocols have been downloaded more than 732,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another part of the status report, the DOJ said a new "substantive complaint" against Microsoft was received in September. The state plaintiffs and the technical committee "are currently engaged in ongoing discussions with both Microsoft and the complainant." No further information was available.&lt;/p&gt;

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
La croissance des &#233;conomies mondiales va faire augmenter la demande en &#233;nergie
d`environ 35 % en 2030 par rapport &#224; 2005, n&#233;cessitant d`investir des billions
de dollars et de s`engager envers l`innovation et la technologie, a d&#233;clar&#233;
aujourd`hui Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE : XOM) alors que la soci&#233;t&#233; publiait
sa nouvelle &#233;dition de Perspectives en mati&#232;re d`&#233;nergie : regard &#224; l`horizon
2030(Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030).

&#171; Dans nos perspectives concernant l`&#233;nergie, nous voyons de nombreux &#233;l&#233;ments
encourageants (la reprise et la croissance &#233;conomiques, de meilleurs niveaux de
vie et une baisse de la pauvret&#233;, ainsi que des technologies d`&#233;nergies
nouvelles prometteuses &#187;, a indiqu&#233; Rex W. Tillerson, pr&#233;sident-directeur
g&#233;n&#233;ral. &#171; Mais nous y voyons aussi un &#233;norme d&#233;fi, &#224; savoir comment r&#233;pondre
aux besoins croissants en &#233;nergie de la plan&#232;te tout en r&#233;duisant l`impact de
l`utilisation d`&#233;nergie sur l`environnement. &#187; 

M. Tillerson a d&#233;clar&#233; que les ressources de toutes les sources &#233;conomiques de
carburants devaient &#234;tre &#233;tendues pour satisfaire aux augmentations projet&#233;es de
la demande mondiale en &#233;nergie et assurer une &#233;nergie fiable et abordable pour
relever les d&#233;fis sociaux, &#233;conomiques et environnementaux. 

ExxonMobil fait remarquer qu`ensemble, la croissance d&#233;mographique et &#233;conomique
jusqu`&#224; 2030 va continuer &#224; faire augmenter la demande mondiale en &#233;nergie.
Selon les estimations, la population mondiale devrait augmenter pour atteindre
pr&#232;s de 8 milliards, cr&#233;ant de nouvelles demandes en &#233;nergie pour les besoins
personnels comme du carburant pour les automobiles et de l`&#233;lectricit&#233; pour les
foyers, mais aussi de l`&#233;nergie consomm&#233;e indirectement pour r&#233;pondre aux
besoins plus g&#233;n&#233;raux de la soci&#233;t&#233; et de l`&#233;conomie. 

Les Perspectives comprennent une &#233;valuation de l`impact des politiques de
r&#233;duction des &#233;missions de CO2 sur la demande future en &#233;nergie et sur la
composition en carburants. Par exemple, imposer des co&#251;ts plus &#233;lev&#233;s pour les
&#233;missions de CO2 aurait des r&#233;percussions sur le prix de l`&#233;nergie et inciterait
&#224; passer &#224; des carburants moins consommateurs de carbone, comme le gaz naturel,
ce qui peut aider &#224; satisfaire &#224; la demande croissante en &#233;lectricit&#233; et &#224;
r&#233;duire les &#233;missions provenant de la g&#233;n&#233;ration d`&#233;lectricit&#233; jusqu`&#224; 60 % par
rapport au charbon. 

Parmi les conclusions de cette ann&#233;e :

* La rapide croissance &#233;conomique dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement qui ne font pas
partie de l`Organisation de coop&#233;ration et de d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomiques (OCDE)
va augmenter leur demande en &#233;nergie d`environ 65 % jusqu`en 2030 par rapport &#224;
2005. En revanche, dans les pays de l`OCDE, la demande en &#233;nergie devrait rester
essentiellement inchang&#233;e durant la p&#233;riode jusqu`en 2030, alors que leurs
&#233;conomies seront plus de 50 % plus importantes en moyenne. 
* Les gains en efficience devraient s`acc&#233;l&#233;rer entre 2005 et 2030 par rapport
aux tendances historiques. Les gains en efficience &#233;nerg&#233;tique r&#233;duiront la
croissance de la demande en &#233;nergie jusqu`en 2030 d`environ 65 %. 
* Il y aura une expansion des ressources en gaz naturel, en particulier aux
&#201;tats-Unis o&#249; les ressources en gaz non conventionnelles devraient satisfaire &#224;
plus de 50 % de la demande en gaz d`ici 2030. 
* La g&#233;n&#233;ration d`&#233;lectricit&#233; est le secteur de demande en &#233;nergie le plus
important et &#224; la croissance la plus rapide et repr&#233;sente 55 % de la croissance
totale de la demande jusqu`en 2030, date &#224; laquelle la g&#233;n&#233;ration d`&#233;lectricit&#233;
repr&#233;sentera environ 40 % de la demande totale en &#233;nergie primaire. 
* Les combustibles fossiles (p&#233;trole, gaz naturel et charbon) vont continuer &#224;
r&#233;pondre &#224; la plupart des besoins de la plan&#232;te durant cette p&#233;riode, car aucune
autre source d`&#233;nergie ne peut les &#233;galer en termes de disponibilit&#233;,
polyvalence, co&#251;t abordable et &#233;chelle. Le combustible &#224; la croissance la plus
rapide parmi ceux-ci sera le gaz naturel, refl&#233;tant son abondance, sa
polyvalence et ses avantages &#233;conomiques comme combustible rentable et br&#251;lant
proprement pour la g&#233;n&#233;ration d`&#233;lectricit&#233;. 
* L`&#233;olien, le solaire et les biocarburants augmenteront fortement jusqu`en
2030, &#224; pr&#232;s de 10 % par an en moyenne. Toutefois, &#233;tant donn&#233; qu`ils partent
d`une petite base, leur contribution d`ici 2030 demeurera relativement peu
&#233;lev&#233;e, &#224; environ 2,5 % de l`&#233;nergie totale.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company announced today that it has resumed drilling on
two wells started earlier this year at Point Thomson and is on schedule to reach
total depth by year-end 2010. The company drilled each of the wells, PTU-15 and
PTU-16, to approximately 5,000 feet during the summer, as deep as possible
during the ice-free season. Drilling into deeper formations is permitted only
during the period November 1 through April 15. 

This season`s drilling program follows a successful summer work program which
safely delivered over 30,000 tons of fuel, equipment and supplies in 120 barge
runs from the Prudhoe Bay West Dock, some 60 miles west of the Point Thomson
drilling site. 

"We are making real progress at Point Thomson, and are on schedule to start
production in 2014," said Dale Pittman, Alaska Production Manager for
ExxonMobil. "The development plan we are pursuing will bring Point Thomson
resources on production in a prudent, efficient and timely manner. ExxonMobil
appreciates the hard work and accomplishments of Point Thomson contractors, as
well as the diligence of the state and regional regulatory agencies, to move
this important project forward. We are working to resolve the unit and lease
dispute with the Department of Natural Resources to ensure Point Thomson`s
development continues." 

He also noted, "The project owners have invested more than $300 million to date,
80 percent of which has been spent in Alaska. We have accomplished this work
while maintaining the safety of our workforce and protection of the sensitive
environment. Safety of the people and the environment at Point Thomson is the
project`s top priority." 

Point Thomson is a natural gas and condensate field located on Alaska`s North
Slope. It holds an estimated 8 trillion cubic feet of gas - about 25 percent of
the North Slope's gas resource - and about 200 million barrels of condensate.
Development of these resources will present significant technical challenges,
including drilling and production of a high pressure gas reservoir. 

ExxonMobil will continue to bring innovative technology and world-class project
management expertise to develop Point Thomson. The project will process 200
million cubic feet per day of natural gas in order to produce approximately
10,000 barrels per day of liquid condensate into the Trans Alaska Pipeline
System, with capacity for up to 10,000 additional barrels of oil per day. After
processing, the natural gas will be recycled into the reservoir, making Point
Thomson the highest-pressure gas cycling operation in the world. Gas from the
Point Thomson field will play a key role to underpin a future Alaskan gas
pipeline project. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Estimates, expectations, and business plans in this
release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including
resource recoveries, production rates, and project plans, schedules, and costs
could differ materially due to changes in market conditions affecting the oil
and gas industry or long-term oil and gas price levels; political or regulatory
developments; the outcome of negotiations; reservoir performance; timely
completion of development projects; technical or operating factors; and other
factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the
Investor Information section of our website (www.exxonmobil.com) and in Item 1A
of our most recent Form 10-K. References to hydrocarbon resources, gas, barrels
of liquid condensate, and similar terms include quantities of oil and gas that
are not yet classified as proved reserves but that we believe will be produced
in the future.

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Las econom&#237;as mundiales en crecimiento aumentar&#225;n la demanda energ&#233;tica en
aproximadamente un 35% en 2030, en comparaci&#243;n con 2005, y ser&#225;n necesarios
billones de d&#243;lares en inversiones y un compromiso con la innovaci&#243;n y la
tecnolog&#237;a, afirm&#243; hoy Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), mientras dio a
conocer su nueva edici&#243;n de Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030 (Perspectivas
energ&#233;ticas: una visi&#243;n hacia 2030).

"En nuestra perspectiva energ&#233;tica, vemos muchas esperanzas, recuperaci&#243;n
econ&#243;mica y crecimiento, est&#225;ndares de vida mejorados y una reducci&#243;n en la
pobreza, al igual que nuevas y prometedoras tecnolog&#237;as energ&#233;ticas", expres&#243;
Rex W. Tillerson, presidente y director ejecutivo. "Pero tambi&#233;n vemos un enorme
desaf&#237;o: c&#243;mo cubrir las crecientes necesidades energ&#233;ticas en el mundo y a la
vez reducir el impacto del uso de la energ&#237;a sobre el medioambiente". 

Tillerson coment&#243;: los suministros de todas las fuentes de combustible
econ&#243;micas deben expandirse para cubrir los aumentos proyectados en la demanda
mundial de energ&#237;a y garantizar energ&#237;a confiable y rentable para enfrentar los
desaf&#237;os ambientales, econ&#243;micos y sociales. 

ExxonMobil destaca que, en conjunto, la poblaci&#243;n y el crecimiento econ&#243;mico
hasta 2030 continuar&#225;n aumentando cada vez m&#225;s la demanda mundial de energ&#237;a. Se
espera que la poblaci&#243;n mundial aumente a casi 8.000 millones de habitantes,
situaci&#243;n que generar&#225; nuevas demandas de energ&#237;a para necesidades personales,
como combustibles para los veh&#237;culos y electricidad para los hogares, pero
adem&#225;s aumentar&#225; la demanda de energ&#237;a que se consume en forma indirecta para
servir a la econom&#237;a y a la sociedad en un sentido m&#225;s general. 

La perspectiva incluye una evaluaci&#243;n de la forma en que las pol&#237;ticas
potenciales de reducci&#243;n de emisiones de carbono afectar&#225;n la demanda energ&#233;tica
futura e impactar&#225;n sobre la mezcla de combustible. Por ejemplo, la imposici&#243;n
de mayores costos sobre las emisiones de carbono impactar&#237;a sobre los precios de
la energ&#237;a y ser&#237;a un incentivo para cambiar a combustibles con menor contenido
de carbono como el gas natural, lo que podr&#237;a ayudar a cubrir la demanda
creciente de electricidad y reducir hasta en un 60% las emisiones provenientes
de la generaci&#243;n de energ&#237;a en comparaci&#243;n con el carb&#243;n. 

Entre los descubrimientos de este a&#241;o, se encuentran:

* El r&#225;pido crecimiento econ&#243;mico de los pa&#237;ses en v&#237;as de desarrollo que no
forman parte de la Organizaci&#243;n para la Cooperaci&#243;n y el Desarrollo Econ&#243;mico
(OCDE) aumentar&#225; la demanda de energ&#237;a en aproximadamente un 65% para 2030, en
comparaci&#243;n con 2005. Por el contrario, en los pa&#237;ses que participan en la OCDE,
se espera que la demanda energ&#233;tica se mantenga estable hasta el a&#241;o 2030,
aunque sus econom&#237;as crecer&#225;n m&#225;s del 50% en promedio. 
* Se espera que las ganancias en eficiencia se aceleren entre 2005 y 2030 en
comparaci&#243;n con las tendencias hist&#243;ricas. Las ganancias en eficiencia
energ&#233;tica frenar&#225;n el crecimiento de la demanda energ&#233;tica en un 65% hasta el
a&#241;o 2030. 
* Habr&#225; una expansi&#243;n en los suministros de gas natural, particularmente en los
Estados Unidos, donde se espera que los suministros de gas provenientes de
fuentes no convencionales cubran m&#225;s del 50% de la demanda de gas para 2030. 
* La producci&#243;n energ&#233;tica es el sector de demanda de energ&#237;a m&#225;s grande y de
mayor crecimiento, y representa el 55% del crecimiento total en la demanda hasta
2030. En ese momento, la producci&#243;n energ&#233;tica representar&#225; alrededor del 40%
del total de la demanda principal de energ&#237;a. 
* Los combustibles f&#243;siles -petr&#243;leo, gas natural y carb&#243;n- continuar&#225;n
cubriendo la mayor&#237;a de las necesidades mundiales durante este per&#237;odo debido a

&lt;p&gt;Today was Microsoft's final Patch Tuesday of 2009. Microsoft released a total of six new security bulletins, the most urgent one affecting a zero-day flaw in Internet Explorer for which exploit code already exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barring any urgent security issues or exploits circulating in the wild to force an out-of-band update, the total number of security bulletins for 2009 is 74--a 5 percent drop from the 78 security bulletins released in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deal with MS09-072 First&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts are unanimous that the MS09-072 security bulletin, which includes the cumulative security update for Internet Explorer, is by far the most urgent patch released by Microsoft today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Storms, director of security operations for nCircle, said in an email "Topping today's news from Microsoft is the fix for a critical zero-day bug in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability became a top security concern for users when exploit code became publicly available. In recognition of the critical nature of the problem, Microsoft made the fix a top priority and delivered it in about two weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another nCircle security expert, senior security engineer Tyler Reguly, agreed "Number one on everyone's hit list today should be MS09-072, the IE patch, as this includes a patch for the current IE 0-day vulnerability. Patching IE is always crucial but given the public exploit, this should be patched as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Amol Sarwate, manager of Qualys Vulnerabilities Research Lab, who summed it up "MS09-072 is definitely the most urgent. The vulnerability was made public three weeks ago. Attackers have had three weeks to work with the proof-of-concept and develop a workable exploit. If you can only do one patch, do that one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reguly said that beyond MS09-072 the rest of today's security bulletins are sort of a random mash-up of fixes. They involve a most of the alphabet and a number of acronyms, affecting LSASS, ADFS, and IAS for starters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of things, though, there is nothing very urgent once you patch Internet Explorer. Reguly recommends that organizations take the time to properly test the remaining patches before deploying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer Fail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not have noticed, but "Cumulative Update for Internet Explorer" is a permanent fixture on the monthly list of security bulletins from Microsoft, and as far as I can recall it is always rated as Critical. As more applications and services are run directly from the cloud, the Web browser will become even more of a security Achilles heel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I talked with Qualys chief technology officer Wolfgang Kandek who noted that a significant percentage of Qualys customers still rely on Internet Explorer 6. He suggested that most of the weaknesses being faced could be eliminated by simply adopting Internet Explorer 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;nCircle's Storms' points out, however, that "Microsoft's secure code development practices are going to come under scrutiny again because today's IE update includes fixes for two previously non-public exploits that only affect IE8, the newest browser from Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms' elaborated "There's no way for Microsoft to avoid the speculation that these bugs should have been found during the software development and quality assurance cycle, but the reality is that this was bound to happen. Every product has bugs and more features means greater attack surfaces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't Drag Yourself Down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kandek feels that Microsoft is firmly focused on Windows 7 and would like to keep its eyes--and developers--on the future, but that the massive base of Windows XP installations can't be ignored. As much as Microsoft might like to walk away from supporting the legacy operating system, Windows XP will still be around for a while. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its worth noting that Windows 7 has not been directly affected by any of the 12 security bulletins that have been released since it hit the streets. Windows 7 is peripherally affected by the Internet Explorer issues addressed in MS09-072, and there is the ongoing exploration into what is causing the mysterious black screen of death, but no confirmed Windows 7 flaws as of yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, Internet Explorer 6 is like swiss cheese compared with IE8 from a security perspective. Its also a nightmare for Web Administrators and users who try to do things like view Web pages. The recent Microsoft Security Intelligence Report showed that Windows XP is 75 percent more likely to be compromised than Windows 7. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As weak as those two products are compared with their more modern equivalents, many organizations still rely on them. Those organizations need to take another look at Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 8 and the potential savings in terms of support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Windows XP and Internet Explorer 6 and then complaining about the security of Microsoft products is like driving your car around dragging a boat anchor and then complaining that you're getting poor gas mileage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bradley tweets as @PCSecurityNews, and can be contacted at his Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/184061&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 with Hyper-V and DataCore Software`s Storage
Virtualization Power the New Virtual Infrastructure at this Wholesale
Distributor
SEATTLE &amp; FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
DataCore Software, a leading provider of storage virtualization, business
continuity and disaster recovery software solutions, today announced its
SANmelody storage virtualization solution has been deployed along with Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V at Northwest Wholesale Florists (NWF) in Seattle.
Family-owned and operated, NWF is a distributor of fresh-cut flowers, potted
plants and floral supplies in downtown Seattle. "What we have found with the
DataCore and Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 + Hyper-V combination is a virtual
infrastructure that is redundant, reliable, flexible and expandable," stated
Mary Toupin, Office Manager, Northwest Wholesale Florists. "Moreover, the
redundant storage with DataCore complements the redundancy built into the VM
system. We are very pleased with the way the system has performed." 

A Virtual Infrastructure that Combines Servers and Storage - with Live Migration
Functionality

As their trusted technology advisor, NWF relies on the IT counsel and direction
from Moose Logic. Moose Logic`s recommendation was that what it needed was a
more resilient, highly-available system leveraging virtualization and storage
area network (SAN) technology, while at the same time improving the performance
of NWF`s key applications - Macola, Microsoft Exchange, Outlook, Office as well
as a few other applications to support point of sale, credit card swipes, etc.
The objective was also to improve data protection for NWF - through a backup
solution and other measures. 

According to Doug Otani, General Manager, Northwest Wholesale Florists, "Our IT
environment is now comprised of a virtual infrastructure whereby DataCore
SANmelody is deployed in conjunction with a clustered Hyper-V system. With a
Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V cluster, our company now has the ability to live
migrate our virtual machines (VMs). Because these VMs can `live migrate` between
the two hosts, the DataCore-Hyper-V virtual infrastructure minimizes and even
eliminates downtime - when we need to do system maintenance." 

The original desire to upgrade its IT infrastructure was driven by the fact that
NWF was moving to a new warehouse - and needed to do that while running
operations from the existing warehouse. NWF looked to Moose Logic to design a
new IT infrastructure system and provide a smooth transition. In this case,
Moose Logic thought that there were a number of benefits in deploying Hyper-V,
even before the release of Windows Server 2008 R2. However, after the R2 release
of Windows Server 2008, Hyper-V has been infused with live migration
functionality - which was not in Hyper-V prior to R2. "As a reseller, the
combination of DataCore with Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 with Hyper-V gives
our firm and this customer a lot of flexibility," commented Scott Gorcester,
President, Moose Logic, a solutions provider and DataCore partner in the Pacific
Northwest. "Using DataCore storage virtualization combined with Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 R2 and Hyper-V in joint configurations is already proving to
be a great combination for both resellers and users alike." 

Re-purposing Existing Hardware and Deploying Windows Server 2008 R2 with Hyper-V

Knowing that there were two sound pieces of hardware that could be re-purposed,
Moose Logic recommended a solution based on Windows Server 2008 R2 running
Hyper-V. The firm built the customer two Hyper-V servers with System Center
Virtual Machine Manager, running in a failover cluster. Coupled with the
clustered pair of Hyper-V servers is a pair of DataCore SANmelody servers - one
on an existing HP DL 380 G5 that was repurposed after adding new disk drives and
more memory and the other on a new HP DL 380 G5 server to match the existing
one. These G5 servers became the SAN nodes. This system went live at the
customer`s new location on October 1, 2009. Thirty-plus (30+) users benefit from
the system daily. 

Delivering Peace of Mind and Avoiding Unnecessary Downtime

Scott Gorcester of Moose Logic, who assured the management team at NWF that the
Windows 2008 Server with Hyper-V was the right way to go, concluded, "The
bottom-line is that with the DataCore and Windows 2008 Server R2 with Hyper-V
environment, NWF can weather multiple equipment failures and continue to run its
business, which ultimately provides peace of mind because the virtual
infrastructure avoids unnecessary downtime." 

Gorcester sees the deployment as having been "very, very successful." And
according to him, the performance and stability of the system have been
excellent. 

"We have actually had a Hyper-V server fail as a result of the hardware device,
which was an easy fix," explained Gorcester. "It has not happened again, but the
thing that was just beautiful was that the VMs auto-migrated and there was no
downtime at all. My response to the client was, `The bad news is one of your
servers failed. The good news is it had zero effect on the operation of your
business.` It was the first time I think I ever went to a client and said, `You
had a failure.` And they replied, `Wow, it worked perfectly.`"

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA, Dec 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Continuing to change the way teams collect data and collaborate, Adapx
(www.adapx.com) today announced the availability of Capturx(TM) for
Microsoft(R) Office OneNote(R) 2.0. In addition to new support for larger
8-1/2 x 11 notebooks, the upgraded product also now enables the printing
of unlimited blank notebook sheets on ordinary paper for use with Capturx
digital pens and OneNote. Teams simply write in Capturx notebooks or on
blank printed pages with digital pens. All the information is
automatically integrated into OneNote -- where it is backed up,
searchable, and sharable in email or other Microsoft Office applications.

    "Capturx for OneNote has been tremendously successful with helping mobile
workers reliably capture and share notes written in the all-weather Rite
in the Rain(R) notebooks," said Ken Schneider, president and CEO of
Adapx. "We're very pleased to now provide customers with even more
note-taking options through our larger notebooks and print-your-own
notebooks and sheets."

    "With Capturx for OneNote we never have to worry about important
information languishing in personal notebooks," said ShaRonne Hansen,
Fleet Medical Crew Manager, Holland America Line. "With an unlimited
ability to print, not only does Capturx speed our ability to capture and
share information, it also decreases the amount of time spent searching
and retyping information."

    A broad range of industries and agencies, including construction,
military, government, healthcare, and utilities, rely on Capturx to
automate paperwork without missing documents, struggling with mobile
computers, or waiting and paying for data to be scanned or retyped.

    How it Works

    Capturx for OneNote automatically integrates handwritten notes and
sketches written with digital pens into Microsoft OneNote. Teams simply
write in Capturx notebooks or on printed sheets with digital pens, which
write with normal ink. When the pen is connected to a PC, the handwritten
notes and sketches are automatically integrated into OneNote. The pens
can store up to 50 pages of handwriting at a time.

    With new larger notebooks and print-your-own-notebook capabilities,
Capturx for OneNote 2.0 makes it even easier to:


--  Keep Organized. All notes are automatically backed up, centralized,
    and easy to access in OneNote. Each page in the paper notebook corresponds
    to a page in the digital notebook. Notes and pages can be easily
    reorganized.
--  Quickly Search and Find Notes. Handwriting becomes searchable in
    OneNote, which automatically uses powerful character recognition to create
    a searchable index. Simply type a word and find every place where it's
    written across notebooks.
--  Share Notes through Microsoft Office. Sketches and handwriting can be
    copied and pasted in email or for use in other Microsoft Office files.
    Handwriting can be converted to digital text or left in the original ink
    strokes.  Notebooks can also be shared on networks to improve
    collaboration, decisions, and record keeping.
    

    
The Capturx line of products for Microsoft Office includes Capturx
Forms for Excel(R) and SharePoint(R) Server, which enable teams to easily
collect structured data using digital pens on ordinary paper. Information
written on paper becomes immediately available in Office in the original
handwriting and as converted digital text and data tables.

    Availability

    Capturx for Microsoft Office OneNote 2.0 is available today. System
requirements include Microsoft Office OneNote 2007, and either 32-bit
Windows Vista or Windows 7. Optional notebook printing requires a 4-color
PostScript laser printer. Coming soon, Capturx will support 64-bit Windows
Operating Systems. For pricing information, please send email to
sales@adapx.com or call (877) 232-7903.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20091209005529/en

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer announced today results of a survey the company recently sponsored that
shows physicians are more likely to report side effects through an electronic
health records (EHR) system, as compared to traditional paper methods. Nearly 60
percent of physicians who responded to the survey also agreed that adverse event
reporting through an EHR system would improve patient care. 

"Patient safety continues to be a top priority at Pfizer," said Freda
Lewis-Hall, MD, Pfizer`s chief medical officer. "This survey furthers our
understanding about how we can best use electronic health records systems to
collect critical information about the safe and appropriate use of our products
so that we can improve patient safety." 

Of the 300 physicians surveyed, two-thirds utilized some form of an EHR system
and one-third used a paper-based system. Half of all respondents and 60 percent
of fully-functional EHR users reported that they would be much more likely to
submit information about adverse events using an EHR system. Of those still
using paper-based systems, 80 percent cited cost as a deterrent to investing in
an EHR system. 

Ipsos conducted the survey online among primary care physicians in the United
States who were categorized as basic electronic health record users, fully
functional electronic health record users or paper health record users. The
research was conducted during September and October 2009. 

As part of the company`s ongoing efforts to improve patient safety, Pfizer is
collaborating with Brigham and Women`s Hospital, Partners Healthcare, CDISC, an
international standards group, and CRIX International to improve the quality of
data in safety reports. Earlier this year, the group conducted a pilot known as
the ASTER (Adverse Drug Event Spontaneous Triggered Event Reporting) study,
allowing physicians to use electronic health records to report adverse events
directly to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By exploring a combination
of standards, technology and a new business model, the group intends to help
physicians better recognize and report adverse events. 

"These survey results confirm what we saw in the Partners Healthcare ASTER
study," said Jeffrey A. Linder, MD, MPH, FACP an internist at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston. "The system we used in that study was well accepted
by the participating physicians, who felt the adverse event reporting was
unobtrusive and who saw the public health potential of this type of reporting.
While most of the participating clinicians submitted no reports in the year
prior to the study, they submitted hundreds of detailed reports during the five
months of the study period." 

Physician-reported adverse events are critical to the safety profiles of
products by FDA. In the current adverse event reporting process, it can take
physicians as long as 40 minutes to fill out required paperwork. By
transitioning to an electronic health record system for reporting these events
to the FDA, the process is completed in a matter of minutes. For physicians, it
is important for EHR adverse event reporting to be easy to use, convenient and
safe for patients. 

"Adverse event reports are a key component of our ongoing efforts in patient
safety," said Dr. Lewis-Hall. "One critical goal is to increase the number and
quality of the reports we receive. By making it easier and more convenient for
doctors, we anticipate meeting this goal. ASTER is an impressive step in

LNG plant, including facilities for processing, treating natural
gas, liquefaction and storage, to be worth at around $45 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market had been watching whether Chiyoda would win the
contract after the company had secured only 73 billion yen ($825
million) in orders in the first half, about a quarter of its
annual target of 440 billion yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chiyoda booked a first-half operating loss of 2.38 billion
yen due to additional construction costs for LNG projects in
Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, rival JGC recently boosted its annual contract
target to 700 billion yen from 500 billion yen, citing a
favourable market environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was a surprise that JGC was also in the running in the
project," said Yoichiro Watanabe of Mito Securities. "Now it's
clear JGC will be able to achieve its new target of winning 700
billion yen in orders this business year," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JGC edged down 0.6 percent, outperforming the
broader market, after the Nikkei business paper first reported
the news. Chiyoda slid 6.5 percent, partly on profit-taking after
rising 1.8 percent on Tuesday on anticipation of winning the bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others to get contracts for Exxon's $15 billion project
include Italy's Saipem (SPMI.MI), Australia's Clough CLO.AX and
McConnell Dowell.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc plans to pay top managers their 2009 bonuses in stock, rather than cash, as it seeks to deflect outrage over a near-record pay haul months after it repaid billions of dollars in taxpayer aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to pay top managers in stock that cannot be sold for five years puts Goldman at the forefront of the push to align Wall Street pay with long-term performance. Still, the firm's compensation is on pace to top $20 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That figure has put Goldman in the crosshairs of an international debate on pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Wall Street is well aware of the broad direction they need to move," said Douglas Elliott, a former JPMorgan investment banker now with the Brookings Institution. "The devil's in the details."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's plan, announced Thursday, applies to its 30-person management committee, an elite group that includes Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein as well as some of the firm's most senior risk-takers and managers, including the heads of sales and trading operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those managers will receive all of their discretionary compensation in "shares at risk" -- stock that must be held for five years. They will also face a clawback provision that allows the company to recoup pay from an employee later found to have engaged in improper risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan, however, leaves room from for some of Goldman's elite performers not on the 30-person management panel to receive out-sized cash paydays. Those salaries would not have to be publicly disclosed by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman CEO Blankfein said in a statement the company believes its compensation policies are the strongest in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein himself received no bonus 2008, after receiving a bonus of $67.9 million in 2007, according to a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks like Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp have had trouble keeping up with Goldman as they struggled to pay back government bailouts. Chief competitor Morgan Stanley, which has lagged behind Goldman in its recovery, has had to ratchet up its bonus ratio to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TREND SETTER?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has felt the brunt of a public backlash for setting aside nearly $17 billion in the first three quarters of 2009 for year-end compensation, even as the firm earlier this year repaid a $10 billion taxpayer bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anger at pay has gone global.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Britain slapped a 50 percent tax on bank bonuses. Wall Street is trying to guard against such measures in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Service Employees International Union, a persistent critic of Wall Street pay packages, called the move a "pr stunt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lloyd Blankfein and the rest of Goldman's executives are still using the profits they made off the backs of taxpayers to reward themselves with obscene bonuses," the union's secretary treasurer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEIU and other critics have cited the fact that Goldman was a major recipient of TARP money, was made whole on various trading positions in which bailed out insurer American International Group Inc was a counterparty, and was allowed to issue billions of dollars of government-guaranteed debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also helped by being allowed to convert to becoming a bank holding company at the height of the crisis on an expedited basis and also indirectly benefited from more than a trillion dollars of stimulus and rescue funds doled out by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other banks are likely to follow Goldman's lead, said Joe Sorrentino, a compensation consultant with Steven Hall  Partners in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they're leading the pack here. Based on their prestige in the industry and their size and reputation, I wouldn't be surprised to see other companies, the Wall Street firms, carry that forward and adopt certain provisions," Sorrentino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks have already made adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiss bank UBS AG, for example, raised fixed salaries and matched bonuses to sustainable profit, according to an internal memo in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse in October said it would make executives wait three to four years for their bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's plan comes as U.S. pay czar Kenneth Feinberg readies his next wave of pay rulings. Feinberg has the authority to set compensation for the highest-paid employees at companies that have not paid back extraordinary bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feinberg has made aligning pay with long-term performance a point of emphasis in his rulings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City stands to lose about $20 million of tax revenue for every $1 billion not paid in cash. A state official could not immediately provide such an estimate, though the state gets about one-fifth of its tax dollars from Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman gained 0.2 percent, while the sectoral NYSE Arca Securities Broker Dealer index fell 0.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay and Joan Gralla in New York and Karey Wutkowski in Washington; Editing by Gerald E.

Schuhen, Kleidung und Accessoires und wird in adidas Sport Performance Stores

Mit einem Hauch des Zaubers von Disney setzt die Debutkollektion der Linie auf
die traditionellen Silhouetten der adidas-Kleidung mit Taschen-Details und
Mickey Mouse-Gummiemblemen auf T-Shirts und Hosen sowie Zippern in Mickey
Mouse-Form an Kapuzenpullovern. T-Shirts und Hemden f&#252;r Jungen zeigen sich im
Mickey Mouse-Zeichentrickdesign, w&#228;hrend Minnie Mouse, deren Bild T-Shirts und
M&#252;tzen lady-like verziert, die zentrale Figur f&#252;r die M&#228;dchenkleidung darstellt.
M&#228;dchenhafte Accessoires erg&#228;nzen die Outfits: Trolleytaschen passend zu
Kleidung und Schuhen, M&#252;tzen mit Mickey Mouse- oder Minnie Mouse-Abbildungen und
kuschelige Baumwollsocken. (Sehen Sie sich ein Video der Produktlinie beim

Zus&#228;tzlich zum klassischen adidas-3-Streifen-Design, wird der freche Look
unterstrichen durch mehrere Highlight-St&#252;cke mit hervorstechenden Details wie
All-Over-Prints in gl&#228;nzendem Metall- und Perleffektlook auf Kleidung und
speziellen Silberapplikationen auf Schn&#252;rsenkeln. Highlights im Bereich Schuhe
stellen der Sportschuh Disney StreetRun in Divarosa und Silbermetallik f&#252;r
M&#228;dchen und in Blaugr&#252;n und Wei&#223; f&#252;r Jungen dar. 3D-Elemente im Mickey Mouse-
und Minnie Mouse-Design machen diese Schuhkollektion wirklich zu etwas
Besonderem. Kinder werden vor allem die bunte Schuhsohle lieben, die einen
adidas-Fu&#223;abdruck im Disney-Stil hinterl&#228;sst. 

&#8222;Ich bin mit Mickey und Minnie aufgewachsen und mein Hauptziel war es, eine
au&#223;ergew&#246;hnliche Kollektion f&#252;r Jungen und M&#228;dchen zu entwerfen, die
gleichzeitig cool und niedlich ist und diese klassischen Disneyfiguren zum Leben
erweckt", sagt adidas-Designerin Rana Babacan. Pete Brady, Category Manager bei
adidas Kids, f&#228;hrt fort: &#8222;Diese Zusammenarbeit ist so eine tolle M&#246;glichkeit f&#252;r

neuen Fingerabdruck zu kreieren, der die Sportlinie f&#252;r Kinder mit deren Liebe
zu Disney verbindet."

&lt;p&gt;La collezione in arrivo questo mese nei negozi
HERZOGENAURACH, Germania--(Business Wire)--
adidas e Disney hanno annunciato in data odierna una linea di prodotti
completamente nuova per beb&#232; e bambini, che unisce le elevate prestazioni dei
prodotti adidas ai personaggi classici di Disney: Topolino e i suoi amici
Minnie, Pippo, Paperino e Paperina. La collezione, sportiva e alla moda,
comprende calzature, abiti e accessori e sar&#224; disponibile negli adidas Sport
Performance Store e presso i rivenditori di abbigliamento sportivo di tutto il
mondo. 

Con un tocco di magia Disney, la collezione di esordio dell'assortimento
presenta le linee tradizionali dei capi adidas con dettagli delle tasche e
applicazioni in gomma raffiguranti Topolino sulle t-shirt e sui pantaloni,
mentre le felpe con cappuccio ripropongono l'immagine di Mickey Mouse sul
tirante della cerniera. Le maglie e le t-shirt per i maschietti riprendono le
immagini dei cartoni animati di Topolino, mentre Minnie la fa da protagonista
sull'abbigliamento per le bambine, portando la sua femminilit&#224; su t-shirt e
cappellini. Gli accessori per lei completano il guardaroba: borse trolley
abbinate per abiti e scarpe, cappellini che riprendono gli elementi grafici di
Topolino o Minnie e confortevoli calzini di cotone. Per visualizzare il video
sulla linea di prodotti &#232; possibile accedere al canale Disney Living di Disney
Consumer Products su YouTube (www.YouTube.com/DisneyLiving) oppure andare
direttamente all'indirizzo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDVg5gv2MIo). 

Oltre al classico disegno adidas con le tre strisce, diversi modelli di punta di
questa prima collezione presentano dettagli di rilievo, quali stampe su tutto il
capo con una lucente finitura metallica-madreperlata e speciali applicazioni
argentate sui lacci delle scarpe per un effetto di maggiore originalit&#224;. Per le
calzature, tra le pi&#249; notevoli si distinguono le scarpe da ginnastica Disney
StreetRun in color rosa diva e argento metallizzato per le bambine e petrolio e
bianco per i bambini. Gli elementi di design 3D che raffigurano Topolino e
Minnie rendono queste scarpe davvero particolari, ma per i bambini la
caratteristica pi&#249; divertente sar&#224; la suola colorata che lascia un'impronta
adidas ispirata al tema Disney. 

"Sono cresciuta con Topolino e Minnie e il mio obiettivo principale era
disegnare una collezione speciale per bambini e bambine che fosse al contempo
simpatica e bella, portando nella vita quotidiana questi classici personaggi
Disney", ha dichiarato la stilista Rana Babacan. Pete Brady, category manager di
adidas Kids, continua: "Questa collaborazione &#232; un'ottima opportunit&#224; per i due
marchi leader mondiali, che possono fare confluire le loro esperienze e creare
un genere completamente nuovo nel quale si uniscono lo sport e l'amore dei
bambini per tutto ci&#242; che &#232; Disney". 

"Topolino rimane in primo piano in molte tendenze moda e siamo felici per il
modo in cui abbiamo saputo integrare Topolino e i suoi amici in questa gamma",
ha aggiunto Pamela Lifford, Vicepresidente esecutivo del ramo globale Moda e
casa di Disney Consumer Products. "Questa nuova linea di abbigliamento per
ragazzi sar&#224; divertente per i piccoli e attraente per i genitori pi&#249; attenti
alla moda".

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft yesterday re-released a Windows 7 installation tool that it admitted included open-source code, and has posted the utility's source code to its own open-source site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move came three weeks after Microsoft announced it had delayed the re-release of the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (WUDT) because the software needed additional testing. At the time, Peter Galli, Microsoft's open-source community manager, said that WDUT would be re-issued in the "next few weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in November, Microsoft pulled WUDT after blogger Rafael Rivera accused the company of lifting code from the GPLv2-licensed "Imagemaster" open-source project. Rivera, who writes the Within Windows blog, said Microsoft compounded the problem by not acknowledging the source of the code embedded in WDUT, and by not sharing the source code for its modifications, or for the tool itself, to the project -- as required by the terms of GPL (GNU General Public License).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WDUT has now been released under the provisions of GPLv2, Galli said yesterday .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, because Microsoft was forced to split the new WDUT into several components due to licensing requirements, some users must now go through a more complicated installation procedure, Galli acknowledged. Customers running Windows XP must install .Net Framework 2 and the Image Mastering API (application programming interface) before installing WDUT, according to new instructions published by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft originally released WUDT in October, when it touted the tool as a way for netbook owners to create a bootable flash drive from a downloaded .iso file, or disk image, of Windows 7 purchased from Microsoft's online store. Most netbooks lack an optical drive and so can't install the new OS from a DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After WDUT's release, Rivera accused Microsoft of taking code from the open-source Imagemaster project. Yesterday, Rivera said that Microsoft had pulled the Imagemaster code from WDUT at the request of its maker. "I suspect he freaked out after half the Internet started linking to the project -- understandable -- and pulled the code," Rivera said on his blog Wednesday .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft took heat from several corners over the GPL license violation. Computerworld blogger Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, for example, blasted Microsoft for the gaffe. "It seems Microsoft still can't resist stealing from open-source software," Vaughan-Nichols said last month .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Microsoft yanked WDUT and announced it would re-release the tool under GPLv2, however, Vaughan-Nichols changed his tune. "Maybe Microsoft is changing their ways when it comes to open source," he said several days later .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WDUT can be downloaded directly from Microsoft's site ( .exe download ). The source code for WDUT has been posted to CodePlex , Microsoft's open-source repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Swiss banking systems provider Temenos have joined forces to push SQL Server in the banking sector, the companies said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL Server will be used as part of Temenos' core banking system, T24, which is the back-office system that manages accounts and customer information, and lets banks offer other financial services, according to Mike Head, global alliances director at Temenos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages of using SQL Server is lower cost, Head said. However, banks are cautious -- stability, security and performance have to be proven before they adopt a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reliability of SQL Server isn't questioned, according to Head. But showing that SQL Server can perform on the same level as Oracle and IBM is something the two companies have to do. Banks aren't convinced, Head said.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Temenos will work together to demonstrate that SQL Server's performance can equal or surpass other databases, according to Head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, lab tests won't be enough. Most banks don't want to be the first to use a product, so showing that others are already using SQL Server and T24 will be important. For example, North Shore Credit Union has started using both, according to a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more we publicize the people who are running it today, the more confidence it will give," said Head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQL Server has improved a lot during the past couple of years, according to Mark Hejja, CISO at Nordic Internet broker Nordnet Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using SQL Server at smaller banks is definitely a possibility, but Hejja isn't convinced the database can handle the massive amounts of transactions that the Citibanks of the world have to handle, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security is always something that comes up when Microsoft's products are discussed. However, core banking systems are never, from a security point of view, exposed to the user and the Internet. So that isn't as important as integration features, stability and performance, Hejja said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're a technology mongrel like Microsoft, challenges are constant - and 2009 was chock full of them. It was a tumultuous year that saw the software giant's first widespread layoffs and its worst quarterly revenue earnings ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there were some rays of sunlight flickering through the clouds. Windows 7 survived its many pre-launch milestones and launched successfully in October; search engine Bing debuted with aggressive marketing and innovative features; the launch of Windows Azure pulled Microsoft's cloud computing strategy together; Office, Exchange and Sharepoint software continue to own the enterprise; and Microsoft's public presence on television improved with the Laptop Hunters, Windows 7 and Bing ad campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But still, due to its massive size, Microsoft has been more affected by the global economic downturn than tech companies of smaller stature. So 2010 is likely to be a rebuilding year for Redmond as the economy slowly improves, say industry analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system -- including hands-on reviews, video tutorials and advice on enterprise rollouts -- see CIO.com's Windows 7 Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft cannot merely wait out the economy. It must stave off competition and improve on many fronts. Here are four challenges for Microsoft in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't Fall Further Behind in the Mobile Race&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Mobile 6.5 was met with harsh reviews when it launched in early October, widely regarded as a ho-hum refresh on the road to Windows Mobile 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key mobile question for Microsoft is this: How do you win over and keep customers when there are so many established and well-regarded choices?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't help Microsoft's cause that Windows Mobile runs on generic smartphones that lack brand recognition and loyalty. Microsoft could change the game by branding its own smartphones. RIM, Apple and Palm have proven that buyers want smartphones from one maker with one name. Microsoft's alleged Project Pink is a plan to develop Microsoft-branded phones that will reportedly include Zune services and be built on top of Windows Mobile 7. But waiting for Windows Mobile 7 means it will be a year until consumers and businesses see these "Windows" phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that Microsoft has not been able to compete with the iPhone, BlackBerry, Palm or Google Android. Redmond will need to keep WinMo 6.5 from fading into obscurity in 2010 and deliver on the promises of Windows Mobile 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Microsoft delays much longer on producing a decent mobile platform with software, services and partners," says veteran industry analyst Roger Kay, "then it will be out of the game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep Up Windows 7 Momentum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing you can say about Windows 7 so far: It's not Vista. And that's a very good thing for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vista has been the bane of Redmond's existence for the past two years. At first, Vista was criticized for slowness and incompatibility issues, which gave way to negative perceptions that never let up - with no help from snarky Apple TV ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 has entered a more diverse PC landscape than Vista, with different Win7 versions designed to run on everything from tiny netbooks to mammoth all-in-one touchscreen PCs. It has received mostly positive reviews, and its early sales are better than those of XP and Vista in a comparable time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge for Windows 7 is to keep marketing Windows 7, even if that means a protracted and expensive slugfest with Apple's "I'm a Mac, I'm a PC" commercials. Windows 7 also must contend with frugal consumers and businesses that are hesitant to spend money on computers in a bad economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with research firm Gartner forecasting that PC sales will actually make modest gains this year, Windows 7 is in a good position for growth and new sales when consumers and businesses start spending again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch Out for Google Apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's debatable whether Google's productivity suite, Google Apps, or other free offerings like OpenOffice and Zoho are true threats to Microsoft's cash cow, Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been growing enthusiasm for Google Apps among consumers, but businesses, most of which are built around Exchange servers, still largely prefer Microsoft Office desktop tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this gravy train will not last forever. With Google aggressively going after enterprise business and cloud computing becoming more prevalent, corporate fears about storing company data in a cloud environment are likely to subside even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trend, in turn, puts more pressure on Office 2010, scheduled for release in June of next year. Microsoft is all too aware of the Google Apps threat and has been emphasizing Office Web Apps - stripped-down, Web-based and ad supported versions of Office desktop apps that will launch in tandem with Office 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge for Microsoft is to highlight the corporate advantages of using Office Web Apps without downplaying the desktop version of Office. If an enterprise wants go completely Web-based with their productivity apps next year, Microsoft will have to deliver. Or else it's, Hello Google!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grow Bing Grow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal in 2010 with the Bing search engine is simple: Grow ad revenue and market share. Achieving that could be a different story, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing was dubbed "the decision engine" when it launched in June and promised to redefine search engines by organizing more information on a results page than Google and making it easier for users to book flights and purchase retail items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing hasn't revolutionized search, but it is holding its own. Microsoft recently released useful, new Bing features such as full-page weather reports, expanded hover previews showing a snapshot of Web sites, and the integration of Wolfram Alpha, a computational technology that returns deeper search queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing's market share has grown almost two percentage points since its launch, currently at 9.9 percent, according to October data from online market tracker comScore. Expect a big market share jump when Bing is rolled into Yahoo as part of the search deal between Microsoft and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft needs to keep rolling out new features in Bing and market the heck out of them in 2010. Apparently, the checkbooks for Bing will be wide open. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has said that he plans to spend $5.5 billion to $11 billion on Bing during the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there are content partnerships. Rupert Murdoch and other publishers are fed up with Google's purported revenue-hogging practices. Microsoft stands to gain some ground on Google by signing exclusive content partnerships, such as the proposed deal to pay News Corp. for the rights to index the publishing giant's content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has denied there is a deal to pay News Corp. for search rights to content, but revenue-sharing deals with publishers could increase Bing's profit and market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft execs might want to remember that they will have to share the ad revenue, or those publishers will get very, very mad at them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Exxon Releases Energy Outlook

During the new edition of its presentation "Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030,"
ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) stated that trillions of dollars of
investment is required to cope with a 35% increase in energy demand by 2030. 

While oil, natural gas and coal will continue to meet most of the world's needs,
the company emphasized natural gas as a major source of energy, reflecting its
abundance, versatility and economic advantages as an efficient and clean-burning
fuel for power generation. 

The company forecasts an expansion of natural gas from unconventional supplies.
Unconventional gas supplies - tapped through horizontal drilling and fracturing
wells - are expected to satisfy more than 50% of gas demand by 2030. 

Higher costs for carbon emission would impact energy prices and provide an
incentive to switch to less carbon-intensive fuels such as natural gas, which
can help meet growing electricity demand and help reduce power generation
emissions by up to 60% versus coal, ExxonMobil said. 

With a growing world population, alternative energy will also play an important
role. Exxon expects wind, solar and biofuels to grow by about 10% a year through
2030 and comprise a 2.5% share of total energy by 2030. The company has raised
it from the previous years` guidance of 2.1%. 

Morgan Stanley Shuffles Management

Ahead of James Gorman's takeover of the CEO position on Jan 1, 2010, Morgan
Stanley (NYSE: MS) on Tuesday shuffled its top management roles. The change
includes naming of heads of its core securities business and a new finance
chief. Colm Kelleher, CFO and head of global markets, and Paul Taubman head of
investment banking, will take over as co-presidents of institutional securities.


At the same time, Mitch Petrick will step down as head of the bank's sales and
trading unit. Ruth Porat, the head of the firm`s financial institutions group,
will succeed Mr. Kelleher, becoming one of the top women in investment banking.
Thomas Nides, who currently serves as chief administrative officer, will take
additional responsibilities as the firm`s chief operating officer. 

Jim Rosenthal, who currently serves as head of technology and operations, will
serve as chief operating officer of the newly formed Morgan Stanley Smith Barney
that the company bought from Citigroup (NYSE: C). Rosenthal will also serve as
head of corporate strategy for Morgan Stanley. 

Morgan Stanley reported third-quarter 2009 income of $498 million or 38 cents
per share, compared with a loss of $159 million or $1.37 per share in the prior
quarter and an income of $7.7 billion, or $7.38 per share a year ago. The
results were much ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents per share.
The results marked the first quarter of income in a year`s time. 

Results were aided by robust underwriting revenues in the investment banking
operation resulting from higher levels of market activity, strong growth in
fixed income sales and trading, commodities, prime brokerage and wealth
management business, which offset losses in commercial real estate. 

Unlike the preceding quarters, the results were in line with strong results from
competitors like Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM),
who have been grabbing market share after the financial crisis. We expect the
key management shake-up to be positive for Morgan Stanley to remain profitable,
going forward.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Industry Outlook. Today, Zacks Equity Research
discusses the Consumer Electronics Industry, including Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT),
Google (Nasdaq: GOOG), Nokia (NYSE: NOK), Disney (NYSE: DIS) and Viacom (NYSE:
VIA). 

A synopsis of today`s Industry Outlook is presented below. The full article can
be read at
http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/28120/Consumer+Electronics+Stock+Review. 

Consumer Electronics Stock Review

The strongest driver in consumer electronics this holiday season is likely to be
the netbooks. According to ABI Research, 35 million netbooks will be shipped in
2009. As per the most recent data released by Gartner, PC shipments in 2009 are
expected to rise 2.8%, up from the previous forecast of a 2% decline, thanks to
the increased sale of inexpensive consumer notebooks and netbooks. We expect PC
sales to show positive gains in the first half of 2010. 

Netbooks are expected to thrive, driven by Microsoft`s (Nasdaq: MSFT) new
Windows OS7. Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) aims to take over the consumer electronics
netbook market in the latter half of 2010 with its new Chrome operating system
(OS). Handset maker Nokia (NYSE: NOK) has entered the netbook market with its
Booklet 3G, a mini laptop, and has introduced new netbooks and MIDs to take
advantage of the flourishing market in consumer electronics. 

Moreover, both Disney (NYSE: DIS) and Nickelodeon -- owned by Viacom (NYSE: VIA)
-- have plans to launch low-cost netbooks targeting young children, which will
be a further boost to consumer electronics sales.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc plans to pay top managers their 2009 bonuses in stock, rather than cash, as it seeks to deflect outrage over a near-record pay haul months after it repaid billions of dollars in taxpayer aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to pay top managers in stock that cannot be sold for five years puts Goldman at the forefront of the push to align Wall Street pay with long-term performance. Still, the firm's compensation is on pace to top $20 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That figure has put Goldman in the crosshairs of an international debate on pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think Wall Street is well aware of the broad direction they need to move," said Douglas Elliott, a former JPMorgan investment banker now with the Brookings Institution. "The devil's in the details."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's plan, announced Thursday, applies to its 30-person management committee, an elite group that includes Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein as well as some of the firm's most senior risk-takers and managers, including the heads of sales and trading operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those managers will receive all of their discretionary compensation in "shares at risk" -- stock that must be held for five years. They will also face a clawback provision that allows the company to recoup pay from an employee later found to have engaged in improper risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan, however, leaves room from for some of Goldman's elite performers not on the 30-person management panel to receive out-sized cash paydays. Those salaries would not have to be publicly disclosed by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman CEO Blankfein said in a statement the company believes its compensation policies are the strongest in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein himself received no bonus 2008, after receiving a bonus of $67.9 million in 2007, according to a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks like Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp have had trouble keeping up with Goldman as they struggled to pay back government bailouts. Chief competitor Morgan Stanley, which has lagged behind Goldman in its recovery, has had to ratchet up its bonus ratio to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TREND SETTER?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has felt the brunt of a public backlash for setting aside nearly $17 billion in the first three quarters of 2009 for year-end compensation, even as the firm earlier this year repaid a $10 billion taxpayer bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anger at pay has gone global.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Britain slapped a 50 percent tax on bank bonuses. Wall Street is trying to guard against such measures in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Service Employees International Union, a persistent critic of Wall Street pay packages, called the move a "pr stunt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lloyd Blankfein and the rest of Goldman's executives are still using the profits they made off the backs of taxpayers to reward themselves with obscene bonuses," the union's secretary treasurer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEIU and other critics have cited the fact that Goldman was a major recipient of TARP money, was made whole on various trading positions in which bailed out insurer American International Group Inc was a counterparty, and was allowed to issue billions of dollars of government-guaranteed debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also helped by being allowed to convert to becoming a bank holding company at the height of the crisis on an expedited basis and also indirectly benefited from more than a trillion dollars of stimulus and rescue funds doled out by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other banks are likely to follow Goldman's lead, said Joe Sorrentino, a compensation consultant with Steven Hall  Partners in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they're leading the pack here. Based on their prestige in the industry and their size and reputation, I wouldn't be surprised to see other companies, the Wall Street firms, carry that forward and adopt certain provisions," Sorrentino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks have already made adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiss bank UBS AG, for example, raised fixed salaries and matched bonuses to sustainable profit, according to an internal memo in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse in October said it would make executives wait three to four years for their bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's plan comes as U.S. pay czar Kenneth Feinberg readies his next wave of pay rulings. Feinberg has the authority to set compensation for the highest-paid employees at companies that have not paid back extraordinary bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feinberg has made aligning pay with long-term performance a point of emphasis in his rulings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City stands to lose about $20 million of tax revenue for every $1 billion not paid in cash. A state official could not immediately provide such an estimate, though the state gets about one-fifth of its tax dollars from Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman gained 0.2 percent, while the sectoral NYSE Arca Securities Broker Dealer index fell 0.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay and Joan Gralla in New York and Karey Wutkowski in Washington; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;Number of Potential Beneficiaries Increases with Availability of Many Legacy
Wyeth Medicines

New Interactive Tool Makes it Easy for People to Learn if They May Be Eligible
for Pfizer MAINTAIN&#8482; or other Pfizer Patient Assistance Programs
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer today announced it will extend its MAINTAIN&#8482; (Medicines Assistance for
Those who Are in Need) patient assistance program for an additional year,
through December 31, 2010. In addition to the more than 70 Pfizer primary care
medicines currently available through MAINTAIN, Pfizer will extend the benefits
of MAINTAIN to many legacy Wyeth medicines. 

Pfizer launched MAINTAIN in May to help unemployed and uninsured Americans stay
on their Pfizer medicines. The program, an employee-driven initiative, is part
of Pfizer Helpful Answers&#174;, Pfizer`s family of patient assistance programs that
helps uninsured and underinsured Americans get Pfizer medicines for free or at a
savings. Seventy-five percent of people who have applied to Pfizer`s MAINTAIN
program have been enrolled. 

Coupled with testimonials from MAINTAIN members and other interactive features,
Pfizer released the MAINTAINwidget, an online tool that guides users through a
short series of questions that determine whether they may be eligible for
MAINTAIN or for another Pfizer patient assistance program. 

Gail Grime, a MAINTAIN member from Ohio, lost her employment and health
insurance after a 23-year career working for a U.S.-based auto parts
manufacturer. Ms. Grime learned about MAINTAIN in a newspaper article, which she
has subsequently shared with her family and many of her former co-workers. 

"When I lost my job, I found myself without medical coverage for the first time
in years. But thanks to MAINTAIN, I don`t have to cut back on my Pfizer
medicines, or go without them," Ms. Grime said. "The application was easy but,
most importantly, the folks in customer service answered every one of my
questions. In these rough times, it`s nice to have someone looking out for you."


By extending the benefits of the MAINTAIN program for another year and to
patients needing help with legacy Wyeth medicines, Pfizer is responding to the
continued economic challenges facing hard-working Americans. Although the
economy appears to be on the mend and the number of job losses has begun to
slow, data show that unemployment remains at a 26-year high. 

"In the last year, we have witnessed a great deal of suffering. Yet, our
families, friends and neighbors have exhibited true American spirit, finding
innovative ways to manage during tough times," said Jorge Puente, Pfizer`s
regional president of Worldwide Pharmaceuticals and a leading champion of the
initiative. "Signs are pointing to recovery; however, millions of people are
struggling without the benefit of insurance and without a regular income. As the
world`s largest biopharmaceutical company, we believe we have a corporate
responsibility to help our fellow Americans who need the medicines Pfizer
offers, but who do not have insurance to help pay for them. By extending
MAINTAIN, we are hopeful that we can continue to relieve some of the burden
created by the recession." 

Pfizer has long been a leader in making medicines accessible to uninsured
Americans, and MAINTAIN is just the latest example of Pfizer`s innovation in the
area of improved access. In 2004, the company expanded Pfizer Helpful Answers,
the company`s family of patient assistance programs, becoming the first
pharmaceutical company to help anyone in the United States without prescription
insurance, no matter their age or income. 

Pfizer Helpful Answers has been helping uninsured and underinsured patients get
Pfizer medicines for free or at a savings for more than two decades. In the last
five years alone, Pfizer has helped more than 5 million uninsured patients get
access to more than 51 million Pfizer prescriptions valued at more than $4.8
billion at wholesale cost through its patient assistance programs. The reach of
Pfizer`s patient assistance programs in each state is illustrated in one of the
charts accompanying this release. 

"Pfizer MAINTAIN is a response to the evolving needs of uninsured Americans.
Access programs are, simply put, ingrained in our corporate culture," Puente
said. 

MAINTAIN Eligibility Requirements and Application

The MAINTAIN program has four eligibility requirements. Applicants must:

* Be able to demonstrate loss of employment on or after January 1, 2009; 
* Lack prescription coverage; 
* Attest to financial need; and, 
* Have been on their Pfizer medicine for at least three months prior to
unemployment and enrolling in the program.

The program is user-friendly, with a one-page application that Pfizer will
typically process within two to three weeks. Applicants may download the
one-page application from www.PfizerHelpfulAnswers.com, or request one by
calling 866-706-2400, where live operators can help callers find out if they may
be eligible for one of Pfizer`s patient assistance programs. 

The program will accept applications through December 31, 2010. If eligible for
MAINTAIN, patients can get their medicines for free for up to one year after
enrollment or until they become insured, whichever comes first. People who are
uninsured and still need help after being on MAINTAIN for a year can apply to
one of Pfizer`s other patient assistance programs. 

For Help with Wyeth Medicines

As a result of Pfizer and Wyeth coming together, Pfizer is also extending the
benefits of MAINTAIN to people who need help staying on their Wyeth primary care
medicines. Until the Pfizer and Wyeth patient assistance programs are fully
integrated, likely by mid-2010, please visit www.PfizerHelpfulAnswers.com and
click on the Wyeth link or call 866-706-2400 and ask for help with Wyeth
medicines.

uninsured and underinsured who need help getting Pfizer medicines. Today, it is

&lt;p&gt;First Update From Intuit`s New Personal Finance Group Further Enhances User
Interface, Eases Set-Up, Improves Aggregation and Categorization; Reflects
Influence of Newly Acquired Mint.com 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Please replace the release with the following corrected version due to multiple
revisions. 

The corrected release reads: 

QUICKEN`S UPDATED MICROSOFT MONEY CONVERTER LETS MORE PEOPLE SAVE AND DO MORE
WITH THEIR MONEY

First Update From Intuit`s New Personal Finance Group Further Enhances User
Interface, Eases Set-Up, Improves Aggregation and Categorization; Reflects
Influence of Newly Acquired Mint.com 

Quicken 2010 for Windows today announced updates to its new Microsoft Money
Converter, giving thousands of former Microsoft Money users the ability to
easily transfer their financial history and management preferences to help them
save and do more with their money. This update is the first product release
since Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq:INTU) acquired Mint.com and appointed its founder
Aaron Patzer Vice President and General Manager of Personal Finance, and further
enhances product improvements that have already made the latest Quicken release
so popular. 

"I spent eight years as a Quicken customer - then three as a direct competitor -
and this is definitely the best Quicken in years," said Patzer. "It`s faster to
setup, has a better user interface, and more automation - in part due to
inspiration from Mint.com. For consumers looking to replace the now discontinued
Microsoft Money, Quicken provides all the powerful investment, budgeting, and
reporting functionality they need, while preserving the transaction history they
may have built up in Money." 

Intuit`s Personal Finance Group makes Quicken and Mint.com from Quicken, the
best personal financial management products no matter how people like to manage
their money or where they are in their financial life. Whether managing money
online, from the desktop, or on a mobile device, Quicken and Mint.com help
people save and do more with their money. Internal data reveals using personal
financial software like Quicken can help people save about $150 a year in costly
fees. 

"Quicken has always been the best product for people who want to keep highly
detailed records, particularly around investments or tax-lot accounting," said
Patzer. "Quicken 2010 is also easier to use and navigate. As always, Quicken
2010 is powerful and accurate, offering Morning Star research, timely quotes,
funds transfer between accounts, and integrated bill-pay capabilities." 

Key Improvements take cues from the Internet and Respond to User Feedback

* Quicker Sign-Up: The latest version of Quicken has shortened the sign-up
process by approximately two-thirds, to ten screens 
* Supports More Financial Institutions: The Quicken desktop product connects to
more financial institutions, automatically importing transactional data across
users` accounts 
* Improved Aggregation and Categorization: Dramatically improved aggregation and
categorization platforms automate more of the work, making Quicken easier to use
- and will continue to get better with proprietary Mint.com technology as a
result of the acquisition

This release update is the first example of the future of the Intuit Personal
Finance Group, pulling the best of both Quicken and Mint.com into each product
-online, on the desktop, and on mobile devices. 

Pricing and Availability

The Quicken 2010 product line includes:

* Quicken Starter Edition ($29.99) - For consumers who want to get handle on
their money so they avoid missing bills and incurring costly fees.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may not have hustled as fast as researchers thought when the company patched a zero-day bug in Internet Explorer (IE) just 18 days after exploit code went public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to VeriSign iDefense, Microsoft had information about the browser bug nearly six months before the researcher dubbed "K4mr4n" posted attack code to the Bugtraq security mailing list on Nov. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iDefense's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), one of the two best-known bug bounty programs, reported the vulnerability to Microsoft on June 9, 2009, iDefense noted in an advisory published Wednesday .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE6 and IE7, two versions of Microsoft's browser that collectively accounted for approximately 39% of all browsers used last month, were the only editions affected by the vulnerability. The ancient IE 5.01 and the new IE8 were immune from the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days after K4mr4n publicized the exploit proof-of-concept, Microsoft confirmed that the attack code worked , and issued a security advisory that provided some information about the bug. At no time, however, did it acknowledge it knew of the vulnerability, only going as far as to say it was investigating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, experts agreed that it was unlikely Microsoft would be able make the Dec. 8 deadline for the company's monthly Patch Tuesday. In fact, when Microsoft did patch the problem Tuesday, Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security, applauded Microsoft's hustle. "That was record time for Microsoft, to patch in just two weeks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms and others based their bets on Microsoft's past track record. Historically, Microsoft has taken a month or more to deliver a patch for a publicly-disclosed IE vulnerability. On the rare times when Microsoft has issued an "out-of-band" update -- one outside its normal monthly schedule -- it's done so because in-the-wild attacks were gaining momentum. Although K4mr4n's exploit was in circulation, security firms like Symantec had confirmed Microsoft's contention that actual attacks had not yet appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were signs that Microsoft had known of the flaw for longer than two weeks, however. It credited iDefense with reporting the bug in the MS09-072 security bulletin that included the IE6 and IE7 patch, a fact Storms noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Storms pointed out the iDefense reporting date to Computerworld . "The IE zero-day that was fixed -- Microsoft had six months," he said in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Microsoft and iDefense recommended disabling JavaScript in IE if users were unable to apply the patch immediately. The MS09-072 update, which fixed five flaws in IE, including the zero-day, was one of six updates released Tuesday that patched a dozen vulnerabilities altogether .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Coke products to be back in Costco stores by Monday&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Coke shares up 1.2 pct; Costco down 0.3 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 10 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and   
Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) resolved a pricing dispute that
led the retailer to halt orders of the company's soft drinks,
the companies said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Effective this Monday, Coca-Cola products will be on our
shelves," said Costco CFO Richard Galanti on a conference call
with analysts, following the company's earnings release.
[ID:nN10151792]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The resolution, which was first reported via Twitter by
industry newsletter Beverage Digest, comes less than a month
after media reports that a pricing dispute between the soft
drink maker and the wholesale club operator erupted, with the
result that some stores were running out of Coca-Cola drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke spokesman Scott Williamson confirmed that Coca-Cola
products continue to be listed at Costco stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our program aligns Coca-Cola's brand and package offerings
with the needs of Costco's members in a way that is fair and
equitable for both Costco and Coca-Cola," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke shares were up 1.2 percent at $58.53 on the New York
Stock Exchange, while Costco shares were down 0.3 percent at
$58.47 on the Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;Additional Results from the 91-Month Median Follow-up of the Intergroup
Exemestane Study (IES) and the Tamoxifen, Exemestane, Adjuvant, Multicenter
(TEAM) Study Demonstrate Benefits of Aromasin in Estrogen-Receptor
Positive/Unknown Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer Patients
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer today announced results from an exploratory analysis of the Intergroup
Exemestane Study (IES) at a median follow-up of 91 months in estrogen-receptor
positive (ER+) or estrogen-receptor unknown (ER-unknown) women that looked at
breast cancer free survival (BCFS) and censored deaths that occurred prior to
breast cancer relapse. These data showed that women who switched to Aromasin
(exemestane tablets) after 2.5 years of tamoxifen experienced a 19 percent
reduction in risk of breast cancer recurrence (BCFS) (HR=0.81 95% CI (0.71,
0.92); p&lt;0.001) compared to women who continued on tamoxifen for a full five
years of treatment. Separately, results from the Tamoxifen, Exemestane,
Adjuvant, Multicenter (TEAM) study did not show a difference in disease free
survival (DFS) in women who took Aromasin for five years compared to those who
switched from tamoxifen to Aromasin after two to three years (HR=0.97 (95% CI
0.88-1.08); P=0.604). Data from IES and TEAM, presented today at the CTRC-AACR
San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), continue to underscore the benefits
of Aromasin for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive/unknown
early breast cancer. 

About IES

IES is a landmark trial with the longest follow-up of endocrine treatment in the
adjuvant switch setting. It is a randomized, double-blind, multinational trial
of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. The trial is run by the
International Collaborative Cancer Group in collaboration with the Institute of
Cancer Research-Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit (ICR-CTSU), under the
auspices of the Breast International group and sponsored by Pfizer. IES
evaluates the clinical benefits of switching patients to Aromasin after two to
three years of tamoxifen (n=2,352) versus continuing patients on tamoxifen for a
full five years of therapy (n=2,372). The primary endpoint of IES was DFS in the
intent-to-treat (ITT) population. 

The ITT analysis at a median follow-up of 91 months regarding DFS, overall
survival (OS), adverse events and other events of interest, including
cardiovascular and musculoskeletal, was presented at the joint ECCO 15/ESMO 34
in September 2009. The current analysis of BCFS focuses on the 4,599 patients
who are ER+/unknown. 

"Using breast cancer free survival as an endpoint focuses on breast cancer
events only, which is important in a population of older patients who are likely
to have other medical problems," said Dr. Stephen Jones, Medical Director, U.S.
Oncology Research, Houston and Texas Oncology, Dallas, Texas. "We are pleased to
see Aromasin`s place within the switch treatment paradigm underscored once again
by these additional long-term data." 

About TEAM

TEAM is a randomized, open-label, multinational trial in 9,779 postmenopausal
women with hormone sensitive early breast cancer. The TEAM trial represents an
international collaboration of investigators in nine countries who conducted the
trial following protocols representative of local clinical practice. 

TEAM was originally designed in 2001 as a comparison of five years of upfront
Aromasin vs. tamoxifen. In 2004, based on results of IES, the TEAM design was
revised; the tamoxifen arm was converted into a tamoxifen/Aromasin sequencing
arm. The modified design includes two co-primary endpoints comparing DFS in a
pre-planned pooled analysis:

* At 2.75 years in patients randomized to initial therapy with either tamoxifen
or Aromasin (presented at SABCS 2008) 
* In patients treated with Aromasin for five years versus patients who received
sequential therapy of tamoxifen for 2.5 to three years followed by Aromasin for
a total of five years (presented at SABCS 2009)

The analysis of DFS at a median follow-up of 5.1 years did not show a difference
between five years of upfront treatment with Aromasin and switching to Aromasin
following two to three years of tamoxifen. Results demonstrate:

* Disease Free Survival (ITT): HR=0.97 (95% CI 0.88-1.08); P=0.604 
* Time to Recurrence (ITT): HR=0.94 (95% CI 0.83-1.06); P=0.293 
* Overall Survival (ITT): HR=1.00 (95% CI 0.89-1.14); P=0.999

The safety profile reported in the TEAM study is consistent with known side
effects of Aromasin and tamoxifen. Upfront Aromasin was associated with
increased reported incidence of osteoporosis, fractures, arthralgia, nerve
compression, vaginal dryness, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Tamoxifen
followed by Aromasin was associated with increased reported incidence of hot
flushes, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, endometrial abnormalities,
endometrial cancer and venous thrombosis. 

"We are pleased to have data from both IES and TEAM presented at this year`s
SABCS," said Maria Koehler MD, PhD, Vice President, Women`s Cancers Strategy for
Pfizer Oncology. "We believe that results from both studies further support
physician and patient confidence in Aromasin." 

About Aromasin (exemestane tablets)

Aromasin is the only aromatase inhibitor indicated for sequential therapy in
postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor (HR) positive early breast cancer
after two to three years of tamoxifen for a total of five years of adjuvant
therapy. The use of Aromasin in this setting is supported by the landmark IES
trial. Aromasin is also indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in
postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. 

Important Aromasin (exemestane tablets) Safety Information

Aromasin should not be used in women who are premenopausal, are nursing or
pregnant, have a known hypersensitivity to the drug, or are taking
estrogen-containing agents. Dose modification is recommended for patients who
are receiving certain medications, including strong CYP 3A4 inducers. In
patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving Aromasin than
either tamoxifen or placebo. Reductions in bone mineral density over time are
seen with the use of Aromasin.

&lt;p&gt;Management Committee To Receive No Cash Bonus for 2009

All Discretionary Compensation Awarded As Equity "Shares At Risk"

Equity "Shares At Risk" Subject to Sales Restrictions For Five Years

Strengthened Recapture and Clawback Provision

Shareholder Advisory Vote On Compensation Principles and Executive Compensation
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today announced that its Board of
Directors has approved changes to compensation for 2009. They include the
following:

* The firm`s entire 30-person management committee, which comprises all global
divisional and regional leadership, will receive 100 percent of their
discretionary compensation in the form of Shares at Risk, which are subject to
restrictions for five years. Discretionary compensation represents the vast
majority of senior management's compensation and is directly tied to the firm's
overall performance. 
* Shares at Risk cannot be sold for five years, in addition to other
restrictions. 
* The five-year holding period on Shares at Risk includes an enhanced recapture
provision that will permit the firm to recapture the shares in cases where the
employee engaged in materially improper risk analysis or failed sufficiently to
raise concerns about risks. Enhancing our recapture provision is intended to
ensure that our employees are accountable for the future impact of their
decisions, to reinforce the importance of risk controls to the firm and to make
clear that our compensation practices do not reward taking excessive risk. 
* The enhanced recapture rights build off an existing clawback mechanism which
goes well beyond employee acts of fraud or malfeasance and includes any conduct
that is detrimental to the firm, including conduct resulting in a material
restatement of the financial statements or material financial harm to the firm
or one of its business units. 
* Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the firm`s compensation principles
and the compensation of its named executive officers at the firm`s Annual
Meeting of Shareholders in 2010.

"The measures that we are announcing today reflect the compensation principles
that we articulated at our shareholders' meeting in May. We believe our
compensation policies are the strongest in our industry and ensure that
compensation accurately reflects the firm's performance and incentivizes
behavior that is in the public`s and our shareholders` best interests," said
Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the The Goldman
Sachs Group, Inc. "In addition, by subjecting our compensation principles and
executive compensation to a shareholder advisory vote, we are further
strengthening our dialogue with shareholders on the important issue of
compensation." 

The Board of Directors and management believe these changes are consistent with
the firm`s compensation principles, which were presented at last year`s Annual
Meeting. Going forward, we continue to be focused on refining and improving our
compensation practices. The principles underlying effective compensation
practices include linking compensation to multi-year performance, aligning
compensation with the long-term interests of the firm and its shareholders, and
ensuring that compensation incentives are formulated so that they serve as a
tool to attract, retain and motivate talent, without encouraging excessive
risk-taking.

&lt;p&gt;Additional Results from the 91-Month Median Follow-up of the Intergroup
Exemestane Study (IES) and the Tamoxifen, Exemestane, Adjuvant, Multicenter
(TEAM) Study Demonstrate Benefits of Aromasin in Estrogen-Receptor
Positive/Unknown Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer Patients
SAN ANTONIO--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer today announced results from an exploratory analysis of the Intergroup
Exemestane Study (IES) at a median follow-up of 91 months in estrogen-receptor
positive (ER+) or estrogen-receptor unknown (ER-unknown) women that looked at
breast cancer free survival (BCFS) and censored deaths that occurred prior to
breast cancer relapse. These data showed that women who switched to Aromasin
(exemestane tablets) after 2.5 years of tamoxifen experienced a 19 percent
reduction in risk of breast cancer recurrence (BCFS) (HR=0.81 95% CI (0.71,
0.92); p&lt;0.001) compared to women who continued on tamoxifen for a full five
years of treatment. Separately, results from the Tamoxifen, Exemestane,
Adjuvant, Multicenter (TEAM) study did not show a difference in disease free
survival (DFS) in women who took Aromasin for five years compared to those who
switched from tamoxifen to Aromasin after two to three years (HR=0.97 (95% CI
0.88-1.08); P=0.604). Data from IES and TEAM, presented today at the CTRC-AACR
San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), continue to underscore the benefits
of Aromasin for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive/unknown
early breast cancer. 

About IES

IES is a landmark trial with the longest follow-up of endocrine treatment in the
adjuvant switch setting. It is a randomized, double-blind, multinational trial
of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. The trial is run by the
International Collaborative Cancer Group in collaboration with the Institute of
Cancer Research-Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit (ICR-CTSU), under the
auspices of the Breast International group and sponsored by Pfizer. IES
evaluates the clinical benefits of switching patients to Aromasin after two to
three years of tamoxifen (n=2,352) versus continuing patients on tamoxifen for a
full five years of therapy (n=2,372). The primary endpoint of IES was DFS in the
intent-to-treat (ITT) population. 

The ITT analysis at a median follow-up of 91 months regarding DFS, overall
survival (OS), adverse events and other events of interest, including
cardiovascular and musculoskeletal, was presented at the joint ECCO 15/ESMO 34
in September 2009. The current analysis of BCFS focuses on the 4,599 patients
who are ER+/unknown. 

"Using breast cancer free survival as an endpoint focuses on breast cancer
events only, which is important in a population of older patients who are likely
to have other medical problems," said Dr. Stephen Jones, Medical Director, U.S.
Oncology Research, Houston and Texas Oncology, Dallas, Texas. "We are pleased to
see Aromasin`s place within the switch treatment paradigm underscored once again
by these additional long-term data." 

About TEAM

TEAM is a randomized, open-label, multinational trial in 9,779 postmenopausal
women with hormone sensitive early breast cancer. The TEAM trial represents an
international collaboration of investigators in nine countries who conducted the
trial following protocols representative of local clinical practice. 

TEAM was originally designed in 2001 as a comparison of five years of upfront
Aromasin vs. tamoxifen. In 2004, based on results of IES, the TEAM design was
revised; the tamoxifen arm was converted into a tamoxifen/Aromasin sequencing
arm. The modified design includes two co-primary endpoints comparing DFS in a
pre-planned pooled analysis:

* At 2.75 years in patients randomized to initial therapy with either tamoxifen
or Aromasin (presented at SABCS 2008) 
* In patients treated with Aromasin for five years versus patients who received
sequential therapy of tamoxifen for 2.5 to three years followed by Aromasin for
a total of five years (presented at SABCS 2009)

The analysis of DFS at a median follow-up of 5.1 years did not show a difference
between five years of upfront treatment with Aromasin and switching to Aromasin
following two to three years of tamoxifen. Results demonstrate:

* Disease Free Survival (ITT): HR=0.97 (95% CI 0.88-1.08); P=0.604 
* Time to Recurrence (ITT): HR=0.94 (95% CI 0.83-1.06); P=0.293 
* Overall Survival (ITT): HR=1.00 (95% CI 0.89-1.14); P=0.999

The safety profile reported in the TEAM study is consistent with known side
effects of Aromasin and tamoxifen. Upfront Aromasin was associated with
increased reported incidence of osteoporosis, fractures, arthralgia, nerve
compression, vaginal dryness, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Tamoxifen
followed by Aromasin was associated with increased reported incidence of hot
flushes, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, endometrial abnormalities,
endometrial cancer and venous thrombosis. 

"We are pleased to have data from both IES and TEAM presented at this year`s
SABCS," said Maria Koehler MD, PhD, Vice President, Women`s Cancers Strategy for
Pfizer Oncology. "We believe that results from both studies further support
physician and patient confidence in Aromasin." 

About Aromasin (exemestane tablets)

Aromasin is the only aromatase inhibitor indicated for sequential therapy in
postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor (HR) positive early breast cancer
after two to three years of tamoxifen for a total of five years of adjuvant
therapy. The use of Aromasin in this setting is supported by the landmark IES
trial. Aromasin is also indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in
postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. 

Important Aromasin (exemestane tablets) Safety Information

Aromasin should not be used in women who are premenopausal, are nursing or
pregnant, have a known hypersensitivity to the drug, or are taking
estrogen-containing agents. Dose modification is recommended for patients who
are receiving certain medications, including strong CYP 3A4 inducers. In
patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving Aromasin than
either tamoxifen or placebo. Reductions in bone mineral density over time are
seen with the use of Aromasin.

&lt;p&gt;Company Has One of the Largest Development Teams Dedicated to Sustainable
Development in the Industry

By Ed Marchese, Executive Vice President, SJP Properties
PARSIPPANY, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Today more than ever, corporations are seeking buildings that are operationally
efficient as well as environmentally conscious. While sustainable buildings are
more cost effective to maintain and operate, the healthier environment provided
by air and water quality control is also important to today`s leading
corporations, as it directly impacts the health and wellness of their employees.
There are many reasons to go green, which is why SJP has dedicated one of the
world`s most sophisticated development teams to meeting sustainable design
requirements at all of our future properties. 

SJP Properties is committed to exceeding the facility needs of global
corporations and today we are taking this commitment to a whole new level with
LEED-certified developments throughout New Jersey and in New York City. SJP
takes its role as a model corporate citizen very seriously and our commitment to
sustainability is just one of the ways we respond to the needs of our tenants,
partners and local communities. 

Over the past 25 years, SJP Properties has built an incredibly successful track
record, developing Class A office properties for many of the world`s leading
corporations, including Aventis Pharma, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., Engelhard
Corporation, Tiffany &amp; Co., Bayer AG, Ingersoll-Rand, BISYS Plan Services, BMW,
Marsh &amp; McLennan and Prudential Insurance Company, at locations throughout the
Garden State. Our commitment to sustainable development is a natural evolution
of our philosophy of exceeding the needs of corporate America. Our goal is to
develop buildings that set a new standard for responsible environmental
development, safety and efficiency. SJP will therefore seek LEED Silver
certification for all our new developments in the future. 

As part of our company`s overall commitment to sustainable development, SJP
Properties is seeking Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
certification from the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) for all of our
build-to-suit properties in New Jersey. SJP has amassed a highly strategic
portfolio of 2.3 million square feet of build-to-suit office developments in New
Jersey`s most desirable corporate headquarters locations. We have undertaken
extensive reviews of our facilities and proposed projects and made the most
sensible decisions for each individual property. 

Hoboken - Location is Paramount

At our urban portfolio in Hoboken, location will be an important factor in
achieving LEED Silver certification. Waterfront Corporate Center III, a
520,000-square-foot, 14-story office tower in Hoboken, will be one of the
largest LEED-certified commercial developments in the state. Proximity to mass
transit will help us achieve Silver certification at this final building on the
Hoboken waterfront. Every form of mass transportation is at Waterfront Corporate
Center III`s doorstep - PATH is on-site and buses and light rail are just steps
away, as is the ferry terminal. Once the building is complete, the Waterfront
Corporate Center complex will include nearly 1.5 million square feet of Class A
commercial and retail space, featuring high-performance, energy efficient and
environmentally responsible components. 

In addition to its outstanding location, Waterfront Corporate Center III will
include high-efficiency, low-energy air conditioning equipment that utilizes
environmentally friendly refrigerant gases, reducing ozone depletion and global
warming. Systems for outside intake monitoring and increased air filtration from
the top of the building will provide 30 percent more fresh, outdoor air than is
required by international standards. Low-energy light fixtures and new lighting
controls will help reduce energy costs and low night-light levels will reduce
sky pollution, Low-flow plumbing fixtures will reduce water consumption.
Recycled materials are planned for use in construction and the building will
continue to reward green practices, offering preferred parking for low-emission
and fuel-efficient vehicles. 

Iselin - State-of-the-Art Design Features

While location was an important factor at Hoboken, we wanted the building to
represent a leap forward for commercial office buildings in New Jersey in terms
of design, green features and highly efficient mechanical and electrical
engineering systems. We have implemented similar state-of-the-art design
features at Metropark Corporate Center in Iselin, N.J. 

At Metropark, SJP Properties will offer efficient, advanced mechanical,
electrical and telecommunications systems internally, while also being
transit-oriented by offering immediate access to Metropark Train Station. This
site is located just minutes from Liberty International Airport with immediate
access to the Garden State Parkway, Interstates 95 and 287 and Routes 1, 9 and
440. SJP Properties is currently offering 295,000 square feet of build-to-suit,
Class A office space at the campus, one of the most desirable office locations
in New Jersey. 

Central New Jersey - A New Standard of Excellence

In Somerset County, we have planned Somerset Corporate Center in Bridgewater,
N.J., and Mountain View Corporate Center in Bernards Township, N.J., to be LEED
certified. Both buildings will offer high-tech, headquarters-quality, Class A
office space with a wide range of amenities and executive offices. We believe
that these developments, which together will offer more than 600,000 square feet
of highly efficient Class A LEED-certified office space, offer a new standard of
excellence for office space in central New Jersey. 

In Parsippany, N.J., SJP Properties` Morris Corporate Center continues to
evolve. Morris Corporate Center is a master-planned 2.8 million-square-foot,
seven-building office campus on 182 acres in Parsippany. The first two phases of
the campus were completed in 1986, while the third and fourth were completed in
1989 and 2000, respectively. Three additional multi-building developments of
300,000 SF in Morris Corporate Center V, 350,000 SF in Morris Corporate Center
VI and 150,000 SF in Morris Corporate Center VII, are planned at the campus.
This allows for a total of 2.7 million square feet of world class office space.
New construction will feature the highest quality building materials and will
seek LEED certification with operationally efficient mechanical systems and
materials. 

Times Square - The Gold Standard

In New York, we are developing 11 Times Square, a 40-story, 1.1
million-square-foot office tower, which is the largest new-construction
commercial development project in midtown Manhattan. Eleven Times Square will be
a LEED Gold certified tower and will be the newest, most modern and efficient
office building available in Manhattan. Eleven Times Square is on-target to be
delivered for tenant occupancy in 2010. The LEED Gold certified tower will be
high performance, energy efficient and environmentally responsible, utilizing
sustainable and renewable resources, minimizing environmental waste and
pollution and optimizing indoor air quality while seeking to reduce or eliminate
contact with toxic and hazardous conditions. All these features will lead to a
healthier working environment for tenants. 

Our goal is to build buildings that set a new standard for responsible
environmental development. We intend to set the highest possible sustainable
standards throughout our developments in the New York metropolitan area, thereby
meeting the needs not just of today`s generation of leaders but the next
generation as well.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Dec 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
As the banking industry works overtime to right itself, American Banker,
published by SourceMedia, has honored those leading the charge. American
Banker editors have honored JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon
as Banker of the Year and USAA's chairman and chief executive General
Josue Robles Jr. (ret.) as Innovator of the Year. The 2009 Community
Bankers of the Year were ServisFirst president and CEO Thomas Broughton;
Westamerica's chairman and CEO David Payne; and First Niagara Financial
Group's president and CEO John Koelmel. The newspaper's editors also
honored John Allison, retired BB CEO, with a Lifetime Achievement
award. Read the full article at www.AmericanBanker.com/boty.

    American Banker has been naming Bankers of the Year since 1991. "From our
perspective, the recent banking crisis has only increased the importance
of honoring bankers who do great work. The industry's role in the economy
and in society requires that we take note," said Barbara A. Rehm, American
Banker's editor in chief.

    Banker of the Year

    In a time of continued regulatory and economic change, Dimon has continued
to demonstrate strong leadership and prudent risk management during a time
of unprecedented turmoil, using candor and courage to steer JPMorgan Chase
to profitability, exceeding analysts' expectations.

    "Jamie Dimon defied the odds this year," said Rehm. "Superior risk
management positioned JPMorgan to capitalize on the crisis."

    Arguably the most influential banker in the country, Dimon has emerged as
a powerful voice in Washington as well as on Wall Street. As a credible
spokesperson for an industry under unprecedented scrutiny, Dimon was
instrumental in pushing the Treasury to allow JPMorgan Chase and several
other healthy banks to pay back TARP funds. Dimon's skillful handling of
JPMorgan Chase during the banking crisis positioned him as a uniquely
capable leader for the recovering banking industry.

    Innovator of the Year

    USAA's General Josue Robles (ret.), Innovator of the Year, is another
leader who successfully led his bank to calmer waters this year.
Leveraging innovations in mobile banking, remote deposit capture and auto
financing and insurance, Robles helped the $35.7 billion-asset thrift
that caters to military members and their families almost quadruple its
assets and increase deposits almost six fold in the past decade.
Impressively, USAA's growth is entirely organic and comes despite not
having any branch locations.

    Community Bankers of the Year

    Community Banker honoree, ServisFirst's Thomas Broughton, is known for his
passion for pursuing customers, which helped him build ServisFirst Bank to
$1.5 billion in assets in just four years with 30 percent of the growth
occurring in 2009 alone. ServisFirst has grown quickly without loading up
on construction loans and leveraged technologies like remote deposit
capture and internet banking to cost-effectively meet customer needs.

    A commitment to principled, measured growth is the reason that David Payne
was selected as a Community Banker of the Year. While many of his
competitors were growing by 15 to 20 percent through aggressive real
estate lending, Westamerica stuck to its core business of lending to small
companies. Although the bank received much criticism through the boom
years, today the $5.1 billion-asset Westamerica is thriving during the
economic downturn, earning close to $100 million through the first three
quarters of 2009 and generating returns on assets and equity that are
among the best in the industry.

    First Niagara chief, John Koelmel, aggressively built his bank through
acquisitions during the economic crisis. After striking two deals in
Pennsylvania that were praised for their creativity, Koelmel has made it
clear that he will pursue additional deals both inside and outside of the
bank's current market. Koelmel's strategic acquisitions have transformed
his bank into a major regional player.

    Lifetime Achievement Honoree

    As the longest-serving CEO among those running a Top 25 company when he
relinquished his title last year, John Allison sees banking as a long
game. He was best known during his 20 years at the helm of BB for
making it clear where he stood and why. Transforming an eastern North
Carolina bank from an entity with $4.5 billion in assets to one with $165
billion made him a powerful force within the industry, but it also left
some scratching their heads when he made the decision to stop buying in
2003. This important move, while unpopular, positioned BB to
successfully weather the economic downturn. He is currently writing two
books; one will examine effective leadership, and the other, the
evolution of the U.S. financial system; and he recently joined the
faculty of the Wake Forest University School of Business.

    About the Awards

    The Banker of the Year Awards honorees are selected by the editors of
American Banker in an independent and journalistic process. To accompany
the awards, a special report, "Best in Banking 2009," showcasing the
year's most important stories and trends, was published in the December 7
edition of American Banker and is available online.

Patzer. "Quicken 2010 is also easier to use and navigate. As always, Quicken
2010 is powerful and accurate, offering Morning Star research, timely quotes,
funds transfer between accounts, and integrated bill-pay capabilities."

&lt;p&gt;FORT LEE, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
United Dealers New Jersey, whose members own and operate more than 100 local
Exxon stations throughout New Jersey, announces its members filed a Complaint in
Federal Court last night against ExxonMobil Corporation. This unprecedented
legal action is an effort to sustain the operation of their stations and protect
themselves from unfair practices that they say have been levied upon them by
ExxonMobil. Through the lawsuit, the station owners seek to have the Court
declare certain practices of ExxonMobil unlawful and reduce gasoline prices in
New Jersey and ultimately, throughout the country. 

The lawsuit, funded entirely by the station owners, accuses ExxonMobil of taking
advantage of its New Jersey franchises through a number of unlawful practices.
The lawsuit claims that ExxonMobil has been charging different prices to
different Exxon stations for the same quality and grade of motor fuel. Thus,
consumers in the same geographic region have been forced to pay different prices
for the same gasoline. The lawsuit also alleges that ExxonMobil`s conduct has
resulted in the plaintiffs and consuming public having an insufficient supply of
available gasoline as prices rise. The lawsuit seeks to prohibit ExxonMobil from
engaging in such conduct. 

"ExxonMobil`s actions have resulted in an increased financial burden on the
families that own and operate more than 100 Exxon stations in New Jersey," said
attorney Marc J. Gross, a partner with Greenbaum, Rowe, Smith &amp; Davis LLP,
Roseland, New Jersey, who represents the plaintiff station owners. "ExxonMobil
has threatened the continued viability of these small businesses with the
imposition of unreasonable standards." 

For most of these plaintiffs, "their investment in their franchise represents
their life savings," Gross adds. 

Scott Brownfeld, owner of an Exxon station in Lincroft, New Jersey, for nearly a
decade, complains that, "ExxonMobil has made things very difficult. It has
threatened to sell its New Jersey franchises to jobbers. If that happens, we are
afraid our costs will increase. The price we pay is already high enough." 

As the worldwide leader in the sale of motor fuels, ExxonMobil sets the pace by
which all other oil companies follow. "These business owners have taken an
extraordinary risk and placed an enormous burden upon themselves in suing
ExxonMobil," says Gross. "They are attempting to bring order and accountability
to the motor fuel marketplace." 

Gross believes this lawsuit will have "far-reaching consequences in reducing the
price everyone pays for gasoline, if the station owners are successful." 

"We need customer support now more than ever," said Ebbie Ashabi, who has owned
Exxon stations in Ramsey and Newfoundland, New Jersey, for more than nine years.
"ExxonMobil will undoubtedly assemble significant opposition to our efforts and
we will not be able to afford this fight unless our customers stand behinds us."


Ed Rapke, who has owned Exxon stations in Livingston, New Jersey, for more than
nine years, is concerned. "We are paying for this out of our pockets, while at
the same time doing everything we can to keep the price of gasoline as low as
possible. A portion of the purchases made at our stations goes towards our fight
against ExxonMobil so we are all treated fairly." 

Ashabi states his group`s goal plainly. "We want to make the New Jersey gasoline
marketplace more consumer friendly by reducing the price everyone pays. We need
our customers to be our partners to help us be successful."

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced a $21.6 billion capital and
exploratory spending program for 2010, a five percent decrease from projected
2009 expenditures. Included in the 2010 program are $1.6 billion of expenditures
by affiliates, which do not require cash outlays by Chevron`s consolidated
companies. 

"Our company is in a strong financial position," said Chairman and CEO Dave
O`Reilly. 

O`Reilly said about 80 percent of the 2010 spending program is for upstream oil
and gas exploration and production projects worldwide. Another 16 percent is
associated with the company`s downstream businesses that manufacture, transport
and sell gasoline, diesel fuel and other refined products. 

"Much of our 2010 spending continues to be on large, multiyear projects
consistent with our upstream growth strategies and on improving operating
efficiency and reliability," O`Reilly added.

&lt;p&gt;Report Shows How Fast, Efficient and Inexpensive Social Networking is Changing
Consumers` Behavior and Offers Insight into New Opportunities to Reach Them
TIBURON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Jon Peddie Research (JPR), the industry's research and consulting firm for
multimedia, today announced a new study on the Social Networking phenomenon and
shows readers how to benefit from participating in it. The Social Web and its
Implications: How "going social" changes everything about the Internet
illuminates the subject in ways that inform both strategic and tactical users,
and provides guideposts for further exploration and exploitation by the reader. 

"This is not just another study on how to use Twitter and Facebook for
marketing. Instead, we hope to instill a broad understanding of the entire
landscape," said Dr. Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research. 

Word of mouth has proven to be the best sales tool, and social networks are the
fastest and most far-reaching word of mouth mechanism ever seen. The growth of
social networking has been astounding, demonstrating a pent- up demand for fast,
efficient and inexpensive way of communicating and interacting. It also
demonstrates a higher degree of technical savvy by users than was originally
thought. Both are important signs for marketing and manufacturing organizations
that want to know their customers better and tap into social pools to leverage
recommendations, address criticism and head off rumors. 

"The Social Web is not a fad; it is a fundamental shift in how humans
communicate, interact, collaborate, create, inform themselves, prioritize,
organize, buy, sell and play. It is your customers, your friends, your family,
your employees, your constituents, your shareholders, and, like it or not, you,"
said Brad DeGraf, the report`s author. "The word `viral` hardly existed in our
vocabulary before social media. Now it`s in constant use without the slightest
reference to illness." 

The Social Web and its Implications: How "going social" changes everything about
the Internet provides the following:

* A high-level survey of the major societal and economic effects, the key
concepts and impacts, the major players. 
* A thorough inventory of the full range of major behaviors/uses. 
* A broad collection of useful statistics that help answer some frequently-asked
questions. 
* Detailed analysis of one representative application, Twitter. 
* Guidance for further exploration and research, hyperlinked liberally.

JPR uses the term "social media" broadly in order to include all related
applications, trends, and practices, e.g. social networking, collaboration,
user-generated content, and analytics. The report uses the term "social Web"
relatively interchangeably with "social media" to emphasize the human element. 

Why care?

Short answer: if you don`t master it, your competition will. Social media
infants like Twitter and Facebook are the little furry creatures running around
the feet of dinosaurs eating their eggs. Craigslist, for instance, is commonly
blamed for the demise of newspapers, replacing their $100 billion in classified
ad revenue with its reported $100 million revenue according to the Classified
Intelligence Report by media consulting firm Advanced Interactive Media Group. 

Social media represents a transformative new channel to listen to and
communicate with customers, stakeholders, media, peers, and other influencers.
Conversations are taking place about your company, product, and service, right
now, with or without you. Social media provides rapidly evolving channels
through which new classes of "influencers" communicate. 

Pricing and availability

The Social Web and its Implications: How "going social" changes everything about
the Internet is available now in both electronic and hard copy editions, and can
be purchased for $1,995.

&lt;p&gt;Number of Potential Beneficiaries Increases with Availability of Many Legacy
Wyeth Medicines

New Interactive Tool Makes it Easy for People to Learn if They May Be Eligible
for Pfizer MAINTAIN&#8482; or other Pfizer Patient Assistance Programs
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer today announced it will extend its MAINTAIN&#8482; (Medicines Assistance for
Those who Are in Need) patient assistance program for an additional year,
through December 31, 2010. In addition to the more than 70 Pfizer primary care
medicines currently available through MAINTAIN, Pfizer will extend the benefits
of MAINTAIN to many legacy Wyeth medicines. 

Pfizer launched MAINTAIN in May to help unemployed and uninsured Americans stay
on their Pfizer medicines. The program, an employee-driven initiative, is part
of Pfizer Helpful Answers&#174;, Pfizer`s family of patient assistance programs that
helps uninsured and underinsured Americans get Pfizer medicines for free or at a
savings. Seventy-five percent of people who have applied to Pfizer`s MAINTAIN
program have been enrolled. 

Coupled with testimonials from MAINTAIN members and other interactive features,
Pfizer released the MAINTAINwidget, an online tool that guides users through a
short series of questions that determine whether they may be eligible for
MAINTAIN or for another Pfizer patient assistance program. 

Gail Grime, a MAINTAIN member from Ohio, lost her employment and health
insurance after a 23-year career working for a U.S.-based auto parts
manufacturer. Ms. Grime learned about MAINTAIN in a newspaper article, which she
has subsequently shared with her family and many of her former co-workers. 

"When I lost my job, I found myself without medical coverage for the first time
in years. But thanks to MAINTAIN, I don`t have to cut back on my Pfizer
medicines, or go without them," Ms. Grime said. "The application was easy but,
most importantly, the folks in customer service answered every one of my
questions. In these rough times, it`s nice to have someone looking out for you."


By extending the benefits of the MAINTAIN program for another year and to
patients needing help with legacy Wyeth medicines, Pfizer is responding to the
continued economic challenges facing hard-working Americans. Although the
economy appears to be on the mend and the number of job losses has begun to
slow, data show that unemployment remains at a 26-year high. 

"In the last year, we have witnessed a great deal of suffering. Yet, our
families, friends and neighbors have exhibited true American spirit, finding
innovative ways to manage during tough times," said Jorge Puente, Pfizer`s
regional president of Worldwide Pharmaceuticals and a leading champion of the
initiative. "Signs are pointing to recovery; however, millions of people are
struggling without the benefit of insurance and without a regular income. As the
world`s largest biopharmaceutical company, we believe we have a corporate
responsibility to help our fellow Americans who need the medicines Pfizer
offers, but who do not have insurance to help pay for them. By extending
MAINTAIN, we are hopeful that we can continue to relieve some of the burden
created by the recession." 

Pfizer has long been a leader in making medicines accessible to uninsured
Americans, and MAINTAIN is just the latest example of Pfizer`s innovation in the
area of improved access. In 2004, the company expanded Pfizer Helpful Answers,
the company`s family of patient assistance programs, becoming the first
pharmaceutical company to help anyone in the United States without prescription
insurance, no matter their age or income. 

Pfizer Helpful Answers has been helping uninsured and underinsured patients get
Pfizer medicines for free or at a savings for more than two decades. In the last
five years alone, Pfizer has helped more than 5 million uninsured patients get
access to more than 51 million Pfizer prescriptions valued at more than $4.8
billion at wholesale cost through its patient assistance programs. The reach of
Pfizer`s patient assistance programs in each state is illustrated in one of the
charts accompanying this release. 

"Pfizer MAINTAIN is a response to the evolving needs of uninsured Americans.
Access programs are, simply put, ingrained in our corporate culture," Puente
said. 

MAINTAIN Eligibility Requirements and Application

The MAINTAIN program has four eligibility requirements. Applicants must:

* Be able to demonstrate loss of employment on or after January 1, 2009; 
* Lack prescription coverage; 
* Attest to financial need; and, 
* Have been on their Pfizer medicine for at least three months prior to
unemployment and enrolling in the program.

The program is user-friendly, with a one-page application that Pfizer will
typically process within two to three weeks. Applicants may download the
one-page application from www.PfizerHelpfulAnswers.com, or request one by
calling 866-706-2400, where live operators can help callers find out if they may
be eligible for one of Pfizer`s patient assistance programs. 

The program will accept applications through December 31, 2010. If eligible for
MAINTAIN, patients can get their medicines for free for up to one year after
enrollment or until they become insured, whichever comes first. People who are
uninsured and still need help after being on MAINTAIN for a year can apply to
one of Pfizer`s other patient assistance programs. 

For Help with Wyeth Medicines

As a result of Pfizer and Wyeth coming together, Pfizer is also extending the
benefits of MAINTAIN to people who need help staying on their Wyeth primary care
medicines. Until the Pfizer and Wyeth patient assistance programs are fully
integrated, likely by mid-2010, please visit www.PfizerHelpfulAnswers.com and
click on the Wyeth link or call 866-706-2400 and ask for help with Wyeth
medicines.

uninsured and underinsured who need help getting Pfizer medicines. Today, it is

&lt;p&gt;PARIS/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A new email client unveiled by Mozilla this week contains code from an unusual source -- the French military, which decided the open source product was more secure than Microsoft's rival Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of how the French government became involved with the open source movement, which has transformed much software around the world from proprietary to free, goes back six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France's military chose open source software after an internal government debate that began in 2003 and culminated in a November 6, 2007, directive requiring state agencies "Seek maximum technological and commercial independence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The military found Mozilla's open source design permitted France to build security extensions, while Microsoft's secret, proprietary software allowed no tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We started with a military project, but quickly generalized it," said Lieutenant-Colonel Frederic Suel of the Ministry of Defense and one of those in charge of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gendarmerie Nationale police, which was part of the military at the time and did the design, released some of its work to the public under the name "TrustedBird," and co-branded it with Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The military uses Mozilla's Thunderbird mail software and in some cases the Trustedbird extension on 80,000 computers and it has spread to the ministries of Finance, Interior and Culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LINUX ALSO WINS ACCEPTANCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French government is beginning to move to other open source software, including Linux instead of Windows and OpenOffice instead of Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-profit groups that make most such programs, including Samba server programs and Mozilla's best-known product, the Firefox Web browser, depend on volunteer programmers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thunderbird 3 used some of the code from TrustedBird, as well as drawing on 1,000 other computer geeks and users around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The primary changes (the military) have made allow them to know for sure when messages have been read, which is critical in a command-and-control organization," said David Ascher, chief executive of Mozilla Messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That qualifies it for NATO's closed messaging system, and the French military has shown TrustedBird to NATO, military officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French military is "helping build an ecosystem of specialists around the world that provide specialized add-ons, leveraging our platform to help meet customer needs," Mozilla's Ascher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a product that is compatible with Yahoo! mail, Google Gmail and other email systems, but competes against Microsoft Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some observers said the original decision to go to open source was in part to show the French public that the government was trying to save money. But many software experts say free software also has its costs and the French acknowledged that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is never completely free," said Col. Bruno Poirier-Coutansais of the information technology team Gendarmerie Nationale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New software requires the re-training of information technology specialists. Experts point out that it also requires employees to learn to use the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poirier-Coutansais said there was initial reluctance to embrace Thunderbird "because it is less reassuring than to have a renowned company that can bring quality support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has platoons of technicians in France at a state-of-the-art glass building in a western suburban business district emblazoned with the company logo, while Mozilla, with 10 employees in an anonymous concrete colored residential building, is distant from Paris's business districts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the French government is now pleased with the results. Suel said they may move beyond government, because Trusted Bird's security extensions make it "transposable to large international companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One expert was less certain of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The professional market is showing more resistance to open source software," said Bernard-Louis Roques, chief executive of Truffle Capital IT, an investment fund specializing in software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Marcel Michelson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  PERTH, AUSTRALIA, Dec 10 (MARKET WIRE) --

&lt;p&gt;PARIS/SAN FRANCISCO Dec 10 (Reuters) - A new email client
unveiled by Mozilla this week contains code from an unusual
source -- the French military, which decided the open source
product was more secure than Microsoft's (MSFT.O) rival Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The story of how the French government became involved with
the open source movement, which has transformed much software
around the world from proprietary to free, goes back six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; France's military chose open source software after an
internal government debate that began in 2003 and culminated in
a Nov. 6, 2007, directive requiring state agencies "Seek maximum
technological and commercial independence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The military found Mozilla's open source design permitted
France to build security extensions, while Microsoft's secret,
proprietary software allowed no tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We started with a military project, but quickly generalised
it," said Lieutenant-Colonel Frederic Suel of the Ministry of
Defense and one of those in charge of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Gendarmerie Nationale police, which was part of the
military at the time and did the design, released some of its
work to the public under the name "TrustedBird," and co-branded
it with Mozilla.
  The military uses Mozilla's Thunderbird mail software and in
some cases the Trustedbird extension on 80,000 computers and it
has spread to the ministries of Finance, Interior and Culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LINUX ALSO WINS ACCEPTANCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The French government is beginning to move to other open
source software, including Linux instead of Windows and
OpenOffice instead of Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The non-profit groups that make most such programs,
including Samba server programs and Mozilla's best-known
product, the Firefox Web browser, depend on volunteer
programmers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thunderbird 3 used some of the code from TrustedBird, as
well as drawing on 1,000 other computer geeks and users around
the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The primary changes (the military) have made allow them to
know for sure when messages have been read, which is critical in
a command-and-control organisation," said David Ascher, chief
executive of Mozilla Messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That qualifies it for NATO's closed messaging system, and
the French military has shown TrustedBird to NATO, military
officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The French military is "helping build an ecosystem of
specialists around the world that provide specialised add-ons,
leveraging our platform to help meet customer needs," Mozilla's
Ascher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is a product that is compatible with Yahoo! mail
(YHOO.O), Google (GOOG.O) Gmail and other email systems, but
competes against Microsoft Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some observers said the original decision to go to open
source was in part to show the French public that the government
was trying to save money. But many software experts say free
software also has its costs and the French acknowledged that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is never completely free," said Col. Bruno
Poirier-Coutansais of the information technology team
Gendarmerie Nationale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New software requires the re-training of information
technology specialists. Experts point out that it also requires
employees to learn to use the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poirier-Coutansais said there was initial reluctance to
embrace Thunderbird "because it is less reassuring than to have
a renowned company that can bring quality support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has platoons of technicians in France at a
state-of-the-art glass building in a western suburban business
district emblazoned with the company logo, while Mozilla, with
10 employees in an anonymous concrete colored residential
building, is distant from Paris's business districts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the French government is now pleased with the
results. Suel said they may move beyond government, because
Trusted Bird's security extensions make it "transposable to
large international companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One expert was less certain of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The professional market is showing more resistance to open
source software," said Bernard-Louis Roques, chief exective of
Truffle Capital IT, an investment fund specialising in software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Marcel Michelson)

&lt;p&gt;IBM opened a new data center in South Korea on Thursday and said it is building another one in Auckland, New Zealand, to address a surge in demand for cloud computing and IT services in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also announced the opening of a cloud computing lab in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total investment by IBM in these three facilities is about US$100 million, said James M. Larkin, a spokesman for  IBM Global Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which already has over 400 data centers worldwide, will continue to invest in new data centers that offer cloud computing capabilities, while upgrading existing data centers to support cloud computing,  Larkin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is planning to announce by February next year a new data center in Raleigh, North Carolina, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data center at Auckland will be in operation  by 2010 with IBM investing about US$57 million in that center over the next ten years.  IBM will locate the data center at Highbrook Business Park in East Tamaki. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 56,000 square-foot facility will include a 16,000 square-foot data center, IBM said. The company can add more stages to expand the data center as demand rises, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center will support IBM's clients in New Zealand and neighboring countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Larkin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data center in Seoul will provide IT services including strategic outsourcing, e-business hosting and disaster recovery to more than 20 clients which have entered into outsourcing agreements with the company, IBM said. The center was built using green technology, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Computing Laboratory in Hong Kong is a development and services center, focusing on LotusLive messaging development, testing, technical support and services delivery, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LotusLive is IBM's  collection of integrated, online collaboration solutions and social networking services for  businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab, which is IBM's tenth cloud computing lab worldwide, builds on the email technology and expertise of Outblaze, a company in Hong Kong, whose messaging assets were acquired by IBM earlier this year and included in the Lotus brand of collaboration services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab is  part of the IBM China Development Laboratory which has over 5,000 developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' latest IT spending survey forecasts modest overall growth in the coming year, with pent-up demand for new hardware such as servers and PCs stimulating an increase in Windows 7 upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Goldman forecasts an 8 percent decline in global IT spending for 2009, followed by 4 percent growth in 2010. The survey is comprised of 100 IT executives from Fortune 1000 companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending on software for servers (with VMware and Red Hat ranking highest) as well as virtualization and SaaS-based applications (with VMware, salesforce.com and Citrix ranking the highest) is predicted to return to normal levels in 2010. But with more than half the survey respondents indicating they will do PC, server and storage refreshes next year, most of the spending will be on hardware, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Windows 7 in Pictures: The Coolest New Hardware Slideshow: 7 Tools to Ease Your Windows 7 Rollout Slideshow: Windows 7 in Pictures: 10 Cool Desktop Features&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman points to data from research firm IDC stating that 2009 third-quarter PC shipments are up 17 percent from the previous quarter and up 2 percent year-over-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in PC upgrades in 2010 are likely due to aging PCs at the end of their lifecycle. Yet the arrival of Windows 7 also has a significant influence, according to the Goldman Sachs report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey indicates that 94 percent of survey respondents intend to upgrade to Windows 7, with 32 percent planning to do so in 2010 and 28 percent anticipating an upgrade in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft in 2010: Four Challenges That Lie Ahead Windows 7 Launch: Early Adopters Eager to Bid Farewell to XP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman expects that the remaining 34 percent of Windows 7 upgraders who report the intention to upgrade in 2012 and beyond will lean more toward 2012. Why? Because 85 to 90 percent of respondents are still on Windows XP, and XP support expires in April 2014. "We believe that 2013 becomes a de facto deadline for Windows 7 upgrades," states the survey report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another indicator that Windows 7 will drive more IT spending: the percentage of respondents who believe that their spending with Microsoft will increase jumped to 36 percent, compared to 15 percent and 24 percent in the last two surveys, which took place in June and August respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One piece of bad news for Microsoft from the survey: Apple, surprisingly, is the PC maker gaining the most share of IT dollars, followed by Windows-based PC makers HP, Lenovo and Dell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although Apple's presence in the enterprise PC segment remains small," the report states, "the company was a share gainer for the 11th consecutive time in this survey, as companies and employees continue to adopt the Mac platform for corporate use. We think these results are supported by Apple's recent strong September quarter, with Mac sales a key driver."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

Citi Plans Equity Offering

Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) could raise money through a $20 billion equity offering
to repay the bailout money it has received from the government for its
participation in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) at the height of the
credit crisis last year. 

Citigroup`s chairman, Vikram Pandit, has revealed yesterday that the company is
in a position to be able to repay TARP, but is awaiting government approval.
Yesterday, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) announced that it had completed
repaying its $45 billion of TARP funds following its $19.3 billion of equity
offering last week. This has increased the pressure on Citigroup and Wells Fargo
&amp; Co. (NYSE: WFC), both of which have also received significant amounts of TARP
fund. In June, major banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) and
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) paid back their bailout money. 

Citigroup had received $45 billion of TARP funds last year. Later, around $25
billion of that was converted into common stock, representing around 34% of its
stake, which is held by taxpayers. Citigroup has the remaining $20 billion in
TARP funds to repay. 

Additionally, the future of the insurance policy that guarantees over $300
billion of Citigroup`s troubled assets provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation needs to be decided upon. The payment for that insurance was made by
Citigroup through a preferred stock offering to the government. The government
is also expected to disclose its plan for the sale of its 34% stake. 

If Citigroup is allowed to make the equity offering and raise money for the
repayment of the TARP funds, the bank would be free from government involvement
in its affairs and pay restrictions.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

GE Wins $1.4B Wind Turbine Deal

General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) announced that it has received a $1.4
billion contract from independent power producer Caithness Energy to supply wind
turbines and provide services for an 845-megawatt (MW) wind farm project to be
located in Oregon. 

The wind farm, called Shepherds Flat, has received the majority of the necessary
government permits to operate and is ready to be built. When completed, it will
be larger than any wind farm currently in operation around the globe. 

Stretching across 30 square miles of Gilliam and Morrow Counties in
north-central Oregon, near the town of Arlington, the 845-megawatt Shepherds
Flat project marks the US debut and largest single global order of GE`s 2.5xl
wind turbines. A total of 338 turbines will be installed in 2011 and 2012. 

The 2.5-MW wind turbine is the latest evolution of GE`s wind turbine technology
and provides customers with greater efficiency, reliability and grid connection
capabilities. The 2.5-MW builds upon the success of GE`s 1.5-MW wind turbine,
the world's most widely deployed wind turbine with more than 12,000 installed. 

Caithness Energy estimates that the $2 billion project will inject $16 million
annually of direct economic benefits into Oregon, and will employ 400 workers
during construction and 35 during operation. 

GE Energy Financial Services -- with a portfolio of more than 40 wind farms with
a total capacity to produce more than 6 Gigawatts of electricity -- is investing
in the project. 

Under three 20-year power purchase agreements, the Shepherds Flat wind farm will
supply renewable energy to Southern California Edison, an Edison International
(NYSE: EIX) company. 

The project will help California meet both its capacity needs and renewable
energy goals. With the capacity to generate two billion kilowatt-hours per year
of renewable energy, the wind farm will represent more than one-tenth of
Southern California Edison's overall renewable energy portfolio. 

GE serves customers in more than 100 countries and employs more than 300,000
people worldwide. Major competitors include United Technologies Corporation
(NYSE: UTX) and Siemens AG (NYSE: SI). 

We currently have a Neutral recommendation on GE. 

Progressive`s Earnings Fall

Auto insurer Progressive Corporation`s (NYSE: PGR) earnings for November fell to
12 cents per share compared with 20 cents in the year-ago period. Though the
company achieved a growth in premium writings, the year-over-year decline in
earnings reflect a large gain from the sale of U.S. Treasury securities in the
prior-year period. 

The company, which reports earnings on a monthly basis, disclosed an income of
$80.0 million, down from $137.5 million in the prior-year period. In November
2008, Progressive experienced $100.1 million of net realized gains, primarily
from the U.S. Treasury securities sale for tax-planning purposes. Realized gains
in November 2009 were $6.1 million. 

Progressive`s net premiums written increased 2% year-over-year to $942.1
million. Combined ratio, which reflects the percentage of premiums paid out as
claims and expenses, improved to 92.2% from 93.8% recorded in the year-ago
period.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Oil Slides, Fuel Inventories Rise

The overall demand picture remains weak, as reflected by the dip in the total
refined products supplied over the last four-week period, a proxy for overall
petroleum demand. It fell by 3.0% from the year-earlier period, with gasoline up
1.2%, distillates (includes diesel) down 8.3% and jet fuel down 0.7%. 

With gasoline and other petroleum product inventories rising last week, we take
this as an indication that demand in the world's biggest economy remains slack.
In particular, at this time of the year, distillates see rising demand as winter
approaches in the northern hemisphere. As a result, following the bearish EIA
release, oil prices fell below the $71 per barrel level, the lowest in two
months. Additionally, the unexpected drop in crude stockpiles was triggered by
falling imports rather than a much-awaited pick-up in oil demand. 

As such, we prefer to maintain our cautious stance on oil refiners like Sunoco
Inc. (NYSE: SUN), Tesoro Corp. (NYSE: TSO) and Western Refining Inc. (NYSE:
WNR), given that the overall environment for refining margins is likely to
remain poor going into 2010. 

Companies like ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) --
oil majors that have significant refining operations -- are also expected to
remain under pressure until pricing and demand improve.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Dec 11 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
on Friday operations were normal at its 150,000-barrel-per-day
(bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in Torrance, California, after
a process unit malfunctioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The malfunction triggered the refinery's safety flare and
workers on the unit involved in the upset were asked to step
away from it until the problem was corrected, said an Exxon
spokeswoman, who declined to identify the unit involved.

&lt;p&gt;   * Says closure to affect 87 jobs * Says plant not under its
core portfolio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sees charge of $5.5-$6mln in Q4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 11 (Reuters) - Coking coal producer Walter Energy Inc
(WLT.N) said its unit Walter Coke plans to close its fiber
plant in Alabama, effective immediately, cut jobs and take
related charges in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter said the plant was not under its core portfolio, and
that more than half of the 87 employees who will lose their
jobs will be shifted to Walter Coke's operations in other
areas. The plant produced about 100,000 tons of various slag
wool fiber products annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The steel-making coal producer said it expects to take a
charge of about $5.5 million to $6 million in the fourth
quarter, due to the plant closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The worst recession in decades had caused near-term pain
for the coal industry as demand for steel and electricity
slumped, forcing coal producers to slice production, idle
operations and cut jobs to keep prices from plummeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, earlier this week, Walter Energy's top official
said it has seen demand in its key markets bounce back and the
coal miner is looking at further production expansions to meet
the surge in demand. [ID:nWNBB9097]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Walter Energy closed at $71.79 Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;La collection arrive en magasin ce mois-ci
HERZOGENAURACH, Allemagne--(Business Wire)--
Adidas et Disney ont annonc&#233; aujourd`hui le lancement d`une toute nouvelle gamme
de produits pour b&#233;b&#233;s et enfants, qui combinera les produits top performance
pour enfants d`Adidas avec les personnages classiques de Disney, &#224; savoir Mickey

et d`accessoires, sera propos&#233;e &#224; l`&#233;chelle mondiale par les magasins Sport
Performance d`Adidas et par divers magasins de sport. 

Gr&#226;ce &#224; la magie Disney, en plus de l`insigne que l`on retrouve habituellement
sur les habits Adidas, la toute nouvelle collection proposera des d&#233;tails au
niveau des poches ainsi que des badges Mickey Mouse en caoutchouc sur les
T-shirts et les pantalons, tandis que les v&#234;tements &#224; capuche seront compl&#233;t&#233;s
par des fermetures &#224; glissi&#232;re Mickey Mouse. Les T-shirts et chemises pour
gar&#231;ons seront orn&#233;s d`une image anim&#233;e de Mickey Mouse tandis que Minnie Mouse
sera le personnage principal des habits de filles, et que l`on retrouvera sa
silhouette f&#233;minine sur les T-shirts et casquettes leur &#233;tant destin&#233;s. Divers
accessoires f&#233;minins compl&#233;teront les ensembles : valisettes assorties pour les
habits et les chaussures, et casquettes ou chaussettes douces en coton reprenant
les graphiques Mickey Mouse ou Minnie Mouse. (Possibilit&#233; de visionner une vid&#233;o

&#224; Disney Consumer Products &#224; l`adresse (www.YouTube.com/DisneyLiving) ou
directement &#224; l`adresse http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDVg5gv2MIo.) 

En plus du design classique &#224; trois bandes d`Adidas, plusieurs pi&#232;ces de choix
de la premi&#232;re collection sont orn&#233;es de d&#233;tails remarquables, comme des
impressions s`&#233;tendant sur toute la surface avec une finition brillante de type
m&#233;tal/perle sur les habits, et des applications argent&#233;es sp&#233;ciales au niveau
des lacets de chaussures pour ajouter &#224; l`aspect fantaisiste. Au niveau des
chaussures, on notera les chaussures de sport Disney StreetRun de couleur rose
diva et m&#233;tal argent pour les filles et de couleur turquoise et blanc pour les
gar&#231;ons. Gr&#226;ce aux &#233;l&#233;ments de design en 3D repr&#233;sentant Mickey Mouse et Minnie
Mouse, les chaussures sortent vraiment de l`ordinaire, mais pour les enfants, le
d&#233;tail le plus attrayant sera certainement la semelle color&#233;e laissant sur le
sol une empreinte Adidas de th&#232;me Disney. 

&#171; J`ai grandi avec Mickey et Minnie et mon objectif principal &#233;tait de r&#233;aliser
une collection sortant de l`ordinaire pour les gar&#231;ons et filles qui soit cool
et mignonne &#224; la fois, et qui donne vie &#224; ces personnages classiques de Disney
&#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; la cr&#233;atrice d`Adidas Rana Babacan. Pete Brady, manageur de
produits pour Adidas Kids, a quant &#224; lui ajout&#233; : &#171; Pour nos deux marques de
renomm&#233;e internationale, cette coop&#233;ration repr&#233;sente une v&#233;ritable opportunit&#233;
de rassembler des expertises et de cr&#233;er une toute nouvelle empreinte permettant
de combiner les v&#234;tements sport pour enfants et la passion de ces derniers pour
tout ce qui a trait &#224; Disney. &#187; 

&#171; Mickey Mouse reste au premier rang de nombreuses tendances de mode, et nous
sommes ravis de la fa&#231;on dont nous avons r&#233;ussi &#224; int&#233;grer Mickey et ses amis
dans cette gamme &#187;, a ajout&#233; Pamela Lifford, vice-pr&#233;sidente ex&#233;cutive du
d&#233;partement global fashion &amp; home de Disney Consumer Products. &#171; Cette nouvelle
ligne de produits mode devrait plaire aux enfants ainsi qu`&#224; leurs parents
soucieux de la mode. &#187; 

La collection printemps/&#233;t&#233; 2010 arrivera en magasin au cours des mois de
d&#233;cembre 2009 et janvier 2010, y compris des magasins Sport Performance d`Adidas
et autres magasins de sport s&#233;lectionn&#233;s. Pour les b&#233;b&#233;s, les prix d&#233;marreront &#224;

Dans la prochaine collection d`Adidas inspir&#233;e par Disney, on trouvera plusieurs

avec la sortie hautement anticip&#233;e du film Toy Story 3 dans les salles du monde
entier.

&lt;p&gt;RALEIGH, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
State Employees` Credit Union (SECU) recently celebrated its gift of 54 laptop
computers for North Carolina`s Tarheel ChalleNGe Academy at a ribbon cutting
ceremony, which marked the official opening of the school`s computer lab. The
Credit Union provided the computers to the Academy through a partnership with
Visa Inc. 

Tarheel ChalleNGe Academy, located in Salemburg, NC, is a quasi-military program
available for at-risk youth. The Academy`s program concentrates on providing
these young adults with the discipline and life skills necessary to be
productive members of society. The North Carolina National Guard sponsors this
voluntary program, which has seen more than 2,700 graduates since its inception
in 1994. 

The laptops which will be used to enhance instruction at the institution,
feature links to financial literacy programs, including SECU`s teen website and
the National Endowment for Financial Education`s NEFE website, as well as Visa`s
program, Practical Money Skills for Life (www.practicalmoneyskills.com). The
ribbon cutting ceremony for the Academy`s computer lab was held on December 7th
and attended by North Carolina Adjutant General William E. Ingram, Jr., numerous
Academy officials and staff, Academy cadets, Shirley Bell - SECU`s Board of
Directors immediate past chair, SECU volunteer Advisory Board member Dr. Al
Wentzy and various Credit Union staff members. 

SECU - Jackson Advisory Board member Dr. Al Wentzy comments, "This was a `home
run event threefold!` First, we substantially helped a school that takes high
school dropouts and puts them on a path to success. Second, we acquired
computers with supportive technology for learning with financial literacy
software; and third, we supported our own NC National Guard troops in their
efforts to help others! Hearing almost daily of recessionary problems in our
nation, how refreshing it is to be a member of a credit union that is not only
financially stable, but truly cares about their members and the community in
which we live." 

Shirley Bell, 2008-2009 SECU Board of Directors Chairman, adds, "SECU, a
not-for-profit financial cooperative, serves members of the North Carolina
National Guard, making this project a natural fit for our organization. The
Credit Union also places a major focus on education and financial literacy and
the donation of these laptops for Tarheel ChalleNGe Academy`s computer lab
aligns with this focus. With the Academy`s mission of improving life-coping
skills and the employment potential of North Carolina youth, we take great pride
in our partnership with Visa to further enhance the Tarheel ChalleNGe program
and look forward to a long-standing relationship with the Academy, its fine
instructors and cadets." 

About SECU

SECU is a non-profit financial cooperative owned by its members. SECU has been
providing the employees of the State of North Carolina and their families with
consumer financial services for more than 70 years. Currently serving over 1.5
million members, SECU provides services through 226 branch offices, over 1,000
ATMs, 24/7 call centers and a website-www.ncsecu.org.

&lt;p&gt;  TAMPA, FL, Dec 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT), a leading U.S. producer and exporter of
premium coking coal for the global steel industry, announced today that
its Walter Coke subsidiary, based in Birmingham, Ala., plans to close its
fiber plant, effective immediately. The fiber plant produced
approximately 100,000 tons of various slag wool fiber products annually,
primarily for use in acoustical ceiling tiles, fireproof cement,
miscellaneous refractory board products and building insulation
applications.

    Employees were notified of the decision earlier today. Approximately 87
positions will be eliminated as a result of the closure. However, more
than half of the employees are expected to be retained in other areas of
Walter Coke's operation, where recent sales orders are expected to return
the plant to full metallurgical coke capacity in the first quarter of
2010.

    "The fiber plant was not in our core portfolio and the business has
struggled in its current economic environment," said Victor P. Patrick,
chief executive officer of Walter Energy. "The plant's closure will allow
us to redeploy some of our human resources to a core business."

    The Company expects to record a charge of approximately $5.5 to $6.0
million in the fourth quarter 2009 related to the closure.

    About Walter Energy

    Walter Energy is a leading U.S. producer and exporter of premium coking
coal for the global steel industry and also produces steam coal and
industrial coal, metallurgical coke and coal bed methane gas. The Company
has revenues of approximately $1.2 billion and employs approximately
2,150 people. For more information about Walter Energy, please visit the

&lt;p&gt;Collectie deze maand in de winkels
HERZOGENAURACH, Duitsland--(Business Wire)--
adidas en Disney hebben vandaag een geheel nieuwe productlijn aangekondigd voor
baby`s en kinderen, die een combinatie is van adidas Kids topproducten met de
klassieke Disneyfiguren Mickey Mouse en vrienden Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Donald
Duck en Daisy Duck. De sportieve en modieuze collectie, bestaande uit schoenen,
kleding en accessoires, zal wereldwijd verkrijgbaar zijn in adidas Sport
Performance Stores en bij sportwinkels. 

Met een vleugje Disney-magie is de debuutcollectie in de lijn voorzien van de
voor adidaskleding traditionele silhouetten met zak-details en rubberen Mickey
Mouse badges op T-shirts en broeken, terwijl jacks met capuchon iets extra`s
krijgen door de bekende ritsen in Mickey Mouse vorm. Jongens T-shirts en shirts
zijn voorzien van een animatie-afbeelding van Mickey Mouse, terwijl Minnie Mouse
de belangrijkste figuur is op de meisjeskleding, met haar lady-like afbeelding
op T-shirts en petjes. Vrouwelijke accessoires completeren de outfits:
bijpassende roltassen voor de kleding en schoenen, petjes met allerlei plaatjes
van Mickey Mouse of Minnie Mouse en gezellige katoenen sokken. (Bekijk een video
over de productlijn op Disney Consumer Products` YouTube-kanaal Disney Living
(www.YouTube.com/DisneyLiving) of rechtsreeks op
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDVg5gv2MIo.) 

Naast het klassieke adidas 3-strepen ontwerp hebben verscheidene hoogtepunten in
de eerste collectie opvallende details zoals figuren met een glanzende
metallic-parel afwerking overal op de kleding en speciale zilver-applicaties op
de schoenveters om het grillige gevoel extra te benadrukken. De hoogtepunten op
schoenengebied zijn de Disney StreetRun trainingsschoenen in diva-roze en
metallic zilver voor meisjes en in groen en wit voor jongens.
3D-ontwerpelementen met Mickey Mouse en Minnie Mouse maken deze schoenen
werkelijk opvallend, maar voor kinderen is het mooiste eraan de kleurrijke
schoenzool die een adidas-voetafdruk met een Disney-thema achterlaat. 

"Ik ben opgegroeid met Mickey en Minnie en mijn belangrijkste doel was het
ontwerpen van een opvallende collectie voor jongens en meisjes die cool en
grappig tegelijk zou zijn en deze klassieke Disney-figuren tot leven zou
brengen," aldus adidas-ontwerper Rana Babacan. Pete Brady, afdelingsmanager,
adidas Kids, vertelt verder: "Deze samenwerking is zo`n geweldige kans voor twee
wereldmerken om hun ervaring te combineren en een totaal nieuw idee te
realiseren dat kindersport en de liefde voor alles wat Disney is combineert." 

"Mickey Mouse blijft prominent aanwezig in veel modetrends en we zijn erg blij
met de manier waarop we Mickey en zijn vriendjes in dit assortiment hebben
kunnen integreren," voegt Pamela Lifford, executive vice president, global
fashion &amp; home, Disney Consumer Products hieraan toe. "Deze nieuwe lijn
kindermode zal leuk zijn voor kinderen en hun modebewuste ouders zullen hun
kinderen er graag in zien." 

De voorjaar-/zomercollectie 2010 komt in december 2009/januari 2010 in de
winkels, zoals adidas Sport Performance Stores en selecte sportwinkels. De
prijzen voor het productassortiment voor de allerkleinsten lopen van &#8364;10 voor de
Disney-accessoires voor jongens en meisjes, &#8364;15 voor T-shirts tot &#8364;38 voor
volledige outfits en &#8364;35 voor de Disney Bokajone trainer en de StreetRun
trainer. De prijzen voor de producten voor kinderen beginnen bij &#8364;18 voor
T-shirts. De accessoires kosten tussen de &#8364;12 en de &#8364;42 voor de roltas. De
prijzen voor schoenen voor kinderen liggen tussen de &#8364;50 en de &#8364;55. 

In de volgende op Disney ge&#239;nspireerde collectie van adidas wordt een rol
gespeeld door figuren uit Disney&#8226;Pixar`s Toy Story en de introductie ervan valt
samen met die van Disney&#8226;Pixar`s Toy Story 3 in bioscopen wereldwijd waarnaar
erg wordt uitgekeken.

&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday, the same day it issued six updates that patched 12 bugs , Microsoft released a security advisory that outlined the unusual move, which blocks the Indeo codec -- software that compresses and decompresses video data -- from being used by either Internet Explorer (IE) or Windows Media Player. The update also prevents other applications that access the Internet from loading the codec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear exactly how many unpatched vulnerabilities the Indeo codec contains, but at least two security companies -- VeriSign iDefense and Fortinet -- issued their own Indeo bug alerts Tuesday. The vulnerability uncovered by iDefense was reported to Microsoft more than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update targets only the oldest editions of Microsoft's operating system: Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 already bar the Indeo codec from loading. Intel introduced the codec in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By blocking the codec from being used in IE and Windows Media Player, said Microsoft, it's protecting users against the known attack vectors, would rely on duping people into visiting a malicious site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unusual for Microsoft to skip patching known vulnerabilities and instead disable -- "deprecate" in programming terminology -- bits of code. "This is a rare occurrence, as it is usually challenging to remove functionally from products that customers are currently using without affecting existing applications," a Microsoft spokesman acknowledged via e-mail Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patching the codec wouldn't make much sense, said Richie Lai, director of vulnerability research at security company Qualys. "Microsoft already made these changes for Vista and Windows 7, and Indeo is rarely used anymore," Laid said. "I see this more of an attack surface reduction move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft saw it that way, too. "In this case, we created defense-in-depth changes that reduce the attack surface and removed the functionality of this codec rather than addressing individual vulnerabilities because it provided more comprehensive protection for an older, less used codec," said the company's spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On-disk applications, such as games that still rely on the Indeo codec, will function normally, Microsoft added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time that Microsoft has declined to patch valid vulnerabilities. Last September, Microsoft announced that fixing a flaw in Windows 2000 Server SP4's implementation of TCP/IP was not feasible because that would "require re-architecting a very significant amount of the Windows 2000 SP4 operating system," and doing so meant "that there would be no assurance that applications designed to run on Windows 2000 SP4 would continue to operate on the updated system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe this is a new trend," said Jason Miller, the security and data team manager of patch management vendor Shavlik Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this approach should provide more security for customers than addressing single instances of vulnerabilities," the Microsoft spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The codec-blocking update has been pushed to in Windows 2000, XP and Server 2003 users via Windows Update's automatic update mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Houston-based former U.S. Astronaut Dr. Bernard A. Harris, Jr. will give almost
10,000 Houston-area students a first-hand experience with the wonders of
science, technology, engineering and math during a high-tech, high-energy
performance at the Toyota Center on Monday, Dec. 14. The event, the final stop
of the 2009 "Dream Tour, presented by ExxonMobil," will feature appearances from
local athletes, ExxonMobil engineers, and upbeat performances from local artists
all focused on encouraging students to pursue careers in math and science. 

Students from the Alief, Aldine, Fort Bend, Houston and North Forest school
districts will join Dr. Harris for the two-hour program. The tour, which has
visited nine other U.S. cities in 2009, is designed to encourage middle school
students to realize their potential and strive to acquire strong math and
science skills. 

"When I was growing up, I dreamed of traveling in space. Education enabled my
dream and now I would like to encourage students to follow their dreams by
pursuing careers in math and science," Dr. Harris said. "America`s students have
incredible opportunities. The Dream Tour is one way to open their eyes to the
limitless possibilities they have, as long as math and science education are
part of the equation. This stop of the tour will be the culmination of years of
hard work and it is a tremendous way to give back to the Houston area and invest
in our future." 

From humble beginnings in Houston to making history as the first African
American to walk in space in February of 1995, Dr. Harris is a living example of
achieving high aspirations. His story provides a powerful backdrop to bring his
message to students in cities across America. In 2008, the inaugural year of The
Dream Tour, Dr. Harris encouraged more than 8,500 middle school students in
Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Oklahoma City, San
Antonio, St. Louis and Washington, DC. In its second year, The Dream Tour has
been to Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Minneapolis/St. Paul,
Miami, Mobile, Oakland and Seattle as Dr. Harris continues to motivate and
inspire students to pursue math and science. 

"ExxonMobil is focused on the need to attract more of America`s students to
pursue careers in math and science," said Gerald McElvy, president of the
ExxonMobil Foundation. "This starts with taking higher level math and science
courses in middle school and high school. The classes they choose today can make
or break their options for the future, and `The Dream Tour, presented by
ExxonMobil,` is one way to highlight those career possibilities."

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Brazilian Merchant Voucher Receivables
Ltd. (Visanet) series 2003-1 and series 2003-2 at 'A-'. 

The Outlook on both ratings is Stable. 

Collections for the Visanet program have been relatively stable and coverage
levels have remained high, 10.57 times (x) larger than the required quarterly
debt-service. 

The affirmation is further supported by the ratings of Banco Bradesco and Banco
do Brasil, which Fitch affirmed in June 2009 and November 2009, respectively.
These rating actions reflect the banks' strong performance, benefited strongly
from the flight to quality in the local market during the global crisis. 

In June 2009, Visanet's shareholders, including Banco Bradesco and Banco do
Brasil, sold 559.81 million shares. Before the IPO, Bradesco held a 39 percent
stake in Visanet; Banco do Brasil a 31 percent interest; and Santander a 14
percent interest. After the IPO, the three banks still control a majority of
Visanet's shares. Banco Bradesco now has a 26 percent stake, while Banco do
Brasil has a 23.54 percent interest. 

Future flow transaction ratings are also linked to the sovereign environment. In
May of 2009, Fitch affirmed the sovereign ratings of Brazil at 'BBB-'. These
ratings reflect the country's maintenance of a credible policy framework during
the current global crisis, further strengthening the external balance sheet, and
the resumption of a higher growth trajectory. 

These future flow rating actions reflect the application of Fitch's current
criteria which is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' and specifically include
the following reports: 

'Future Flow Securitization Rating Criteria' (Oct. 26, 2007). 

'Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria' (Sept. 30, 2009).

DOWNERS GROVE, Ill.--(Business Wire)--
Sara Lee Corp. (NYSE: SLE) announced today it has received a binding offer from
The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) to acquire Sara Lee`s air care business
for &#8364;320 million. Where permissible, Sara Lee has agreed to accept the binding
offer upon satisfaction of certain conditions. In fiscal 2009, this business
generated annual sales of approximately &#8364;260 million ($355 million based on
fiscal 2009 exchange rates) and accounted for approximately 11 percent of the
adjusted operating segment income1 for the International Household and Body Care
business. 

The proposed transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions and
regulatory clearances, is anticipated to close during fiscal year 2010. Sara Lee
will consult with relevant works councils during the process. 

"The proposed sale of our air care business is the next step in our plan to
focus on our core food and beverage businesses, where we have a strong
competitive position and can generate superior shareholder returns," said Brenda
C. Barnes, chairman and chief executive officer, Sara Lee Corp. "Receiving this
offer from leading consumer goods companyP validates the tremendous trends and
potential of the Ambi Pur brand, an innovative air care leader." 

Sara Lee is executing a divestiture plan for its International Household and
Body Care business which is designed to maximize value and minimize business
disruption. The company continues to receive strong interest in the remainder of
its household business, which includes shoe care, insecticides and certain
non-European cleaning brands. 

In total, this transaction and the previously announced binding offer from
Unileverfor Sara Lee`s global body care and European detergents businesses are
expected to generate sales proceeds of approximately &#8364;1.6 billion ($2.36
billion, based on recent exchange rates) and represent approximately 66 percent
of the adjusted operating segment income1 of the International Household and
Body Care business. 

"This acquisition brings to P the strong Ambi Pur brand equity and
complementary geographic presence, particularly in Europe and Asia," said David
Taylor, P Group President for Global Home Care. "Ambi Pur also brings
high-performance products and new technologies to our current P Air Care
portfolio, including car air fresheners, battery-powered air fresheners, toilet
rim blocks and various non-energized air fresheners." 

In September, the company announced that its board of directors authorized a
$1.0 billion share repurchase program. This was in addition to the 13.5 million
share authorization (approximately $164.6 million based on the recent market
price) remaining under the prior share repurchase program. The company
reiterated that its board intended to maintain the current quarterly dividend of
$.11 for fiscal 2010, regardless of the timing of dispositions. Sara Lee intends
to maintain a credit profile consistent with a strong investment grade credit
rating. 

Sara Lee`s International Household and Body Care business generated
approximately &#8364;1.5 billion ($2.0 billion) in sales in fiscal 2009. The remainder
of its household business, which is not included in this or the
previously-announced binding offer from Unilever, includes the Kiwi shoe care,
Ridsect insecticides and White King bleach brands.

that was filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC"). A preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the offering was filed
with the SEC on December 8, 2009, and a final prospectus supplement will be

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft and SAP will voice their concerns at a European Union hearing on Friday over Oracle's plan to buy Sun Microsystems, adding to regulators' skepticism over the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has objected to Oracle's $7 billion bid for Sun, saying the purchase may limit competition in the database market. The EU competition watchdog has until January 27 to decide on the deal, which its U.S. counterpart has cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software giant Microsoft's representatives and lawyers declined to comment before the two-day hearing, which started on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German software company SAP, whose chief rival is Oracle, has told the Commission Oracle's acquisition of Sun's MySQL database could hurt competition in the market by eliminating one of the top players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle, the world's biggest database software maker, said its customers told Commission officials and European national regulators at the hearing on Thursday that the takeover was not anti-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle lawyer Thomas Vinje told reporters the Commission had misinterpreted the content of its file and that respondents to the Commission's market test and survey had overwhelmingly supported the company's bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monty Widenius, creator of MySQL, will back the Commission's case on Friday while Swedish telecoms network equipment maker Ericsson will argue for Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antitrust lawyers said enlisting major companies to express support at a hearing could sway doubtful regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee, editing by Dale Hudson)&lt;/p&gt;

Pfizer Receives European Authorization For Prevenar 13* For The Prevention Of Pneumococcal Disease In Infants And Young Children</headline><body>

Prevenar 13 to provide the broadest coverage of any pneumococcal conjugate
vaccine for infants and young children
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


The European Commission has granted Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) a European marketing
authorization for its pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevenar 13* (Pneumococcal
Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]). Prevenar 13 is
indicated for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease,
pneumonia, and acute otitis media caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae
serotypes in infants and children from 6 weeks to 5 years of age. Invasive
pneumococcal disease includes sepsis, meningitis, bacteremia, bacteremic
pneumonia, and empyema. 

Prevenar 13, built on the scientific foundation of Prevenar* (Pneumococcal
Saccharide Conjugated Vaccine, Adsorbed), provides the broadest serotype
coverage of any pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. It includes the seven serotypes
(4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) in Prevenar - the standard in pneumococcal
disease prevention in infants and young children - plus six additional serotypes
(1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A), which together represent the most prevalent invasive
disease-causing strains in young children worldwide. Prevenar 13 is the only
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to include serotypes 3, 6A, and 19A. Both
Prevenar and Prevenar 13 use CRM - a carrier protein which has been used in
various approved pediatric conjugate vaccines for more than 20 years. Available
in Europe since 2001, Prevenar is currently available in more than 100 countries
and more than 300 million doses have been distributed worldwide. 

"Although the incidence of pneumococcal disease has been significantly reduced
in European countries and elsewhere where Prevenar is routinely used,
pneumococcal disease remains a serious threat to children in Europe as strains
such as serotypes 19A and 6A are increasing in prevalence and frequently
resistant to antibiotics," says Emilio Emini, Ph.D., chief scientific officer,
Vaccine Research, Pfizer Inc. "By providing the broadest serotype coverage of
any pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevenar 13 is poised to help reduce the
serious public health risk and economic burden associated with pneumococcal
disease." 

The European Commission`s authorization of Prevenar 13 was based on a clinical
trial program of 13 core Phase III studies involving more than 7,000 children.
Data from the Phase III trials support the safety and efficacy of Prevenar 13
for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in infants and young children.
Clinical trial data indicate Prevenar 13 has a safety profile similar to that of
Prevenar, and can be administered with all routine pediatric vaccines studied. 

In the European marketing authorization, the schedule recommended for Prevenar
13 consists of four doses, three primary doses, followed by a booster dose
between 11 and 15 months of age. Alternatively, when Prevenar 13 is given as
part of a routine infant immunization program, Prevenar 13 may be administered
as a three dose series, two primary doses followed by a booster dose. Infants
and children who have begun immunization with Prevenar may switch to Prevenar 13
at any point in their dosing schedule. It is also recommended that children up
to 5 years of age who have completed vaccination with Prevenar should be offered
coverage against the six additional serotypes included in Prevenar 13. The
number of doses of Prevenar 13 required to complete immunization should follow
official recommendations in each member state. It is recommended that infants
who receive a first dose of Prevenar 13 complete the vaccination course with
Prevenar 13. 

"Prevenar 13, with serotype coverage unmatched by any other pneumococcal
conjugate vaccine, is an excellent example of Pfizer`s innovative vaccine
technology at work," says Geno Germano, president and general manager, Specialty
Care Business Unit, Pfizer Inc. "We are committed to vaccines as a key part of
our growth strategy, which is an expression of our mission to improve health and
well-being at every stage of life." 

To date, Prevenar 13 has been approved for use in infants and young children in
3 countries. On November 18, 2009, the United States Food and Drug
Administration`s (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory
Committee voted 10 to 1 that the data presented from the Biologic License
Application (BLA) for Prevnar 13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine
[Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]), as the vaccine is known in the United States,
support its safety and efficacy for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal
disease in infants and young children. The FDA will consider the Advisory
Committee`s votes and discussion in its review of the Prevnar 13 BLA, which has
an action date of December 30, 2009. Other pediatric regulatory filings for
Prevnar 13 are in advanced stages of review in various countries spanning six
continents. Prevenar 13 is also being studied in global Phase III clinical
trials in adults, with regulatory submissions expected in 2010. 

Pneumococcal Disease

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) 2002 estimate, pneumococcal
disease is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable death worldwide in children
younger than 5 years. Pneumococcal disease is complex and describes a group of
illnesses, all caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pneumococcal
disease affects both children and adults, and includes invasive infections such
as bacteremia/sepsis and meningitis, as well as pneumonia and acute otitis
media. 

Important Safety Information for Prevenar 13

The use of Prevenar 13 should be determined on the basis of official
recommendations taking into consideration the impact of invasive disease in
different age groups as well as the variability of serotype epidemiology in
different geographical areas. 

In clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were
injection-site reactions, fever, irritability, decreased appetite, and increased
and/or decreased sleep. 

Risks are associated with all vaccines, including Prevenar 13. Hypersensitivity
to any component, including diphtheria toxoid, is a contraindication to its use.
As with other vaccines, the administration of Prevenar 13 should be postponed in
subjects suffering from acute, severe febrile illness. However, the presence of
a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result in the deferral of
vaccination. Prevenar 13 does not provide 100% protection against vaccine
serotypes or protect against non-vaccine serotypes. 

Indication for Prevenar

Prevenar is indicated for active immunization of infants and children from 6
weeks through 9 years of age against invasive disease, pneumonia, and otitis
media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and
23F. 

Important Safety Information for Prevenar

In clinical studies (n=18,168), the most frequently reported adverse events
included injection-site reactions, fever (&#8805;38&#186;C/100.4&#186;F), irritability,
drowsiness, restless sleep, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash. 

Risks are associated with all vaccines, including Prevenar. Hypersensitivity to
any vaccine component, including diphtheria toxoid, is a contraindication to its
use. Prevenar does not provide 100% protection against vaccine serotypes or
protect against nonvaccine serotypes. The decision to administer Prevenar*
should be based on its efficacy in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease. 

The frequency of pneumococcal serotypes and serogroups can vary from country to
country, which could influence the effectiveness of the vaccine in any given
country.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Dec 11 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) and SAP
(SAPG.DE) will voice their concerns at a European Union hearing
on Friday over Oracle's ORCL.O plan to buy Sun Microsystems
JAVA.O, adding to regulators' scepticism over the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The European Commission has objected to Oracle's $7 billion
bid for Sun, saying the purchase may limit competition in the
database market. The EU competition watchdog has until Jan. 27
to decide on the deal, which its U.S. counterpart has cleared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Software giant Microsoft's representatives and lawyers
declined to comment before the two-day hearing, which started on
Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; German software company SAP, whose chief rival is Oracle,
has told the Commission Oracle's acquisition of Sun's MySQL
database could hurt competition in the market by eliminating one
of the top players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oracle, the world's biggest database software maker, said
its customers told Commission officials and European national
regulators at the hearing on Thursday that the takeover was not
anti-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oracle lawyer Thomas Vinje told reporters the Commission had
misinterpreted the content of its file and that respondents to
the Commission's market test and survey had overwhelmingly
supported the company's bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monty Widenius, creator of MySQL, will back the Commission's
case on Friday while Swedish telecoms network equipment maker
Ericsson (ERICb.ST) will argue for Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Antitrust lawyers said enlisting major companies to express
support at a hearing could sway doubtful regulators.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
In connection with the New York Times` recent coverage of hormone therapy1,
Pfizer Inc. today released important facts and context to respond to the
newspaper`s account. Pfizer believes the coverage is based on a misleading and
selective reading of both the science and history of hormone therapy (HT)
medicines. 

Premarin (conjugated estrogens tablets USP) and Prempro (conjugated
estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets), which are approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), have brought relief to tens of millions of women
for decades. The FDA has stated that HT has a well-established safety profile
and is among the most studied classes of medicines. In addition, the FDA states
that HT "is the most effective FDA approved medicine for relief of hot flashes,
night sweats or vaginal dryness." 

A full, fair and accurate report on HT would show: 

1.FDA-approved hormone therapy is an important treatment option for certain
post-menopausal women.

First and most importantly, doctors have been prescribing HT medicines for the
treatment of menopausal symptoms (e.g., hot flashes and night sweats), as well
as for the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis, for decades. As FDA
itself wrote in a news release following the Women`s Health Initiative study
(WHI): "Because there are few alternatives for the relief of severe vasomotor
symptoms and severe symptoms of vulvar vaginal atrophy, estrogens and estrogens
with progestins have an important role in women's health." The FDA has regularly
and thoroughly reviewed the benefits and risks of these medicines, and has
consistently determined that the benefits outweigh the risks for the appropriate
woman. 

2.Wyeth has acted responsibly by studying its hormone therapy medicines closely,
including the risk of breast cancer, for decades.

HT medicines are among the most thoroughly studied drugs. Wyeth conducted or
supported more than 180 studies covering 180,000 women that examined the risks
and benefits of hormone therapy (including the WHI), 19 of which expressly
examined hormone therapy and breast cancer risk. The first such study was
published in 1959, and these studies were published in peer-reviewed medical
journals and were consistent with the then-current medical science. 

The most definitive study on hormone therapy and breast cancer, the WHI,
reaffirmed the increased relative risk of breast cancer that was already in the
labeling for Premarin and Prempro. 

3.The labels for Premarin and Prempro, which are the official, FDA-approved
description of their benefits and risks relied upon by doctors, are and have
been accurate and science-based, and have warned of the risk of breast cancer
for many years.

Guidance to use Premarin and Prempro at the lowest dose and for the shortest
duration needed to meet treatment goals has been included in the labels of these
medicines for decades. 

Breast cancer risks were discussed at least nine times in the 1995 launch label
for Prempro, and have been included in the Premarin label for decades. The label
and the Physicians` Desk Reference in which it is included carry the most
authoritative information on a medicine`s risks and benefits. 

Moreover, commenting on the Prempro labeling before the WHI, Janet Woodcock,
then-director of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told the NIH on
October 24, 2002: "What was known at the time about benefits and risks was
discussed within that label." 

After the WHI study, Wyeth proactively updated its label and worked with the FDA
to develop labeling that reflected the medical community's new understanding of
risks associated with hormone therapy. The FDA wrote in a January 8, 2003, press
release: "The revisions for the Premarin, Prempro, and Premphase labeling build
on revisions to the labeling that Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (the products'
manufacturer) made in August 2002, shortly after the release of the findings
from WHI. Since August, FDA has carefully reviewed the data from the WHI study
and has worked with Wyeth to develop the new labeling approved today for these
products." 

Similarly, in response to numerous studies that Wyeth and others conducted that
reported increased risks of endometrial carcinoma associated with Premarin in
the 1970s, the company included a prominent warning of those risks in the
Premarin label seven months before the FDA issued class labeling. 

About Premarin and Prempro

Both Premarin (conjugated estrogens tablets USP), approved by the FDA in 1942,
and Prempro (conjugated estrogens/medroxy-progesterone acetate tablets USP),
approved by the FDA in 1994, treat moderate to severe symptoms of menopause and
help reduce the chances of osteoporosis.

&lt;p&gt;Results presented at CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS)
SAN ANTONIO--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced results from studies evaluating
neratinib (HKI-272), an investigational, orally administered, pan-ErbB
inhibitor, in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2, also
known as ErbB2) positive breast cancer at the 2009 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast
Cancer Symposium (SABCS). Neratinib is now part of Pfizer`s expanded oncology
portfolio, following the recent acquisition of Wyeth. 

"Data gathered from ongoing clinical trials of neratinib, both as a monotherapy
and in combination, continue to support its evaluation in HER2 positive
metastatic breast cancer," said Maria Koehler MD, PhD, Vice President, Women`s
Cancers Strategy for Pfizer Oncology. "We look forward to studying neratinib
further in an effort to help seek to provide HER2 targeted therapies for
patients battling this aggressive disease." 

Breast cancer of the HER2 positive type accounts for 20 to 30 percent of all
breast cancers and is identified by the overexpression of the HER2 protein in
tumor tissue. HER2 positive breast cancer is more aggressive than other breast
cancers and has an increased likelihood of metastasizing. 

Neratinib Shows Activity in Phase 1/2 Study

This ongoing, Phase 1/2, open-label, two-part study evaluates the safety and
efficacy of neratinib in combination with weekly paclitaxel in patients with
solid tumors and HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (Poster #5081). Part 1
of the study showed that a standard oral dose of 240 mg of neratinib daily can
be given with 80 mg/m2 of paclitaxel weekly to patients with solid tumors. In
part 2, only patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (newly
diagnosed or following up to three recurrences) received therapy to evaluate the
overall response rate (ORR) of this combination of neratinib and paclitaxel. 

As of October 19, 2009, an ORR (including both complete and partial responses)
of 69 percent (n=68) was observed, from a total of 99 patients with HER2
positive breast cancer who were evaluable for efficacy analysis in part 2 of
this ongoing study. In the first-line metastatic setting of 33 patients, the ORR
was 70 percent (n=23). Overall response rates observed in patients with
hormone-receptor positive tumors, prior exposure to endocrine therapy, and
previous taxane therapy, were 84 percent (n=46), 80 percent (n=31) and 76
percent (n=47), respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for all
patients with HER2 positive breast cancer was estimated at 52.1 weeks (95
percent C.I. 47.7-NE). 

In part 2 of the study, preliminary clinical data indicate the combination of
neratinib 240 mg and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 was tolerable, with a similar toxicity
profile to each drug given as monotherapy. The most common treatment-emergent
adverse events occurring in &#8805;20 percent of patients included diarrhea,
neutropenia, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, leucopenia, infection (any site),
anemia, rash, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia and pyrexia. Diarrhea of any
grade was the most common adverse event (in 91 percent of patients), and
presented as a grade 3/4 adverse event in 28 percent of patients. Diarrhea was
generally observed early (median onset, three days after the first dose of
neratinib; median duration, 30 days). Fifteen and 37 patients required dose
reductions of neratinib and paclitaxel, respectively, because of adverse events,
and a total of 49 patients discontinued the study. Most study discontinuations
(39 patients) were secondary to disease progression. Three patients discontinued
therapy due to adverse events (renal failure, left ventricular ejection fraction
reduction, and mouth ulceration). 

Phase 2 Safety Results of Neratinib Monotherapy in Patients with HER2 Positive
Breast Cancer

A Phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral neratinib (240 mg
daily) as a monotherapy in patients with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer
assigned to two cohorts: those with prior trastuzumab treatment (cohort 1) and
those with no prior trastuzumab treatment (cohort 2)(Poster #5096). The new
analysis presented at SABCS focused on the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular
safety profiles of neratinib seen in this study. 

Diarrhea that developed in patients treated with single agent neratinib had
early onset (median time to onset three days), but its frequency and severity
decreased with time on neratinib. Neratinib-related diarrhea was managed with
standard supportive therapy and dose interruptions and/or reductions.
Anti-diarrheal medications for supportive therapy were used by 85 percent of
patients in the study. Dose reductions to manage diarrhea were applied in 30
percent of patients in cohort 1 and in 7 percent of patients in cohort 2. One
patient with prior trastuzumab therapy discontinued treatment as a result of
diarrhea. 

There was no statistically significant difference in PFS for patients with a
maximum grade 3/4 diarrhea event versus patients with no diarrhea or a maximum
grade 1/2 diarrhea event. 

Vomiting, any grade, occurred in 29 percent of patients and was managed with the
use of anti-emetic medications and dose modifications. 

In this study, neratinib was not associated with clinically significant
cardiotoxicity; no patients had congestive heart failure. 

Additional Neratinib Data Presentations

Two additional neratinib studies were presented at SABCS 2009. These studies
include:

* Safety of Neratinib (HKI-272) in Combination with Capecitabine in Patients
with Solid Tumors: A Phase 1/2 Study (Poster #5108) 
* Safety and Efficacy of Neratinib (HKI-272) in Combination with Vinorelbine in
ErbB2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer (Poster #5095)

About Neratinib

Neratinib is an investigational, orally administered, irreversible inhibitor of
the ErbB1 (EGFR), ErbB2 (HER2) and ErbB4 (HER4) kinases. Neratinib permanently
inactivates the ErbB kinases. Inhibited HER2 activities include downstream
signal transduction events and cell cycle regulatory pathways, such as the cell
division cycle, ultimately resulting in decreased cell proliferation. 

ErbB2 belongs to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which has been
implicated in a variety of human cancers, including cancers of the breast. HER2
positive breast cancer is identified by the overexpression of human epidermal
growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) protein in tumor tissue and results in an
increased rate of cell proliferation.

&lt;p&gt;COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The Coca-Cola Company supports a global climate deal and aims to reduce its environmental footprint by focusing on water use, refrigeration and packaging, its chief executive said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * CEO Muhtar Kent says Coke wants a climate framework deal * Says plant material bottle could replace all other bottles  By John Acher COPENHAGEN, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Coca-Cola Company (KO.N) supports a global climate deal and aims to reduce its environmental footprint by focusing on water use, refrigeration and packaging, its chief executive said on Saturday. CEO Muhtar Kent told Reuters the world's biggest soft drinks maker aims to spread a plastic bottle made partly from plant material throughout its business, potentially replacing all other bottles in its system, to help cut carbon emissions. We want to join in the call to have a global agreement reached on climate protection, Kent said in an interview during 190-nation U.N. climate talks in the Danish capital. He said it was too early to say how a deal at the Dec. 7-18 Copenhagen conference would affect the beverage industry. But I would hope and expect to at least have a framework agreed amongst nations, amongst the political leaders of the world here, he said, adding that that should lead to the signing of a treaty fairly quickly. Without an agreement, there will not be a framework and a road map as to how we are going to get climate protection, said Kent, one of many international industry chiefs in Copenhagen for the conference. Earlier this month, Coca-Cola announced an initiative with Greenpeace to replace vending machines and coolers with new refrigeration equipment free from hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) -- greenhouse gases with a high warming effect -- by 2015. PLANT BOTTLE VISIONS In May, Coca-Cola introduced a plastic recyclable bottle up to 30 percent of which is made of waste from sugar production, which it has dubbed the bottle of the future. Kent said Coke's intention is to get that (percentage) higher. This has the beginnings for us of decoupling of our packaging from fossil fuels, Kent said. Next year we should be selling for the full year more than a couple of billion bottles (of this material) around the world, and our intention is to ratchet up the supply as much as we can, he said. Slightly more than half of all Coke goes into non-refillable plastic bottles, while 13 percent goes into aluminium cans, 12 percent into glass refillable bottles, 12 percent into fountain distributors, and the rest into refillable plastic bottles or other types of packaging, company material showed. Kent said the adoption of the new bottle is currently limited by supply of the material, but that would change. Eventually, this will replace all our bottles, he said, because sugar cane is a very big product around the world, and our intention is to ratchet this up as fast as we can. Coca-Cola is also looking at other plant materials, such as wood chips and corn stover, that could be used to make bottles, another company executive said.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Dec 15 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the
world's largest drugmaker, and Osaka-based Takeda
Pharmaceutical Co Ltd 4502.T8 said on Tuesday they have
signed an agreement to jointly promote and sell Takeda's
diabetes drug in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The agreement allows Takeda, Japan's biggest drugmaker, to
increase the number of medical representatives in the sales and
marketing of its Actos product, expanding its reach by using
the territory coverage of Pfizer in China, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Takeda earns about half its revenues overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actos, Takeda's best-known drug, is a prescription
medication used along with diet and exercise to improve blood
sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. It has been sold
in China since 2004 by Tianjin Takeda Pharmaceuticals, a joint
venture between Takeda Pharmaceutical and Chinese partner
Tianjin Lisheng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the Pfizer-Takeda agreement, Pfizer's Chinese
affiliate will receive a fixed ratio of Actos net sales. No
further financial details were given in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China, currently the world's fifth-largest pharmaceutical
market, is expected to grow to be the third-largest market by
2011. It is also is expected to have more than 50 million
diabetics by 2025, according to the International Diabetes
Federation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Pfizer said it planned to expand its research
and development operations in central and western China as it
strengthens its biomedical infrastructure throughout the
country. [ID:nHKG353994]

&lt;p&gt;Plurk, a micro-blogging service popular in parts of Asia, claimed today that its site design and underlying code were copied by a recently debuted service from Microsoft Corp.'s China division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSN Juku made its beta debut in China earlier this month as a way for users to post 140-character messages on a scrolling timeline interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, MSN Juku is a "local innovation developed by MSN China...based on Windows Live Messenger networks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, local Chinese media were already commenting on the similarities in the look-and-feel between MSN Juku and Plurk, with one calling it a "bandit" version (Chinese slang for a knock-off).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That accusation was brought out into the open today by Plurk. In a blog post, the company said that while "imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but blatant theft of code, design, and UI elements is just not cool, especially when the infringing party is the biggest software company in the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plurk showed purported screenshots of MSN China's new service, which it called "a little overly inspired" by Plurk's 18-month-old service. It also showed snippets of JavaScript and CSS code from both services, and claimed that 80% of the codebase "appears to be stolen directly from Plurk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plurk said the two services are so similar that some bloggers speculated that Microsoft's service might have been based on a partnership with Plurk, a rumor it quickly dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were never contacted by any party at M$ to collaborate on such a venture nor did we give any prior written or verbal permission to anyone on their side to take our code, take our CSS, and copy the essence and ethos of our service," wrote Plurk. "As a young startup, we're stunned, shocked, and unsure what to do next and need your support and suggestions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a separate interview with Plurk's co-founder published on Monday, the 9-employee company is scattered across the world, though incorporated in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plurk has largely failed to make a dent in the English-speaking Web, where Twitter dominates. It had 766,000 visitors last month, compared to 1.3 million for Friendfeed and 131 million for Twitter, according to statistics from Compete.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plurk is also banned in China, along with Twitter and some other social-networking services, by the government for political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Plurk reportedly tops the microblog market in Taiwan, ahead of Twitter. It is also popular in other Asian countries such as Indonesia and Singapore. One reason: Twitter, due to cost and time, only operates a fully localized service in Asia for Japanese users. Plurk, meanwhile, solicits help from volunteers in each country to help translate key commands and phrases, with the best chosen by a vote in that country. That allows Plurk to offer its service in 33 languages, including Chinese, Gaelic, Arabic and Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Lai covers Windows and Linux, desktop applications, databases and business intelligence for Computerworld .

bailout of $10 billion in June, announced last week that its
top 30 executives would forgo cash bonuses and receive them
entirely in restricted stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit seeks to recover "billions in compensation"
that Goldman has paid or plans to pay employees.

FWR) au prix de 1,00 CAD en actions Cliffs par action Freewest. 

Noront a annonc&#233; que 11,8 millions d`actions Freewest, repr&#233;sentant environ 4,5
% de la soci&#233;t&#233; sur une base enti&#232;rement dilu&#233;e, ont &#233;t&#233; apport&#233;es dans le cadre

Des actionnaires de Freewest d&#233;tenant au total 24,7 millions d`actions, soit
environ 10,3 % des actions ordinaires de Freewest en circulation, ont conclu des
conventions de vote avec Cliffs en faveur du plan d`arrangement. 

Comme annonc&#233; pr&#233;c&#233;demment, une r&#233;union sp&#233;ciale avec les actionnaires de
Freewest se tiendra le 15 janvier 2010, il leur sera alors demand&#233; de voter au

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) $30 billion takeover of XTO Energy Inc XTO.N is a major vote of confidence in natural gas and the latest sign that the world's top oil companies are looking to invest more in the cleaner-burning fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gas prices across the world have slumped in 2009, largely due to a surge in U.S. output from unconventional gas companies like XTO. But global demand for natural gas is expected to surge back more than 50 percent by 2030, making it the fastest-growing major energy source of the next few decades and promising fat profits for reserve holders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of a demand surge, the oil majors have started opening their wallets for expensive gas projects like gas liquefaction plants and pricey gas shale wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about the next 10 to 20 to 30 years of what we believe has now emerged as a very important part of the global resource portfolio," Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson said on a conference call with investors on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to be important to meeting energy supply, and that's the real value creation that we see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said last week it sees gas demand rising by an average of 1.8 percent a year over the next two decades, compared with 0.8 percent for oil, largely because power generation is set to grow faster than any other energy type to 40 percent of total primary energy demand by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeover gives Exxon a major position in so-called unconventional gas assets in North America, which include shale plays, where gas trapped in underground rock formations requires expensive and complex drilling techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment bankers in the energy industry said the deal could spur more investment by oil majors and national oil companies into these unconventional plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The capital needs for this industry, in particular the unconventional resources, we believe are in excess of $1 trillion. If you look at the independent oil sector there is not enough market capitalization to develop all these shale resources," said David Rockecharlie, co-head of energy investment banking at Jefferies, who advised XTO on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The capital markets clearly have provided a lot of capital, but these major oil companies are the right place financially for future development of these shale plays."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse analyst Jonathan Wolff said in a research note that possible sellers in the industry include Devon Energy (DVN.N), EOG Resources (EOG.N) and Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN.N) Investment bankers said bidders could include top oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), BP (BP.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and ENI (ENI.MI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO LONGER A SIDESHOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil companies used to flare off much of the gas they found lingering in oil fields around the world, often seeing it as a low-value sideshow to the black gold they craved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But tighter controls on wasteful burning of carbon-emitting fuels and the increasing appetite for natural gas as a fuel for generating electricity and heating has seen most oil companies sniffing around the globe for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, 40 percent of Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSa.L) daily production is natural gas, with France's Total (TOTF.PA) not far behind on 38 percent in 2008. Around 37 percent of BP's (BP.L)(BP.N) global production was gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shell is increasingly focusing on natural gas, the cleanest-burning fossil fuel. By 2012, natural gas will likely make up around half of our production," Shell Chief Executive Peter Voser said in Washington in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Increasing natural gas production and transportation by liquefying it and shipping the LNG to global markets means that more natural gas will be available to displace coal as the fuel for power plants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the top international oil companies have already started to make blockbuster investments in liquefaction plants in order to be able to move gas more easily around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rasgas 3 project in Qatar, being developed by Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum, required an investment of about $14 billion, according to the Rasgas website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodside Petroleum's (WPL.AX) Pluto LNG project in western Australia, expected to be making shipments in 2011, will cost about $11 billion. Shell's Qatargas 4 LNG project, planned for late 2010, is expected to cost about $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP estimates the 6,500 trillion cubic feet (tcf), or 1.2 trillion barrels of oil equivalent, of already proven gas reserves is enough to meet current demand levels for at least 60 years. Reserves of crude oil are widely expected to be exhausted in the latter half of this century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global hunt for gas from unexplored fields and within the world's vast coal deposits or sedimentary rocks could contribute another 4,000 tcf to gas resources over the next few years, taking the world total up to roughly 100 years of consumption at current rates, BP estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Lisa Shumaker, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Robbins Umeda LLP has commenced an investigation into possible breaches of
fiduciary duty and other violations of state law by members of the Board of
Directors of XTO Energy Inc. ("XTO") in connection with its decision to merge
with Exxon Mobile Corporation ("Exxon"). XTO and Exxon announced their agreement
to merge the companies on Monday, December 14, 2009. Under the terms of the
merger agreement, Exxon has agreed to exchange 0.7098 common shares for each
common share of XTO. This exchange ration is based on the closing share prices
of Exxon and XTO on December 11, 2009. XTO and Exxon expect to complete the
transaction in the second quarter of 2010. 

Robbins Umeda LLP's investigation concerns whether the consideration to be
received by XTO shareholders is fair and whether the directors and special
committee members have acted in the shareholders' best interests in connection
with the sale process. 

If you are a shareholder of XTO and would like more information about your
rights as a shareholder, please contact attorney Lauren Levi at 800-350-6003 or

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings anticipates that ExxonMobil Corporation's (NYSE: XOM) acquisition
of XTO Energy, Inc (NYSE: XTO) will not impact ExxonMobil's ratings. Under the
terms of the deal, ExxonMobil will exchange 0.7098 shares per XTO share. The
total transaction value is estimated at $41 billion and includes the expected
assumption of approximately $10.4 billion in XTO debt by ExxonMobil. Closing is
anticipated in the second quarter of 2010 and is subject to XTO shareholder
approval and regulatory review. 

The transaction is expected to significantly enhance ExxonMobil's unconventional
resource base and technical capabilities. ExxonMobil has sizable global
unconventional resources including large net acreage positions in North America
(Marcellus Shale, Haynesville, Piceance Basin, Horn River Basin), Europe
(Germany, Hungary, Poland) and South America (Argentina). XTO has strong
expertise in unconventional resources and is exposed to all major unconventional
resource basins in the U.S. 

Post closing, the combined entity is expected to have nearly 8 million net acres
of unconventional resources, 60% of which are located outside the U.S. XTO's
proven (p1) reserves at year-end 2008 were 2.31 billion boe (barrels of oil
equivalent), and its production was 476,000 barrels per day (bpd), of which
approximately 82% was natural gas. XTO also has a small amount of North Sea
production (less than 1% of total), as well as conventional onshore resources in
the U.S. ExxonMobil's ability to leverage XTO's capabilities in unconventional
resources across the combined entity's broader portfolio remains a key strategic
driver for the acquisition; therefore, retention of key XTO geological staff is
expected to be a critical factor to the success of the acquisition going
forward. 

On a pro forma basis at Sept. 30, 2009, the combined company would have had
$19.98 billion in debt, approximately double that of ExxonMobil on a standalone
basis ($9.6 billion). However, when measured against large cash reserves of
approximately $12.5 billion, the combined entity's pro forma net debt is low on
an absolute basis at just $7.34 billion. As calculated by Fitch, pro forma
debt/boe metrics have also increased but remain low on an absolute basis. At
Sept. 30, 2009 the combined entity would have had pro-forma debt/boe metrics as
follows: net debt of $0.51/boe p1 reserves; E debt of $1.05/boe of p1
reserves; and E debt of $1.57/boe of proven developed (PD) reserves
(calculations use year-end [YE] 2008 reserve data for both XOM and XTO and
assume 72% allocation of total debt to E for XOM and 100% allocation of debt
for XTO). Pro-forma free cash flow of the combined companies at Sept. 30, 2009
was $3.03 billion. Looking forward, Fitch anticipates that the company will
continue to be managed conservatively and will maintain high levels of financial
flexibility post-integration. 

Fitch's current ratings for Exxon Mobil Corporation (ExxonMobil) are as follows:


--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'AAA'; 

--Senior Unsecured Debt 'AAA'; 

--Commercial Paper 'F1+'; 

--Short Term IDR 'F1+'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

ExxonMobil's ratings reflect: 

--the company's unsurpassed depth, breadth, and quality of ExxonMobil's asset
portfolio and strong competitive position in all parts of the integrated oil
chain; 

--the company's disciplined returns-based investment focus and best-in-class
ability to generate returns on capital employed (ROCEs) with low levels of
financial leverage; 

--its very strong cash flow generation capability and historical record of
maintaining the highest levels of credit quality throughout previous cycles in
the oil industry; 

--the strategic value the rating confers on the company in negotiations with
National Oil Companies (NOCs) and other international partners when it comes to
long-term deals. 

Worldwide, ExxonMobil is the largest publicly traded integrated oil company in
terms of proven oil &amp; gas reserves, with some 21.2 billion boe proven reserves
(including equity affiliates). Total book assets at Sept. 30, 2009 were $229.3
billion. On the upstream side, the company has a large proven reserve base and
production of approximately 3.92 million boepd. Downstream, ExxonMobil is the
largest refiner in the world with approximately 6 million barrels per day of
refining capacity in 37 refineries. The marketing arm of the segment sells
gasoline and other fuels at stations worldwide. The company is also a worldwide
leader in the chemicals business, and a significant portion of its
petrochemicals and lubes capacity is integrated with existing refinery
facilities. Overall, the upstream component of ExxonMobil provides the bulk of
the company's earnings and cash flow. The company is active in more than 200
countries and territories and had a worldwide regular employee count of 79,900
at year-end 2008, excluding company-operated retail site employees (of which
there were 24,800).

&lt;p&gt; (Adds share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Dec 14 (Reuters) - XTO Energy Inc's XTO.N
Chairman Bob Simpson may receive around $70 million in
compensation after the company's deal with Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) closes, according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simpson would have been due an additional $120 million
bonus if the U.S. natural gas company he founded signed a deal
by June 1, or a $60 million bonus if the deal was signed by Dec
1. But those amounts reset to zero after Dec. 1, according to a
footnote in the company's April proxy filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) agreed to buy U.S. natural gas
company XTO on Monday in a stock deal valued at about $30
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding the bonus, Simpson is due roughly $50.7 million
in compensation under the change of control clause in his
employment agreement, according to the proxy statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The executive's employment pact was also modified in
September to say he will receive an amount in cash equal to
three times the value of about 150,000 XTO shares granted by
company in January if the company is acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The value of those shares will ultimately be based on the
closing price when the change in control occurs, according to
the regulatory filings. Based on the last closing price before
the deal was announced, those shares are worth more than $18
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials at XTO did not immediately respond to a question
about Simpson's compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; XTO shares closed up $6.37, 15.4 percent, at $47.86 on the
New York Stock Exchange on Monday.

The rise was within the 10 to 20 percent range some industry analysts had forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said its board of directors approved an 18 cent dividend for the first quarter of 2010, up from its current dividend of 16 cents on the company's common stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The board has determined that a measured dividend increase can be supported at this time," Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Kindler said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which completed its $67 billion purchase of Wyeth in mid-October, said the dividend boost reflected the company's confidence in its business and its ability to integrate Wyeth rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase will lift the yield on Pfizer's dividend to about the 4 percent range, from its current yield of about 3.6 percent -- making it more competitive with somewhat higher yields of rival U.S. drugmakers Merck  Co Inc (MRK.N), Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly, whose annual yield is about 5.5 percent, on Monday declared a first-quarter dividend of 49 cents per share, unchanged from the prior quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclay's analyst Tony Butler, in an interview last week, said his main concern is not Pfizer's dividend -- but how well the company capitalizes on the Wyeth purchase and whether it can really reverse its earlier poor drug-development and earnings record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're reorganizing the business to increase internal accountability and make people change habits of old. We don't know if that's going to bear fruit," Butler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares closed up 10 cents, or 0.55 percent, at $18.40 on the New York Stock Exchange, in line with gains for other large drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; editing by Andre Grenon and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Boosts dividend by 12.5 pct

 * Move had been largely expected by many investors

 * Shares rise modestly after dividend increase
 (Adds Lilly leaving first-quarter dividend unchanged)

 NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which
halved its industry-topping dividend in January to finance its
recent acquisition of Wyeth, boosted the dividend 12.5 percent
on Monday.

 Shares of the world's largest drugmaker rose modestly after
the dividend increase, which had been expected by many
investors. The rise was within the 10 to 20 percent range some
industry analysts had forecast.

 Pfizer said its board of directors approved an 18 cent
dividend for the first quarter of 2010, up from its current
dividend of 16 cents on the company's common stock.

 "The board has determined that a measured dividend increase
can be supported at this time," Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey
Kindler said in a release.

 Pfizer, which completed its $67 billion purchase of Wyeth
in mid-October, said the dividend boost reflected the company's
confidence in its business and its ability to integrate Wyeth
rapidly.

 The increase will lift the yield on Pfizer's dividend to
about the 4 percent range, from its current yield of about 3.6
percent -- making it more competitive with somewhat higher
yields of rival U.S. drugmakers Merck  Co Inc (MRK.N), Eli
Lilly and Co (LLY.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N).

 Lilly, whose annual yield is about 5.5 percent, on Monday
declared a first-quarter dividend of 49 cents per share,
unchanged from the prior quarter.

 Barclay's analyst Tony Butler, in an interview last week,
said his main concern is not Pfizer's dividend -- but how well
the company capitalizes on the Wyeth purchase and whether it
can really reverse its earlier poor drug-development and
earnings record.

 "They're reorganizing the business to increase internal
accountability and make people change habits of old. We don't
know if that's going to bear fruit," Butler said.

 Pfizer shares closed up 10 cents, or 0.55 percent, at
$18.40 on the New York Stock Exchange, in line with gains for
other large drugmakers.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Less than a month after beaching "Captain Nemo: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea," Disney's new studio chief has put the kibosh on "Wedding Banned," a romantic comedy to have starred Robin Williams and Diane Keaton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Banned" revolves around a long-divorced couple (Williams and Keaton) who kidnap their daughter (Anna Faris) on her wedding day to prevent her from making the same mistakes they did. The parents rekindle their relationship as they elude cops and the angry groom. The film's production company, Mandevile Films, is now free to shop it around town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision by Walt Disney Studios chairman Rich Ross to drop the project surprised some observers since "Banned" seemed to be in the mold of such other studio hit comedies as "The Proposal" and "Wild Hogs." But one factor in the decision was the poor showing of another Disney comedy starring Williams, "Old Dogs," which has grossed $35 million since its November 25 opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far Ross, who stepped into the top job in September, has put into development a remake of "The Black Hole," with "Tron Legacy" director Joseph Kosinksi at the helm, and has picked up the rights to the book series "Fallen."&lt;/p&gt;

AOL Spins Off from Time Warner

The marriage between Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX), a global leader in media and
entertainment businesses, and AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL), its web media unit, which
took place in 2000, ended on Dec 9, 2009, when the former announced the
completion of the spin-off of AOL. Time Warner investors will receive one AOL
share for 11 Time Warner shares they own, and any fractional AOL shares will be
compensated by a cash payment. 

The owner of Time magazine, Sports Illustrated and CNN, has structured the
spin-off to qualify as a tax-free dividend to Time Warner shareholders. After
seven months of preparation, AOL began trading independently on Dec 10, 2009
under the symbol `AOL`. AOL shares fell 0.6% to close at $23.52, whereas Time
Warner shares climbed 4% to close at $30.45 on Thursday. 

AOL had been striving to revamp itself to become an independent online company
preparing to compete with Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG), Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO)
and Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT) in the U.S. market for online
advertising valued at $29 billion. The company will now focus more on capturing
online readership by increasing content offerings and providing an online
advertising platform. 

As a part of its restructuring program, AOL plans to lay off one-third of its
staff or 2,500 employees to slash annual costs by $300 million, and is also
evaluating options to shed some of its assets. AOL`s revenue dipped 23% to $777
million in third-quarter 2009 due to a 29% drop in subscription revenue,
resulting from sustained subscriber losses and an 18% fall in advertising
revenue. 

AOL lost nearly 438,000 subscribers during the period. AOL owns and operates
more than 80 branded and niche content sites, which include independent music
site Spinner, sports site Fanhouse, Engadget for tech news, MapQuest site and
social-networking service Bebo.

Pay Czar to Impose New Rules

After slashing 50% pay of the top 25 earners in October at seven firms that have
received substantial support from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the
U.S. Treasury's pay czar, Kenneth Feinberg, plans to announce a new set of pay
restrictions on top executives of the companies today. The primary intention of
the Pay Czar is to enable the bailed out firms to repay government money by
controlling excessive pay. 

The pay czar expects to put a $500,000 cap on the cash compensation for the 26th
to 100th highest-paid employees at the six firms for which he still oversees
employees` compensation. The six firms whose compensation plans are still under
the jurisdiction of the pay czar are Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C), American
International Group Inc. (NYSE: AIG), Chrysler Financial, Chrysler Group LLC,
General Motors and GMAC Inc (NYSE: GJM). 

The pay restrictions have caused significant negative vibes within AIG, where
key employees, including CEO Robert Benmosche, have considered leaving several
times. Though Citigroup is planning to exit TARP, we don`t think it will be free
from the pay czar`s scrutiny anytime soon. However, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC)
will be absolutely free from the pay restrictions as it has only recently repaid
the $45 billion bailout money in full it had received from the TARP. 

The new rules will be applicable only to the rest of Dec 2009, but will be the
baseline for 2010. The rules could also scale down 2009 bonuses. However, the
British government has taken far tougher steps this week, announcing a 50% tax
on banker bonuses above $40,000. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) said on Thursday that
its top executives will not receive cash bonuses for 2009. 

With BofA's payment, the total amount of TARP money repaid so far totaled $116
billion. The Treasury expects a total of $175 billion of TARP repayment by the
end of 2010. The repayment of TARP money can be viewed as a sign of recovery of
the institutions as well as the economy.

concerning the characteristics of zPrimeTM. NEON is seeking to recover actual
and enhanced damages, disgorgement of IBM profits, a declaratory judgment and
reasonable and necessary attorneys` fees.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - XTO Energy Inc's XTO.N Chairman Bob Simpson may receive around $70 million in compensation after the company's deal with Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) closes, according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simpson would have been due a $120 million bonus if the U.S. natural gas company he founded signed a deal by June 1, or a $60 million bonus if the deal was signed by Dec 1. But those amounts reset to zero after December 1, according to a footnote in the company's April proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) agreed to buy U.S. natural gas company XTO on Monday in a stock deal valued at about $30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding the bonus, Simpson is due roughly $50.7 million in compensation under the change of control clause in his employment agreement, according to the proxy statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive's employment pact was also modified in September to say he will receive an amount in cash equal to three times the value of about 150,000 XTO shares granted by company in January if the company is acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of those shares will ultimately be based on the closing price when the change in control occurs, according to the regulatory filings. Based on the last closing price before the deal was announced, those shares are worth more than $18 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at XTO did not immediately respond to a question about Simpson's compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Driver in Houston and Mike Erman in New York; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp plans to buy XTO Energy Inc for about $30 billion in stock, in a move that thrusts the U.S. energy giant to the forefront of North America's fast-growing natural gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the buy, Exxon, the largest publicly traded energy company, will become the top U.S. natural gas producer as it bets on natural gas expanding its share in the world's largest energy market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This deal provides Exxon with some domestic momentum it didn't have," John Olson, a fund manager at Houston Energy Partners, said. "They are getting a huge acreage spread, with lots of shale gas plays."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bid, announced on Monday, spurred expectation of a wave of consolidation in the energy industry as cash-rich companies such as Exxon move to snap up smaller players with attractive assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will be more of these deals, and it will make the industry more resilient to volatility in natural gas prices," said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, which is subject to XTO shareholder approval and expected to close in the second quarter, would be Exxon's biggest since it purchased Mobil Corp in 1999, and the eighth-largest ever in the energy and power sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon will issue 0.7098 common share for each share of XTO, representing a premium of about 25 percent over XTO's closing price on Friday of $41.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's shares fell 4.3 percent to $69.69 on Monday, while XTO shares jumped more than 15 percent to $47.86 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Stock Exchange index of natural gas companies jumped nearly 5 percent, with Chesapeake Energy Corp up 5.8 percent at $24.37 and Devon Energy Corp up 4.6 percent at $66.80 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is valued at $41 billion, including about $10 billion in XTO debt, and is based on the December 11 closing share prices of the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchase values XTO's proved reserves at about $2.93 per thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent, just over half the current NYMEX natural gas futures price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XTO, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is one of the leading developers of unconventional resources including shale oil and gas or gas trapped in sands with low permeability that require advanced drilling techniques to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These resources have emerged as a potentially huge new resource play in North America, and their development has so far been dominated by independent U.S. exploration and production companies. But now, big oil companies like Exxon are starting to look for reserves around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Natural gas is expected to be the fastest growing of the major energy sources; it's going to grow at a substantially faster rate than oil or coal," Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive officer, said on a call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG RESERVE ADDITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XTO's resource base is the equivalent of 45 trillion cubic feet of gas and includes shale gas, tight gas, coal bed methane and shale oil and is intended to complement Exxon Mobil's holdings in the United States, Canada, Germany, Poland, Hungary and Argentina, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to be able to bring their expertise to bear on many of these new plays that we've acquired," Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XTO has been one of the fastest-growing energy producers in the United States and it expects its production to climb 23 percent this year to about 2.87 million cfe per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. natural gas prices have been under pressure as inventories of the fuel rose to record high levels, but prices have begun to firm in recent weeks as winter temperatures tap into those stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal will not likely increase Exxon's earnings per share in the near-term and may be dilutive because of the market price for natural gas, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll probably suffer in the near-term as we put it together," Tillerson told analysts. "This is really about value creation over the next many years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, like other major oil companies, has struggled to increase its oil and gas reserves in recent years as state-owned energy companies held fast to the new energy discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson said the purchase would increase the company's resource base about 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal will likely win antitrust approval even though the industry is relatively concentrated, said Craig Caesar, an antitrust attorney in the Dallas offices of law firm McGlinchey Stafford PLLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't anticipate that this is going to take a long time. This is simply a quick analysis of the marketplace and the competitive impact, which I think is going to be minimal," he said. "Despite the magnitude and the numbers, in this industry that magnitude is not that big."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan advised Exxon Mobil, and Barclays Capital Inc and Jefferies  Company Inc advised XTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Phil Wahba, Ryan Vlastelica, Ernest Scheyder, Michael Erman and Megan Davies in New York and Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Dave Zimmerman and Maureen Bavdek and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

such as Exxon move to snap up smaller players with attractive
assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There will be more of these deals, and it will make the
industry more resilient to volatility in natural gas prices,"
said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For additional stories, please see: [ID:nN14190396]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal, which is subject to XTO shareholder approval and
expected to close in the second quarter, would be Exxon's biggest
since it purchased Mobil Corp in 1999, and the eighth-largest
ever in the energy and power sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon will issue 0.7098 common share for each share of XTO,
representing a premium of about 25 percent over XTO's closing
price on Friday of $41.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's shares fell 4.3 percent to $69.69 on Monday, while
XTO shares jumped more than 15 percent to $47.86 on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The American Stock Exchange index of natural gas companies
jumped nearly 5 percent .XNG, with Chesapeake Energy Corp
(CHK.N) up 5.8 percent at $24.37 and Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) up
4.6 percent at $66.80 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is valued at $41 billion, including about $10
billion in XTO debt, and is based on the Dec. 11 closing share
prices of the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The purchase values XTO's proved reserves at about $2.93 per
thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent, just over half the current
NYMEX natural gas futures price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; XTO, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is one of the leading
developers of unconventional resources including shale oil and
gas or gas trapped in sands with low permeability that require
advanced drilling techniques to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These resources have emerged as a potentially huge new
resource play in North America, and their development has so far
been dominated by independent U.S. exploration and production
companies. But now, big oil companies like Exxon are starting to
look for reserves around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Natural gas is expected to be the fastest growing of the
major energy sources; it's going to grow at a substantially
faster rate than oil or coal," Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief
executive officer, said on a call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BIG RESERVE ADDITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; XTO's resource base is the equivalent of 45 trillion cubic
feet of gas and includes shale gas, tight gas, coal bed methane
and shale oil and is intended to complement Exxon Mobil's
holdings in the United States, Canada, Germany, Poland, Hungary
and Argentina, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're going to be able to bring their expertise to bear on
many of these new plays that we've acquired," Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; XTO has been one of the fastest-growing energy producers in
the United States and it expects its production to climb 23
percent this year to about 2.87 million cfe per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. natural gas prices have been under pressure as
inventories of the fuel rose to record high levels, but prices
have begun to firm in recent weeks as winter temperatures tap
into those stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal will not likely increase Exxon's earnings per share
in the near-term and may be dilutive because of the market price
for natural gas, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'll probably suffer in the near-term as we put it
together," Tillerson told analysts. "This is really about value
creation over the next many years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, like other major oil companies, has struggled to
increase its oil and gas reserves in recent years as state-owned
energy companies held fast to the new energy discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson said the purchase would increase the company's
resource base about 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal will likely win antitrust approval even though the
industry is relatively concentrated, said Craig Caesar, an
antitrust attorney in the Dallas offices of law firm McGlinchey
Stafford PLLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't anticipate that this is going to take a long time.
This is simply a quick analysis of the marketplace and the
competitive impact, which I think is going to be minimal," he
said. "Despite the magnitude and the numbers, in this industry
that magnitude is not that big."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan (JPM.N) advised Exxon Mobil, and Barclays Capital
Inc (BARC.L) and Jefferies  Company Inc advised XTO.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Google have built Web applications designed to highlight environmental problems coinciding with the climate change negotiations in Copenhagen that run through Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is working with the European Environmental Agency (EEA) to use its Bing Maps, Silverlight multimedia technology and Azure cloud platform to show how climate change is affecting certain regions in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Web site, called the Environmental Atlas of Europe, will inform people about climate-change stories and interesting projects, such as wine farmers in the Tuscany region of Italy who run a carbon-negative farm to a city in Denmark that uses 100 percent renewable energy, said Bert Jansen, technology lead for the EEA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's strange that not everybody is aware of these kinds of initiatives," Jansen said. "I think it's important that good initiatives get the attention that they deserve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and the EEA also launched another Web site called Bend the Trend, where people can pick from up to 45 pledges for how they can reduce their impact on the environment. Pledges, which are marked on an interactive Bing map, include eating less meat, turning down thermostats and recycling all paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Web sites are essentially data visualization tools focused on environmental information, said Ludo De Bock, senior director for European Union and NATO relations for Microsoft. Jansen said that the EEA has a lot of data, such as noise pollution data, that could be overlaid onto the Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is also lending its cloud-computing power to help scientists keep closer tabs on deforestation. Over the next year or so, Google expects to release an online version of a tool that analyzes raw satellite imagery to compare deforestation over time. The tool will enable the creation of deforestation maps much faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application is essentially an online version of those built by forest researchers Greg Asner of the Carnegie Institution for Science and Carlos Souza of Imazon, an Amazon rain forest research institute. Their applications are used across Latin America, but analysis had been hampered by a lack of access to satellite images and slow computational resources, according to a Google blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform offers a much cheaper way for countries to measure deforestation since Google's data centers can serve up terabytes of satellite images and contribute a massive amount of computational power from its data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On a top-of-the-line desktop computer, it can take days or weeks to analyze deforestation over the Amazon," wrote Rebecca Moore, engineering manager, and Amy Luers, environment manager for Google.org, the company's philanthropic branch. "Using our cloud-based computing power, we can reduce that time to seconds. Being able to detect illegal logging activities faster can help support local law enforcement and prevent further deforestation from happening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said a prototype of the platform is available now to a limited number of partners, but it should be rolled out to the public over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil's $30 billion bid for XTO Energy on Monday could signal confidence the price of cleaner burning natural gas will rally against crude prices to more normal levels in the mid-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High inventories, light summer demand, and near record high natural gas production in 2009, coming mostly from growth in shale gas output, kept gas prices under pressure for most of this year, with quotes in September sinking to a 7-1/2-year low below $2 per million British thermal units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weak fundamentals drove down natural gas prices relative to crude to more than 25 -- meaning crude prices in absolute terms were trading at more than 25 times higher than gas -- after the price ratio between the two markets hovered between 7 and 8 for most of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ratio has since narrowed to 13 as crude prices slipped to $70 a barrel from recent highs above $80 due to high inventories, while gas prices moved back above $5 as winter weather arrived to drive up demand again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Natural gas prices are actually very low relative to crude on an energy equivalent basis. It could be that Exxon is playing that gap," said Earl Sweet, managing director at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE LONG VIEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also said the bid makes sense for Exxon longer-term, noting demand for gas, which produces about half the carbon dioxide of coal, is likely to increase worldwide as nations struggle to meet climate change objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gas supplies have gotten ahead of demand, but as the gas market expands, conditions are likely to tighten. Exxon doesn't invest for (only) 18 months," said Stephen Smith at Stephen Smith Energy, a consulting firm in Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say gas, which burns much cleaner than coal or oil, should be the favored fossil fuel in coming years as countries transition to even cleaner alternative fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XTO, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is one of the leading developers of unconventional resources including shale gas or gas trapped in sands with low permeability that require advanced drilling techniques to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These resources have emerged as a potentially huge new resource play in North America, and their development has so far been dominated by independent U.S. exploration and production companies. But now oil majors like Exxon are starting to look for reserves around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a comfortable plan B for an oil producer. They already know a lot about gas, and it makes them a little less dependent on the petroleum market," said Tim Evans, energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TWO DIFFERENT MARKETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While oil and natural gas prices don't always move in tandem, they are loosely linked by competition for a share of winter heating and summer cooling demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil is more globally-focused, with prices impacted by OPEC production, political instability and worldwide growth prospects, while gas is still primarily a domestic market, with most of the gas burned in North America produced there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude oil by-products like heating oil and residual fuel can be used instead of gas in dual-fired burners that produce heat or power for homes and factories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the time, the two markets (oil and gas) move independently, and right now oil is certainly expensive," Citi Futures' Evans said, noting heating oil was trading at a substantial premium to gas even with high inventories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the economy improves and gas production slows as predicted next year, gas prices are expected to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The January crude-to-gas ratio in 2011 and 2012 is quoted between 11 and 12 based on New York Mercantile Exchange forward futures prices on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joe Silha; Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) $30 billion bid for XTO Energy XTO.N on Monday could signal confidence the price of cleaner burning natural gas will rally against crude prices to more normal levels in the mid-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High inventories, light summer demand, and near record high natural gas production in 2009, coming mostly from growth in shale gas output, kept gas prices under pressure for most of this year, with quotes in September sinking to a 7-1/2-year low below $2 per million British thermal units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weak fundamentals drove down natural gas prices relative to crude to more than 25 -- meaning crude prices in absolute terms were trading at more than 25 times higher than gas -- after the price ratio between the two markets hovered between 7 and 8 for most of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ratio has since narrowed to 13 as crude prices slipped to $70 a barrel from recent highs above $80 due to high inventories, while gas prices moved back above $5 as winter weather arrived to drive up demand again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Natural gas prices are actually very low relative to crude on an energy equivalent basis. It could be that Exxon is playing that gap," said Earl Sweet, managing director at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE LONG VIEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also said the bid makes sense for Exxon longer-term, noting demand for gas, which produces about half the carbon dioxide of coal, is likely to increase worldwide as nations struggle to meet climate change objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gas supplies have gotten ahead of demand, but as the gas market expands, conditions are likely to tighten. Exxon doesn't invest for (only) 18 months," said Stephen Smith at Stephen Smith Energy, a consulting firm in Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say gas, which burns much cleaner than coal or oil, should be the favored fossil fuel in coming years as countries transition to even cleaner alternative fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XTO, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is one of the leading developers of unconventional resources including shale gas or gas trapped in sands with low permeability that require advanced drilling techniques to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These resources have emerged as a potentially huge new resource play in North America, and their development has so far been dominated by independent U.S. exploration and production companies. But now oil majors like Exxon are starting to look for reserves around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a comfortable plan B for an oil producer. They already know a lot about gas, and it makes them a little less dependent on the petroleum market," said Tim Evans, energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TWO DIFFERENT MARKETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While oil and natural gas prices don't always move in tandem, they are loosely linked by competition for a share of winter heating and summer cooling demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil is more globally-focused, with prices impacted by OPEC production, political instability and worldwide growth prospects, while gas is still primarily a domestic market, with most of the gas burned in North America produced there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude oil by-products like heating oil and residual fuel can be used instead of gas in dual-fired burners that produce heat or power for homes and factories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the time, the two markets (oil and gas) move independently, and right now oil is certainly expensive," Citi Futures' Evans said, noting heating oil was trading at a substantial premium to gas even with high inventories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the economy improves and gas production slows as predicted next year, gas prices are expected to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The January crude-to-gas ratio in 2011 and 2012 is quoted between 11 and 12 based on New York Mercantile Exchange forward futures prices on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joe Silha; Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 14 (Reuters) - Mid- and small cap stocks rose
on Monday as news of Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) plan to buy XTO
Energy Inc XTO.N boosted shares of energy companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil reached a deal to acquire XTO, one of the

oil or gas, in an all-stock deal valued at about $41 billion,
including about $10 billion in debt. For details, see

[ID:nN14161252].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You get days like today because of the takeover, so there

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) today announced it has purchased
three intrastate natural gas liquids (NGL) pipeline systems from Chevron
Midstream Pipelines LLC that expand and extend the partnership`s South Louisiana
network of midstream infrastructure. Originating from a central point in Henry,
Louisiana, the 212 miles of intrastate pipelines extend westward to Lake
Charles, northward to Breaux Bridge in St. Martin Parish, and eastward to
Napoleonville, Louisiana, where Enterprise`s Promix NGL fractionation and
storage facilities are located. 

"Reflecting the efficiencies and flexibility of our integrated midstream
network, this targeted acquisition enhances our NGL pipeline access to the
sizeable refining and petrochemical complex in Lake Charles for a relatively
modest capital investment," said Michael A. Creel, president and chief executive
officer for Enterprise. "We are very pleased to work with Chevron to acquire
these pipelines, which will also complement our ongoing expansion plans in South
Louisiana." 

The extensive network of intrastate pipelines in Louisiana already owned by
Enterprise transports NGL products between key supply points, including the
partnership`s storage and terminal facilities at Breaux Bridge and its
fractionation facilities at Norco, Promix, and Baton Rouge, as well as various
markets at Napoleonville, Geismar, and other points along the Mississippi River.
In addition to improving the partnership`s Louisiana NGL pipeline system to Lake
Charles, the acquisition will increase capacity between Breaux Bridge and
Napoleonville. This bi-directional pipeline will not only enhance Enterprise`s
ability to move various NGL products to these Louisiana markets, it will also
provide additional capacity for delivering Louisiana propane production into the
Enterprise-owned Dixie Pipeline system for transportation to end-use markets
throughout the southeastern United States or to the partnership`s Mont Belvieu,
Texas NGL fractionation complex. Along with the improvements already identified,
Enterprise continues to evaluate other potential expansion opportunities
resulting from the acquisition. 

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. is the largest publicly traded partnership and
a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and
consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals.
The partnership`s assets include: more than 48,000 miles of onshore and offshore
pipelines; approximately 200 million barrels of storage capacity for NGLs,
refined products and crude oil; and 27 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage
capacity. Services include: natural gas transportation, gathering, processing
and storage; NGL fractionation (or separation), transportation, storage, and
import and export terminaling; crude oil and refined products storage,
transportation and terminaling; offshore production platform; petrochemical
transportation and storage; and a marine transportation business that operates
primarily on the United States inland and Intracoastal Waterway systems and in
the Gulf of Mexico. For additional information visit www.epplp.com. Enterprise
Products Partners L.P. is managed by its general partner, Enterprise Products GP
LLC, which is wholly owned by Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. (NYSE:EPE). For more

 TORONTO, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Toronto's main stock index
jumped 1 percent on Monday as Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) $30
billion deal to buy XTO Energy Inc XTO.N spurred hopes for
more acquisition moves in the energy sector.

 Shares of EnCana Corp (ECA.TO), up 5.76 percent at C$31.76,
and Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO), up 1.85 percent at C$36.96,
played the biggest role in leading the index higher.

 Exxon's deal raised expectations of a wave of consolidation
in the energy sector as cash-rich companies move to snap up
smaller players with attractive assets. [ID:nN14126206]

 "That put an undertone to the (Canadian) market," said Paul
Gardner, partner and portfolio manager at Avenue Investment
Management.

 "It makes a lot of sense. Exxon's got the capital, natural
gas is near historic lows and this is probably a perfect
opportunity to deploy capital,"

 At 11:50 a.m. (1650 GMT), the SP/TSX composite index
.GSPTSE was up 110.59 points, or 0.97 percent, at 11,534.52.

 Other top gainers on the index were Canadian Natural
Resources (CNQ.TO), up 2.43 percent at C$70.44, and Talisman
Energy (TLM.TO), up 3.2 percent at C$18.68.

 The Exxon deal added impetus to recent economic data that
has spurred optimism in the market.

 "I get the general sense people have sort of bought into
the fact that economic conditions have more than stabilized and
we're slowly moving up," said Ian Nakamoto, director of
research at MacDougall, MacDougall  MacTier.

 Markets were also helped by news that Abu Dhabi threw its
debt-laden neighbor Dubai a surprise $10 billion lifeline on
Monday to head off a bond default. [ID:nLDE5BD0FV]

 Weighing on the market were shares of fertilizer makers,
which fell after Terra Industries TRA.N rejected a sweetened
takeover offer from rival CF Industries (CF.N).
[ID:nN14170919]

 Potash Corp (POT.TO) was the biggest drag on the index,
down 2.43 percent to C$122.93, while rival Agrium (AGU.TO) fell
1.31 percent at C$65.53

&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies were still getting H-1B visa petitions even as they cut jobs, according to data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) that shows who received the visas in the 2009 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of trends are immediately apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, some of the big India IT services cut back on their H-1B use during the softening job market. For instance, Infosys Technologies Ltd. received only 440 visas in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 2008 and ended on Sept. 30, 2009. In the prior fiscal year, it received more than 10 times that number, or 4,559. And while Wipro Ltd. led the FY09 list with 1,964 visas, that number is still down more than 25% from the 2,678 visas it got the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, U.S. firms, despite cutbacks in their own staffs and an overall decline in IT employment, continued to hire people using H-1B visas. That list includes Microsoft, Intel and IBM's India operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. can issue 85,000 visas in the current 2010 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1; only 2,500 remain available. In the last several years, the pool of available visas has been exhausted within days of the April 1 filing period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the economic slowdown has not dampened efforts by tech firms to get H-1B visa limits raised, if not removed all together. Congress is expected to take up comprehensive immigration reform next year, a move likely to focus renewed attention on H-1B visa restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue came up obliquely earlier this month at a White House " jobs summit " attended mostly by business leaders, labor officials and economists. Just before that summit, the CEOs of more than 50 companies, many of them tech firms, sent out a letter calling for fewer restrictions on hiring of foreign workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those signing the letter were top officials of Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Oracle, Microsoft, EMC, Computer Associates, Hewlett-Packard, Dell Inc. and Texas Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the United States to remain a world leader in innovation," the letter said in part, "we need to increase America's domestic pipeline of highly skilled workers, while also attracting and retaining the world's best and brightest workers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That point was later echoed by Obama at the summit when he said that "one of the great things about this country is we get the best and the brightest talent to study here, and once they study here they start enjoying the intellectual freedom and the entrepreneurship, they decide to stay, and they start new businesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of H-1B visas approved by the USCIS for FY09 is available here. (And here'sthe full list from 2008 .)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

 TORONTO, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Toronto's main stock index rose
on Monday, led by energy shares after Exxon Mobil Corp's
(XOM.N) $30 billion bid to take over XTO Energy Inc XTO.N
spurred hopes about more dealmaking in the sector.

 Shares of EnCana Corp (ECA.TO), up 5.26 percent at C$31.60,
and Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO), up 1.32 percent at C$36.77,
played the biggest role in leading the index higher.

 The deal added impetus to recent economic data that has
spurred optimism in the market.

 "I get the general sense people have sort of bought into
the fact that economic conditions have more than stabilized and
we're slowly moving up," said Ian Nakamoto, director of
research at MacDougall, MacDougall  MacTier.

 Markets were also buoyed by news that Abu Dhabi threw its
debt-laden neighbor Dubai a surprise $10 billion lifeline on
Monday to head off a bond default. [ID:nLDE5BD0FV]

&lt;p&gt;Conference Theme Unveiled-Transitioning Your Company in the New Economy
RONKONKOMA, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
VAI (Vormittag Associates, Inc.), a leader in enterprise management solutions
for the mid-market, and an IBM Premier Business Partner, today unveiled plans
for its 2010 VAI User Conference. The conference will be held November 3-6 at
Disney's BoardWalk Inn in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. VAI customers will have
access to a series of workshops designed to provide best-practice training and
technical information about the latest features and benefits of the S2K Software
Suite, with special emphasis around the event`s central theme, Transitioning
Your Company in the New Economy. 

VAI`s annual User Conference traditionally highlights S2K`s newest features,
while allowing users the chance to discover best practices for improving
operational efficiencies, network with peers and learn about the latest industry
trends. The goal of this year`s Conference is to provide attendees with the
tools and information needed to excel and work smarter in this rapidly changing
market. Designed to provide immediately implementable, real-world knowledge, the
2010 workshops will focus on the following topics:

* Extending the Enterprise: The emerging economy demands that businesses adapt
quickly to rapidly changing market conditions. In this hyper-competitive
environment, mobile access to critical company data is no longer an option, but
rather a necessity. Attendees will be introduced to a variety of mobile
solutions that allow businesses to grow by extending the enterprise to provide
customers, suppliers and employees instant access to the information they
need-in the way that they want to receive it-anywhere, anytime. 
* Lowering Operational Costs: The biggest expense for most businesses is related
to the management of inventory. Space, equipment and people make up for most of
these expenses. With slower consumer spending, customers will reduce order
quantities, place more orders and demand better prices. This reduces revenues
while increasing transaction costs. Warehouse resources will have to deal with
additional, smaller transactions that can hurt productivity. Investments in
Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) can help optimize resources. By grouping
orders, picking can be improved significantly freeing people and equipment. In
addition, space optimization, a reduction in lost and damaged inventory and the
elimination of mistakes in picking can be realized. 
* Customer Loyalty: Customer loyalty describes the tendency of a customer to
choose one business over another for a particular need. One way that a business
can fail, regardless of treating customers well, is to misunderstand the
fundamental needs of customers and the movements of the market. Businesses
should be proactive in using technology to enhance customer relationships.
Whether it be a customer self service Web site, or by giving the remote sales
force the tools needed to react quickly to customer demands, it is imperative
that businesses today provide the highest level of customer service. 
* Inventory Management:In 2009,plummeting sales and swelling inventories pushed
up the inventory-to-sales ratio. Most of the inventory businesses carry is
funded either by suppliers or by banks. As sales drop, inventory remains in the
warehouse longer, but suppliers still demand payment. This dead inventory
directly impacts the bottom line and as a company`s financials deteriorate,
banks become reluctant to lend. Therefore, companies must identify dead stock to
reduce future investments. The key to success lies in effectively forecasting
and managing inventory, which means having the right material on hand when a
customer needs it, but without accumulating dead stock and negatively affecting
the bottom line.

Long-time VAI customer, Russ TumSuden, CFO, Sid Harvey`s, said, "Often,
executives are focused on operations within the four walls of their own company
and lack knowledge of the best-practices in place at other organizations.
Therefore, it is important for me to attend the VAI User Conference because I
have an opportunity to speak with other industry professionals to find out what
tactics they use to improve efficiencies and to attend workshop sessions to
learn about S2K capabilities that will enhance operations. Coming to this event
is a worthwhile educational experience." 

Bob Vormittag, President &amp; CEO, VAI, said, "VAI understands that keeping
customers happy by providing quality customer care is very important to a
company`s sustainability. Ensuring the existing customer base is well cared for
is imperative, especially in today`s economy where new business is harder to
acquire. Business leaders must implement smart solutions that extend access to
accurate and timely enterprise data, and VAI can help. With our advanced arsenal
of enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications, we understand that
competitive advantage is won with the use of technology, and best-in-class
companies are leading the charge. For VAI customers, the 2010 User Conference
will provide the tools and knowledge necessary to adapt to current and future
economic conditions."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) confirmed that Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon
would attend today`s White House meeting to discuss the bank`s plans to continue
to support the Administration`s objectives of increased and responsible lending
to individuals and businesses, increased efforts to keep families in their
homes, better consumer protections, and responsible executive compensation. 

As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is connected to many corners
of the economy and is working together, every day, with its customers,
communities, employees and vendors to support a successful economic rebound. 

"This is simply what a bank should do," said JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO
Jamie Dimon. 

JPMorgan Chase serves over 90 million consumers and 2 million small businesses
across the country. The firm lends to approximately 10,000 government
organizations, non profits, hospitals and schools in the United States, and the
investment bank has client relationships with over 4,000 issuers and 15,000
investor clients globally. As a market leader, the bank has led the market with
$120 billion in corporate loans to its large, corporate clients this year and
raised $580 billion for clients in the global debt and equity markets. 

The bank spends more than $15 billion per year with approximately 40,000
vendors, who provide jobs to millions of employees. JPMorgan Chase pays more
than $10 billion a year in taxes to the U.S. federal government as well as to
state and local jurisdictions. 

Specifically, JPMorgan Chase continues to focuses its efforts on: 

Supporting Small Businesses:

* Recognizing the role small businesses play in creating jobs and supporting our
economy, JPMorgan Chase has $29 billion in outstanding balances in the form of
loans, lines and credit card balances to small businesses. 
* Last month, the bank announced plans to increase lending to small businesses
by up to $4 billion in 2010, boosting expected new lending to about $10 billion
next year to this vital segment of the U.S. economy. 
* To accomplish increased lending, JPMorgan Chase is hiring 325 additional small
business bankers to work around the country supporting all of these efforts,
adding to the 1,900 bankers who currently support the less than $10 million
segment. The bank also added approximately 100 middle market bankers to support
lending to mid-sized companies. 
* In November, the bank began offering a second look on all previous loan
applications from small businesses to ensure the bank has examined all possible
ways to provide the credit.

Maintaining Responsible Lending, Despite Decreased Demand:

* The bank is continuing to offer customers responsible loans that meet their
needs and that they can afford. 
* Banks are competing to lend to qualified business borrowers - but demand is
down. Mortgage applications are down 10 percent year-to-date, and credit card
spending is down 7 percent. 
* Small business loan applications were down 37 percent in the third quarter,
but the bank maintained its lending at nearly the same levels over the past
year. JPMorgan Chase has just recently started to see an uptick in these
applications, following on its announcement in November that it would increase
lending even more in this area. 
* While financial institutions should do all they can to lend responsibly, it is
important that institutions are not pushed to lower their underwriting
standards. Making bad loans would be even worse for the economy, and this was
one of the leading causes of the financial crisis.

Stepping Up for Local Governments and Non Profits:

* Since the credit crisis that struck in the fall 2008, JPMorgan Chase has
provided more than $90 billion in financing to non-profit and healthcare
companies, universities and state and local governments, helping to build
bridges and parks, improve social services, train young people for jobs, expand
hospitals and fund medical research 
* JPMorgan Chase was able to offer billions of dollars in financing to states
and municipalities like Illinois, New Jersey and California at critical times
when credit markets were shut down. 
* The company`s strong capital position allowed it to step in and help these
borrowers through traditional loans, credit facilities and bond and capital
market underwritings.

Mortgage Modifications:

* Chase has offered more than 568,000 mortgage modifications to struggling
homeowners in 2009 through the government's and Chase`s modification programs. 
* The bank modifies mortgages in accordance with the standards specified by the
Obama Administration, and when a borrower does not qualify for the
Administration`s program, we use a range of other modification programs. 
* Chase opened 30 Chase Homeownership Centers in 13 states this year for more
effective face-to-face contact, with a planned addition of 21 more sites in the
first quarter of 2010. We are proud to be the first major servicer to offer this
option. 
* We`ve hired 3,700 additional mortgage operations employees to handle the
unprecedented volume generated by the troubled economy and housing market. 
* We`ve also launched a coordinated program to call a customer 36 times, reach
out by mail 15 times and make at least two home visits, if necessary, to get the
appropriate documents. 
* We are hopeful that streamlined programs and constant improvements will
increase modifications even more. The bank is constantly working with Treasury
officials on new methods to try to increase the number of borrowers who make
their mortgage payments under these programs and to encourage them to return
income verification documents.

Supporting Financial Regulatory Reform:

* As CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon has written in the Wall Street Journal and the
Washington Post, we agree with the need for better financial regulation,
including regulatory consolidation, systemic risk regulation, ending
too-big-to-fail, better consumer protection, and more transparency in the
derivatives markets. 
* The details matter, and the stakes are simply too high and the consequences
too far-reaching to do this hastily and poorly. While we agree with many of the
proposals, we share concerns with others that some regulatory proposals could
restrict lending by banks, which will hinder economic growth and job creation. 
* Clarity and consistency build confidence and are critical to companies that
are looking to create jobs, invest and expand their businesses.

Upholding Sound Executive Compensation Principles:

* Poorly designed compensation practices contributed to the financial crisis.
JPMorgan Chase has always tried to stay at the forefront of sound and sensible
compensation practices, with a process that is disciplined and rigorous. 
* JPMorgan Chase has always paid a significant share of our incentive
compensation in stock. Executive compensation is tied to long-term company
performance with equity awards that vest over multiple years. All senior
executives retain at least 75 percent of all equity awards granted to them. 
* Incentive compensation is determined by looking at multi-year performance
periods, not just a single year, and does not reward excessive risk taking. The
bank`s bonus recoupment policy is beyond that required by Sarbanes-Oxley. 
* As a general practice, JPMorgan Chase does not have: change-of-control
agreements, special executive retirement plans, golden parachutes, special
severance or medical packages for senior executives or merger bonuses.

JPMorgan Chase is committed to working with policymakers and looks forward to
hearing President Obama`s ideas about improving the economy and getting people
back to work. For more information on JPMorgan Chase`s work to help the economic

&lt;p&gt;vDesk Extends Desktop Management to Unmanaged Workers with Microsoft System
Center Configuration Manager
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
RingCube Technologies, the leading provider of the managed virtual workspace,
today announced that it has become a member of the Microsoft System Center
Alliance. The RingCube vDesk solution enables enterprises to provide unmanaged
workers such as contractors, consultants and outsourced workers with a secure
managed virtual workspace that workers can use with their own PCs, while keeping
applications, confidential data and network traffic completely isolated. Rather
than providing each unmanaged worker with a dedicated PC, vDesk integrates with
Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2007 to extend its provisioning,
policy enforcement, and disaster recovery capabilities to unmanaged worker PCs
using vDesk virtual workspaces. 

"Workspace virtualization solutions offer isolation, without the added data
center costs of servers, storage and other infrastructure resources that some
other approaches require," said Ronni Colville, vice president and distinguished
analyst, Gartner, Inc. "These tools also will more likely align with existing
desktop management processes, but standards will be needed to enable mixing and
matching of technologies." 

Unmanaged workers such as contractors, consultants, outsourced or temporary
employees often require a computing environment on a project basis to perform a
specific set of tasks. These types of workers typically use their own PCs that
are considered unmanaged or untrusted desktop computers from a corporate IT
perspective. When their unmanaged workers are finished with their projects or
reassigned, their workspaces can be revoked remotely, protecting corporate data
from loss. By combining RingCube vDesk with Microsoft System Center, IT
organizations can deploy a high-performance virtual desktop with an agent that:

* Runs at 99% of the native host PC performance including full 3D graphics 
* Can be stored on a portable USB drive, unmanaged PC or network file share 
* Encrypts the virtual workspace using a Microsoft virtual hard drive (VHD)
format 
* Isolates applications, data and network traffic from the unmanaged PC 
* Joins to the corporate domain as a separate computer and retains group
policies (GPO) 
* Provides virtual network communication that supports VPN remote access

"Workspace virtualization is driving down the cost of delivering and managing a
corporate desktop for unmanaged workers without the performance and cost
compromises found in many legacy virtualization approaches," said Doug Dooley,
vice president of marketing, RingCube. "By partnering with the Microsoft System
Center Alliance, RingCube is leveraging desktop management infrastructure that
customers already have in place for physical PCs to deliver fully managed
virtual workspaces that lower the cost of desktop management, increase
provisioning speed and improve employee productivity." 

The aim of the System Center Alliance is to create, nurture and grow a strong
partner ecosystem around the System Center suite of systems management products.
Together the member solutions provide sophisticated and effective IT and systems
management functionality. Based on successful customer deployments, RingCube
demonstrated that it has built an architecturally sound workspace virtualization
layer that delivers a solution for unmanaged workers and leverages Microsoft
System Center Configuration Manager. 

"We are pleased to see RingCube vDesk integrate with System Center Configuration
Manager 2007 to deliver a managed virtual workspace to unmanaged workers," said
JD Marymee, director of strategic partner alliances, Management and Services
Division at Microsoft Corp. "Mutual customers will benefit from increased
deployment options and desktop mobility solutions while using their existing
Windows management infrastructure. We are pleased to work with RingCube to
further the capabilities offered by the System Center products and to help
customers with their desktop virtualization deployments." 

Joining the Microsoft System Center Alliance is an example of RingCube`s ongoing
collaboration with Microsoft. For more information on the Microsoft System
Center Alliance please visit http://www.microsoft.com/sca. For more information

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) confirmed that Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon
would attend today`s White House meeting to discuss the bank`s plans to continue
to support the Administration`s objectives of increased and responsible lending
to individuals and businesses, increased efforts to keep families in their
homes, better consumer protections, and responsible executive compensation. 

As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is connected to many corners
of the economy and is working together, every day, with its customers,
communities, employees and vendors to support a successful economic rebound. 

"This is simply what a bank should do," said JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO
Jamie Dimon. 

JPMorgan Chase serves over 90 million consumers and 2 million small businesses
across the country. The firm lends to approximately 10,000 government
organizations, non profits, hospitals and schools in the United States, and the
investment bank has client relationships with over 4,000 issuers and 15,000
investor clients globally. As a market leader, the bank has led the market with
$120 billion in corporate loans to its large, corporate clients this year and
raised $580 billion for clients in the global debt and equity markets. 

The bank spends more than $15 billion per year with approximately 40,000
vendors, who provide jobs to millions of employees. JPMorgan Chase pays more
than $10 billion a year in taxes to the U.S. federal government as well as to
state and local jurisdictions. 

Specifically, JPMorgan Chase continues to focuses its efforts on: 

Supporting Small Businesses:

* Recognizing the role small businesses play in creating jobs and supporting our
economy, JPMorgan Chase has $29 billion in outstanding balances in the form of
loans, lines and credit card balances to small businesses. 
* Last month, the bank announced plans to increase lending to small businesses
by up to $4 billion in 2010, boosting expected new lending to about $10 billion
next year to this vital segment of the U.S. economy. 
* To accomplish increased lending, JPMorgan Chase is hiring 325 additional small
business bankers to work around the country supporting all of these efforts,
adding to the 1,900 bankers who currently support the less than $10 million
segment. The bank also added approximately 100 middle market bankers to support
lending to mid-sized companies. 
* In November, the bank began offering a second look on all previous loan
applications from small businesses to ensure the bank has examined all possible
ways to provide the credit.

Maintaining Responsible Lending, Despite Decreased Demand:

* The bank is continuing to offer customers responsible loans that meet their
needs and that they can afford. 
* Banks are competing to lend to qualified business borrowers - but demand is
down. Mortgage applications are down 10 percent year-to-date, and credit card
spending is down 7 percent. 
* Small business loan applications were down 37 percent in the third quarter,
but the bank maintained its lending at nearly the same levels over the past
year. JPMorgan Chase has just recently started to see an uptick in these
applications, following on its announcement in November that it would increase
lending even more in this area. 
* While financial institutions should do all they can to lend responsibly, it is
important that institutions are not pushed to lower their underwriting
standards. Making bad loans would be even worse for the economy, and this was
one of the leading causes of the financial crisis.

Stepping Up for Local Governments and Non Profits:

* Since the credit crisis that struck in the fall 2008, JPMorgan Chase has
provided more than $90 billion in financing to non-profit and healthcare
companies, universities and state and local governments, helping to build
bridges and parks, improve social services, train young people for jobs, expand
hospitals and fund medical research 
* JPMorgan Chase was able to offer billions of dollars in financing to states
and municipalities like Illinois, New Jersey and California at critical times
when credit markets were shut down. 
* The company`s strong capital position allowed it to step in and help these
borrowers through traditional loans, credit facilities and bond and capital
market underwritings.

Mortgage Modifications:

* Chase has offered more than 568,000 mortgage modifications to struggling
homeowners in 2009 through the government's and Chase`s modification programs. 
* The bank modifies mortgages in accordance with the standards specified by the
Obama Administration, and when a borrower does not qualify for the
Administration`s program, we use a range of other modification programs. 
* Chase opened 30 Chase Homeownership Centers in 13 states this year for more
effective face-to-face contact, with a planned addition of 21 more sites in the
first quarter of 2010. We are proud to be the first major servicer to offer this
option. 
* We`ve hired 3,700 additional mortgage operations employees to handle the
unprecedented volume generated by the troubled economy and housing market. 
* We`ve also launched a coordinated program to call a customer 36 times, reach
out by mail 15 times and make at least two home visits, if necessary, to get the
appropriate documents. 
* We are hopeful that streamlined programs and constant improvements will
increase modifications even more. The bank is constantly working with Treasury
officials on new methods to try to increase the number of borrowers who make
their mortgage payments under these programs and to encourage them to return
income verification documents.

Supporting Financial Regulatory Reform:

* As CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon has written in the Wall Street Journal and the
Washington Post, we agree with the need for better financial regulation,
including regulatory consolidation, systemic risk regulation, ending
too-big-to-fail, better consumer protection, and more transparency in the
derivatives markets. 
* The details matter, and the stakes are simply too high and the consequences
too far-reaching to do this hastily and poorly. While we agree with many of the
proposals, we share concerns with others that some regulatory proposals could
restrict lending by banks, which will hinder economic growth and job creation. 
* Clarity and consistency build confidence and are critical to companies that
are looking to create jobs, invest and expand their businesses.

Upholding Sound Executive Compensation Principles:

* Poorly designed compensation practices contributed to the financial crisis.
JPMorgan Chase has always tried to stay at the forefront of sound and sensible
compensation practices, with a process that is disciplined and rigorous. 
* JPMorgan Chase has always paid a significant share of our incentive
compensation in stock. Executive compensation is tied to long-term company
performance with equity awards that vest over multiple years. All senior

&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Random Password Manager Integrates with Microsoft Office SharePoint
Server toAutomatically Discover High-Risk Privileged Account Activity on
SharePoint Sites
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Lieberman Software today announced integration of its flagship privileged
identity management solution, Enterprise Random Password Manager (ERPM), with
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server to give enterprises the ability to
automatically discover and secure all privileged identities present on
SharePoint Server sites. 

Privileged identities are accounts that hold elevated permission to access
files, install and run programs, and change configuration settings. They exist
on most server and desktop operating systems, business applications, databases,
Web services and network appliances in an organization. Enterprises that do not
maintain frequently-changed, unique passwords for each privileged account face a
threat of unauthorized users and malicious programs gaining unrestricted access
to resources throughout the network should a single identity be compromised. 

SharePoint Server makes extensive use of privileged accounts for its processes,
and is an example of an enterprise service that could benefit from Lieberman
Software`s Enterprise Random Password Manager. The most common management
solution for privileged accounts is for IT staff to develop, test, deploy and
maintain ad-hoc scripts. While suitable for smaller, more static, IT
environments, scripts are not a comprehensive solution in an enterprise. Large,
dynamic networks require continuous identification and management of all the
privileged identities present in SharePoint Server sites. 

"Each SharePoint Server site could have its own set of privileged accounts, and
finding and managing these accounts can be difficult," said Chris Stoneff,
product manager at Lieberman Software. "Consequently, most organizations'
privileged account passwords for enterprise applications and services, such as
SharePoint Server, are rarely changed. This can result in failed security audits
and potentially costly data breaches. Fortunately, Enterprise Random Password
Manager now provides complete management for all SharePoint Server privileged
accounts." 

SharePoint Integration

Comprehensive integration between Lieberman Software ERPM and Microsoft
SharePoint Server includes:

* Automatic Discovery - ERPM automatically discovers all privileged accounts in
SharePoint Server sites. This capability is ideal for large SharePoint Server
farms because it allows IT administrators to regularly change these passwords
locally in Active Directory and propagate the new password to all SharePoint
components with a single mouse click. 
* Controlled Access - ERPM now has the ability to grant controlled access to
SharePoint Server privileged accounts using a web-based firecall system. This
provides time-limited access to these accounts, restricted only to authorized
staff who document the purpose for each access. It also removes the security
threat posed by individuals who hold high-powered credentials indefinitely,
without documented need for each access.

Enterprise Random Password Manager integrates with all current and recent
versions of SharePoint Server - including SharePoint Server 2007, SharePoint
Server 2003, and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server - and is available now.

&lt;p&gt;  SUNNYVALE, CA, Dec 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ShoreTel(R) (NASDAQ: SHOR), the leading provider of brilliantly simple IP
phone systems with fully integrated Unified Communications (UC), today
announced it has completed interoperability testing with IBM Sametime
Unified Telephony (SUT) to offer ShoreTel customers the option to access
the advanced capabilities of SUT for collaboration and communications.

    The ShoreTel UC system is already enjoyed by more than a million end users
in organizations of all sizes around the globe. With this validation,
ShoreTel extends its feature-rich capabilities to organizations that use
IBM SUT client and bridges the gap with seamless integration between the
ShoreTel phone system and the IBM Sametime environment. UC features made
available with IBM SUT include presence information so end-users can see
if a contact is free to take a call, call alerts, and call routing for
improved flexibility.

    This interoperability testing marks yet another milestone in collaboration
between IBM and ShoreTel to deliver UC solutions that offer flexibility,
ease of use and efficiency enhancements to organizations of all sizes. In
May, ShoreTel showcased its ease of integration with IBM Sametime for
enterprise-level UC capabilities and, in July, ShoreTel announced an
agreement with IBM to integrate with IBM Lotus Foundations Reach to offer
an affordable, self-managed, brilliantly simple UC solution in a box for
small and midsize businesses.

    "ShoreTel recognizes that every organization has a different approach and
a unique roadmap for its UC strategy," said Kevin Gavin, vice president of
marketing at ShoreTel. "The ShoreTel UC system already offers this degree
of flexibility with ShoreTel Professional Call Manager, but organizations
that have already deployed an IBM Lotus Sametime solution with Lotus
Sametime Connect across desktops may prefer to standardize on that
application, rather than require end users to switch. As a result,
organizations can leverage existing IBM investment and reduce their
training requirements."

    The demand for more efficient and productive communications has triggered
major advances in unified communications, which involve the integration of
what were once separate silos -- information technology, communications,
and application software. A key requirement of successful integration is
to enable users to place an audio or video call, exchange instant messages
(IM), check a user's presence, or make a conference call -- all through a
single integrated interface.

&lt;p&gt;Deepwater Discovery Supports Company`s Long-Term Growth Plans for Gorgon
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), through its subsidiary Chevron Australia Pty
Ltd, today announced an additional natural gas discovery in the Carnarvon Basin
offshore Western Australia. The discovery is located in Australia`s premier
hydrocarbon basin, where Chevron is the leading leaseholder. 

The exploration well, Satyr-1, located 100 miles (160 kilometers) offshore in
the Greater Gorgon Area in 3,510 feet (1,070 meters) of water, was drilled to a
total depth of 14,960 feet (4,560 meters). The well discovered 425 feet (130
meters) of net gas pay. 

"Our offshore drilling campaign in northwestern Australia continues to deliver
results and is expected to provide additional natural gas supplies to underpin
the Chevron-operated Gorgon natural gas project," said George Kirkland,
executive vice president, Global Upstream and Gas, Chevron Corporation. 

"The success of Satyr-1, following closely on the Achilles-1 discovery,
highlights the quality of Chevron`s exploration capability in the region and the
significance of Australia to Chevron`s energy portfolio," said Jim Blackwell,
president, Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production. 

Satyr-1 is located in the WA-374-P permit area. Chevron Australia is the
operator with a 50 percent interest. Shell Development (Australia) Pty Ltd and
Mobil Australia Resources Company each hold a 25 percent interest. 

The initial Gorgon Project development, in northwestern Australia, will include
a three-train, 15 million-metric-tons-per-year liquefied natural gas facility
and a domestic gas plant. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

Exxon is making a bold statement about getting into the exploration and production business, but it's hard to tell if this will start a wave of acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Natural gas is trading at historical lows. Exxon is making a bullish statement about natgas prospects, and if others agree, you could see more deals like this, but only time will tell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ryan Vlastelica, Phil Wahba and Ernest Scheyder; Compiled by Tiffany Wu)&lt;/p&gt;

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and XTO Energy Inc. announced today an
all-stock transaction valued at $41 billion. The agreement, which is subject to
XTO stockholder approval and regulatory clearance, will enhance ExxonMobil`s
position in the development of unconventional natural gas and oil resources. 

Under the terms of the agreement, approved by the boards of directors of both
companies, ExxonMobil has agreed to issue 0.7098 common shares for each common
share of XTO. This represents a 25 percent premium to XTO stockholders. The
transaction value includes $10 billion of existing XTO debt and is based on the
closing share prices of ExxonMobil and XTO on December 11, 2009. 

"We are pleased that ExxonMobil and XTO have reached this agreement," said Rex
W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation. 

"XTO is a leading U.S. unconventional natural gas producer, with an outstanding
resource base, strong technical expertise and highly skilled employees. XTO`s
strengths, together with ExxonMobil`s advanced R and operational capabilities,
global scale and financial capacity, should enable development of additional
supplies of unconventional oil and gas resources, benefiting consumers both here
in the United States and around the world." 

Tillerson said the agreement is good news for the United States economy and
energy security, as it will enhance opportunities for job creation and
investment in the production of America`s own clean-burning natural gas
resources. 

XTO`s resource base is the equivalent of 45 trillion cubic feet of gas and
includes shale gas, tight gas, coal bed methane and shale oil. These will
complement ExxonMobil`s holdings in the United States, Canada, Germany, Poland,
Hungary and Argentina. 

Following the transaction closing, ExxonMobil intends to establish a new
upstream organization to manage global development and production of
unconventional resources, enabling the rapid development and deployment of
technologies and operating practices to increase production and maximize
resource value. The new organization will be located in Fort Worth, Texas, in
XTO`s current offices. 

Bob R. Simpson, chairman and founder of XTO, said that over the company`s
23-year history, XTO has developed technical expertise and has assembled a
substantial, high-quality and diverse resource base in producing basins across
the United States. 

"XTO has a proven ability to profitably and consistently grow production and
reserves in unconventional resources," said Simpson. "As the world`s leading
energy company, ExxonMobil will build on our success and open new opportunities
for the development of natural gas and oil resources on a global basis." 

Tillerson said the agreement is part of an ongoing, disciplined evaluation of
timely investment opportunities to create value for shareholders, and to help
meet long-term global energy demand growth. The agreement is consistent with
ExxonMobil`s business model which is focused on sustainable, long-term value
creation. 

Completion of the transaction is expected in the second quarter of 2010. In
connection with the transaction, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. are acting as
financial advisors to ExxonMobil and Barclays Capital Inc. and Jefferies &amp;
Company Inc. are acting as financial advisors to XTO.

&lt;p&gt;HR Outsourcing Provider Brings in One of the Most Sought-After Directors in
Silicon Valley
SAN LEANDRO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
TriNet, a provider of payroll, benefits and human resources outsourcing services
to small businesses, today announced the appointment of Ken Goldman to the PEO`s
six-member board of directors. Goldman, currently the CFO of network security
provider Fortinet, brings more than 35 years of financial, operational and
business management experience to TriNet`s board. 

"Ken`s addition to our board is a big win for TriNet, as he is one of the most
sought-after directors in Silicon Valley," said Martin Babinec, TriNet`s founder
and chairman. "Ken`s track record in both operating CFO and board roles has been
distinguished by his ability to help a number of high-growth companies navigate
toward long-term success. He is a great fit to enter at this stage of TriNet's
growth and will provide a lasting contribution to our company." 

Goldman joins current TriNet directors Babinec, H. Raymond Bingham, David C.
Hodgson, Wayne Lowell and Burton M. Goldfield, TriNet`s President and CEO. 

"TriNet is an important player in the developing PEO industry and there`s
potential to significantly expand market share," Goldman said. "The active
engagement of TriNet`s board and the commitment displayed by the management team
were also key drivers behind my decision to join the organization." 

Goldman has been with Fortinet since 2007, and prior to that, held CFO positions
at Siebel Systems, Excite@Home, Sybase, Cypress Semiconductor and VLSI
Technology. Goldman helped grow VLSI`s revenues from $0 to $500 million in nine
years and helped take the company public in 1983. He joined Sybase shortly after
its IPO and helped the company reach $1 billion in revenue. Goldman also took
Excite@Home public, in 1997, while increasing its revenues to $150 million. He
managed 500 employees while at Siebel, overseeing IT, HR, Sales, Legal and
Finance, for six years, until the close of Oracle's acquisition in January 2006.


"We`re delivering on both organic and inorganic growth and Ken`s experience in
growth-oriented companies and public offerings align well with our future
plans," said Goldfield. "We`re also laser-focused on delivering solutions to
address the unique needs of vertical markets, and Ken`s insight will be valuable
to further distance ourselves from the industry standard of a one-size-fits-all
offering." 

Goldman earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Cornell
University and a master's in business administration from Harvard. He is a
member and the former president of The Financial Executive Institute, Santa
Clara chapter, and was a four-year member of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board Advisory Council. He serves on the boards of other public and private
companies and is a Trustee of Cornell.

&lt;p&gt;PITTSFORD, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Infinite Group, Inc. (OTCBB:IMCI) today announced a partnership with Information
Strategies, Inc. (InfoStrat) of Washington, D.C. that will extend the firm`s
implementation capabilities for the Microsoft Stimulus360 solution. Microsoft
Stimulus360 helps public sector agencies track, measure, and share information
about federal stimulus programs through easy-to-use graphical dashboards and
maps, and the partnership between IGI and InfoStrat will deliver increased
reporting accuracy and uniformity for public sector clients. 

Infinite Group and Information Strategies will assist state, city, county and
municipal governments with compliance and reporting requirements under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), commonly referred to as "the
Stimulus." Numerous Federal agencies are responsible for distributing ARRA
dollars to states and local governments, and each Federal agency can have unique
funding allocations, deadlines, and program requirements. These Federal Stimulus
Program reporting requirements are often complex and can change rapidly, making
accurate reports a challenge. Stimulus360 helps these agencies keep pace with
the ongoing changes in reporting requirements to ensure compliance, helping
local governments make the most of Federal stimulus funds. InfoStrat developed
Stimulus360 for Microsoft in close collaboration with state and local clients
around the country. 

"Stimulus360 is all about making sure that public sector agencies are in line
with the most current reporting requirements for ARRA dollars," said Michael S.
Smith, President and CEO of Infinite Group, Inc. "Our partnership with InfoStrat
means that we can deliver Stimulus360 solutions with more accurate and
highly-compliant reporting, thereby eliminating red tape and helping the country
put the Stimulus into action. Our team is currently implementing Stimulus360 for
the State of Mississippi." 

"As Microsoft Certified Partners, IGI and InfoStrat take pride in bringing the
capability of the Stimulus360 package to better serve our clients in meeting the
complex ARRA reporting requirements," said Jim Townsend, President of
Information Strategies, Inc. "So far we have fifteen clients who collectively
report on hundreds of grants and billions of dollars in Federal funding."

Results presented at CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS)
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced results from studies evaluating
neratinib (HKI-272), an investigational, orally administered, pan-ErbB
inhibitor, in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2, also
known as ErbB2) positive breast cancer at the 2009 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast
Cancer Symposium (SABCS). Neratinib is now part of Pfizer`s expanded oncology
portfolio, following the recent acquisition of Wyeth. 

"Data gathered from ongoing clinical trials of neratinib, both as a monotherapy
and in combination, continue to support its evaluation in HER2 positive
metastatic breast cancer," said Maria Koehler MD, PhD, Vice President, Women`s
Cancers Strategy for Pfizer Oncology. "We look forward to studying neratinib
further in an effort to help seek to provide HER2 targeted therapies for
patients battling this aggressive disease." 

Breast cancer of the HER2 positive type accounts for 20 to 30 percent of all
breast cancers and is identified by the overexpression of the HER2 protein in
tumor tissue. HER2 positive breast cancer is more aggressive than other breast
cancers and has an increased likelihood of metastasizing. 

Neratinib Shows Activity in Phase 1/2 Study

This ongoing, Phase 1/2, open-label, two-part study evaluates the safety and
efficacy of neratinib in combination with weekly paclitaxel in patients with
solid tumors and HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (Poster #5081). Part 1
of the study showed that a standard oral dose of 240 mg of neratinib daily can
be given with 80 mg/m2 of paclitaxel weekly to patients with solid tumors. In
part 2, only patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (newly
diagnosed or following up to three recurrences) received therapy to evaluate the
overall response rate (ORR) of this combination of neratinib and paclitaxel. 

As of October 19, 2009, an ORR (including both complete and partial responses)
of 69 percent (n=68) was observed, from a total of 99 patients with HER2
positive breast cancer who were evaluable for efficacy analysis in part 2 of
this ongoing study. In the first-line metastatic setting of 33 patients, the ORR
was 70 percent (n=23). Overall response rates observed in patients with
hormone-receptor positive tumors, prior exposure to endocrine therapy, and
previous taxane therapy, were 84 percent (n=46), 80 percent (n=31) and 76
percent (n=47), respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for all
patients with HER2 positive breast cancer was estimated at 52.1 weeks (95
percent C.I. 47.7-NE). 

In part 2 of the study, preliminary clinical data indicate the combination of
neratinib 240 mg and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 was tolerable, with a similar toxicity
profile to each drug given as monotherapy. The most common treatment-emergent
adverse events occurring in &#8805;20 percent of patients included diarrhea,
neutropenia, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, leucopenia, infection (any site),
anemia, rash, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia and pyrexia. Diarrhea of any
grade was the most common adverse event (in 91 percent of patients), and
presented as a grade 3/4 adverse event in 28 percent of patients. Diarrhea was
generally observed early (median onset, three days after the first dose of
neratinib; median duration, 30 days). Fifteen and 37 patients required dose
reductions of neratinib and paclitaxel, respectively, because of adverse events,
and a total of 49 patients discontinued the study. Most study discontinuations
(39 patients) were secondary to disease progression. Three patients discontinued
therapy due to adverse events (renal failure, left ventricular ejection fraction
reduction, and mouth ulceration). 

Phase 2 Safety Results of Neratinib Monotherapy in Patients with HER2 Positive
Breast Cancer

A Phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral neratinib (240 mg
daily) as a monotherapy in patients with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer
assigned to two cohorts: those with prior trastuzumab treatment (cohort 1) and
those with no prior trastuzumab treatment (cohort 2)(Poster #5096). The new
analysis presented at SABCS focused on the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular
safety profiles of neratinib seen in this study. 

Diarrhea that developed in patients treated with single agent neratinib had
early onset (median time to onset three days), but its frequency and severity
decreased with time on neratinib. Neratinib-related diarrhea was managed with
standard supportive therapy and dose interruptions and/or reductions.
Anti-diarrheal medications for supportive therapy were used by 85 percent of
patients in the study. Dose reductions to manage diarrhea were applied in 30
percent of patients in cohort 1 and in 7 percent of patients in cohort 2. One
patient with prior trastuzumab therapy discontinued treatment as a result of
diarrhea. 

There was no statistically significant difference in PFS for patients with a
maximum grade 3/4 diarrhea event versus patients with no diarrhea or a maximum
grade 1/2 diarrhea event. 

Vomiting, any grade, occurred in 29 percent of patients and was managed with the
use of anti-emetic medications and dose modifications. 

In this study, neratinib was not associated with clinically significant
cardiotoxicity; no patients had congestive heart failure. 

Additional Neratinib Data Presentations

Two additional neratinib studies were presented at SABCS 2009. These studies
include:

* Safety of Neratinib (HKI-272) in Combination with Capecitabine in Patients
with Solid Tumors: A Phase 1/2 Study (Poster #5108) 
* Safety and Efficacy of Neratinib (HKI-272) in Combination with Vinorelbine in
ErbB2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer (Poster #5095)

About Neratinib

Neratinib is an investigational, orally administered, irreversible inhibitor of
the ErbB1 (EGFR), ErbB2 (HER2) and ErbB4 (HER4) kinases. Neratinib permanently
inactivates the ErbB kinases. Inhibited HER2 activities include downstream
signal transduction events and cell cycle regulatory pathways, such as the cell
division cycle, ultimately resulting in decreased cell proliferation. 

ErbB2 belongs to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which has been
implicated in a variety of human cancers, including cancers of the breast. HER2
positive breast cancer is identified by the overexpression of human epidermal
growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) protein in tumor tissue and results in an
increased rate of cell proliferation.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
In connection with the New York Times` recent coverage of hormone therapy1,
Pfizer Inc. today released important facts and context to respond to the
newspaper`s account. Pfizer believes the coverage is based on a misleading and
selective reading of both the science and history of hormone therapy (HT)
medicines. 

Premarin (conjugated estrogens tablets USP) and Prempro (conjugated
estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets), which are approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), have brought relief to tens of millions of women
for decades. The FDA has stated that HT has a well-established safety profile
and is among the most studied classes of medicines. In addition, the FDA states
that HT "is the most effective FDA approved medicine for relief of hot flashes,
night sweats or vaginal dryness." 

A full, fair and accurate report on HT would show: 

1.FDA-approved hormone therapy is an important treatment option for certain
post-menopausal women.

First and most importantly, doctors have been prescribing HT medicines for the
treatment of menopausal symptoms (e.g., hot flashes and night sweats), as well
as for the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis, for decades. As FDA
itself wrote in a news release following the Women`s Health Initiative study
(WHI): "Because there are few alternatives for the relief of severe vasomotor
symptoms and severe symptoms of vulvar vaginal atrophy, estrogens and estrogens
with progestins have an important role in women's health." The FDA has regularly
and thoroughly reviewed the benefits and risks of these medicines, and has
consistently determined that the benefits outweigh the risks for the appropriate
woman. 

2.Wyeth has acted responsibly by studying its hormone therapy medicines closely,
including the risk of breast cancer, for decades.

HT medicines are among the most thoroughly studied drugs. Wyeth conducted or
supported more than 180 studies covering 180,000 women that examined the risks
and benefits of hormone therapy (including the WHI), 19 of which expressly
examined hormone therapy and breast cancer risk. The first such study was
published in 1959, and these studies were published in peer-reviewed medical
journals and were consistent with the then-current medical science. 

The most definitive study on hormone therapy and breast cancer, the WHI,
reaffirmed the increased relative risk of breast cancer that was already in the
labeling for Premarin and Prempro. 

3.The labels for Premarin and Prempro, which are the official, FDA-approved
description of their benefits and risks relied upon by doctors, are and have
been accurate and science-based, and have warned of the risk of breast cancer
for many years.

Guidance to use Premarin and Prempro at the lowest dose and for the shortest
duration needed to meet treatment goals has been included in the labels of these
medicines for decades. 

Breast cancer risks were discussed at least nine times in the 1995 launch label
for Prempro, and have been included in the Premarin label for decades. The label
and the Physicians` Desk Reference in which it is included carry the most
authoritative information on a medicine`s risks and benefits. 

Moreover, commenting on the Prempro labeling before the WHI, Janet Woodcock,
then-director of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told the NIH on
October 24, 2002: "What was known at the time about benefits and risks was
discussed within that label." 

After the WHI study, Wyeth proactively updated its label and worked with the FDA
to develop labeling that reflected the medical community's new understanding of
risks associated with hormone therapy. The FDA wrote in a January 8, 2003, press
release: "The revisions for the Premarin, Prempro, and Premphase labeling build
on revisions to the labeling that Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (the products'
manufacturer) made in August 2002, shortly after the release of the findings
from WHI. Since August, FDA has carefully reviewed the data from the WHI study
and has worked with Wyeth to develop the new labeling approved today for these
products." 

Similarly, in response to numerous studies that Wyeth and others conducted that
reported increased risks of endometrial carcinoma associated with Premarin in
the 1970s, the company included a prominent warning of those risks in the
Premarin label seven months before the FDA issued class labeling. 

About Premarin and Prempro

Both Premarin (conjugated estrogens tablets USP), approved by the FDA in 1942,
and Prempro (conjugated estrogens/medroxy-progesterone acetate tablets USP),
approved by the FDA in 1994, treat moderate to severe symptoms of menopause and
help reduce the chances of osteoporosis.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Juku service in China did indeed steal code from Plurk, a popular Twitter rival in Asia, the software giant admitted on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plurk alleged this week that about 80 percent of Juku's code base was stolen from Plurk. Shortly after the accusations appeared on Plurk's blog, Microsoft suspended the Juku service and said it was investigating the matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it says that a vendor working with Microsoft's MSN China joint venture acknowledged that a portion of the code that it provided was indeed copied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was apologetic in its note. "When we hire an outside company to do development work, our practice is to include strong language in our contract that clearly states the company must provide work that does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We are a company that respects intellectual property and it was never our intent to have a site that was not respectful of the work that others in the industry have done," Microsoft said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has worked hard over the years to try to prevent the piracy of its own software. China, where the Juku service was developed, is one of the biggest consumers of pirated Microsoft software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it is suspending the Juku service indefinitely and that it assumes responsibility for the situation. It apologized to Plurk and said it would reach out to the company directly to explain what happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said it will be working with MSN China to examine development practices and applications provided by vendors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plurk has not responded on its blog to Microsoft's latest statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AYNA SAN FRANCISCO, Peru (Reuters) - Peru's civil war is over but fighters from the Shining Path rebel group have joined the country's cocaine trade, turning a lawless bundle of valleys into a security problem for President Alan Garcia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A civil war killed around 70,000 people in the 1980s and 1990s when Shining Path's Maoist guerrillas nearly toppled the Peruvian state and both sides committed rights atrocities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rebels mostly disbanded after the capture of their leader, Abimael Guzman, yet violence is escalating again in the rugged and volatile Ene and Apurimac River Valleys, known as the VRAE, in Peru's southern jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has become the most densely planted coca-growing belt in the world, according to the United Nations, and police say much of the cocaine leaving these fertile valleys is exported with help from a remnant band of Shining Path fighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia, whose first term as president in the 1980s was haunted by the rise of the insurgency, has mobilized the army to try to eliminate one of Shining Path's last footholds and prevent its influence from spreading again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the military push has been marred by setbacks. Rebels working with cocaine smuggling gangs have killed 40 poorly equipped soldiers and police over the last year in the VRAE and shot down helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The army has suffered embarrassing ambushes, traffickers buy lenient treatment from judges and mayors in local towns defend growers of coca, the leaf used to make cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia is unpopular in a region that has long felt ignored by the governing elites 400 miles away in Lima, the capital, on the other side of the Andes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alan Garcia has never come here like a man and kept his word," said Doris Medina, 33, whose father was murdered by rebels at the height of the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He has turned his back on the VRAE again," she says while walking through the small farm where her mother plants coca, the main ingredient for cocaine, as well as coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medina's father belonged to one of the peasant patrols that former President Alberto Fujimori set up in the 1990s to help a weak army stop the insurgents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medina credits Fujimori, who was later convicted of human rights crimes, for capturing Guzman and other Shining Path leaders, but holdouts from the war are still on the loose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Col. Elmer Mendoza of Peru's counter-terrorism police said that as the army tries to round up 300-600 rebels in the VRAE, its hands have been tied by human rights protections passed after Fujimori left office to limit the use of deadly force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small farmers here say the government has demonized them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We aren't terrorists or traffickers. We are farmers. I fought against the terrorists," Maria Palomino, 59, whose husband was in a peasant patrol and was killed by insurgents, said while chatting in her first language of Quechua with farm hands picking coca on her daughter's plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETTY CASH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widespread poverty and a history of underinvestment by the government in roads, education and healthcare mean that coca has long been a fallback for people like Medina and Palomino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It grows quickly, can be harvested four times a year, and functions as a kind of parallel currency, used to pay farm hands or augment income between coffee and cacao harvests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Coca is our petty cash," said Medina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although some of the coca is chewed as a mild stimulant or brewed for tea, as it has been for centuries, experts say up to 90 percent of it winds up being refined into cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations and private aid groups are trying to untangle the culture of coca and violence in this region by working with small farmers to plant alternative crops, but people tend to keep a hand in coca even after they move into the legitimate economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medina is the quality control inspector at the CACVRA agricultural cooperative, which exports organic coffee and cacao raised by its 2,000 members to the United States and Europe. Palomino's daughter works for a company that exports cacao. Her grandchildren are going to university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medina encourages farmers to increase their incomes by improving the quality of their beans and marketing the coffee as organic, fair-trade, high-altitude, or grown by women. Yet, like a fifth of the farmers in her cooperative, her mother still plants coca to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca also distorts the local farm economy. Planters complain that during harvests farm hands charge double or triple the normal daily wage to pick coffee because they can make so much more working coca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The increases in labor prices have been severe, and the only way to respond is to sell higher-value coffee," said Illich Nicolas Gavilan, who manages the cooperative. "The issue of coca is incredibly complex."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enter the VRAE, you must bounce along a dirt road for four hours, snaking around hairpin turns that lurch precariously over steep gorges blanketed by rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, shotgun-toting peasant patrols stop cars to charge a toll and anti-drug police search vehicles and jot down the names of everybody going into the area. It is about six hours by car from the city of Huamanga, the Shining Path's birthplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VRAE runs across four of Peru's provinces, a cause of administrative headaches as the government tries to implement a security, development and anti-drug strategy. And the efforts are hurt by some public officials in the pay of traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have to be sincere, the corruption that exists in this area at some point affects everything," said Luis Guevara Ortega, an appointee who represents Garcia's office in the Sivia district of the VRAE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics the government has bitten off more than it can chew in the VRAE, and members of peasant patrols on the front line say there is no incentive to really go after the Shining Path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Garcia guaranteed us life insurance policies for our families, we could go in and wipe out the Shining Path in two months, but why are we going to risk our lives for nothing?" said Reinaldo Silva, a patrol leader in the town of Pichari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Kieran Murray)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AYNA SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A growing cocaine trade and a remnant group of Shining Path rebels in Peru's Ene and Apurimac River Valleys, known as the VRAE, have become President Alan Garcia's toughest domestic issue.&lt;/p&gt;

I have to be sincere, the corruption that exists in this area at some point affects everything, said Luis Guevara Ortega, an appointee who represents Garcia's office in the Sivia district of the VRAE.          Critics the government has bitten off more than it can chew in the VRAE, and members of peasant patrols on the front line say there is no incentive to really go after the Shining Path.          If Garcia guaranteed us life insurance policies for our families, we could go in and wipe out the Shining Path in two months, but why are we going to risk our lives for nothing? said Reinaldo Silva, a patrol leader in the town of Pichari.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second largest oil company in the U.S., would want to "move the needle" if it made a major push into U.S. shale gas, a sector that Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) put in the spotlight with its planned acquisition of XTO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unveiled on Monday, the largest energy company's planned $30 billion purchase of XTO Energy Inc XTO.N serves as a exclamation point for the argument that natural gas is the hydrocarbon of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Chevron has not clearly spelled out its approach to the fast-growing, but technically challenging, extraction of natural gas from shale rock, executives at Chevron have dropped some hints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cracking shale to release huge amounts of gas is now widely done, even if it is largely the preserve companies other than the majors, and demand has not yet risen to meet supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly, who retires in two weeks, has said some of the experience gained with its multiple well drilling program off Thailand could be applied to shale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So I feel pretty confident it can be done," O'Reilly said of shale gas on a conference call in late October to discuss quarterly results. "But we have to be able to do it at scale to move the needle. And that's what we would propose to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington also used the same 'move the needle' phrasing when asked about acquisition strategy in general, telling an investors' conference that Chevron had no interest in 'small' deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yarrington also said that stable oil and gas prices in the latter half of 2009 had set the table for energy deals generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Youngberg, analyst at brokerage Edward Jones, said a Chevron needle-mover on shale would likely involve a corporate takeover. "You probably couldn't cobble something together from a series of smaller acreage acquisitions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE GAS IN PIPELINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He highlighted, however, the difference between the many Chevron oil and gas projects in the works and Exxon's own thinner pipeline to explain why Exxon had more reason to do a deal than Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon, lately, their biggest strategy has been buying back shares -- you know liquidating itself basically," Youngberg said. "That's not a long-term strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts noted the Exxon share sell-off on Monday may give rivals pause when considering a deal the size of XTO, which ranks by value around the likes of EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N), Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) and Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N), particularly given the many smaller players to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Tudor, Pickering and Holt said that adding a "consolidation twist" meant their top recommendations among gas company stocks now include Southwestern Energy Co (SWN.N), with a $14 billion market capitalization, and Petrohawk Energy Corp (HK.N) and Range Resources Corp (RRC.N), both valued around half that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron already has drilled development wells in the Haynesville shale in Louisiana. It also has gas assets in Colorado, where it is building capacity to produce 60 million cubic feet per day, though it has slowed down development there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the need for skills can drive an acquisition too, and part of what analysts liked about XTO is that Exxon has shale assets globally XTO could help tap. As for Chevron, only last week Poland granted the company a license to seek shale gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons  Co analyst Robert Kessler saw Exxon's deal within a broader trend toward majors buying smaller players, which also is what many investment bankers believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the respective strategic directions of ConocoPhillips,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(COP.N), which is shedding assets and Occidental Petroleum Corp,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(OXY.N) which is focused on conventional gas production, Chevron is left as the top candidate to do deals among big U.S. oil concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company has healthy finances, and has made no significant acquisition since its $20 billion deal for Unocal in 2005. Also, incoming CEO John Watson knows something of big acquisitions, having led Texaco's integration after Chevron bought it for $38.6 billion in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokeswoman on Tuesday declined to comment on its plans for shale gas beyond what the CEO said in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Tatusko, chief investment officer at Westport Resources in Connecticut, which manages $700 million of assets including big U.S. energy stocks, wonders if Chevron might want more oil assets instead, given the current weak pricing for gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The spread between crude and natural gas is so wide that acquiring crude assets makes a lot of sense, but I don't know why we haven't seen much of it," Tatusko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chevron's larger rival is taking a long-term view of gas, and the potential for U.S. shale plays to provide the largest energy-consuming country with more home produced energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For years, the shale plays were viewed as too small and insignificant," Youngberg said. "Now they're not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp placed a $31 billion bet that demand for natural gas will skyrocket, but the U.S. oil major may now be a bigger target for critics who say the special drilling techniques used to tap into the fields can contaminate water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Exxon said it plans to buy XTO Energy Inc in an all-stock deal. The combined companies will have 8 million acres of shale gas and other types of unconventional resources, the largest in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unconventional resources require advanced drilling and production techniques like hydraulic fracturing. In a so-called "frac job," water, sand and other chemicals are pumped at high pressure deep underground to create fissures in shale and other rock that allow natural gas to flow out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the big oil companies have such large capitalization, they can push shale development along in ways that smaller companies could not," said Bruce Baizel, an attorney with Earthworks' Oil and Gas Accountability Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With development picking up, you can expect to see more conflict between the companies drilling and those people that live on top of the shale," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say the drilling chemicals have polluted aquifers in Pennsylvania and Colorado and can cause cancer and other serious illnesses, but there has never been a documented case of ground water contamination because of hydraulic fracturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONCERNS "UTTER NONSENSE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil and gas industry says hydraulic fracturing is well regulated and safe, a position that Exxon says it supports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's just utter nonsense," Mike Breard, energy analyst with Hodges Capital Management, said. "The industry has been safely drilling these well for years. There are thousands of them. And they are so deep, you drill below the aquifers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, U.S. Representative Edward Markey, chairman of the House Energy and Environment Subcommittee, said on Tuesday he plans to hold hearings on the deal next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This proposed merger also raises a number of issues with respect to the future direction of the U.S. domestic oil and gas industry, competition within the industry, and the potential environmental impact of increased unconventional natural gas development," Markey said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARCELLUS SHALE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myron Arnowitt, Pennsylvania director of Clean Water Action, an environmental group, said Exxon's planned deal signals the major's interest in drilling for gas in Pennsylvania, where the Marcellus Shale is believed to contain enough gas to meet total U.S. needs for a decade or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a little scary," he said. "We know they are not going to be drilling just 12 wells a year, they are going to be doing a lot more than that. I don't think the state can handle what it's got right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XTO has about 280,000 acres in the Marcellus, while Exxon has about 20,000 acres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even environmentalists agree that large companies like Exxon have enough money to drill in a responsible manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of the majors are willing to spend the money and try and do things in a better way than some of the smaller companies, Earthworks' Baizel, said. "In that respect, it may reduce some of the conflict."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydraulic fracturing was pioneered in the United States to develop the Barnett Shale in north Texas, but Exxon is snapping up unconventional oil and gas acreage in Germany, Poland, Canada, Hungary and Argentina, the company said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jon Hurdle in Philadelphia)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Dec 15 (Reuters) - Hearings planned by a U.S.
lawmaker to look into Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) takeover of
XTO Energy Inc XTO.N would pose little risk to the completion
of the merger, an analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Rep. Ed Markey, chairman of the House of Representatives
Energy and Environment Subcommittee said on Tuesday he intends
to hold hearings early next year on the merger which would
create the largest U.S. natural gas producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Markey will look into competition issues of the roughly $30
billion in stock merger and environmental issues resulting from
producing natural gas from shale-rock formations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But an analyst said the lawmaker had little power to slow
the deal, expected to close in the second quarter next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From a market competition point of view, it's more the
Federal Trade Commission's work to review the deal," said Tim
Evans, energy analyst for Citi Futures Perspective in New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and XTO combined to produce a little more than 4
percent of daily U.S. natural gas production through the first
six months of 2009, according to the Natural Gas Supply
Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I just don't see that as a big roadblock to the deal,
Evans said. The FTC has generally gone after deals that would
create much larger market shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hearings may focus attention on environmental issues of
producing gas from shale-rock. But those are industry-wide
issues, not unique to the companies in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; XTO is a leading developer of unconventional resources
including shale oil and gas or gas trapped in sands with low
permeability that require advanced drilling techniques to
recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon did not immediately respond to questions about
Markey's planned hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Timothy Gardner in Washington and Anna Driver

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Exxon Acquiring XTO Energy

With a bullish view on natural gas prospects, the world`s largest publicly
traded oil company ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) will buy XTO Energy (NYSE:
XTO) in an all-stock deal worth $31 billion, excluding debt. 

The transaction is valued at $41 billion, including about $10 billion in XTO
debt, and is based on the Dec 11 closing share prices in both the companies.
Completion of the transaction is expected in the second quarter of 2010. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Exxon has agreed to issue 0.7098 common shares
for each common share of XTO, representing a 25% premium to XTO shareholders.
The agreement is approved by the boards of directors of both the companies. 

The agreement will enhance Exxon`s position in the development of unconventional
natural gas and oil resources and is subject to XTO stockholder approval and
regulatory clearance. 

XTO`s outstanding unconventional natural gas resource base, along with Exxon`s
advanced R and operational capabilities, global scale and financial capacity
should enable development of additional supplies of unconventional oil and gas
resources. This will benefit domestic as well as international consumers. 

Following this deal, Exxon will gain a major grip over North America's newest
energy discoveries as it looks forward to the growth of natural gas in expanding
its share of the world's largest energy market. After closing of the deal, Exxon
said it will establish a new organization to manage global development and
production of unconventional resources. 

We believe Exxon`s decision to purchase XTO will definitely prompt its peers
such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), BP Plc (NYSE: BP) and Royal Dutch Shell
(NYSE: RDS.A) to move forward with similar deals.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Citi Nears Deal to Repay TARP

Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) is almost close to finalizing a deal with the U.S.
government to start repaying the bailout money it has received from the
government for its participation in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) at
the height of the credit crisis last year. 

Citigroup is expected to infuse capital of over $10 billion through common stock
offering to repay the TARP funds. Citigroup had received $45 billion of TARP
funds last year. Later, around $25 billion of that was converted into common
stock, representing around 34% of its stake held by taxpayers. Citigroup has
remaining $20 billion in TARP funds to repay. 

Additionally, the future of the insurance policy that guarantees over $300
billion of Citigroup`s troubled assets provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation needs to be decided. The payment for that insurance was made by
Citigroup through preferred stock offering to the government. The government is
also expected to disclose its plan for the sale of its 34% stake. 

Last week, Citigroup`s Chairman has revealed that the company is in a position
to be able to repay TARP funds, but is waiting for the government`s approval.
Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) announced last Wednesday that it had completed
repaying its $45 billion of TARP funds following its $19.3 billion of equity
offering last week. This has increased the repayment pressure on Citigroup and
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE: WFC), both of which have also received significant
amounts of TARP funds. In June, major banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
(NYSE: GS) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) and others paid back their TARP
funds. 

It is expected that the government would sell a part of its 34% holdings in
Citigroup. However, a partial repayment would not free the bank from the
government`s control and pay restrictions.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has withdrawn JP Morgan Commercial Real Estate Loan
Administration's (CRELA) rating of 'Acceptable' as a construction loan servicer
for commercial real estate loans. 

CRELA management has informed Fitch that it no longer wishes to participate in
Fitch's construction loan servicer rating program; therefore, Fitch will no
longer receive information from CRELA about its servicing operation.
Furthermore, as CRELA does not currently service construction loans in
securitized transactions and does not plan to do so in the near future, Fitch
has determined that the benefit to structured finance investors of maintaining
the servicer rating is minimal. Therefore, Fitch has decided to withdraw the
servicer rating. 

In June 2009, Fitch changed its rating scale for its construction loan servicer
ratings to the numeric scale used for CMBS servicer ratings. Servicer ratings
are based on the methodology described in Fitch's reports 'U.S. Commercial
Mortgage Servicer Rating Criteria,' dated June 19, 2009, and 'Global Rating
Criteria for Structured Finance Servicers' dated Sept. 30, 2009, available on
Fitch's web site at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 

Fitch rates commercial construction loan servicers on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1
being the highest rating. Within each of these rating levels, Fitch further
differentiates ratings by plus (+) and minus (-) as well as the flat rating.

&lt;p&gt;House Members Express "Concern" About Oil Giant`s Effort to Use Trade Policy to
Deny Due Process in Environmental Lawsuit
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Chevron has been dealt a major setback in the Congress as more than two dozen
representatives, led by Rep. Linda Sanchez and including powerful senior
members, have signed a letter urging that the United States Trade Representative
reject efforts by the oil giant to cancel Ecuador`s trade preferences. Chevron
has pressured the USTR and Congress for years to revoke or curtail Ecuador`s
preferences in retaliation for a lawsuit brought by 30,000 Ecuadorian citizens
alleging that Chevron dumped billions of gallons of toxic waste into the
rainforest over a period of more than 20 years. 

Separately, a one-year extension of the trade preferences for Ecuador were
approved in the House on Dec. 14 on a voice vote - the fourth consecutive year
Chevron`s lobbying effort against Ecuador appears to have failed. The Senate is
expected to formally approve the measure by the end of the year. 

The letter to the USTR, sent December 15, expresses concern about Chevron`s
efforts to influence a private litigation which originally was filed in 1993 in
U.S. federal court by several Ecuadorian indigenous tribes and farmer
communities, but was sent to Ecuador at Chevron`s request in 2002. 

"We urge you to reject Chevron`s request and reaffirm that U.S. trade agreements
will not be used as leverage to interfere in private claims progressing through
Ecuador`s legal process," the representatives wrote in the letter. 

Among the 26 Members taking this strong stand with Rep. Sanchez were: the Chief
Democratic Deputy Whip and Vice-Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee`s
Trade Subcommittee, Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL); the Chairman of the Human Rights
Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. William Delahunt (D-MA);
eight Members of the Ways &amp; Means Committee, including the chairman of its
Oversight Subcommittee, Rep. John Lewis (D-GA); and eight members of the
Appropriations Committee, three of whom also oversee State Department matters
and Foreign Operations. Judiciary and Rules Committee Members also were among
those lending their support. 

Other members signing the letter were Reps.: Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), James
McGovern (D-MA), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Danny Davis
(D-IL), Sam Farr (D-CA), Steve Israel (D-NY), Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), Brian
Higgins (D-NY), Phil Hare (D-IL), Hank Johnson (D-GA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Betty
McCollum (D-MN), Michael Michaud (D-ME), Jim McDermott (D-MA), James Moran
(D-VA), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Mike Quigley (D-IL), John Olver (D-MA),
Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA), Betty Sutton (D-OH), and Fortney "Pete" Stark
(D-CA). 

Chevron is charged in the lawsuit with dumping more than 18 billion gallons of
toxic waste into Amazon waterways and abandoning more than 900 unlined waste
pits when it operated a large oil concession in Ecuador's Amazon from 1964 to
1990. A team of independent, court-appointed experts has estimated that at least
1,401 individuals have died from cancer related to exposure to the contamination
and determined that damages could reach as high as $27.3 billion, according to a
4,000-page report turned over to the court last year. 

The members of Congress write: "We do not prejudge the outcome of the case, nor
do we take a position on the litigation. We do believe, however, that tens of
thousands of indigenous residents of Ecuador who have brought this case deserve
their day in court. We further believe that the USTR should not interfere in an
ongoing judicial matter, particularly when this case involves environmental,
health, and human rights issues that have a regional, and even global,
importance." 

Even though Chevron filed 14 expert affidavits in U.S. federal court praising
Ecuador's court system to get the case transferred, once the evidence in the
Ecuador trial pointed to the company`s culpability it began a lobbying campaign
in Washington to have Ecuador`s preferences canceled. Chevron`s lobbyists have
made misleading assertions to the Congress that the company was granted a
release from claims after a limited environmental clean-up in the mid-1990s,
even though the release does not apply to the private claims in the lawsuit and
the clean-up itself was fraudulent, according to the plaintiffs. 

The ultimate goal of Chevron`s Washington lobbying campaign was to pressure
Ecuador`s President, Rafael Correa, to interfere in his country`s judiciary and
quash the case as a way to maintain more than 300,000 jobs in Ecuador that are
dependent on the preferences, according to Steven Donziger, an American legal
advisor to the plaintiffs in the legal case. 

"Chevron was trying to pressure Ecuador`s President to violate his own
Constitution and interfere in a private litigation to benefit the company in its
battle with indigenous groups decimated by Chevron`s pollution," said Donziger. 

Chevron's lobbying campaign has sparked strong reactions across Capitol Hill and
in the media. 

On November 17, in testimony before the trade subcommittee of the Ways and Means
Committee, Rep. Sanchez called Chevron`s lobbying "extortion" and said,
"Apparently, if it can't get the outcome it wants from the Ecuadorian court
system, Chevron will use the US government to deny trade benefits until Ecuador
cries uncle." 

A recent editorial in the Los Angeles Times editorial blasted Chevron, noting
that "If ... Chevron has its way, Congress will instead punish Ecuador because
its government refuses to halt a private lawsuit against the oil giant.... to
force a favorable outcome in a private claim would justly generate international
outrage." 

In 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama and Sen. Patrick Leahy wrote a similar letter
to the USTR asking it to reject Chevron`s petition, which it did. 

Experts believe the Ecuador contamination - which covers an area the size of
Rhode Island -- is the worst oil-related disaster on earth and would take at
least two decades to properly clean. A final judgment in the case is expected
next year.

Robbins Umeda LLP has commenced an investigation into possible breaches of
fiduciary duty and other violations of state law by members of the Board of

to merge the companies on Monday, December 14, 2009. Under the terms of the
merger agreement, Exxon has agreed to exchange 0.7098 common shares for each
common share of XTO. This exchange ratio is based on the closing share prices of
Exxon and XTO on December 11, 2009. XTO and Exxon expect to complete the
transaction in the second quarter of 2010. 

Robbins Umeda LLP's investigation concerns whether the consideration to be
received by XTO shareholders is fair and whether the directors and special
committee members have acted in the shareholders' best interests in connection
with the sale process.

for the people of Angola, including disease prevention, education and economic
development."

Initiative, established in 2000, to support the prevention, control and
treatment of malaria, and the ExxonMobil Women`s Economic Opportunity
Initiative, established in 2005, to help women in developing countries fulfill
their economic potential and drive social change in their communities. 

Since 2000, the ExxonMobil Foundation has contributed more than $23 million in
Angola through the two signature programs.

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer, Takeda to co-market diabetes drug in China&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer to receive fixed ratio of Actos sales in China&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which is
steadily building its presence overseas, said on Tuesday it has
forged an agreement to co-market Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd's
 (4502.T) blockbuster Actos diabetes drug in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker and one of the most
active multinational players in the fast-growing Chinese
market, said in a joint release with Takeda that it will
receive a fixed ratio of Actos net sales. It did not provide
financial details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes, a potentially
debilitating condition highly linked to obesity that is
becoming widespread in China and many other developing nations
that are adopting high-fat Western diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pill, with global annual sales of $4 billion, has been
sold in China since 2004 by Tianjin Takeda Pharmaceuticals -- a
joint venture between Takeda and Tianjin Lisheng Pharmaceutical
Ltd., a Chinese company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actos is the flagship product for Takeda, Japan's largest
drugmaker. But the medicine could start losing much of its
sales in 2011 when it faces generic competition in the United
States, its biggest market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Takeda developed Actos and has relied on U.S. drugmaker Eli
Lilly and Co (LLY.N) to market it in most countries, excluding
countries such as Japan, the United States, England and France
where Takeda itself has sold the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Takeda in April said it had taken back marketing rights
from Lilly in Canada, Turkey and five European nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actos got a major competitive boost a year ago when a
widely publicized trial showed that older diabetics taking
GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK.L) rival Avandia had a higher risk of
death and heart failure than similar patients taking the Takeda
drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both products belong to a family of drugs known as
glitazones, designed to lower resistance to insulin in
diabetics.

&lt;p&gt;  RENO, NV, Dec 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Hybrid Energy Holdings, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: HYBE) announced today it is
prepared for the anticipated massive increase in natural gas demand as
clean energy and regulatory pressures mount. Hybrid Energy's current and
planned acquisitions in the clean energy sector position the Company for
massive growth and profits.

    The Company recently agreed to acquire various natural gas properties with
strong current profitable production and significant untapped reserves.
The equity-based transaction is valued at approximately $4 million and
creates no debt for the Company. Full disclosures will be made immediately
subsequent to the scheduled Closing Date of 20th December, 2009 with the
OTC Disclosure Service.

    The Company notes the recent Exxon transaction where Exxon purchased XTO
for $31 Billion in a move to diversify from oil to Natural Gas. The low
price of natural gas and impending rise in the demand of clean energy
sources played a role in the largest acquisition since the purchase of
Mobil in 1998.

    Exxon Mobil Corp agreed to acquire the largest U.S. natural gas producer
XTO Energy Inc for $31 billion. The XTO acquisition follows the shift in
the energy consumption pattern worldwide as the U.S. and other developed
nations shift to cleaner energy sources away from coal.

    Shareholders will receive continuing updates and disclosures on current
and planned acquisitions and industry conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft suspended a microblog-style site for Chinese users on Tuesday after the service was accused of copying programming code from Plurk, a Twitter rival popular in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plurk this week alleged that MSN Juku, a service where users could share 140-character messages with friends on a scrolling timeline, appeared to have stolen up to 80 percent of its codebase from Plurk. In a blog post, Plurk showed screenshots and samples of similar JavaScript and CSS code pulled from both services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is looking into the allegations against MSN Juku, which a Microsoft joint venture in China hired a third-party vendor to develop, the company said in a statement. The service, still in beta and launched last month, could not be accessed on Tuesday. Microsoft promised to release further information as it learned more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plurk did not reply to e-mails or phone calls on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online social networking is increasingly popular in China and Microsoft was just one of several big companies looking to tap the market, though Twitter and some of its local-language rivals have been blocked for months in the country on political grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Dan Nystedt in Taipei contributed to this report.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  EASLEY, SC, Dec 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CSI Technology Outfitters (OTCBB: CSWI) (Computer Software Innovations,
Inc.) announced today an agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to
include Microsoft Live@edu education services as part of its CSI@K12
solution, which will deliver a groundbreaking, enterprise-class email and
collaboration solution for K-12 educational institutions. CSI Technology
Outfitters CEO Nancy Hedrick and Kirk Gregersen, Senior Director at
Microsoft announced the agreement, outlining a shared vision of robust,
and regulatory compliant, enterprise class email and collaboration
offering for teachers, administrators, students and parents throughout
the United States.

    Under the terms of the agreement, CSI will be delivering a next
generation, instructional communications management solution that
addresses the key needs and requirements of the K-12 market. This new
solution is powered by the Live@edu Services and SharePoint Platform,
which provide an enterprise-class engine for CSI@K12 and leverages CSI's
deep experience and identity management products already available in the
K-12 market. The CSI@K12 offering will be eligible for E-Rate
reimbursement. The E-Rate program provides discounts to assist most
schools and libraries in the United States (and U.S. territories) to
obtain affordable telecommunications and Internet access.

    Web based technologies are increasingly being used as a tool to enhance
the education process. Teacher to student communication, group
communication with and among students and parents, as well as delivering
information in a broad-based, rapid fashion are all being enabled. This
adoption of technology creates new and unique challenges for school
systems, whose needs have evolved to be on par with other
enterprise-customers for safe, secure, easily managed and
regulatory-compliant environments. Limited school budgets and IT
resources add to these challenges.

    "School districts today are working to deliver highly collaborative
learning environments," said Hedrick. "CSI@K12 will not only help enable
those environments, but give the user community an infrastructure that is
available when they need it, as they need it, provide the protections and
security that learners require, and enable teachers, students, and parents
to enhance the complete learning experience."

    "Microsoft Live@edu services provides schools a complete set of
communication and collaboration services to connect students, educators
and alumni while also giving our partners the ability to build custom
solutions to meet the specific needs and requirements of schools,"
Gregersen added. The CSI@K12 solution is a prime example as it further
extends the ability for schools to manage the learning experience
securely and effectively."

    This announcement builds on the existing work both CSI and Microsoft are
doing by optimizing access to enterprise class e-mail and collaboration
tools. In addition to the capabilities of email and collaboration tools
such as personalized email, full featured calendar services, task and
contact management, anywhere access via the worldwide web, 10GB Inbox,
collaborative workspaces, and integration with Microsoft Office provided
by Live@edu services, CSI@K12 adds a number of important features
including:


--  Meeting all regulatory compliance for CIPA/COPPA/FERPA
--  Eligible for E-Rate reimbursement
--  Inbox archiving
--  Flesh tone filtering
--  Auditable end user training for safe adoption and use
--  Simplified control and management facilities that limit needs for IT
    expertise

Takeda and Pfizer to Co-Promote Takeda&#8217;s Actos&#174; (Pioglitazone HCl) for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in China</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited ("Takeda") and Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer")

will co-promote Takeda`s Actos&#174; (pioglitazone HCl) with Tianjin Takeda
Pharmaceuticals in China. The exclusive co-promotion agreement will build on the

representatives supporting the sales and marketing of the product and expanding

Currently the world`s fifth largest pharmaceutical market, China is expected to

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's executive compensation reforms are not significantly burdensome for Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) as the two Wall Street giants largely met the new standards even prior to the credit crisis, Sanford C Bernstein said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The current goal of the compensation vigilantes - more equity, less cash, long vesting and potential claw back of losses - is not a threat to most of the business franchises of the investment banks," analyst Brad Hintz wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has embarked on a deeper review of pay at the biggest financial firms, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is trying to empower shareholders with more control over executive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to encourage compensation structures that align the pay of Wall Street workers with the long-term success of the company instead of rewarding short-term gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives at Morgan Stanley and Goldman have long held a substantial portion of their wealth in deferred common stock, Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said last week it plans to pay top managers their 2009 bonuses in stock, rather than cash, as it seeks to deflect outrage over a near-record pay haul months after it repaid billions of dollars in taxpayer aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, sectors such as MA advisory do not require significant capital and bankers may find working for a financial boutique, such as Evercore Partners (EVR.N), Greenhill  Co (GHL.N) or Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N), more attractive on a risk adjusted basis than staying with a large bank facing regulatory uncertainty, the analyst noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a worse case, the new compensation rules could lead to a new model of Wall Street in which new talent is trained and gains client relationships at the large capitalization "trainer" banks and exits later in their careers to monetize their Rolodexes at boutiques, private equity firms and hedge funds outside the spotlight of government oversight," Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anurag Kotoky in Bangalore; Editing by Deepak Kannan)&lt;/p&gt;

retrievable for seven years, providing clients with continuous archived
information in the event of a technical breakdown or site disaster. Powerful
search criteria enables users to quickly access check images by clearing date,

Payables Web ServicesSM. With this service, clients who hold Toronto accounts

protection service. Checks are customized with company name and logo.

deposits, foreign exchange, tax payments and wholesale lockbox services. "The
enhancements to J.P. Morgan`s Canadian payables capabilities are part of the
company`s ongoing investment in Treasury Services systems, innovation and
services designed to benefit its clients around the world," said Chris Doria,

&lt;p&gt;RICHARDSON, Texas--(Business Wire)--
In today`s fast-paced business world, there is no room for network downtime.
Communications must be constant and uninterrupted. Thus the performance of the
enterprise network-and consequently its data center-is vital to business
operations. To address these issues, CommScope Enterprise Solutions, a division
of CommScope, Inc. (NYSE:CTV), is teaming up with IBM on its Fiber Transport
System (FTS) S-Line Solution-a pre-terminated fiber optic solution that can be
integrated into IBM`s revolutionary Portable Modular Data Center (PMDC). 

Developed in tandem with CommScope and its SYSTIMAX brand, the IBM FTS S-Line
solution capitalizes on CommScope`s 40-year heritage in the development and
production of fiber optics. Leveraging SYSTIMAX`s InstaPATCH solution with the
IBM suite of server (IBM zSeries) and storage area network products, the system
expands productivity and scalability while lowering costs. In addition, its
unique, pre-terminated hardware gives installers the ability to quickly connect
system components together while safeguarding bandwidth needs within these
portable data centers. And with the solution incorporating CommScope`s
innovative port dust covers, installers don`t have to worry about interference
or network problems caused by outside debris. 

"When IBM came to us looking for a fiber-optic solution that could support its
PMDC system, a key issue for them was speed. They needed a solution that could
make their mobile data centers fully operational very quickly to ensure maximum
uptime," said Luc Adriaenssens, senior vice president of research and
development, CommScope Enterprise Solutions. "Our pre-terminated fiber solution
alleviated the issue in more ways than one. Its many features make it ideal for
the rugged and demanding network environments where IBM`s PMDC system is
deployed." 

IBM`s Portable Modular Data Center system provides a fully-functional, mobile
data center that allows for quick deployment and installation into any
environment. With a PMDC system, IT departments can quickly and easily expand
their data center capacity to address critical bandwidth needs. As part of the
system, the IBM FTS S-Line of cables includes high-performance, pre-terminated
hardware, trunk cables, direct-harness cables, standard fiber patch cords and
additional supporting hardware. 

In addition to its pre-terminated design, the trunk cabling system provides more
efficient use of space, which is critical in any containerized data center
solution. The FTS S-Line is also compatible with CommScope`s complete line of
network infrastructure solutions including its SYSTIMAX iPatch Intelligent
Patching System and 10Gb/s copper cabling. The FTS S-Line is currently available
through IBM as part of its PMDC system and is backed by CommScope`s global
network of sales and technical support personnel.

&lt;p&gt;Citrix Essentials for Microsoft Hyper-V Now Includes Affordable Disaster
Recovery Capability with Citrix StorageLink Site Recovery
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Extending its strategic virtualization partnership with Microsoft, Citrix
Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) today announced a new version of its virtualization
management solution for Microsoft Hyper-V. The new Citrix Essentials 5.5 for
Microsoft Hyper-V will now include Citrix StorageLink Site Recovery, a powerful
set of tools that make end-to-end business continuity accessible, affordable,
and easy to deploy. Citrix will make the solution available in both an Express
edition, to provide customers an easy way to test and deploy disaster recovery,
and as part of a full-featured Platinum edition. 

As virtualization becomes more broadly deployed in corporate datacenters,
companies of all sizes are increasingly moving mission-critical applications
into virtual machine environments, enhancing the need for proven and reliable
disaster recovery systems. Site recovery solutions for virtual environments,
however, have remained complex and expensive to implement. 

Now, with the new StorageLink Site Recovery capability from Citrix, customers
will be able to setup, test and manage disaster recovery services, including
utilization of storage hardware for replication, through a single console, using
a set of intuitive operations. In addition, new features in StorageLink Site
Recovery allow customers to test "what-if" disaster recovery scenarios, ensuring
confidence that systems can be restored in the event of an outage. Customers can
also choose to integrate recovery services directly with their existing systems
management applications, making it easier than ever to protect key assets. In
total, StorageLink Site Recovery provides customers with a comprehensive
end-to-end solution that orchestrates the implementation, management, testing nd
failover processes - at significant savings when compared to alternate
solutions. 

"Customers are looking for a reliable, rapid site recovery strategy that isn`t
time-consuming to implement and expensive to manage," said Garth Fort, general
manager of System Center marketing, Server and Tools Business at Microsoft Corp.
"We`re working with Citrix to deliver a configurable and integrated solution
that removes the complexity associated with competitive solutions. With its new
site recovery technology, Citrix Essentials for Microsoft Hyper-V gives
customers an easy way to improve disaster recovery and bullet proof application
and data availability." 

Citrix Extends Microsoft Server Virtualization, Minimizing Risk in Deploying
Disaster Recovery Services

As a result of this collaboration, Microsoft Hyper-V and System Center customers
are able to minimize risk in introducing disaster recovery services by gaining
immediate access to StorageLink Site Recovery Express, which is part of Citrix
Essentials 5.5 for Microsoft Hyper-V Express edition. This edition allows
recovery of unlimited Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machines on up to two host
servers at no additional charge. Organizations that require protection for more
than two host servers can easily upgrade to the broader Platinum edition of
Citrix Essentials 5.5 for Microsoft Hyper-V. 

"We are continuing to build further capabilities into our virtualization
management products. As we have done in desktop virtualization, our
collaboration with Microsoft has once again resulted in solutions that bring a
high degree of value to our joint customers. Customers that want to develop
proof-of-concepts with disaster recovery services can deploy the Citrix
Essentials 5.5 for Microsoft Hyper-V Express edition and those that want the
functionality for their entire virtualization farm can upgrade to the Platinum
edition. We will continue this partnership to extend our StorageLink Site
Recovery solution to include additional business continuity services," said Lou
Shipley, vice president and general manager of virtualization management for the
Datacenter and Cloud division at Citrix. 

"Customers can reduce risk and administrative time by using proven automated
disaster recovery solutions to support virtual infrastructures," said Andrew
Manners, vice president, marketing, HP StorageWorks. "By leveraging HP
StorageWorks` advanced virtual array features, StorageLink Site Recovery helps
customers ensure critical business data is accessible in the event of disasters
by automatically configuring replication and controlling failover of Microsoft
Hyper-V environments." 

StorageLink Site Recovery Enhances Full Citrix Essentials Solution

The new StorageLink Site Recovery technology available in the Citrix Essentials
5.5 for Microsoft Hyper-V offers advanced virtualization management capabilities
that extend the benefits of Microsoft Hyper-V and System Center. These
capabilities include dynamic provisioning services for deploying physical and
virtual workloads from a single consolidated image, workflow management to
automate IT processes, and lab and stage management for automating the lifecycle
of software development processes. StorageLink Site Recovery adds disaster
recovery services to these existing capabilities. 

"It is difficult to align systems, networking and storage teams for disaster
recovery planning and implementation. Then in the event of a disaster the same
teams have to coordinate recovery. Disaster recovery can be an insurmountable
task for organizations lacking either budget or expertise. The Citrix-Microsoft
solution solves these challenges," said Barry Barnett, senior systems engineer
at OSIsoft, a leading provider of highly-scalable and secure infrastructure for
the management of real-time data and events. 

Pricing and Availability

StorageLink Site Recovery is available immediately with Citrix Essentials 5.5
for Microsoft Hyper-V Platinum edition. The StorageLink Site Recovery Express
edition will be available for download on December 23, 2009, as part of Citrix
Essentials 5.5 for Microsoft Hyper-V Express edition. 

Customers can download Citrix Essentials 5.5 for Microsoft Hyper-V Express
edition free of charge. Citrix Essentials 5.5 for Microsoft Hyper-V Platinum

&lt;p&gt;More Than 350 Customers Migrate from Sun to HP in 2009 
PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
HP (NYSE:HPQ) today announced it has partnered with Microsoft, Novell and Red
Hat to provide customers with service offerings, incentives and training
programs that streamline the migration from Sun to HP-based solutions, while
reducing total cost of ownership. 

In 12 months ending Oct. 31, 2009, more than 350 customers - about one customer
per day - migrated from Sun systems to HP solutions. Many of these customers
have taken advantage of the specialized services, support programs and financial
incentives offered through the HP Complete Care program. 

Working with industry-leading partners, HP has enhanced this program with new
tools, expertise and operating environment solutions that offer customers
migrating from Sun the peace of mind they need to focus on growing their
businesses. 

HP and partners provide flexibility

To simplify the migration process, HP offers proof-of-concept, initial
assessments, application migration, implementation and total life cycle
services. HP`s partners provide additional services to ensure that customers`
data center environments are fully supported. New HP Complete Care program
benefits include:

* Improved ease of use with a 50 percent discount on SUSE Linux Enterprise
Fundamentals on-demand training; 
* Expanded access to migration expertise with up to 25 percent off Red Hat
Global Training; 
* Greater support with the Migration Competency Center in Grenoble, France,
which provides assessment and proof-of-concept services for customers.

HP`s partner relationships also empower customers to choose the operating system
that best meets their needs to run on HP ProLiant, HP BladeSystem and HP
Integrity server platforms. This includes HP`s UNIX operating system HP-UX 11i,
Microsoft Windows Server, Novell`s SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Red Hat
Enterprise Linux and even Sun Solaris. 

HP-UX 11i delivers built-in business value

HP-UX 11i with HP Integrity servers provides better performance and reliability
of mission-critical computing systems than IBM AIX and Sun Solaris.(1) Its
centralized management significantly reduces system administration and
maintenance. Integrated virtualization improves system utilization, while
built-in security and failover clusters optimize availability of demanding
workloads. HP recently secured the No. 2 position in UNIX revenue, according to
IDC.(2)

When ICA Fluor, Mexico`s largest construction company, and Fluor Corp., a
U.S.-based Fortune 500 company, experienced rapid growth, the company needed to
migrate from its Sun Fire server running Sun Solaris to HP Integrity running
HP-UX11i. 

"HP`s support and technical expertise during the migration was critical -
ensuring us a seamless transition that we anticipate will save us nearly $1
million in cumulative IT costs over three years," said Gregorio Pirez, IT
manager, ICA Fluor. 

HP and Microsoft maximize return on investment

HP`s more than 23,000 Microsoft-trained professionals continuously work with
Microsoft on design, engineering testing and support to provide customers a
smooth transition to HP-based solutions. 

Additionally, HP and Microsoft deliver reliable, flexible, standards-based
platforms for application and database solutions. The new releases of Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 R2 and upcoming release of SQL Server 2008 R2 deliver
enhanced scalability, helping enable customers to easily consolidate workloads
and reduce total cost of ownership. 

HP and Novell reduce risk, improve uptime

HP and Novell provide customers a highly interoperable alternative to Sun
Solaris with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, which runs on HP Integrity and HP
ProLiant servers. ITIC recently reported that SUSE Linux Enterprise customers
experience 51 percent less downtime than customers running Solaris on SPARC.(3)

HP and Red Hat improve performance, simplify migration

For more than a decade, HP and Red Hat have worked collaboratively to support
innovation in server and open source technology. This relationship provides
customers a broad range of business-critical and high-performance workloads and
applications. 

Red Hat solutions running on HP servers combine high availability, disaster
recovery, capacity planning and automated provisioning into one command center,
with the simplified management of a converged infrastructure. Customers can use
HP and Red Hat`s mutual migration services to benefit from standards-based open
source, while managing risk and reducing costs.

metres of Norwegian gas per year to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are continuously looking at optimising our portfolio and
this time we are marketing Gassled to see if we can sell it,"
Exxon Norway spokeswoman Kristin Kragseth said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision to market the stake comes a year after Exxon,
as well as other foreign minority Gassled owners including Total
(TOTF.PA), Shell (RDSa.L), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Eni
(ENI.MI), accused the Norwegian government of giving too much
sway over Gassled to companies it has influence over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than 70 percent of Gassled is controlled by state-owned
Petoro and majority state-owned Statoil (STL.OL), which the
foreign companies said made it tough for them to have influence
over strategic decisions on pipelines and access to new fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike many other oil- and gas-rich countries which have
succumbed to resource nationalism, Norway prides itself on equal
treatment of all market participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nevertheless, the 2007 tie-up between the oil and gas
divisions of its two biggest producers, Statoil and Norsk Hydro,
left the bulk of the Norwegian shelf's production under control
of a single company, which is two-thirds owned by the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon says it is the second-largest producer in Norway after
Statoil, with output of about 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent
per day, which amounts to about 10 percent of the Norwegian
shelf's total production and ExxonMobil's worldwide output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't intend to reduce our level of activity in Norway
at all. In fact we will be doing 3D seismic (scans for potential
oil and gas deposits) in the Norwegian sea next year," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In operation since 2003, Gassled has no employees and is
organised through committees. It has set up a different company,
Gassco, to run the 7,800 km (4,847 miles) gas pipeline system,
some platforms and onshore facilities on behalf of the owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2008, Gassco had gross tariffs of 26.6 billion Norwegian
crowns ($4.59 billion) and operating costs of 5.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Gassco's website, Gasco owners are: Petoro
(38.459 pct), Statoil (32.102), ExxonMobil (9.428), Total
(7.783), Shell (5.319), Norsea Gas (2.726), ConocoPhillips
(1.996), Eni (1.525) and DONG Energy [DOENRY.UL] (0.662).

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's $30 billion takeover of XTO Energy Inc is a major vote of confidence in natural gas and the latest sign that the world's top oil companies are looking to invest more in the cleaner-burning fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gas prices across the world have slumped in 2009, largely due to a surge in U.S. output from unconventional gas companies like XTO. But global demand for natural gas is expected to surge back more than 50 percent by 2030, making it the fastest-growing major energy source of the next few decades and promising fat profits for reserve holders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of a demand surge, the oil majors have started opening their wallets for expensive gas projects like gas liquefaction plants and pricey gas shale wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about the next 10 to 20 to 30 years of what we believe has now emerged as a very important part of the global resource portfolio," Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson said on a conference call with investors on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to be important to meeting energy supply, and that's the real value creation that we see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said last week it sees gas demand rising by an average of 1.8 percent a year over the next two decades, compared with 0.8 percent for oil, largely because power generation is set to grow faster than any other energy type to 40 percent of total primary energy demand by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeover gives Exxon a major position in so-called unconventional gas assets in North America, which include shale plays, where gas trapped in underground rock formations requires expensive and complex drilling techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment bankers in the energy industry said the deal could spur more investment by oil majors and national oil companies into these unconventional plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The capital needs for this industry, in particular the unconventional resources, we believe are in excess of $1 trillion. If you look at the independent oil sector there is not enough market capitalization to develop all these shale resources," said David Rockecharlie, co-head of energy investment banking at Jefferies, who advised XTO on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The capital markets clearly have provided a lot of capital, but these major oil companies are the right place financially for future development of these shale plays."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse analyst Jonathan Wolff said in a research note that possible sellers in the industry include Devon Energy, EOG Resources and Southwestern Energy Co. Investment bankers said bidders could include top oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron and ENI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO LONGER A SIDESHOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil companies used to flare off much of the gas they found lingering in oil fields around the world, often seeing it as a low-value sideshow to the black gold they craved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But tighter controls on wasteful burning of carbon-emitting fuels and the increasing appetite for natural gas as a fuel for generating electricity and heating has seen most oil companies sniffing around the globe for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, 40 percent of Royal Dutch Shell's daily production is natural gas, with France's Total not far behind on 38 percent in 2008. Around 37 percent of BP's global production was gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shell is increasingly focusing on natural gas, the cleanest-burning fossil fuel. By 2012, natural gas will likely make up around half of our production," Shell Chief Executive Peter Voser said in Washington in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Increasing natural gas production and transportation by liquefying it and shipping the LNG to global markets means that more natural gas will be available to displace coal as the fuel for power plants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the top international oil companies have already started to make blockbuster investments in liquefaction plants in order to be able to move gas more easily around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rasgas 3 project in Qatar, being developed by Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum, required an investment of about $14 billion, according to the Rasgas website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodside Petroleum's Pluto LNG project in western Australia, expected to be making shipments in 2011, will cost about $11 billion. Shell's Qatargas 4 LNG project, planned for late 2010, is expected to cost about $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP estimates the 6,500 trillion cubic feet (tcf), or 1.2 trillion barrels of oil equivalent, of already proven gas reserves is enough to meet current demand levels for at least 60 years. Reserves of crude oil are widely expected to be exhausted in the latter half of this century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global hunt for gas from unexplored fields and within the world's vast coal deposits or sedimentary rocks could contribute another 4,000 tcf to gas resources over the next few years, taking the world total up to roughly 100 years of consumption at current rates, BP estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Lisa Shumaker, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM has been disparaging products made by a smaller rival in order to protect its lucrative mainframe business, according to a lawsuit filed on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed by Neon Enterprise Software and concerns a software tool called zPrime that the company released in July. Neon says zPrime can reduce operating costs for mainframe users by allowing them to shift more of their computing jobs onto IBM's zAAP and zIIP specialty mainframe processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers don't pay software licensing fees to use those specialty processors, or SPs, instead of IBM's standard central processors, which has caused IBM to lash out at Neon in order to protect its mainframe business, according to the lawsuit (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM told its mainframe customers in a letter that "the use of zPrime will cause Neon's customers to become obligated -- contrary to IBM's original promises to customers that purchased SPs -- to pay software license fees for workloads shifted to SPs," Neon said in its lawsuit. That claim is false, Neon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also accused IBM of selling additional SPs to customers only if they agree not to use Neon's product, and of characterizing zPrime as an unlawful "circumvention" technology. The lawsuit seeks damages and a permanent injunction to prevent IBM from repeating those claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is not taking the suit lying down. In a brief statement via e-mail, it said Neon's claims "have no merit, and its product offers no innovation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Neon's software deliberately subverts the way IBM mainframe computers process data," IBM said. "This is akin to a homeowner tampering with his electrical meter to save money. IBM has invested billions of dollars in the mainframe this decade, and we will vigorously protect our investment." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is also dealing with an antitrust inquiry into its mainframe business by the U.S. Department of Justice, following a complaint filed in September by the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trade group said IBM has been refusing to issue licenses for its mainframe OS to competitors, something it had been required to do by the DOJ after actions taken against the company in the 1970s. The DOJ ended a longstanding antitrust consent decree with IBM in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's successful settlement of its antitrust issues with the European Commission was welcomed by the software company's foes and friends alike Wednesday, with many hailing the moment as a turning point for the computer industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some urged caution, warning that Microsoft has a history of dragging its feet when it comes to addressing antitrust concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did the world's biggest software company agree to allow users a choice of Internet browsers instead of just offering them its own Internet Explorer browser, it also agreed to open up a wide range of its software products, including the Windows operating system, Windows Server, Office, Exchange and SharePoint products, to direct competition for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legally binding commitments Microsoft made in the browser case mark "a victory for the future of the Web and its users," Hakon Wium Lie, the chief technology officer at Opera said at a press conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera is a small rival to Microsoft's IE in the browser market. It sparked the European Commission's case when it complained to the regulator about Microsoft's behavior at the end of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Opera's key concerns was that Microsoft refused to respect technology standards that are widely used by other Internet companies. As IE is omnipresent, many Web sites tailored their pages just for IE and not other browsers including Opera.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The days when companies could use poor standards support to tie down users are over," Wium Lie added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commitments to open up Office and other software products to competition are not legally binding because the Commission had not yet started formal legal proceedings in this separate antitrust case, known as the interoperability case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said it would keep the case open and would only close it once Microsoft had honored its commitments, which include providing information to third-party software developers so that they can make their software interoperable with Microsoft's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said she hoped the Commission would be able to sign off on the interoperability case early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some questioned whether it is feasible for third-party developers to adapt their products to work with Microsoft's in such a short time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Office, an open-source alternative to Microsoft's Office package of applications, which is developed by Sun Microsystems among others, currently doesn't work well with Office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adapting it using the information Microsoft will provide would take at least three or four months, said Thomas Vinje, the lawyer representing Opera, Mozilla (maker of the Firefox browser), and ECIS, a trade group representing Microsoft's biggest rivals, which sparked the interoperability case with a complaint last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECIS (the European Committee for Interoperable Systems) counts IBM, Oracle, Sun, Red Hat and Opera among its members. It has fought Microsoft in Europe for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft welcomed the settlement with the European Commission, and said that the promises it has made will change the way it competes from now on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are embarking on a path that will require significant change within Microsoft," said Brad Smith, the company's top lawyer, describing Wednesday's settlement as "an important day and a major step forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Microsoft's closest allies applauded the settlement. "Today's settlement ends a long-running litigation, and Microsoft has made some important concessions in order to get to this point," said Jonathan Zuck, president of he Association for Competitive Technology (ACT). The ACT has loyally supported Microsoft through antitrust battles on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vinje, who has fought Microsoft as long as Zuck has supported it, provided the only downbeat message of the day by pointing out that Microsoft's past record in complying with antitrust orders is poor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a press conference organized by Opera and ECIS, he said that while the settlement is a welcome development, "we have to face reality. We have seen declarations of willingness [to change its practices] just like today, only to see Microsoft undermine the settlements later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our emphasis on enforcement is based on years of familiarity with Microsoft's inadequate commitments and broken promises," he said, and urged the Commission to be vigilant in monitoring Microsoft's compliance with the terms of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that antitrust issues remain unresolved, such as Microsoft's controversial move to secure International Standards Organization (ISO) recognition for its OOXML document format. ECIS would pursue the issue, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Roy Disney, the nephew of Walt Disney Co. founder Walt Disney who was best known for revitalizing its animation unit and helping to oust longtime chief executive Michael Eisner, died on Wednesday at 79.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney, who had been ill with stomach cancer for a year, died at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, California, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting out as an assistant film editor in 1953, Disney worked for more than half a century at the entertainment giant, where he was widely regarded as a fierce protector of the family's legacy and a champion of animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the last Disney family member to work at the company, family spokesman Cliff Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On behalf of everyone at Disney, we are saddened by the loss of our friend and colleague Roy E. Disney. He was much more than a valued 56-year company veteran - Roy's true passion and focus were preserving and building upon the amazing legacy of Disney animation that was started by his father and uncle," Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his death, Disney owned more than 16 million shares of common stock, which was worth $518 million at the close of trading on Wednesday, but retained no direct role in running the giant media company. He served as a consultant for Disney and a director emeritus for the board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The successful philanthropist, filmmaker and award-winning sailor helped to guide the studio with a string of animated box office hits including "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast," "Aladdin," and "The Lion King."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE 'SAVE DISNEY' WARS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney was executive producer of "Fantasia/2000," a sequel to the 1940 Disney classic, and served in a similar capacity on a number of recent animated shorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unhappy with the leadership of chief executive Ron Miller, Disney abruptly quit the company's board of directors in 1984, touching off a series of events that ultimately brought the departure of Miller and his replacement by Eisner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney returned to the board of directors and served as head of the famed animation department but resigned again in 2003, this time citing serious differences with the direction Eisner was taking the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his resignation, Disney helped establish the Web site called SaveDisney.com aimed at ousting Eisner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a 2004 annual shareholder meeting, an unprecedented 43 percent of Disney shareholders voted to oppose the reelection of Eisner to the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As criticism of Eisner intensified in the wake of the shareholder meeting, his position grew more tenuous.

&lt;p&gt;BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Shamrock Holdings, Inc. today issued the following statement on the death of its
founder, Roy E. Disney: 

All of us at Shamrock are deeply saddened by the loss of our founder, mentor and
dear friend, Roy E. Disney. He was not only a creative genius and an
accomplished business executive, but a truly wonderful human being who cared
about people and every living thing. Roy established Shamrock in 1978 with an
investing philosophy that reflected his personal approach to life: be active and
be responsible. It is a trait that the firm has become known for throughout the
years. 

Initially a vehicle for the Disney family, Shamrock grew into a multi-faceted
advisor serving some of the largest pension funds in the nation, managing
approximately $2 billion under the guidance of Roy and his dear friend and
business partner Stanley P Gold, Shamrock`s president and CEO. To this day,
Shamrock strives to make the companies it invests in better and more
accountable. Roy once said Shamrock thrived on its willingness to "take risks
and succeed gracefully." 

That could also describe Roy himself - a man who relished the challenges as well
as the many successes life brought him. Whether on the open sea, in the midst of
a proxy fight or reviewing an animator`s work, Roy helped all of us see the
possibility - and, sometimes, the magic - in the world around us. 

Mr. Gold added, "We all dearly miss Roy: his dry sense of humor, his
self-effacing demeanor, his creative insight. Roy was a gentleman in the truest
sense of the word. His passing has left a hole in the hearts of the many that he
knew. I know I speak for everyone at Shamrock, Roy`s family and for all of his
friends and colleagues when I say our lives were truly enriched just knowing
him."

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights ZOLL Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: ZOLL) as the
Bull of the Day and Greatbatch (NYSE: GB) the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Exxon (NYSE: XOM), XTO Energy (NYSE:
XTO) and Chesapeake (NYSE: CHK). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

ZOLL Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: ZOLL) reported fourth quarter earnings of 16
cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents. The company
earned 41 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. 

For fiscal 2009, the company earned 45 cents per share, which also exceeded the
Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents but was well below the year-ago earnings of
$1.10. We are pleased with the company's wide range of products and significant
international presence. 

ZOLL has made multiple acquisitions in the past which have aided growth, and the
company is looking for more such opportunities. Consequently, we upgrade the
stock to Outperform with a target of $31. 

Bear of the Day: 

The flurry of acquisition activities in the past few years have expanded
Greatbatch's (NYSE: GB) customer base, particularly in orthopedics, and moved
its product portfolio into higher growth segments. The company's move into areas
beyond original equipment manufacturing should increase future operating
margins. 

However, the company reported disappointing third quarter fiscal 2009 results.
Earnings per share were 32 cents, considerably lower than the Zacks Consensus
Estimate of 38 cents and the year-ago earnings of 43 cents. The company also
witnessed erosion in its top-line. 

In light of its disappointing performance, we downgrade the stock to
Underperform with a target price of $17. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Capacity Utilization Rises

Utilization up the production chain is doing much better than downstream.
Utilization of finished goods was just 70.0%, up from 69.4% last month, but is
down from 71.2% a year ago and a long term average of 77.7%. Production of crude
goods was 85.2%, up sharply from 83.4% in October and actually above the
year-ago level of 84.7%. It too has been aided by a 1.2% shrinkage in total
capacity. 

Still, we are not that far off the long-term average utilization rate of 86.6%.
Curiously, the step in the middle -- semi finished goods capacity utilization --
is actually well below that of either crude of finished goods at 67.8%, up from
67.4% last month, but down from 73.5% a year ago and well off its long-term
average of 82.0%. 

The much higher utilization rates for crude goods could indicate that we are
exporting much more in the way of crude goods, which is not a good long-term
sign. We would generally prefer to do the later, higher-value-added stages of
production than just producing the raw materials. 

The increase in mining activity was primarily in oil and gas production (and
related oil field services that are lumped in with mining). This reflects the
growing amount of unconventional natural gas coming from the shale plays. As
Exxon`s (NYSE: XOM) purchase yesterday of XTO Energy (NYSE: XTO) indicates this
is a very significant and important development for our long-term energy future.
There are many other firms that are active in those shale plays that will
benefit, such as Chesapeake (NYSE: CHK).

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Ciena Out of S 500

According to Standard and Poor`s latest realignment, Ciena Corp. (Nasdaq: CIEN),
the telecommunications equipment maker has been removed from the S 500 index
and has been included in the S MidCap 400, replacing Blyth Inc. (NYSE: BTH).
Visa (NYSE: V) will replace Ciena in the S 500 Index. 

After the announcement, Ciena shares fell 6.64%, as negative investor sentiments
loomed on the stock. The S 500 Index includes companies with market capital of
above $5 billion. Since Ciena has a market cap of $1 billion, it is no longer a
representative of the market index and thus has been removed. 

Standard &amp; Poor's added five other companies to its S 500, including Mead
Johnson Nutrition Co. (NYSE: MJN), which is being split off from Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY).

&lt;p&gt;IBM on Wednesday said it has signed a deal to buy Lombardi, an Austin, Texas, BPM (business process management) vendor. Terms were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BPM software helps companies develop, implement and manage business processes, such as the steps involved in hiring help or buying supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's WebSphere product portfolio already includes a wide range of BPM software, as Lombardi itself once pointed out in a competitive white paper that portrayed its technology as easier to use and deploy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is "a great fit" in IBM's portfolio for Lombardi's Teamworks and Blueprint software products, which already support WebSphere, Lombardi CEO Rod Favaron said in a blog postWednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also have many joint customers and partners -- so we understand the types of expanded product and service offerings that are needed to drive enterprise level success with BPM," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pending acquisition is one of more than 90 IBM has made since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has been looking for an acquisition that could help it sell BPM to line-of-business executives, rather than IT staffers, "and Lombardi surely fills that gap," Forrester Research analyst Clay Richardson said via e-mail. "Of course, this will introduce further stack confusion, but if executed properly it could parachute IBM into successful deals led by line of business managers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig Hayman, general manager, IBM application and integration middleware, seemed to echo that assessment during a conference call, saying Lombardi's technology will specifically improve IBM's ability to "bring about the human-centric automation of business processes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Blue sees big business in BPM down the road. It already has 5,000 BPM customers, according to Hayman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BPM market is set to grow from US$1.7 billion this year to roughly $3 billion by 2013, according to an IDC report released in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As BPM sales grow, buyers will become more sophisticated about their needs, meaning "the market will begin to segment itself even further than it has," IDC analyst Maureen Fleming wrote. "Generalized BPM offerings are likely to begin specializing for competitive differentiation, while the offerings from larger vendors will increasingly be integrated with their application platforms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPM providers will also need to ensure their products "broadly support process applications," Fleming added. "That means strong interoperability with business intelligence tools, as well as the ability to create and adapt user interfaces -- or directly support third-party development environments."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Nephew of Disney founder loses battle with cancer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Known for leading shareholder revolt to oust Eisner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Credited with revitalizing famed animation unit at studio
 (Adds quotes, details, background, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Dan Whitcomb and Sue Zeidler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Roy Disney, the nephew of
Walt Disney Co. founder Walt Disney who was best known for
revitalizing its animation unit and helping to oust longtime
chief executive Michael Eisner, died on Wednesday at 79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney, who had been ill with stomach cancer for a year,
died at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach,
California, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Starting out as an assistant film editor in 1953, Disney
worked for more than half a century at the entertainment giant,
where he was widely regarded as a fierce protector of the
family's legacy and a champion of animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was the last Disney family member to work at the
company, family spokesman Cliff Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On behalf of everyone at Disney, we are saddened by the
loss of our friend and colleague Roy E. Disney. He was much
more than a valued 56-year company veteran - Roy's true passion
and focus were preserving and building upon the amazing legacy
of Disney animation that was started by his father and uncle,"
Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the time of his death, Disney owned more than 16 million
shares of common stock, which was worth $518 million at the
close of trading on Wednesday, but retained no direct role in
running the giant media company. He served as a consultant for
Disney and a director emeritus for the board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The successful philanthropist, filmmaker and award-winning
sailor helped to guide the studio with a string of animated box
office hits including "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the
Beast," "Aladdin," and "The Lion King."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE 'SAVE DISNEY' WARS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney was executive producer of "Fantasia/2000," a sequel
to the 1940 Disney classic, and served in a similar capacity on
a number of recent animated shorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unhappy with the leadership of chief executive Ron Miller,
Disney abruptly quit the company's board of directors in 1984,
touching off a series of events that ultimately brought the
departure of Miller and his replacement by Eisner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney returned to the board of directors and served as
head of the famed animation department but resigned again in
2003, this time citing serious differences with the direction
Eisner was taking the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After his resignation, Disney helped establish the Web site
called SaveDisney.com aimed at ousting Eisner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a 2004 annual shareholder meeting, an unprecedented 43
percent of Disney shareholders voted to oppose the reelection
of Eisner to the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As criticism of Eisner intensified in the wake of the
shareholder meeting, his position grew more tenuous. Eisner
announced in March of 2005 that he would resign that September,
one year before his contract expired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Iger's behest, Disney rejoined the company in July of
2005 as a non-voting director emeritus and consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He put his heart and soul into preserving Disney's
legendary past, while helping to move the art of animation into
the modern age by embracing new technology. Roy was a visionary
and passionate supporter of the art form, and he was all about
quality," said John Lasseter, chief creative officer for Walt
Disney and Pixar Animation Studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney was born in Los Angeles on January 10, 1930 to Roy
O. Disney and Edna Francis Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is survived by his wife, Leslie, and four children from
his marriage to Patricia Dailey Disney.

&lt;p&gt;For the First Time Windows Users Can Choose Browser Alternatives
REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The European Commission (EU) announced a decision today that will, for the first
time, give European Windows users the freedom to choose an alternative default
browser over Microsoft Internet Explorer. Flock was selected by the Commission
as one of the top browser options that will be presented to Windows users. 

The pool of alternative browsers were chosen based on popularity, as measured by
market share within the European Union. Flock recently announced that it has
grown active users 475 percent during 2009, and over 3 Million users have
selected Flock as a better way to log-in and stay connected to their friends on
Facebook, as well as other social destinations on the web. 

The European Union estimates that approximately 100 million computers will
automatically be offered the browser alternatives by mid-March 2010. They also
estimate that approximately 30 million new computers per year will include this
new option over the next five years. 

"This is a banner day for European computer consumers that have wanted nothing
more than to choose a browser that fits their very personal needs," said Shawn
Hardin, CEO of Flock. "This decision supports Flock`s commitment to innovation,
and our mission to deliver a superior experience for people who actively
participate in social activities on the web. This decision will allow the
millions of users, whose lives are enriched by social media and networking, to
be introduced to the unique benefits of the Flock browser over conventional
browsers. Of course, this is also a banner day for Flock as the ruling opens up
access to the millions of Windows users in the European market, who have
accepted the default browser presented by Microsoft without knowledge of
available choices in the past." 

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said, "Millions of European consumers
will benefit from this decision by having a free choice about which web browser
they use. Such choice will not only serve to improve people's experience of the
internet now but also act as an incentive for web browser companies to innovate
and offer people better browsers in the future." 

According to a statement released by the EU, the decision by the Commission
reflects "&#8230;the Commission concerns that Microsoft may have tied its web browser
Internet Explorer to the Windows PC operating system in breach of EU rules on
abuse of a dominant market position (Article 102 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union - TFEU)." 

The eleven browsers selected by the EU as alternatives to Microsoft IE were
Flock, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, AOL, Maxthon,
K-Meleon, Avant, Sleipnir and Slim. 

Flock gives social web users the ability to better manage and maintain an active
presence on a variety of popular social services, keep in touch with the people
and information they care about, and share their favorite content with their
friends all from within the Flock browser. 

About Flock

user`s experience and liberate them from the complexities of managing multiple
social networks, web mail, media, news feeds and blogs. With Flock, they can
instantly discover, enjoy and share the relationships and content they are

&lt;p&gt; * About a sixth of Chevron Gorgon gas now needs buyers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Eyes on other parts of Asia that need natural gas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Dec 16 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said
on Wednesday it closed a deal with Japan's Chubu Electric Power
Co (9502.T) for about a fifth of the U.S. oil major's share of
natural gas from the massive Gorgon project in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chubu deal includes a 0.417 percent equity stake and
1.44 million metric tons per year of liquefied natural gas from
a $40 billion-plus project that will initially produce 15
million tonnes annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron initially owned half the Gorgon project, though it
has already sold a 1.25 percent stake to Osaka Gas Co (9532.T)
and 1.1 percent to Tokyo Gas Co (9531.T) along with contracts
totaling 2.475 million tonnes of LNG annually over 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gorgon, which is being built on Barrow Island off Western
Australia, is forecast to deliver 8 percent of the world's
liquefied natural gas (LNG) when it starts producing in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The foundation customers in Gorgon are leading energy
companies in the world's largest LNG markets," said John Gass,
president of Chevron Global Gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the Chubu deal, San Ramon, California-based Chevron
now owns just over 47 percent of the project, while Exxon Mobil
Corp (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) hold the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In South Korea, Chevron affiliate GS Caltex will buy
another 0.5 million tonnes of Chevron's Gorgon gas annually for
20 years, while Korea Gas Corp (036460.KS) has an initial
agreement for 1.5 million tonnes per year for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That leaves roughly a sixth of Chevron's Gorgon gas free to
be sold. Analysts believe China, already under contract to buy
some of Exxon's and Shell's Gorgon gas along with a few Indian
companies, could be looking to buy more. [ID:nSYD35374]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chubu deal closed less than two weeks after Chevron
agreed with Tokyo Electric Power Co (9501.T) to sell up to
nearly half the initial 8.6 million tonnes per year of LNG from
Wheatstone, a project that ramps up a few years after Gorgon at

&lt;p&gt; (Adds company confirmation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Dec 16 (Reuters) - Roy Disney, nephew of Walt
Disney Co. founder Walt Disney and a longtime executive for the
company, died on Wednesday at 79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co. said he died at Hoag Memorial Hospital
Presbyterian in Newport Beach, California. Disney had been ill
with stomach cancer, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney was born in Los Angeles and began working in the
1950s for the company founded by his uncle and his father. He
is best known for leading a shareholder revolt to remove former
chairman and CEO Michael Eisner, who stepped down in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the time of his death, Disney owned over 16 million
shares or about one percent of the company's total outstanding
common shares but had no direct role in running the giant media
company. He served as a consultant for Disney and a director
emeritus for the board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Whitcomb, Sue Zeidler and Gina Keating,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Putting up $30 billion to buy XTO Energy XTO.N may have been the easy part of Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) bold expansion into the natural gas world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hard work may now be finding a way for the famously conservative, strictly managed company that has shunned major acquisitions for a decade to integrate XTO without quashing the aggressive spirit that built it into a top U.S. gas producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The XTO acquisition will increase Exxon's proven reserves by about 10 percent and catapult Exxon, the largest publicly traded energy company, to the number one U.S. gas producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface the move appears like a good fit. Exxon brings more capital to a smaller independent producer and gets access to XTO's major shale reserves and technical expertise in shale drilling that can be used in its overseas projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But big questions loom about whether Exxon will continue XTO's active drilling program or its forward hedging program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon is likely to modify rig counts and other development plans from XTO's prior plans. Majors tend to be less aggressive on the drilling front than independents like XTO, though it is safe to say Exxon is not buying these properties for them to sit on a shelf," broker Raymond James said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts note XTO will no longer have to 'count pennies' when ramping up drilling in anticipation of an improving economy but some wonder if managements will eventually clash over strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will be interesting to watch the management styles of Exxon versus the more entrepreneurial style of XTO. If the merger is going to be successful, there will have to be a willingness to 'let the boys play'," said Philip Adams, senior bond analyst with Gimme Credit in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Platt, commodity strategist with Archer Financials in Chicago, agreed. "Exxon recognizes the talent at XTO. I don't think they bought it to put it into their mold. I don't think Exxon conservatism will overshadow what XTO does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon tacitly acknowledged XTO's expertise in the field by saying it would create a new upstream organization to be based at XTO's Fort Worth, Texas, office to manage its global development and production of unconventional resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XTO is one of the leading developers of unconventional resources including shale gas, or gas trapped in sedimentary beds, that requires advanced drilling techniques to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These reserves have emerged as a potentially huge new resource play in North America, and their development has so far been dominated by independent U.S. exploration and production companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now oil majors like Exxon and state oil companies are starting to look for unconventional reserves around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FUTURE OF HEDGING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XTO has hedged more than half its natural gas production for 2010, or about 1.25 billion cubic feet per day, with some additional hedges already in place for 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Exxon says it makes only limited use of derivative instruments to hedge oil and gas production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have questioned what the deal will mean for trading operations going forward at XTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see the XTO operation being gutted. It's supposed to be operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary," said a natural gas trader familiar with XTO's operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hedging was one of the things that made XTO attractive from a bond holder's perspective. The fact that it could survive a fairly extended period of weak natural gas prices because they did have a hedge position in place took some of the risk off the table," said Gimme Credit's Adams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand for gas, which burns much cleaner than either oil or coal, is expected to steadily increase worldwide as nations struggle to control emissions that contribute to pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gas, which produces about half the carbon dioxide of coal, should be the favored fossil fuel in coming years as countries transition to even cleaner alternative fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the Exxon-XTO deal may be just the beginning of investments by majors in the natural gas market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the current economic climate, this is a really good time for companies with large balance sheets and a lot of cash on hand to go shopping," said Jason Schenker, president, Prestige Economics, LLC, in Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Matt Daily; Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's promise to allow Windows users to choose which Internet browser they use has been accepted by the European Commission, ending its antitrust investigation of the company's position in the browser market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company will offer users of Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 a choice screen through which they can pick the browsers they want to install on their PC. The screen will be offered to users in the European Union and some neighboring countries for the next five years via the Windows Update mechanism. In addition, PC manufacturers will be allowed to ship computers with competing Web browsers, as well as or instead of Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To eliminate bias, the choice screen is presented as a neutral window, not a full Internet Explorer window as Microsoft initially proposed, and the browsers are presented in random, rather than alphabetical, order. The five most popular browsers -- initially Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Opera -- will be displayed first, while users will be able to scroll the list to pick from seven others, initially AOL, Maxthon, K-Meleon, Flock, Avant Browser, Sleipnir and Slim Browser. The list will be reviewed every six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission informed Microsoft of its objections to the company's practice of tying Internet Explorer to its Windows operating systems on Jan. 15. By exploiting its dominant position in the operating system market, Microsoft prevented other software browsers from competing on their merits. The new choice screen will enable such competition, the Commission said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope this closes a long chapter in a sometimes uneasy relationship with the Commission, and we hope it opens a new one," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said at a news conference in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the Commission has accepted Microsoft's proposal, it becomes legally binding. If Microsoft fails to deliver, it could face a fine of up to 10 percent of its worldwide turnover, under E.U. antitrust law. The Commission will review the situation regularly to ensure that the choice screen is achieving the desired result, and may require Microsoft to make changes, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also made some concessions on another complaint filed with the Commission, regarding the information it provides to third-party software developers to enable them to develop products interoperable with those of Microsoft. Without such information, it is difficult for other companies to develop software that collaborates with, or competes with, Microsoft products such as Office or SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission has not yet sent a statement of objections, or formal accusation, to Microsoft regarding the interoperability complaint, so the legal process has not begun, and Microsoft's concessions on this point are not legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes hopes to make a decision "as early in 2010 as possible" either to drop that case or to file a statement of objections, she said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(With additional reporting by Paul Meller in Brussels.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BPM software helps companies develop, implement and manage business processes, such as the steps involved in hiring help or buying supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's WebSphere product portfolio already includes a wide range of BPM software, as Lombardi itself once pointed out in a competitive white paper that portrayed its technology as easier to use and deploy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is "a great fit" in IBM's portfolio for Lombardi's Teamworks and Blueprint software products, which already support WebSphere, Lombardi CEO Rod Favaron said in a blog postWednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also have many joint customers and partners &#8211; so we understand the types of expanded product and service offerings that are needed to drive enterprise level success with BPM," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pending acquisition is one of more than 90 IBM has made since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives from both companies are expected to discuss the deal further in a conference call later Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(More to follow.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may still face a lawsuit after apologizing for the theft of software code used in MSN China's microblog service, Juku, from rival Plurk, a popular provider from Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are definitely looking at all possibilities on how to move forward in response to Microsoft's recent statement," Plurk cofounder Alvin Woon said Wednesday. A "lawsuit is definitely one of the many options we have considered and will continue to look closely to," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plurk fired off a blog posting early this week alleging as much as 80 percent of Juku's code base was stolen from Plurk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft apologized Tuesday, saying an outside company hired to develop Juku copied a portion of the code from Plurk. The statement from the world's largest software vendor is at odds with one from MSN China early this month defending Juku as "a local innovation developed by MSN China ... based on Windows Live Messenger networks." The MSN China statement was a response to Chinese bloggers who early on called Juku a pirated version of Plurk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The matter puts Microsoft in an unfamiliar position. The company has complained for years about the piracy of its software in China. In spite of its long experience with the issue, the software giant now finds itself apologizing for its failure to adequately safeguard the intellectual property of a rival code developer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Thompson, a spokesman for Plurk, said the company went ahead with its blog post accusing Microsoft of code theft only after determining willful intent was involved. "The client code and backend code on Plurk is still all proprietary and not easily accessible for anyone to just lift. Speaking technically, what makes our claim a little stronger is that Plurk's client side code was obfuscated to begin with, so someone went in there and had to spend some real effort to unpack/reengineer the JS code and prettify it on their end," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Owen Fletcher in Beijing and Nancy Gohring in Seattle contributed to this report.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's promise to allow Windows users to choose which Internet browser they use has been accepted by the European Commission, ending its antitrust investigation of the company's position in the browser market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company will offer users of Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 a choice screen through which they can pick the browsers they want to install on their PC. The screen will be offered to users in the European Union and some neighboring countries for the next five years via the Windows Update mechanism. In addition, PC manufacturers will be allowed to ship computers with competing Web browsers, as well as or instead of Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission informed Microsoft of its objections to the company's practice of tying Internet Explorer to its Windows operating systems on Jan. 15. By exploiting its dominant position in the operating system market, Microsoft prevented other software browsers from competing on their merits. The new choice screen will enable such competition, the Commission said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the Commission has accepted Microsoft's proposal, it becomes legally binding. If Microsoft fails to deliver, it could face a fine of up to 10 percent of its worldwide turnover, under E.U. antitrust law. The Commission will review the situation regularly to ensure that the choice screen is achieve the desired result, and may require Microsoft to make changes, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agreement to Deliver 1.44 Million Tons Annually From Gorgon Project Over 25
Years
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that its Australian subsidiaries
have signed binding long-term Sales and Purchase Agreements (SPAs) with Chubu
Electric Power for a portion of Chevron`s share of liquefied natural gas (LNG)
from the Gorgon Project. 

Chevron agreed to supply Chubu Electric 1.44 million metric tons per year (MTPY)
of LNG for 25 years. Also, Chubu Electric intends to purchase 0.417 percent
equity from Chevron`s stake in the Gorgon Project. 

"We are pleased to build on our long-term relationship with Chubu Electric and
welcome them as a foundation customer and equity participant in the Gorgon
Project," said Jim Blackwell, president, Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and
Production Company. "The SPA with Chubu Electric continues to build momentum
toward commercializing our equity natural gas in the project." 

The agreement follows the recent signing of three binding long-term SPAs with
Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and GS Caltex, a 50 percent-owned Chevron equity affiliate,
for delivery of a total of nearly 3 MTPY, as well as a Heads of Agreement with
the Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) for 1.5 MTPY. 

"The foundation customers in Gorgon are leading energy companies in the world`s
largest LNG markets. Our agreements position Chevron to deliver supplies to meet
long-term demand in the growing Asia-Pacific region," said John Gass, president,
Chevron Global Gas. 

The Gorgon Project is operated by Chevron, which will have an approximate 47
percent interest in the project after the sale to Chubu. 

The initial Gorgon Project development, in northwestern Australia, will include
a three-train, 15 million-metric-tons-per-year liquefied natural gas facility
and a domestic gas plant. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides
energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future,
including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
IDGA announced today that Microsoft will participate in the Cloud Computing for
DoD &amp; Government Summit, scheduled for February 22-24, 2010 at the Hilton Old
Town Alexandria. 

The event, chaired by QinetiQ North America, will address the fast-growing IT
infrastructure sector of cloud computing.

Speakers from National Institute of Science &amp; Technology, Defense Information
Systems Agency, Department of Energy, Department of Interior, United States Air
Force Reserves, United States Navy and many more will discuss current programs
and future plans for cloud computing activities. 

While cloud computing provides vast computing power, reliable off-site data
storage, wide availability, and lower investment costs, potential security risks
remain top-of-mind to IT professionals. Cloud computing eliminates the need to
buy hardware and pay to manage it and offers more flexibility which is why this
is appealing to government agencies.

&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON, Del.--(Business Wire)--
The Bancorp Bank Payment Solutions Group, a division of The Bancorp Bank
("Bancorp"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: TBBK),
today announced that Bancorp, in collaboration with InsurCard, have joined with
the New Jersey Insurance Underwriting Association (NJIUA) to offer a program to
provide immediate cash payments to New Jersey policyholders in the event of a
catastrophe. The NJIUA is an association created by the state of New Jersey in
1968 to provide essential property insurance to any person unable to obtain
insurance coverage. 

"We feel that providing a card to our policyholders will enable them to recover
more quickly from a catastrophic situation. Cardholders are able to access funds
immediately to secure items such as hotel rooms, food or clothing. Plus,
external adjusting firms appointed by the Association can add additional funds
to a prepaid card immediately, providing instant relief for our policyholders,"
explained Jerry Warner, President of NJIUA. 

The InsurCard Visa Prepaid Card is loaded when emergency payments are required,
eliminating the challenges associated with check issuance. The InsurCard can be
used to make purchases wherever Visa debit cards are accepted and cardholders
have access to cash through ATMs located nationwide. Policyholders can obtain
account balance and transaction information 24-hours a day. 

InsurCard was developed by J. Robert Mendte of Lansdale, Pa. - an executive with
more than 30 years experience in insurance operations. "After seeing the
challenges faced by people in these very difficult situations, it was clear that
there had to be a better way. By using InsurCard, insurers can provide immediate
relief to their customers and continue to load payments as necessary with the
press of a button," offered Mendte. 

In any designated catastrophe, representatives of NJIUA and/or field adjusters
will have access to an inventory of preprinted cards. These cards remain
inactive and have no value until authorized by NJIUA. After the catastrophe,
adjusters will contact policyholders who have experienced losses and make an

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Dec 16 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators
accepted on Wednesday Microsoft (MSFT.O)'s offer to allow users
in Europe choose rival Internet browsers, ending a decade-long
dispute and averting a possible fine for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The European Commission has to date imposed fines totalling

breached EU antitrust rules by bundling its Internet Explorer
web browser with its dominant Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Millions of European consumers will benefit from this
decision by having a free choice about which web browser they
use," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She said the company's pledge was an incentive for web

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON -- Nearly 90 members of the U.S. House are co-sponsoring an immigration reform bill that would make some broad changes to the H-1B program, as well as take the high-skilled employment debate in new directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation would create a federal agency to review U.S. employment needs, a new type of visa for start-up founders, as well as an increase the supply of H-1B visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the technology industry has tried in recent years to get Congress to increase the H-1B cap past 85,000, it has been stymied by proponents of comprehensive immigration reform who didn't want to peel away potential support for a broader bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But whether this 700-page, yet-to-be-released bill, will get the support of either the tech industry or H-1B critics is less than clear. Both sides may find things to love and hate in its basket of provisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One provision that may win tech industry support, calls for the release next year of all the unused H-1B visas from 1992-2008, around 309,000 visas, said one source who has seen some details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this House bill, dubbed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America's Security and Prosperity Act of 2009, also incorporates some of the provisions of H-1B bills introduced by visa critics Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) that broadly impose restrictions on H-1B use and tougher enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill would set "strict requirements for the recruitment of American workers," according to a House summary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a press conference today about the bill, U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), one of the bill's main sponsors, said, "If you want to bring a worker from outside the United States to come and work here, we want to make sure American workers get the first opportunity at every American job."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill exempts "several categories" of highly skilled workers from employment-based immigrant visa caps. But just what those categories include wasn't detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill would create a new, independent federal agency, to be called the "Commission on Immigration and Labor Markets," which would establish "employment-based immigration policies that promote economic growth and competitiveness while minimizing job displacement, wage depression and unauthorized employment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new agency would also recommend H-1B and other visa caps to Congress. The legislation also calls for the creation of a new visa, called the "Founders Visa." It's an idea that has been championed by Paul Graham , a programming language developer, and others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the U.S. is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley. It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country," he wrote earlier this year about the visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a long list of co-sponsors, the House bill has a long way to go. A competing immigration bill in the U.S. Senate is expected from U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, who heads of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Border Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schumer is a longtime supporter of the H-1B program , but Durbin and Grassley are on that committee as well. Schumer had planned to introduce it this year but has since delayed it until spring .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - In the lucrative business of underwriting and selling company stock, J.P. Morgan led the world's banks this year, earning an estimated $2.2 billion in fees, or nearly double what it hauled from the deals last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the investment banking industry, equity capital market (ECM) underwriting was the main driver of fees, marking a change in a sector where money made from advising on mergers and acquisitions is traditionally the cash cow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECM burst was driven by resurgent stock markets across the globe and the need for companies to raise cash after last year's market plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global ECM activity reached $866 billion this year, up 25 percent from 2008. Of that total figure, follow-on activity totaled $669 billion, with nearly half of that coming from banks seeking capital after the financial crisis took its toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan's (JPM.N) top ECM status this year came from 383 deals worth $98.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America (BAC.N) earned a No. 2 spot on the global ECM rankings (298, $72.4 billion), a surprising bump up from No. 4, given the turmoil that hit the bank beginning late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third slot went to Goldman Sachs (GS.N) (251, $71.3 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huge bank stock offerings early in the year from HSBC (HSBA.L), BofA and Japan's SMFG (8411.T), reflected on the ECM data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian IPOs led the ECM story in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight of the world's top ten IPOs came from Asia. Hong Kong was by far the world's most active stock market for IPOs, surpassing exchanges in New York and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of last week, Hong Kong was on pace to raise more than $25.6 billion in IPO proceeds this year, its second-largest total in the last decade and more than triple last year's figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter U.S. IPO volume reached $7.8 billion, its highest level in 7 quarters. By comparison, only two IPOs hit the London Stock Exchange this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the top 10 global ECM rankings, only two other banks aside from BofA moved two or more spots in the rankings: Citigroup (C.N) went from 5th last year to 8th this year; RBS (RBS.L) went from 12th to 10th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASIA IPO BOOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last major IPO wave to hit Hong Kong was 2007, at a time when the credit bubble and Asia's growth story were in full swing. Around $37.8 billion of IPO proceeds hit the Hong Kong exchange that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS (UBSN.VX) was the top IPO underwriter in Hong Kong this year, according to Thomson Reuters, bumping Morgan Stanley (MS.N) down one notch from the place it held during the 2007 bull run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup jumped to 4th place this year from 10th two years ago. Goldman was 7th this year, down from 4th in 2007, while BofA leapt to 6th place this year from 12th two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The after-market trading of the offerings has faced pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five of Hong Kong's six top IPOs this year are trading below their offering price, including China Minsheng Banking Corp. (600016.SS), casino group Sands China (1928.HK), and building materials company China Zhongwang (1333.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese windfarm company China Longyuan (0916.HK), which opened on December 10, is up 16 percent since its debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visanet VNET3.SA, the Brazilian affiliate of credit card company Visa Inc. (V.N), is trading 16 cents below its IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pakistan is delaying hundreds of visas for U.S. officials and contractors, a "very serious issue" that could hamper U.S. aid programs and further strain a critical alliance in the fight against Islamic extremism, U.S. officials said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This is big. It's not minor," a senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding the issue was being addressed with Islamabad at the highest levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we are pushing very hard and at very senior levels tells you the importance we place on it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Department spokesman Robert Wood, confirming a report about the visas in The New York Times, said the issue had been raised with the Pakistani authorities but the reason for the delays was still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are well aware of these concerns," he said. "I can't give you any reason why they are being delayed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior administration official said Pakistan had indicated it was processing the applications as quickly as it could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not satisfied with the answers we've been getting," he said. As for Pakistan moving as quickly as it could, "I'm sure it's not happening," the official said. "I don't think it. I know it's not happening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan's ambassador to the United States attributed the delay in part to bureaucratic inefficiency, coupled with an "exponential" growth in the number of Americans in Pakistan. He said there was no intentional effort to delay issuing visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't go so far as characterizing it as a deliberate campaign of harassment. Pakistan and the U.S. remain allies," Ambassador Husain Haqqani said on CNN's "The Situation Room."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delay in visa approvals is threatening to hamper or disrupt U.S. aid programs aimed at stabilizing the Islamabad government and helping the Pakistani people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan's effort to oust the Afghan Taliban in its northwestern border areas is critical to U.S. attempts to roll back the Taliban campaign in neighboring Afghanistan, where Washington is sending in 30,000 additional troops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington's relations with Islamabad have already been strained by Pakistan's reluctance to heed U.S. pressure to crack down harder on militants within its own borders, with Pakistan officials saying they cannot move too fast without provoking a backlash against U.S.-aligned President Asif Ali Zardari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood said the visa delays could have an effect on a range of U.S. aid programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this continues, it will indeed have an impact," he said. "We are trying to work these issues with the government of Pakistan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Congress passed legislation last October for a $7.5 billion nonmilitary aid program over the next five years for Pakistan. The first tranche of that aid, amounting to nearly $1.5 billion for the next year, was agreed to by appropriations committees in Congress over the past week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're committed to trying to help the people of Pakistan. And these programs ... will be impacted if we are unable to get our people in to do the work," the senior administration official said, noting Congress was watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'VERY, VERY SERIOUS ISSUE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a very, very serious issue for us," the official said, adding, "We can't do our work if we don't have those visas renewed or ... processed." The affected programs included agriculture, security and military, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Pentagon official, while declining to comment on the visa issue, acknowledged, "There are tensions on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are things that Pakistan wants that we're not able to do, things that we want that Pakistan is not able to do," David Sedney, deputy assistant secretary of defense, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sometimes our discussions with our Pakistani colleagues are very, very difficult. Other times they are very, very positive," he said, adding there was an increasingly positive trend "both in discussions and results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His comments followed high-level bilateral defense talks in Washington earlier this month, which Sedney said gave the Obama administration a chance to explain a war strategy involving an increase of 30,000 forces into Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Phil Stewart; Writing by Andrew Quinn and David Alexander; Editing by Peter Cooney)&lt;/p&gt;

Washington's relations with Islamabad have already been strained by Pakistan's reluctance to heed U.S. pressure to crack down harder on militants within its own borders, with Pakistan officials saying they cannot move too fast without provoking a backlash against U.S.-aligned President Asif Ali Zardari. Wood said the visa delays could have an effect on a range of U.S. aid programs. If this continues, it will indeed have an impact, he said. We are trying to work these issues with the government of Pakistan. The U.S. Congress passed legislation last October for a $7.5 billion nonmilitary aid program over the next five years for Pakistan. The first tranche of that aid, amounting to nearly $1.5 billion for the next year, was agreed to by appropriations committees in Congress over the past week. We're committed to trying to help the people of Pakistan. And these programs ... will be impacted if we are unable to get our people in to do the work, the senior administration official said, noting Congress was watching. 'VERY, VERY SERIOUS ISSUE' This is a very, very serious issue for us, the official said, adding, We can't do our work if we don't have those visas renewed or ... processed. The affected programs included agriculture, security and military, he said. The official stopped short of characterizing it as a breakdown in the relationship. Relationships, particularly one as as important as this one, as complex as this one, you're going to have these types of issues, he said. I don't want to belittle it, as I said. I mean this is something that has got the attention of senior people ... and we're going to continue to follow through on it. A senior Pentagon official, while declining to comment on the visa issue, acknowledged, There are tensions on both sides. There are things that Pakistan wants that we're not able to do, things that we want that Pakistan is not able to do, David Sedney, deputy assistant secretary of defense, told reporters. Sometimes our discussions with our Pakistani colleagues are very, very difficult. Other times they are very, very positive, he said, adding there was an increasingly positive trend both in discussions and results. His comments followed high-level bilateral defense talks in Washington earlier this month, which Sedney said gave the Obama administration a chance to explain a war strategy involving an increase of 30,000 forces into Afghanistan.

&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Conceptus, Inc. (Nasdaq:CPTS), developer of the Essure procedure, the first
proven non-incisional permanent birth control method available, today announced
that Mark Sieczkarek, president and chief executive officer, will present at the
28th Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference on Thursday January 14, 2010, at
12:00 p.m. PT. The conference will be held at The Westin St. Francis Hotel in
San Francisco.

will be available for a period of 30 days. 

About the Essure&#174;Procedure

The Essure procedure, FDA approved since 2002, is the first permanent birth
control method that can be performed in the comfort of a physician`s office in
about 10 minutes (average hysteroscopic time) without hormones, cutting, burning
or the risks associated with general anesthesia or tubal ligation. Small,
flexible micro-inserts are placed in a woman`s fallopian tubes through the
cervix without incisions. Over the next three months, the body forms a natural
barrier around the micro-inserts to prevent sperm from reaching the egg. Essure
is 99.8% effective based on four years of follow up with zero pregnancies
reported in clinical trials, making it the most effective form of permanent
birth control on the market. The procedure is covered by most insurance plans,
and when it is performed in a doctor`s office the cost may be as low as a simple
co-pay. 

Three months after the Essure procedure, a doctor performs an Essure
Confirmation Test to confirm that the fallopian tubes are fully blocked, and
that the patient can rely on Essure for permanent birth control. Essure has been
proven and trusted by physicians since 2002, with more than 340,000 women
worldwide having undergone the Essure procedure.

&lt;p&gt;BERNE (Reuters) - Frenchman Richard Gasquet has been cleared over a positive cocaine test after sport's highest court accepted that he was probably contaminated inadvertently by kissing a woman in a nightclub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The player has been exonerated from any fault or negligence," the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said as it rejected an appeal from the International Tennis Federation (IFT) and World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), who had asked for a one-to-two year ban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On a balance of probability, the CAS panel concluded that it was more likely than not that the player's contamination with cocaine resulted, as Gasquet always asserted, from kissing a woman in a nightclub in Miami on the day before the anti-doping test and that the player had met the required standards of proof with respect to the way of ingestion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world number 52, who appeared before a CAS hearing in Lausanne in November, was provisionally suspended in May after a sample he provided in March tested positive for benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am totally relieved," Gasquet told French television channel Canal Plus. "It was a crazy story and I went through a nightmare for eight months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought I had more chances to win grand slams, to beat (Rafael) Nadal at Roland-Garros and (Roger) Federer at Wimbledon than to be tested positive," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am happy to be a hundred per cent cleared. It was very difficult for me, I'm glad it's over. I am now ready to go to Australia on December 28, to play two tournaments there and to enter the Australian Open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mentally, it was very tough. I could have done without all this but now I'm happy to be back on the tennis courts. My goal is to make it back into the top 10."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gasquet, who finished 2007 in the top 10 of the ATP rankings, always claimed his innocence and said he had a hair sample tested by an independent lab which showed no trace of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INADVERTENTLY CONTAMINATED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, an independent tribunal set up under the tennis anti-doping programme, found the 23-year-old guilty but ruled that he had been inadvertently contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gasquet, winner of five ATP titles including three in 2006, was banned for two months and 15 days, backdated to May 1, and the tribunal ruled that his results, ranking points and prize money from subsequent events would stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the ITF and WADA appealed to CAS in August for a heavier sanction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CAS panel decided to dismiss the appeals after having found that in this particular case Richard Gasquet had not committed any fault or negligence within the meaning of the ITF Anti-Doping Programme," the CAS statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CAS panel noted that a doping offence was correctly reported because of the presence of a minuscule quantity of benzoylecgonine in the player's urine, but that it was not the result of a fault or negligence of the player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was also established that the player was clearly not a regular cocaine user, even in very small amounts. As a consequence, the possibility of contamination became the most plausible explanation justifying the presence of cocaine metabolite in the player's urine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ITF expressed its disappointment at the CAS decision to clear Gasquet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ITF is disappointed with today's decision of the Court of Arbitration for Sport to dismiss the ITF's and WADA's (World Anti-Doping Agency) appeal against the decision imposed on Richard Gasquet by an independent tribunal in July 2009," ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Patrick Vignal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ed Osmond)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Visa delays raises tension between allies * U.S. aid programs affected, no reasons given WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Pakistan has delayed hundreds of visas for U.S. officials and contractors, the State Department said on Thursday, adding tension to a relationship already strained by the battle against Islamic extremists. If this continues, it will indeed have an impact, State Department spokesman Robert Wood told a news briefing, confirming a report in the New York Times. We are trying to work these issues with the government of Pakistan. Pakistan's efforts to oust the Afghan Taliban in its northwestern border areas are critical to U.S. attempts to roll back the Taliban campaign in neighboring Afghanistan, where Washington is sending 30,000 additional troops. Wood said the delays, which affect hundreds of applications for visas and visa renewals, had been noted for months and covered officials and contractors engaged in a wide range of activities. He said U.S. officials had been in touch with the Pakistani government but as yet had no clear picture on why the visas were not being issued.They are well aware of these concerns, Wood said. I can't give you any reason why they are being delayed. The New York Times said U.S. officials have described the visa problems as part of a broader effort to harass U.S. diplomats that also included frequent searches of U.S. diplomatic vehicles in major cities. The newspaper said the problem affected military attaches, CIA officers, development experts and junior-level diplomats and quoted one source as saying some U.S. aid programs to Pakistan are grinding to a halt as a result.The U.S. Congress passed legislation last October for a $7.5 billion nonmilitary aid program over the next five years for Pakistan. The first tranche of that aid, amounting to nearly $1.5 billion for the next year, was agreed by appropriations committees in Congress over the past week. Washington's relations with Islamabad have already been strained by Pakistan's reluctance to heed U.S. pressure to crack down harder on militants within its own borders, saying they cannot move too fast without provoking a backlash against U.S.-aligned President Asif Ali Zardari.

The corrected release reads: 

THE SIMON LAW FIRM FILES TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT SUIT AGAINST MICROSOFT ON BEHALF
OF BING!

St. Louis-based company alleges unfair competition and trademark infringement

Bing! Information Design has sued Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT), alleging
trademark infringement and unfair competition over Microsoft`s use of Bing for
its search engine. 

The suit, Bing! Information Design LLC v. Microsoft Corporation, cause no.
0922-AC18341, was filed Dec. 16 in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis
and asserts claims for trademark infringement, unfair competition and tortious
interference with business expectancy. 

Bing! Information Design is an Internet-related company that creates interactive
and computer-related illustrations, designs, interactive graphics, animations,
technical diagrams and related services. The St. Louis-based company has used
the mark Bing! since at least 2000 and has applications pending to register the
mark . Bing! uses the Internet, search engines and its Web page as its primary
sources of advertising and promotion. 

In 2009, Microsoft launched Bing, an Internet business that includes a visual
and graphics search component. Microsoft heavily advertises and promotes the
Bing search engine. 

In its lawsuit, Bing! Information Design alleges that Microsoft infringed on its
trademark when it started using Bing for its search engine. The plaintiff
alleges that the name causes confusion with regard to the relationship between
the plaintiff and the defendant, confuses the public with regard to the origin
of the plaintiff`s services and dilutes the value of the plaintiff`s trademark.
The plaintiff also claims that Microsoft knew of plaintiff`s trademark rights in
the name before using the mark Bing. 

The suit seeks actual and punitive damages including having Microsoft pay for
corrective advertising to remedy the confusion it caused. 

Bing! Information Design is represented by Anthony G. Simon, John G. Simon and
Stephanie H. To, all of St. Louis` The Simon Law Firm. 

"For nearly 10 years my client has been using the Bing! mark," explains Anthony
Simon. "My client selected this unique mark to distinguish itself in the
marketplace and invested substantial time and effort promoting its business
using Bing!. Microsoft`s use of the identical mark and its aggressive
advertising have gutted all of my client`s efforts to distinguish its business
and created confusion that must be remedied." 

The Simon Law Firm handles intellectual property, commercial and business
litigation cases nationwide.

&lt;p&gt;St. Louis-based company alleges unfair competition and trademark infringement
ST. LOUIS--(Business Wire)--
Bing! Interactive Design has sued Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT), alleging
trademark infringement and unfair competition over Microsoft`s use of Bing for
its search engine. 

The suit, Bing! Information Design LLC v. Microsoft Corporation, cause no.
0922-AC18341, was filed Dec. 16 in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis
and asserts claims for trademark infringement, unfair competition and tortious
interference with business expectancy. 

Bing! Information Design is an Internet-related company that creates interactive
and computer-related illustrations, designs, interactive graphics, animations,
technical diagrams and related services. The St. Louis-based company has used
the mark Bing! since at least 2000 and has applications pending to register the
mark . Bing! uses the Internet, search engines and its Web page as its primary
sources of advertising and promotion. 

In 2009, Microsoft launched Bing, an Internet business that includes a visual
and graphics search component. Microsoft heavily advertises and promotes the
Bing search engine. 

In its lawsuit, Bing! Information Design alleges that Microsoft infringed on its
trademark when it started using Bing for its search engine. The plaintiff
alleges that the name causes confusion with regard to the relationship between
the plaintiff and the defendant, confuses the public with regard to the origin
of the plaintiff`s services and dilutes the value of the plaintiff`s trademark.
The plaintiff also claims that Microsoft knew of plaintiff`s trademark rights in
the name before using the mark Bing. 

The suit seeks actual and punitive damages including having Microsoft pay for
corrective advertising to remedy the confusion it caused. 

Bing! Information Design is represented by Anthony G. Simon, John G. Simon and
Stephanie H. To, all of St. Louis` The Simon Law Firm. 

"For nearly 10 years my client has been using the Bing! mark," explains Anthony
Simon. "My client selected this unique mark to distinguish itself in the
marketplace and invested substantial time and effort promoting its business
using Bing!. Microsoft`s use of the identical mark and its aggressive
advertising have gutted all of my client`s efforts to distinguish its business
and created confusion that must be remedied." 

The Simon Law Firm handles intellectual property, commercial and business
litigation cases nationwide.

&lt;p&gt;* Full-year 2009 comparable diluted EPS now expected to be in a range of $1.56
to $1.59.
* Share repurchase expected to total approximately $600 million by year-end
2010.

* Free cash flow expected to remain strong and enhance the company`s ability to
return cash to shareowners.

ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE) today announced 2010 financial guidance that
includes high single-digit earnings per diluted share growth and continued
strong free cash flow. In addition, the company will resume its existing share
repurchase programs and expects to complete the purchase of shares totaling $600
million by the end of 2010. 

The company also increased its full-year 2009 guidance for comparable, diluted
earnings per share to a range of $1.56 to $1.59. 

"Our strong 2009 results and positive growth outlook for 2010 reflect the
benefits of our work to maximize brand value, to enhance the system
effectiveness and efficiency, and to provide customers with the highest levels
of service," said John F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. "Despite
the impact of a difficult economic environment, we have made tremendous progress
in 2009, delivering profit growth exceeding our long-term objectives. 

"As a result of this progress, and our focus on strengthening our balance sheet,
we are now able to begin substantially increasing returns to our shareowners,"
Mr. Brock said. "Driving shareowner value remains our most important objective,
and long-term success will demand even greater diligence in strengthening every
level of our company." 

2009 OUTLOOK

For full-year 2009, comparable earnings per diluted share is expected in a range
of $1.56 to $1.59, including negative foreign currency impact of 14 to 15 cents
and excluding items affecting comparability. Excluding the impact of currency,
revenue will increase in a low to mid single-digit range and after including the
impact of currency will decline slightly on a reported basis. 

For 2009, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $850 million, net of an
expected additional pension contribution of approximately $150 million in the
fourth quarter 2009. Capital expenditures will total approximately $900 million.
The effective tax rate for 2009 is expected to be approximately 25 percent. 

SHARE REPURCHASE

CCE said that continued strong free cash flow, an improved long-term operating
outlook and a strengthened balance sheet will allow a rebalance in the use of
free cash flow from debt reduction to increasing returns of cash to shareowners.
The company said its share repurchase plans may be adjusted depending on
economic, operating, or other factors, including acquisition opportunities. CCE
plans to begin repurchasing its shares during the first quarter of 2010 under
previously authorized share repurchase programs. Repurchased shares will be
added to treasury stock and made available for general corporate purposes,
including acquisition financing and the funding of various employee benefit and
compensation plans. 

In addition to the share repurchase program, the company will seek consistent
annual dividend increases. CCE has doubled its dividend per share since 2006 and
is currently paying an annualized dividend of 32 cents per share, a 14 percent
increase over prior year. 

2010 OUTLOOK

For 2010, the company expects operating income will increase in a mid to high
single-digit range, driven by mid single-digit growth in both Europe and North
America. Revenue should increase at a low single-digit rate, driven by mid
single-digit growth in Europe and slight growth in North America. 

Comparable earnings per diluted share will increase at a high single-digit rate,
excluding currency. Though it is too early to accurately evaluate 2010 currency
impact, at current rates, currency would add approximately 4 cents of EPS
favorability. 

The company also expects strong free cash flow of approximately $800 million,
and capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion. Interest expense is
expected to decline modestly, and the effective tax rate for 2010 is expected to

&lt;p&gt;  WOODINVILLE, WA, Dec 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Quosal Inc. today announced full support and immediate availability for 
Microsoft(R) SQL Azure(TM) Database cloud for its on-demand Quote and
Proposal platform. With SQL Azure support, Quosal offers sales teams a
cost-effective, highly secure and turn-key way to host and backup their
Quosal data and access the application from multiple locations, desktop
and/or device.

    Quosal, which can be deployed as an installed or on-demand application,
is the ultimate software tool for the preparation, delivery and
management of both simple form-based quotes and complex, multi-section
proposals. With Quosal users can create timely, accurate, high-quality
and attractive quotes and proposals with tight CRM integration and
up-to-the-minute pricing, availability, promotions, product specs, images
and more -- in a fraction of the time it normally takes.

    In its  review of Quosal, Small Business Computing.com
(www.smallbusinesscomputing.com) said, "Quosal's handsomely designed
interface is one of the best-looking user interfaces we've seen on a
business application... no matter what type of documents your sales staff
needs in order to pitch a deal, from simple price quotes to lengthy
scope-of-work proposals, Quosal has you covered. It makes creating quotes
easy -- and tracking them in one place even easier."

    Using Quosal Order Porter, sales professionals can create personal web
pages for customers who can electronically select desired options,
confirm their order, and digitally sign-off on the contract. Order Porter
can also be used as collaboration platform for colleagues to make
comments/updates to quotes and proposals as they go through the sales
process.

    Leveraging its advanced architecture and self-maintaining database, Quosal
is off-the-shelf compatible with SQL Azure in a move that further
distances it from competitive products.

their quotes and proposals in a matter of minutes," said Kent McNall,

need to access the central data, it's equally simple to set up the shared
data access for everyone to use."

will offer professional service support, including Azure account set up,
configuration and database management. Quosal will also provide an equally
easy and convenient implementation for users who have obtained their own
Azure accounts from Microsoft or other providers.

    "Microsoft offers excellent options for cloud-hosted databases, and many
of our users will pay only $9.95 per month for full hosting services,
which is a tremendous value for a secure, reliable, universally available
Quosal database that's hosted in your own geographical region. Microsoft
is also offering some great start-up promotions," added McNall.

    In addition to offering geographical data support with Azure, Quosal
offers a flexible range of deployment options ranging from single-user PC
to complete enterprise deployments via shared central databases or hosted
databases.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said it can pull out of its $30 billion acquisition of XTO Energy XTO.N if U.S. lawmakers pass legislation on a controversial drilling technique used to tap oil and gas fields.&lt;/p&gt;

First Head-to-Head Trial Designed to Compare Toviaz 8 mg with Detrol LA 4 mg
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Patients treated with Toviaz&#174; (fesoterodine fumarate) 8 mg extended release
tablets had greater and statistically significant reductions in urge urinary
incontinence episodes at week 12 (P=0.017) compared with Detrol&#174; LA (tolterodine
tartrate extended release capsules) in a placebo-controlled randomized clinical
trial. The primary endpoint of the study was reductions in urge urinary
incontinence episodes. This new study, published today in the January issue of
BJU International, is the first head-to-head superiority trial specifically
designed to compare the two medications. 

When looking at prespecified secondary endpoints, patients treated with Toviaz 8
mg had a significantly greater increase in the average volume of urine voided
per micturition from baseline to week 12 compared with those who received Detrol
LA (P=0.005). The differences between Toviaz 8 mg and Detrol LA in urinary
frequency (P=0.380) and urgency episodes (P=0.054) were not statistically
significant. 

"This is the first clinical trial that has been designed to assess the
superiority of an antimuscarinic agent for the treatment of overactive bladder.
This new data provides important information to physicians making treatment
decisions for patients with overactive bladder since it compares two available
medicines. This study showed that Toviaz 8 mg was significantly more efficacious
than Detrol LA in treating urge urinary incontinence," said lead author Dr.
Sender Herschorn, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto. 

About the Study

Of the 1,712 patients enrolled in this 12-week, randomized, double-blinded,
placebo-controlled superiority study, 1,697 were randomized to receive either
Toviaz 8 mg (n=679), Detrol LA 4 mg (n=684) or placebo (n=334) once daily for 12
weeks. All patients in the Toviaz group started on Toviaz 4 mg for one week,
followed by Toviaz 8 mg for 11 weeks. 

The most frequently reported adverse events were dry mouth (28 percent in the
Toviaz 8 mg group, 16 percent in the Detrol LA group and 6 percent in the
placebo group), headache (6 percent in the Toviaz 8 mg group, 3 percent in the
Detrol LA group and 2 percent in the placebo group), and constipation (5 percent
in the Toviaz 8 mg group, 4 percent in the Detrol LA group and 3 percent in the
placebo group). Discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events were 2
percent in the placebo group, 4 percent in the Detrol LA group and 6 percent in
the Toviaz group. 

After the study was completed, additional analyses (post hoc analyses) were
done. In one post hoc analysis, patients in the study who were treated with
Toviaz 8 mg showed statistically significant improvements over those treated
with Detrol LA (P=0.015) as assessed by the three-day diary dry rate at week 12.
Toviaz 8 mg also produced significantly greater improvements compared with
Detrol LA as measured by the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (P&lt;0.001)
and Urgency Perception Scale (P=0.014)at week 12. 

Also in a post hoc analysis, patients in the study who were treated with Toviaz
8 mg showed significantly greater improvements over those treated with Detrol LA
on all sections except one of the Overactive Bladder questionnaire, a
questionnaire which assesses the bothersomeness of symptoms and health-related
quality of life. At week 12, significant improvements were found in: Symptom
Bother (P&lt;0.001) and total health-related quality of life (P=0.006) as well as
the Concern (P=0.008), Coping (P=0.002) and Social Interaction (P=0.019)
sections of the questionnaire; improvements in the Sleep section (P=0.081) were
not significant. 

The results of a second head-to-head clinical trial with identical study design
confirm the superiority of Toviaz 8 mg over Detrol LA 4 mg on the primary
endpoint, urge urinary incontinence at week 12. As with this first trial, the
results are planned to be submitted in 2010 for publication. 

About Toviaz

Toviaz is an FDA-approved, once-daily prescription treatment for patients with
symptoms of overactive bladder. Affecting an estimated one in six people,
overactive bladder symptoms include frequent and sudden urges to urinate and
wetting accidents. Toviaz comes with the YourWay&#8482; 
      plan (www.ToviazYourWay.com), a simple program designed to help educate
patients about their condition and treatment expectations, and to encourage and
empower patients to become more engaged in their treatment. 

The recommended starting dose of Toviaz is 4 mg once daily. Based upon
individual response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 8 mg once
daily. The ability to titrate the dose of Toviaz allows physicians to customize
treatment for each patient based on individual history and need. Toviaz is not
recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment. 

Doses greater than 4 mg are not recommended in patients with severe renal
insufficiency or in patients taking a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor; in patients
taking a weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, careful assessment at 4 mg is
advised prior to increasing to 8 mg. 

Important Information for Toviaz

If patients have certain stomach problems, glaucoma, or cannot empty their
bladder, they should not take Toviaz. 

Medicines like Toviaz can cause blurred vision, drowsiness, and decreased
sweating. Patients should use caution when driving, doing unsafe tasks, or in
especially hot environments, until they know how Toviaz affects them. Drinking
alcohol while taking medicines such as Toviaz may cause increased drowsiness. 

The most common side effects are dry mouth and constipation. 

Toviaz treats the symptoms of overactive bladder (leaks, strong sudden urges to
go, going too often). 

Toviaz has benefits and risks. There may be other options. 

Important Information for Detrol LA

Patients should not take Detrol LA if they have certain types of stomach
problems, glaucoma, or cannot empty their bladder. The most common side effect
is dry mouth. Other side effects may include headache, constipation, and
abdominal pain. 

Detrol LA treats the symptoms of overactive bladder (leaks, strong sudden urges
to go, going too often). The recommended dose of Detrol LA is 4 mg daily. For
patients with significantly reduced hepatic function or renal function or who
are currently taking drugs that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, the recommended
dose of Detrol LA is 2 mg daily. 

Detrol LA has benefits and risks. There may be other options.

&lt;p&gt;It was a week where competition regulators danced with IT industry behemoths: the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust lawsuit against Intel, while the European Commission gave approval to Microsoft's proposed browser "ballot screen" and pushed the proposed Oracle-Sun Microsystems deal forward. Meanwhile, a French court slapped down Google for what it saw as a copyright grab in a book-scanning case.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;1. EU approves Microsoft ballot screen, Microsoft browser antitrust agreement gets cautious backing and With EU browser case dropped, Microsoft seeks trust, interoperability: The European Commission's antitrust investigation into Microsoft ended with the approval of the company's proposal for allowing Windows 7 users a choice of browsers. The agreement received cautious applause, with a reminder from one critic that Microsoft has a history of "inadequate commitments and broken promises." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

Paris court rules against Google in book copyright case: A Paris court slapped Google with a fine for breach of copyright in its book-search project and ordered that the company stop distributing digital copies of French books to users in that country without first getting publishers' permission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Oracle, Sun merger gains favor in Europe: The European Commission appears poised to approve Oracle's proposed acquisition of Sun after a review of the latest promises from Oracle about how it will safeguard competition in the database software market.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.

Then Plurk said the apology might not be enough and that it is considering "all possibilities," including a lawsuit in light of Microsoft's admission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Apple granted permanent injunction against Psystar: A U.S. District Court judge granted a permanent injunction to Apple against Mac clone-maker Psystar, which has until Dec. 31 to comply with the court ruling.

Facebook target of FTC privacy complaint and Facebook privacy complaint ignites war of words: Well, we had a feeling last week we should clear space in the weekly top-news list for ongoing Facebook privacy policy coverage. Sure enough, 10 privacy groups filed a complaint with the FTC this week about the privacy policy changes that were announced last week. The privacy groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, contend that the policy changes "violate user expectations, diminish user privacy, and contradict Facebook's own representations."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is updating its Dynamics ERP (enterprise resource planning) suites to accommodate changes in Europe's VAT (value-added tax) law that take effect next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting Jan. 1, business will have to report the sale to other companies within the European Union of not only goods but also services, which means their ERP systems will have to be capable of delivering that information. According to the E.U., business-to-business suppliers of services will be taxed based on where the customer is located rather than the where the supplier is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the layout of the new tax report is different for each of the 27 countries in the E.U.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updates will upgrade Dynamics ERP systems, although Microsoft said customers need to subscribe to its Business Ready Enhancement Plan. The plan entitles subscribers to software upgrades for tax changes, among other features. Customers also must be on a still-supported version of Dynamics ERP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updates are for Dynamics AX, GP and NAV that support VAT 2010 within the core application, Microsoft said. The company will release further updates when other E.U. member countries specify more local details about the tax changes.&lt;/p&gt;

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Industry Outlook. Today, Zacks Equity Research
discusses the Healthcare Industry, including UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:
UNH), Cigna Corp. (NYSE: CI), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), GlaxoSmithKline Plc
(NYSE: GSK) and Merck &amp; Co Inc. (NYSE: MRK). 

A synopsis of today`s Industry Outlook is presented below. The full article can
be read at
http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/28445/Healthcare+Stock+Review+-+Dec.+2009. 

Healthcare Stock Review - Dec. 2009

The healthcare sector comprises different industries, ranging from managed care
organizations, healthcare facilities providers and medical devices manufacturers
to biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Consequently, we believe that investors
in this sector should be mindful of the different drivers and appropriate
metrics associated with the various sub-sectors. 

In the present scenario, investor sentiment in healthcare continues to be driven
by decisions in Congress related to government funding and the state of the
broader economy. In view of the ongoing healthcare reform debate in Congress,
healthcare policy changes remain an important indicator to investing in the
sector. 

Even though legislation -- which aims to cover nearly all Americans by providing
government subsidies to help pay premiums irrespective of health or income --
was passed in the House of Representatives, it is facing opposition in the
Senate mainly due to the government`s intention to compete with private
insurers. 

Under the legislation, practices such as denying coverage on the basis of
pre-existing medical conditions would be discontinued and insurers would no
longer be able to charge higher premiums on the basis of gender or medical
history. Furthermore, the industry would no longer enjoy an exemption from
federal antitrust restrictions on price gouging, bid rigging and market
allocation. Health insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH) and
Cigna Corp. (NYSE: CI) could face increased competition, more scrutiny and fewer
protections under the bill. 

The House version of the bill would not be profitable to drugmakers like Pfizer
Inc. (NYSE: PFE), GlaxoSmithKline Plc (NYSE: GSK) and Merck &amp; Co Inc. (NYSE:
MRK). They would be required to pay rebates to the government for drugs used by
the elderly and disabled Medicare patients who also are on Medicaid.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Treasury Delays Citi Stock Sale

The U.S. Treasury has postponed its plan to sell $5 billion of its 34% stake in
Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) after a lackluster response from investors following
Citi's stock offering. Citigroup stock has been under pressure this morning, in
an overall soft market. 

Citigroup priced its $20.5 billion offering yesterday. However, due to a poor
response by investors, Citi had to sell the shares at a discounted price of
$3.15 a share. This was 10 cents below the price that the Treasury had paid to
buy the shares earlier. 

The Treasury has also announced an extension of its lock-up period on the sale
of its 7.7 billion shares of Citi to 90 days from 45 days following the
completion of this offering. 

Citigroup had received $45 billion of TARP fund last year. Later, around $25
billion of that was converted into common stock, representing nearly 34% of its
stake held by taxpayers. The Treasury had to pay $3.25 a share for this stake.
Citi has $20 billion of TARP funds to repay. 

Yesterday, Citigroup has priced its 5.4 billion stock offering at $3.15 per
share, generating net proceeds of approximately $17 billion. Citi has also
priced its tangible equity units offering at $100 each, generating net proceeds
of approximately $3.5 billion, of which approximately $2.8 billion would be
counted as equity. 

However, the good news is that the Internal Revenue Service has given a tax
break of $38 billion to Citi for its TARP payback agreement. 

While the repayment of the TARP fund through the common stock offering will free
Citigroup from government interventions and pay restrictions, this offering
leads to significant earnings dilution for Citi. 

Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) has already repaid the entire $45 billion of TARP
funds to the Treasury following its $19.3 billion of equity offering recently.
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE: WFC) has also announced a $12.25 billion of common
stock offering to repay the $25 billion TARP fund it received. 

Other major banks that have already paid back their TARP funds to the Treasury
include Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM).

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - In the lucrative business of underwriting and selling company stock, J.P. Morgan led the world's banks this year, earning an estimated $2.2 billion in fees, or nearly double what it hauled from the deals last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the investment banking industry, equity capital market (ECM) underwriting was the main driver of fees, marking a change in a sector where money made from advising on mergers and acquisitions is traditionally the cash cow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECM burst was driven by resurgent stock markets across the globe and the need for companies to raise cash after last year's market plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global ECM activity reached $888.9 billion this year, up 27.7 percent from 2008. Of that total figure, follow-on activity totaled $689 billion, with nearly half of that coming from banks seeking capital after the financial crisis took its toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) top ECM status this year came from 386 deals worth $98.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) earned a No. 2 spot on the global ECM rankings (255, $76.5 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third slot went to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) (300, $71.2 billion), a surprising bump up from No. 4, given the turmoil that hit the bank beginning late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huge bank stock offerings early in the year from HSBC (HSBA.L), BofA and Japan's SMFG (8411.T), reflected on the ECM data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian IPOs led the ECM story in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight of the world's top 10 IPOs came from Asia. Hong Kong was by far the world's most active stock market for IPOs, surpassing exchanges in New York and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of last week, Hong Kong was on pace to raise more than $25.6 billion in IPO proceeds this year, its second-largest total in the last decade and more than triple last year's figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter U.S. IPO volume reached $8.7 billion, its highest level in 7 quarters. By comparison, only three IPOs hit the London Stock Exchange this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the top 10 global ECM rankings, only two other banks aside from BofA moved two or more spots in the rankings: Citigroup (C.N) went from 5th last year to 8th this year; RBS (RBS.L) went from 12th to 10th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASIA IPO BOOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last major IPO wave to hit Hong Kong was 2007, at a time when the credit bubble and Asia's growth story were in full swing. Around $37.8 billion of IPO proceeds hit the Hong Kong exchange that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS (UBSN.VX) was the top IPO underwriter in Hong Kong this year, according to Thomson Reuters, bumping Morgan Stanley (MS.N) down one notch from the place it held during the 2007 bull run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup jumped to 4th place this year from 10th two years ago. Goldman was 7th this year, down from 4th in 2007, while BofA leapt to 6th place this year from 12th two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The after-market trading of the offerings has faced pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five of Hong Kong's six top IPOs this year are trading below their offering price, including China Minsheng Banking Corp. (600016.SS), casino group Sands China (1928.HK), and building materials company China Zhongwang (1333.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese windfarm company China Longyuan (0916.HK), which opened on December 10, is up 16 percent since its debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visanet VNET3.SA, the Brazilian affiliate of credit card company Visa Inc. (V.N), is trading 16 cents below its IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *Goldman Sachs winding down life settlement index&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *Goldman decision follows Congressional hearing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *Credit crunch crushes exotic securities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Matthew Goldstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is
quietly backing away from life settlements--- the business of
buying life insurance policies from aging Americans in the
hopes of collecting on the death benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street investment bank is ending its involvement
with a "mortality index" it launched in December 2007 with high
expectations. A Goldman spokesman confirmed the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's QXX index tracks the life expectancy of a group
of people aged 65 and older who have sold their life insurance
policies to an investment pool that's managed by another firm,
AVS Underwriting LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street company once had big plans to sell
derivatives pegged to the index to investors seeking exposure
to the estimated $15 billion life settlements market. Goldman
also saw the derivatives as a potential hedge for any
institutional investor buying a security or note backed by
another pool of life settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the market for Goldman's index-based life settlement
derivatives appears to be a casualty of the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression, said executives with several
life settlements firms, who didn't want to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and other Wall Street investment banks began moving
into life settlements in 2006. The banks viewed the market as a
potential profit center, given the advancing age of the baby
boomer population and the need for some of them to supplement
their retirement incomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, the market for exotic securities of all stripes
has withered and Wall Street is struggling to revive interest
in even the most mundane type of securitized products -- bonds
backed by a pool of loans, mortgages or credit card debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market for bonds backed by life settlements --
so-called "death bonds" -- has been even slower to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally confirmed that Goldman
recently decided to end its involvement with the life
settlements index. "It never really did much of a commercial
business," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But executives in the life settlements business said
Goldman may also be throwing in the towel on its fledgling
index because the firm is wary of the "headline risk"
associated with these speculative investments. The executives
did not want to be identified because some of them do business
with Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics argue that life settlements are nothing more than
an opportunity for a speculator to make a wager that a policy
seller will die sooner rather than later. Investors profit by
buying policies at a fraction of their face value and
collecting on the death benefit when the person who sells the
policy dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In September, the House Financial Services Committee held a
hearing on Wall Street's involvement in the life settlement
market and asked Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein or one
of his "designees" to testify. The firm sent Steven Strongin, a
managing director, to testify. He told the panel that life
settlements represented a "very small percentage of our overall
business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strongin also testified the company had never been involved
in a life settlement securitization and had "no plans to
execute one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DuVally declined to comment on the future of the firm's two
other life settlements businesses, Longmore Capital and
Longmore Credit. "We don't comment on our business strategies,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Longmore subsidiaries are in the business of acquiring
life settlements or providing financing for those transactions.
Goldman formed the businesses some three years ago after
deciding against buying an existing San Diego-based firm called
Life Settlement Solutions.

year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eight of the world's top 10 IPOs came from Asia. Hong Kong
was by far the world's most active stock market for IPOs,
surpassing exchanges in New York and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carve-out IPOs did particularly well this year, said Bank
of America Merrill Lynch Global Head of Equity Capital Markets
Lisa Carnoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In general, investors made a lot of money on carve-outs
because they're mature, proven companies," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She expects more carve-outs in 2010 -- companies carving
out similar businesses in different regions, businesses that
are different from the parent company, or businesses with
different growth profiles from the parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carnoy said investors are still cautious, but she expects
the market to improve further in 2010, and added there could be
more healthcare and tech IPOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We still have sectors that have been relatively quiet,
including growth sectors like healthcare and tech, which are
usually the lion's share of IPO market," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carnoy said U.S. investors have more sector-dedicated funds
and are often willing to pay a premium for tech, healthcare,
and new media stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of last week, Hong Kong was on pace to raise more than
$25.6 billion in IPO proceeds this year, its second largest
total in the last decade and more than triple last year's
figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quarterly U.S. IPO volume reached $8.7 billion, its highest
in 7 quarters. By comparison, only three IPOs hit the London
Stock Exchange this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the top 10 global ECM rankings, only two other banks
aside from BofA moved two or more spots in the rankings:
Citigroup Inc (C.N) went from 5th last year to 8th this year;
RBS (RBS.L) went from 12th to 10th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The IPO market, itself, has had difficulties in getting
continuous traction, but at the end of the day we are -- and we
will continue to be -- in a deal-by-deal specific environment,"
said Deutsche Bank Global Co-Head of Equity Capital Markets
Mark Hantho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There was a larger volume of IPOs this year than expected
and the visibility on the backlog for 2010 is encouraging," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ASIA IPO BOOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The last major IPO wave to hit Hong Kong was 2007, at a
time when the credit bubble and Asia's growth story were in
full swing. Around $37.8 billion of IPO proceeds hit the Hong
Kong exchange that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS AG (UBSN.VX) was the top IPO underwriter in Hong Kong
this year, according to Thomson Reuters, bumping Morgan Stanley
(MS.N) down one notch from the place it held in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup jumped to 4th place this year from 10th two years
ago. Goldman was 7th this year, down from 4th in 2007, while
BofA leaped to 6th place this year from 12th two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Traditionally, the U.S. market is a huge proportion of the
total IPO market. This year, however, Asia had the lion's
share. Latin America was also a large provider," Hantho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The after-market trading of the offerings has also faced
pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five of Hong Kong's six top IPOs this year are trading
below their offering price, including China Minsheng Banking

building materials company China Zhongwang (1333.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese windfarm company China Longyuan (0916.HK), which

global ECM rankings (255, $76.5 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The third slot went to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) (300,
$71.2 billion), a surprising bump up from No. 4, given the
turmoil that hit the bank beginning late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huge bank stock offerings early in the year from HSBC
(HSBA.L), BofA and Japan's SMFG (8411.T), reflected on the ECM
data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asian IPOs led the ECM story in the second half of the
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eight of the world's top 10 IPOs came from Asia. Hong Kong
was by far the world's most active stock market for IPOs,
surpassing exchanges in New York and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of last week, Hong Kong was on pace to raise more than
$25.6 billion in IPO proceeds this year, its second-largest
total in the last decade and more than triple last year's
figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fourth-quarter U.S. IPO volume reached $8.7 billion, its
highest level in 7 quarters. By comparison, only three IPOs hit
the London Stock Exchange this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the top 10 global ECM rankings, only two other banks
aside from BofA moved two or more spots in the rankings:
Citigroup (C.N) went from 5th last year to 8th this year; RBS
(RBS.L) went from 12th to 10th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ASIA IPO BOOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The last major IPO wave to hit Hong Kong was 2007, at a
time when the credit bubble and Asia's growth story were in
full swing. Around $37.8 billion of IPO proceeds hit the Hong
Kong exchange that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS (UBSN.VX) was the top IPO underwriter in Hong Kong this
year, according to Thomson Reuters, bumping Morgan Stanley
(MS.N) down one notch from the place it held during the 2007
bull run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup jumped to 4th place this year from 10th two years
ago. Goldman was 7th this year, down from 4th in 2007, while
BofA leapt to 6th place this year from 12th two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The after-market trading of the offerings has faced
pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five of Hong Kong's six top IPOs this year are trading
below their offering price, including China Minsheng Banking
Corp. (600016.SS), casino group Sands China (1928.HK), and
building materials company China Zhongwang (1333.HK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese windfarm company China Longyuan (0916.HK), which
opened on Dec. 10, is up 16 percent since its debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visanet VNET3.SA, the Brazilian affiliate of credit card
company Visa Inc. (V.N), is trading 16 cents below its IPO.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
How will you achieve the "healthy" part of your New Year's resolutions? Your
approach probably depends on whether you`re a woman or a man. 

According to a new national survey sponsored by Centrum&#174; Ultra multivitamins, a
line of scientifically-advanced, gender-and age-specific adult multivitamins,
nearly all Americans (93 percent) surveyed have established at least one new
health and wellness goal in the past year, but the survey shows that men and
women may set different goals. 

Seventy-eight percent of women surveyed said in the past year they set goals to
eat better and 63 percent said they set goals to lose weight. Women are also
more likely than men to take a multivitamin and focus on nutrition-monitoring
activities when setting their goals. Men, on the other hand, are more likely
than women to set goals to exercise more. 

The majority of men and women surveyed felt that women are more successful at
setting and achieving health and wellness goals. Many women felt a lack of time
and energy prevents them from reaching their goals as they age. In addition, a
majority of women felt that age had an impact on their ability to achieve their
goals compared to when they were younger. Many men felt a roadblock to achieving
their health and wellness goals was that their goals were more overwhelming in
scope. 

About the Survey

A total of 1,007 phone interviews were conducted among 507 men and 500 women 18
years of age and older, living in private households between June 25 - 28, 2009.
The survey was conducted by Opinion Research Corporation on behalf of Pfizer
Consumer Healthcare and has a margin of error of &#177;3%.

&lt;p&gt;A small Missouri company with the word "Bing" in its name has sued Microsoft for branding its search engine with the same word, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition by the software giant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bing Information Design filed the case in a St. Louis circuit court this week, seeking damages including corrective advertising paid for by Microsoft to eliminate confusion between the brands, the company's law firm said in a statement on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design company, which offers computer-related illustrations and other services, has used the name Bing since 2000 and applied to register the trademark "Bing!" on May 26, according to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office records. The USPTO initially refused the application on Aug. 25, giving the company six months to file supporting information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft filed its application for the trademark "Bing" (without the exclamation mark) on March 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's use of the name Bing and its aggressive advertising have "gutted" efforts by the small design company to distinguish itself, the statement said. Bing.biz, a Web site linked to in the statement, showed sample graphics from the company and gave the job titles of its two principals as "overlord-in-chief" and "the brains behind the operation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not been served with a complaint but is aware of the lawsuit based on media reports, a Microsoft spokesman said in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this suit to be without merit and we do not believe there is any confusion in the marketplace with regard to the complainant's offerings and Microsoft's Bing product," the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft launched its Bing search engine earlier this year as a revamp of its Microsoft Live Search service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the lucrative business of underwriting and selling a company's stock, J.P. Morgan led the world's banks this year, earning an estimated $2.2 billion in fees, or nearly double what it hauled from the deals last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the investment banking industry, equity capital market (ECM) underwriting was the main driver of fees, marking a change in a sector where money made from advising on mergers and acquisitions is traditionally the cash cow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECM burst was driven by resurgent stock markets across the globe and the need for companies to raise cash after last year's market plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global ECM activity reached $866 billion this year, up 25 percent from 2008. Of that total, follow-on activity totaled&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$669 billion, with nearly half of that coming from banks seeking capital after the financial crisis took its toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) top ECM status this year came from 383 deals worth $98.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) earned a No. 2 spot on the global ECM rankings (298, $72.4 billion), a surprising bump up from No. 4, given the turmoil that hit the bank beginning late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third slot went to Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) (251, $71.3 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huge bank stock offerings early in the year from HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L), BofA and Japan's SMFG (8411.T), weighed on the ECM data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian IPOs led the ECM story in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight of the world's top 10 IPOs came from Asia. Hong Kong was by far the world's most active stock market for IPOs, surpassing exchanges in New York and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carve-out IPOs did particularly well this year, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Head of Equity Capital Markets Lisa Carnoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In general, investors made a lot of money on carve-outs because they're mature, proven companies," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She expects more carve-outs in 2010 -- companies carving out similar businesses in different regions, businesses that are different from the parent company, or businesses with different growth profiles from the parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnoy said investors are still cautious, but she expects the market to improve further in 2010, and added there could be more healthcare and tech IPOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still have sectors that have been relatively quiet, including growth sectors like healthcare and tech, which are usually the lion's share of IPO market," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnoy said U.S. investors have more sector-dedicated funds and are often willing to pay a premium for tech, healthcare, and new media stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of last week, Hong Kong was on pace to raise more than $25.6 billion in IPO proceeds this year, its second largest total in the last decade and more than triple last year's figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly U.S. IPO volume reached $7.8 billion, its highest in 7 quarters. By comparison, only two IPOs hit the London Stock Exchange this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the top 10 global ECM rankings, only two other banks aside from BofA moved two or more spots in the rankings: Citigroup Inc (C.N) went from 5th last year to 8th this year; RBS (RBS.L) went from 12th to 10th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The IPO market, itself, has had difficulties in getting continuous traction, but at the end of the day we are -- and we will continue to be -- in a deal-by-deal specific environment," said Deutsche Bank Global Co-Head of Equity Capital Markets Mark Hantho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a larger volume of IPOs this year than expected and the visibility on the backlog for 2010 is encouraging," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

high quality processing and support activities required to run the Save &amp;

    The decision to extend the contract, which was first established in 2001,

its strategy and business requirements. The contract extension will reduce
cost for J.P. Morgan Asset Management and deliver service enhancements to
improve the policyholder experience. HCL, a trusted partner with a strong
understanding of the business, will continue to provide an end-to-end
service solution to enhance policy administration, finance, actuarial and
call center services. The new contract services 185,000 policies and

&amp; Prosper, said: "J.P. Morgan Asset Management has long enjoyed a strong

    Commenting on the win, Stephen White, Chief Operating Officer, HCL IBS

we deliver, HCL is the ideal partner for JPMorgan Asset Management. We are
delighted that J.P. Morgan Asset Management has reconfirmed the value it
places in our partnership through this contract extension. We look forward
to adding further value through the introduction of wider HCL service
capabilities to help the company achieve its business needs."

    Stephen White added: "HCL's governance model means that strategic needs
are given as much focus as operational delivery. Our platform has the
capability to deliver cost certainty and provide those benefits on long
term contracts. We have developed a growing onshore/offshore business
model, which will enable further capability developments and efficiency
improvements. We are keen to grow our Life and Pensions business, in both
the open and closed book space, and this announcement demonstrates we
provide a compelling and competitive proposition in this market."

    Commenting on the deal, David Mitchell, SVP, IT Research at analyst firm
Ovum said: "Outsourcing of specific business functions or business areas
is most effective when the outsourcing provider has domain specific
capabilities. The recent life and pensions administration contract with
HCL for Save &amp; Prosper with JP Morgan is based on the HCL industry
specific expertise in this sector, offering JP Morgan an enhanced service
for their customers and staff while still being very cost effective."

&lt;p&gt;CIS Wraps up 2009 with New User-Driven Security Configuration Standards to
Encourage Safer Security Practices
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) today announced the public release of two
new consensus security benchmarks for Apache Tomcat 5.5-6.0 application server
and IBM DB2 v8.0-9.5 relational database management system. The new benchmarks
are the only prescriptive controls guides available today for securely
configuring these widely used systems that power a broad range of business
applications. The benchmarks are available as free downloads at
https://community.cisecurity.org/download/. 

"The CIS community expressed a need for additional guidance securing the tiers
that define their business logic and store their data - the Apache Tomcat and
IBM DB2 benchmarks are a response to that need," Blake Frantz, chief technology
officer for Center for Internet Security. 

In addition, CIS announced availability of updated versions of three existing
consensus security benchmarks: Apple iPhone 3.1.2; HP-UX 11i v1.5.0 UNIX
operating system; and VMWare ESX 3.5 virtualization server. 

"We thank the CIS community for their contributions to these important
benchmarks," added Frantz. 

CIS Security Configuration Benchmark for Apache Tomcat 5.5-6.0

Apache Tomcat is an open source software implementation of the Java servlet
engine and is one of the most used application servers by the Java development
community. Tomcat runs numerous large-scale, mission-critical web applications
across a diverse range of industries and organizations. Organizations using
Tomcat are advised to tighten the configuration of their systems in order to
reduce exposure to threats introduced by local users and the possibility of
sensitive information disclosure. By doing so, organizations can also ensure the
availability of processes that leverage Tomcat and access to useful logging
information when investigating security events. 

The CIS Security Configuration Benchmark for Apache Tomcat versions 5.5 - 6.0
provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture
for developing, deploying, assessing or securing solutions that incorporate
Apache Tomcat on a Linux platform. The recommendations cover twelve security
categories, including:

* Installation considerations 
* Removing extraneous resources 
* Limiting server platform information leaks 
* Protecting the shutdown port and Tomcat configurations 
* Configuring realms 
* Connector security 
* Establishing and protecting logging facilities 
* Configuring Catalina policy 
* Application deployment 
* Other configuration settings considerations

CIS Security Configuration Benchmark for IBM DB2 v8.0-9.5

IBM DB2 is a market share and performance leader in relational database
management systems. These systems manage vast amounts of information to support
mission-critical business applications - and when breached can cripple an
organization. While there are many causes of data breaches, the cornerstone of
an effective data security policy is ensuring that the databases themselves are
configured to be as secure as possible. 

The CIS Security Configuration Benchmark for DB2 versions 8.0-9.5 provides
prescriptive configuration guidance for establishing a secure posture for
developing, deploying, assessing or securing solutions that incorporate DB2 on
Linux, UNIX, and Windows platforms. The recommendations cover nine security
categories, including:

* Installation and patches 
* DB2 directory and file permissions 
* DB2 configurations 
* Label-Based Access Controls (LBAC) 
* Database maintenance 
* Securing database objects 
* Entitlements 
* General policy and procedures 
* DB2 utilities and tools

The CIS Public-Private Collaboration Process

CIS guides are created using a consensus review process comprised of volunteer
and contract subject matter experts. Consensus participants provide perspective
from a diverse set of backgrounds, including consulting, software development,
audit and compliance, security research, operations, government, and legal.
Because they are user-driven, CIS benchmarks are widely accepted and adopted in
government, business, industry and academia as the basis for enterprise system
and network configuration policies. 

By using the benchmarks, security professionals save tens of thousands of

&lt;p&gt;
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMAX Corporation (Nasdaq:IMAX)
(TSX:IMX) and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures today announced that Toy Story
3, the third installment of the blockbuster hit franchise Toy Story, will be
released to IMAX(R) 3D theatres simultaneously with its wide release on June 18,
2010. Toy Story 3 will be digitally re-mastered into the unparalleled image and
sound quality of The IMAX Experience(R) with proprietary IMAX DMR(R) (Digital
Re-mastering) technology.

Commenting on the announcement Bob Chapek, president, Distribution, The Walt
Disney Studios, said, "We're very excited to once again unite Disney Digital 3D
with The IMAX Experience, and to do it for the long-awaited release of Toy Story
3 is a real treat. A film like this is designed to take audiences on an exciting
thrill-ride adventure, making it a perfect match for both 3D and IMAX."

"We have always envisioned the Toy Story franchise as an ideal fit for The IMAX
Experience and we're very happy to finally turn that vision into a reality,"
said IMAX CEO Richard L. Gelfond. "This film also fits nicely into our 2010
lineup, ensuring that families will be able to start the summer holidays with a
fun Disney release in IMAX."

"Pixar's beloved films have changed the way people go to the movies. IMAX is
proud to be working with both Pixar and Disney, who like IMAX, strive to
transport moviegoers to incredible places that people only dream about
visiting," added Greg Foster, Chairman and President of IMAX Filmed
Entertainment. "In IMAX 3D and through the power of Randy Newman's incomparable
music, audiences will be able to see and hear Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the
larger than life characters of Toy Story in a whole new way."

The creators of the beloved "Toy Story" films re-open the toy box and bring
moviegoers back to the delightful world of our favorite gang of toy characters
in Toy Story 3. As Andy prepares to depart for college, Buzz, Woody and the rest
of his loyal toys are troubled about their uncertain future. Directed by Lee
Unkrich (co-director of "Toy Story 2" and "Finding Nemo"), Toy Story 3 is a
comical new adventure in Disney Digital 3D(TM) that lands the toys in a room
full untamed tots who can't wait to get their sticky little fingers on these
"new" toys. It's pandemonium as they try to stay together, ensuring "no toy gets
left behind." Meanwhile, Barbie comes face to plastic face with Ken (yes, that
Ken). Pixar veteran Darla K. Anderson ("Cars," "Monsters, Inc.") produces, while
Michael Arndt, Academy Award(R)-winning screenwriter of "Little Miss Sunshine,"
brings his unique talents and comedic sensibilities.

First Once-Daily Steroid-Free Maintenance Treatment That Has Been Shown to
Reduce Exacerbations for People with COPD
RIDGEFIELD, Conn. &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Pfizer Inc. announced today that
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved SPIRIVA&#174; HandiHaler&#174;
(tiotropium bromide inhalation powder) for the reduction of exacerbations in
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). SPIRIVA HandiHaler
is already FDA-approved as a once-daily maintenance treatment for breathing
problems associated with COPD, which includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or
both. 

Reducing exacerbations is a key goal of COPD disease management, according to
treatment guidelines. In the clinical trials that served as the basis for this
approval, COPD exacerbations were defined as a new onset or increase of symptoms
(including cough, sputum, wheezing or difficulty breathing) lasting for at least
three days and which required a change in treatment (antibiotics or steroids),
which could include hospitalization. COPD exacerbations may be caused by viral
or bacterial infections, as well as environmental irritants. 

"Exacerbations of COPD are serious events that can negatively impact the lives
of patients," said Dr. Donald P. Tashkin, emeritus professor of medicine, David
Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles. "People with COPD now have a
once-daily treatment option that not only helps them manage the debilitating
symptoms of COPD, but also can help them reduce the chance of an exacerbation." 

The new indication is supported by data from two clinical trials: the landmark
UPLIFT (Understanding the Potential Long-term Impacts on Function with
Tiotropium) study and a six-month study conducted in the Veterans Affairs
setting, which together involved nearly 8,000 people with COPD. While the UPLIFT
trial did not meet its primary endpoint (slowing the rate of decline in lung
function versus placebo), it provided relevant and important clinical
information regarding the effect of SPIRIVA HandiHaler on COPD exacerbations. 

"With today`s approval, SPIRIVA HandiHaler is now the first steroid-free
maintenance treatment that has been shown to reduce COPD exacerbations," said
Dr. Christopher Corsico, vice president, drug regulatory affairs, Boehringer
Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. "We also are pleased that the product label will
now include data from the landmark UPLIFT trial, which provides important
information for physicians to consider when making treatment decisions." 

Along with the new indication, the SPIRIVA HandiHaler product label now includes
clinical trial data from the UPLIFT study. In this trial, COPD patients in both
treatment groups were allowed to use all of their respiratory medications with
the exception of inhaled anticholinergics in order to simulate a real-world
environment. The clinical data demonstrated that SPIRIVA HandiHaler sustained
improved lung function over four years when compared with placebo and reduced
COPD exacerbations, even with the use of these medications. Additionally, the
inclusion of the safety data reaffirmed the established safety profile of
SPIRIVA HandiHaler. 

The safety profile of SPIRIVA HandiHaler has been well-established in clinical
studies involving more than 17,000 COPD patients, 11,000 of whom were treated
with SPIRIVA HandiHaler, and in post-marketing experience involving more than 16
million patient-years of exposure since its European approval in 2002. SPIRIVA
HandiHaler was approved in the United States in 2004. 

About COPD

COPD is a progressive, but preventable and treatable lung condition that is
characterized by a restricted flow of air into and out of the lungs and loss of
lung function over time. It includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both. 

COPD is the fourth-leading cause of death and the second-leading cause of
disability in the United States, and is projected to become the third-leading
fatal illness by 2020. Each year, COPD kills 120,000 Americans - that`s one
death every four minutes. 

The disease primarily affects current and former smokers and symptoms include
shortness of breath, coughing (sometimes with phlegm or mucus) and wheezing.
When most severe, COPD may even limit a person`s ability to perform simple tasks
such as washing and dressing. The damage in the lungs caused by COPD is not
reversible, but it is treatable. 

About SPIRIVA&#174; HandiHaler&#174;

SPIRIVA&#174; HandiHaler&#174; is a prescription medicine used once every day (a
maintenance medicine) to control symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) by relaxing your airways and keeping them open. COPD includes
chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both. 

SPIRIVA HandiHaler also reduces the likelihood of flare-ups and worsening of
COPD symptoms (COPD exacerbations). A COPD exacerbation is defined as an
increase or new onset of more than one COPD symptom such as cough, mucus,
shortness of breath, and wheezing that requires medicine beyond your rescue
medicine. 

Do not use SPIRIVA HandiHaler if you are allergic to tiotropium or if you have
had an allergic reaction to ipratropium. 

Allergic reactions may include itching, rash, or swelling of the lips, tongue or
throat (trouble swallowing). 

SPIRIVA HandiHaler is not a rescue medicine and should not be used for treating
sudden breathing problems. 

Do not swallow SPIRIVA capsules. SPIRIVA capsules should only be used with the
HandiHaler device. SPIRIVA HandiHaler should only be inhaled by mouth (oral
inhalation). 

Stop taking SPIRIVA and get medical help right away if your breathing suddenly
worsens, your throat, lips, or tongue swells, you get hives, you have vision
changes or eye pain, or you have difficulty passing urine or painful urination. 

Tell your doctor if you have glaucoma, problems passing urine or an enlarged
prostate, as these may worsen with SPIRIVA. Tell your doctor if you are allergic
to milk proteins. Ask your doctor if you are not sure. Tell your doctor if you
have kidney problems. Also discuss with your doctor all the medicines you take,
including eye drops. 

The most common side effects with SPIRIVA include upper respiratory tract
infection, dry mouth, sinus infection, and sore throat. For a complete list of
reported side effects, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 

Do not get SPIRIVA powder in your eyes. 

Read the Patient Information and the step-by-step Patient`s Instructions for Use
for SPIRIVA before you take your medicine.

&lt;p&gt;Reports of Microsoft's demise in the consumer space are in, but are they premature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York Times blog post last week highlighted influential tech writer and analyst Mark Anderson's assertion that Microsoft just doesn't understand consumers. Specifically, it's smartphones that elude Redmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Phones are consumer items, and Microsoft doesn't have consumer DNA," said Anderson, who writes the widely-followed Strategic News Service technology newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ For complete coverage on Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system -- including hands-on reviews, video tutorials and advice on enterprise rollouts -- see CIO.com's Windows 7 Bible. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft owns the PC market and corporate desktop, few would dispute that Windows Mobile has fallen way behind the iPhone, BlackBerry and, more and more, Google Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows Mobile is in big trouble," says veteran industry analyst Roger Kay. "Apple expanded its mobile platform and other competitors like Palm and Google have followed. But where's Microsoft?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slideshow: Seven Features in Windows 7 You Probably Don't Know About Slideshow: Windows 7 in Pictures: The Coolest New Hardware&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could pay a heavy price for this slide as mobile devices and other technologies such as Web-based applications and social networking platforms make their way into corporate environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a NetworkWorld story this week, IDC research vice president Al Gillen discussed the eventual shift away from the Windows client OS as businesses become less reliant upon the desktop PC and move to devices such as smartphones, thin clients and browser-based devices that run on non-Windows software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All these devices are going to come along that Microsoft does not own, which creates a whole new battle field," Gillen says, adding that the transition will result in more virtualized and cloud-based software and "in the process, help break the dependency on fat clients and full local processing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillen is not saying Windows is dying, and emphasizes that Windows 7 will be successful and adoption will be strong for the next five to seven years. But during that time period the world will become "a lot less centralized around the PC than it is today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ties back to the notion that Microsoft is losing ground with consumer trends that are destined to influence corporate adoption. Areas where Microsoft has failed or not dedicated enough resources such as mobile, SaaS (software as a service) and social media will fold into enterprise technology over the next few years, say industry analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite Anderson's claims that it's "game over" for Microsoft in the consumer space, the software giant is the proud owner of many superior consumer products and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To name a few: Xbox 360, Zune HD, Bing and the Windows 7 OS and features therein such as Windows Media Center. Microsoft is planning to open retail stores and has been vocal about facilitating an entertainment hub in the home by linking the Xbox and Windows Media Center on the PC. It has also been aggressively pushing its "three screens and a cloud" strategy to connect media on phones, PCs and televisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumer focus is also evident in Microsoft's advertising. TV commercials such as the "Laptop Hunters" and "Rookies" series, as well as ads for Windows 7 and Bing are more lively and engaging than past campaigns. For a company known for its coldness, Microsoft's TV ads have been warm and fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft undoubtedly has the potential and deep pockets to balance both the enterprise and consumer worlds. More of the humor from recent ad campaigns could go a long way on the consumer side, says Rob Enderle, president of tech consulting firm The Enderle Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft, a decade ago, was known for its sense of humor and positive image," says Enderle. "Both have eroded sharply, and this has made them vulnerable to brand assassination advertising from Apple."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executed well with the marketing of Windows 7, notes Enderle, and now needs to "bring this effort up to corporate to improve its image and rediscover its public sense of humor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it will take more than funny and inspiring advertising to resurrect Windows Mobile. The release of Windows Mobile 7 in late 2010, which promises to be a significant upgrade, will help. But it's a long way off, and until then Windows Mobile will remain Microsoft's Achilles' heel in the race for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing Anderson's grim prediction, analyst Kay says: "If Microsoft delays much longer on producing a decent mobile platform with software, services, and partners, then they're out of the game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane O'Neill is a senior writer at CIO.com.

        </body></entry><entry author="recommending that users exclude some file extensions and folders from antivirus scans, Microsoft may put users at risk, a security company said today." date="2009-12-22T01:52:30+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/idgSmallBusiness/idUS53791837220091222"><headline>Microsoft's 'whitelist' helps hackers, says Trend Micro</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;In a document published on its support site , Microsoft suggests that users do not scan some files and folders for malware as a way to improve performance in Windows 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7 , Server 2003, Server 2008 and Server 2008 R2. "These files are not at risk of infection. If you scan these files, serious performance problems may occur because of file locking," Microsoft states in the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the files and folders Microsoft tells users to exclude are those associated with Windows Update and Group Policy, and files with the .edb., .sdb and .chk extensions contained within the "%windir%\security" folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trend Micro took exception -- not with the list itself, but with Microsoft making it public. "Although it actually makes sense to stop checking Windows Update and some Group Policy-related files if you really want to speed up the system, we are concerned by the fact that this was released publicly," said David Sancho, a malware researcher with Trend Micro, in an entry to his firm's blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sancho argued that the list could be a boon to hackers. "Following the recommendations does not pose a significant threat as of now, but it has a very big potential of being one," he said. "Cybercriminals may strategically drop or download a malicious file into one of the folders that are recommended to be excluded from scanning, or use a file extension that is also in the excluded list."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the least, Sancho continued, only experienced users who know the downside of such file "whitelisting" should consider excluding files and folders from security scanning. "Excluding certain file types or folders from antivirus scanning is not something novice users should tinker with," Sancho said. "Doing so may expose the system to risks that can lead to an inconvenience far more severe than a slightly slower system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Storms, director of security operations at nCircle Network Security, backed Sancho on that. "I would agree with Trend that making any sort of whitelisting with your security software is not for the average user or the faint at heart," Storms said in an interview conducted via instant message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Storms also downplayed the significance of Microsoft's publicly posting its exclusion recommendations. "Will the bad guys latch on to this and suddenly change their locations to hide malware? Probably not," Storms said. "Where the malware is stored on the file system is the not the root of the conundrum with antivirus software.... It's that antivirus software is historically a post-event and blacklist kind of approach to security. It helps provide another layer of defense, but is it going to catch everything? No way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trend has a history of butting heads with Microsoft. Like other third-party security vendors, it has dismissed Microsoft's moves in the antivirus market , most recently earlier this year when the Redmond, Wash. company released its for-free Security Essentials software. And in April 2008, Trend researchers disputed Microsoft's claim that the latter's Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) had crushed the life out of the Storm botnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;The move, announced on Monday, is the highest-profile hire for GM since it exited bankruptcy in July and completes a whirlwind reshuffling of the top U.S. automaker's senior leadership team under Whitacre this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of November, Microsoft said Liddell would be leaving the software maker and was looking at "opportunities that will expand his career beyond being a CFO," leading many to expect he would soon be named CEO of another company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM has been operating since July with a new board vetted by the Obama administration and, since the start of December, under acting CEO Whitacre, who had spent a career at telecommunications provider ATT (T.N) and was already GM's chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three weeks, Whitacre has shaken up GM's top management ranks by promoting two executives, reassigning two others, and bringing in GM director and investment banker Steve Girsky as his adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM has begun a search for a permanent CEO although Whitacre has told directors he is prepared to see the automaker through the next stage of its restructuring and possibly through June when it is due to pay off $6.7 billion in U.S. government loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As CFO, Liddell will face the challenge of readying GM for a stock offering to reduce the U.S. government's 60 percent stake in the company, and winning back investor trust after accounting missteps, mounting losses, a costly bankruptcy and $50 billion in government aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being CFO at Microsoft will seem like a breeze compared to what he has to do at GM," said Toan Tran, a Morningstar analyst who has followed Microsoft for several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's hard to be a bad CFO at Microsoft. You don't have to deal with much when the company generates a billon dollars (in profit) a month."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GM will be a much bigger challenge," said Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddell, 51, a New Zealand native, joined Microsoft in 2005 from International Paper Co (IP.N), where he was also CFO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Microsoft, Liddell was a key player in a range of initiatives that reflected the company's transition to a slower growth business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those included Microsoft's first debt offering, a failed bid to acquire Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), and a cost-cutting plan set in motion last January that included the biggest job cuts the company had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson, who had been CFO, was dismissed by the automaker's board earlier this month. His successor as CFO, Ray Young, was reassigned to GM's international operations in Shanghai earlier this month as part of the shake-up announced by Whitacre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPO IN FOCUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitacre had cautioned that federal pay restrictions were complicating GM's search for outside hires for key executive positions, but said last week that the company had found a replacement for Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddell earned just over $3.5 million at Microsoft last fiscal year -- about $1.1 million in salary and bonus and about $2.4 million in stock awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM did not immediately detail his compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first challenges for Liddell will be to oversee the process of preparing post-bankruptcy accounting statements for GM that revalue its assets and liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completing that "fresh start" accounting is a prerequisite for an initial public offering of GM shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM has lost $88 billion since 2005, excluding results for this year that included its bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Rattner, the former investment banker who headed the White House-appointed autos task force, said in October that he and other U.S. officials were surprised by the "stunningly poor management" at GM, especially in its finance operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last January GM settled a five-year probe of its accounting practices by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to errors in its treatment of pensions, derivatives and precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since emerging from bankruptcy, GM has also had a harder than expected time disposing of the smaller and money-losing brands it no longer wants, including Saturn, Saab and Hummer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal to sell Saturn to Penske Automotive Group (PAG.N) collapsed in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week GM said it had been unable to find a buyer for Sweden-based Saab and would shut it down, but indicated this week that it could consider additional offers for the 60-year-old auto brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Matthew Lewis, John Wallace and Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

[GM.UL] has hired Chris Liddell, the chief financial officer of
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), as its new finance chief, bringing in
a well-regarded auto outsider who could succeed GM's acting CEO
Ed Whitacre when he steps aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move, announced on Monday, is the highest-profile hire
for GM since it exited bankruptcy in July and completes a
whirlwind reshuffling of the top U.S. automaker's senior
leadership team under Whitacre this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end of November, Microsoft said Liddell would be
leaving the software maker and was looking at "opportunities
that will expand his career beyond being a CFO," leading many
to expect he would soon be named CEO of another company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM has been operating since July with a new board vetted by
the Obama administration and, since the start of December,
under acting CEO Whitacre, who had spent a career at
telecommunications provider ATT (T.N) and was already GM's
chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the past three weeks, Whitacre has shaken up GM's top
management ranks by promoting two executives, reassigning two
others, and bringing in GM director and investment banker Steve
Girsky as his adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM has begun a search for a permanent CEO although Whitacre
has told directors he is prepared to see the automaker through
the next stage of its restructuring and possibly through June
when it is due to pay off $6.7 billion in U.S. government
loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As CFO, Liddell will face the challenge of readying GM for
a stock offering to reduce the U.S. government's 60 percent stake in

from International Paper Co (IP.N), where he was also CFO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Microsoft, Liddell was a key player in a range of
initiatives that reflected the company's transition to a slower
growth business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those included Microsoft's first debt offering, a failed
bid to acquire Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), and a cost-cutting plan set
in motion last January that included the biggest job cuts the
company had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson, who had been CFO, was
dismissed by the automaker's board earlier this month. His successor
as CFO, Ray Young, was reassigned to GM's international operations in
Shanghai earlier this month as part of the shake-up announced by
Whitacre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IPO IN FOCUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whitacre had cautioned that federal pay restrictions were
complicating GM's search for outside hires for key executive
positions, but said last week that the company had found a
replacement for Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liddell earned just over $3.5 million at Microsoft last
fiscal year -- about $1.1 million in salary and bonus and about
$2.4 million in stock awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM did not immediately detail his compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the first challenges for Liddell will be to oversee
the process of preparing post-bankruptcy accounting statements
for GM that revalue its assets and liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Completing that "fresh start" accounting is a prerequisite
for an initial public offering of GM shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM has lost $88 billion since 2005, excluding results for
this year that included its bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve Rattner, the former investment banker who headed the
White House-appointed autos task force, said in October that he
and other U.S. officials were surprised by the "stunningly poor
management" at GM, especially in its finance operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last January GM settled a five-year probe of its accounting
practices by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to errors
in its treatment of pensions, derivatives and precious
metals.[ID:nN22543300]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since emerging from bankruptcy, GM has also had a harder than
expected time disposing of the smaller and money-losing brands it no
longer wants, including Saturn, Saab and Hummer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A deal to sell Saturn to Penske Automotive Group (PAG.N)
collapsed in September.[ID:nN30232356]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week GM said it had been unable to find a buyer for
Sweden-based Saab and would shut it down, but indicated this
week that it could consider additional offers for the 60-year-old
auto brand.[ID:nLDE5BJ08K]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Matthew

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Oracle Impresses the Market

Oracle Corp. (Nasdaq: ORCL) rose 4.02% after market yesterday following the
company`s second-quarter of fiscal 2010 earnings announcement. 

The market reacted positively to the company`s better-than-expected earnings and
growing market share. The company said that for the fourth consecutive quarter,
it captured market share from SAP AG (NYSE: SAP). Moreover, positive
expectations regarding the European Commission`s approval of the $7.4 billion
Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: JAVA) acquisition in January also boosted the
company`s share price. 

For the third quarter, Oracle expects earnings to range between 26 and 28 cents
a share, with non-GAAP earnings per share ranging between 36 and 38 cents a
share. This surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents. 

Total revenue is expected to rise between 3% and 6% in the third quarter, at the
current exchange rates. The guidance assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% versus
26.6% last year. The guidance does not include the impact of the Sun
acquisition. Upon closing, the acquisition is expected to contribute $1.5
billion in non-GAAP operating income. 

Oracle`s results and guidance demonstrate that enterprise spending is on the
mend. We are highly positive on the company`s longer term growth prospects and
believe that the Sun acquisition will further boost shares. We believe the
investors will benefit from the company`s growing software business over the
long term. 

However, competition is expected to remain intense, as Oracle has strong
competitors in the form of International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:
IBM) and Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT).

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry smartphone users on Verizon Wireless's U.S. cellular network may have noticed a small but significant change within their mobile web browsers in the past week or so: The only search engine option that's currently available to some Verizon customers via their BlackBerry Browsers' "Start" or "Go to" pages is now Microsoft Bing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the Google, Yahoo and Wikipedia options that were available just days before--though Verizon BlackBerry users can still manually access any search engine they please by typing the corresponding URL into the BlackBerry Browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oft-criticized BlackBerry Browser launches with what BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion (RIM) has labeled a "Go to" screen. The BlackBerry Go to screen is a home page of sorts, with an option to search the Web directly from the page, along with both BlackBerry Bookmarks and Internet navigation History.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, BlackBerry users can select their own search engines of choice from the BlackBerry Go to pages and search the Web from there. But as of last week, Verizon decided to eliminate all the search options and now a number of its wireless customers are, in effect, being force-fed Microsoft's Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that not all of Verizon's BlackBerry subscribers have seen the change...yet; I've spoken with a number of BlackBerry users on Verizon and few of them report that additional search options are still available. But my BlackBerry Storm2 no longer lists any search options within my BlackBerry Browser other than Bing. And if I had to guess, I'd say it's only a matter of time before all Verizon BlackBerrys get all "Binged-Up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verizon and Microsoft have clearly struck some kind of deal, as the wireless carrier recently decided to ship the brand new BlackBerry Storm2 9550 with an exclusive, dedicated Bing search mobile application in October. Shortly after the Storm2 launch, Verizon started pushing out the Bing application to additional BlackBerry smartphones. (Can you say, "crapware?")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And today, Bing is the only default search option available to many Verizon BlackBerry customers. It's not uncommon for a wireless carrier to favor one search engine over another. T-Mobile, for example, sets Yahoo as the default engine on its BlackBerry Browser Go to pages. But T-Mobile customers can always open up the dropdown menu on the Go to pages and choose another search engine--though they return to the default Yahoo engine as soon as the BlackBerry Browser is exited and reopened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's annoying for T-Mobile to specify a default search engine--especially if you're a Google Guy or Gal, like me. But it's simply wrong of Verizon to force one particular search engine on its customers, regardless if that engine is Google, Yahoo, Bing or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verizon's not exactly known for respecting its customers' freedom; until recently the carrier resisted the inclusion of Wi-Fi in BlackBerry devices for fear it could eat into profits, and Verizon even crippled certain handsets by disabling GPS or GPS-related functions. But this seems like a new low to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, I can still type "Google.com" into my BlackBerry browser and search from there, but why should I have to waste time plugging in the URL and popping over to a separate page? Another possible workaround is tagging your search-page of choice as a BlackBerry Browser bookmark, and popping over to that site with a single click from the Go to page. But that's still more work than it could, and should, be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verizon Wireless is sending a clear message that its customers' freedom of choice means very little to the company, and that shouldn't go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings assigns an 'A+' long-term rating to the fixed- to floating-rate
capital securities issued by JPMorgan Chase Capital XXVIII, a Delaware statutory
trust. JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) fully and unconditionally guarantees these
securities on a subordinated basis. The trust will invest the proceeds of the
capital securities in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of
JPMC. The capital securities are entitled to periodic distributions that mirror
JPMC's distributions on the debentures. The securities qualify as Tier 1 Capital
under U.S. banking regulatory guidance. 

Based upon Fitch's hybrid capital rating criteria, the securities have a high
equity component. Fitch has assigned Class D equity treatment to the issuance
(75% equity, 25% debt). The equity credit classification for the securities
recognizes its junior subordinated ranking, as these securities rank junior to
all senior and subordinated obligations of JPMC, and rank pari passu to the
junior subordinated debt associated with JPMC's other currently outstanding
traditional trust preferred securities. The securities have an optional deferral
feature. The notes have a scheduled maturity in 2039. 

Fitch recently announced a pending change to its ratings and notching of hybrid
securities which is expected to result in the ratings of many performing hybrids
that rank as junior securities being downgraded by one notch. (For further
information, please see the December 14, 2009 rating action comment, entitled
'Fitch Announces Forthcoming Changes in Hybrid Securities Rating Criteria',
which is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.) Final rating changes are expected
to be announced in early 2010, and will likely impact the ratings of the Trust's
securities. 

Fitch's rating criteria for assigning equity credit for hybrids, dated June 25,
2008, is also available on Fitch's web site 'www.fitchratings.com' under the
title 'Equity Credit for Hybrids and Other Capital Securities'. 

Fitch assigns the following rating: 

JPMorgan Chase Capital XXVIII 

--Capital securities, series AA 'A+'.

&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
While politicians and pundits continue to arm wrestle the minutiae of health
reform, more and more Americans are stepping up to take charge of their own
health. The key weapon in their arsenal: information. 

Many people are embracing the connection between oral health and overall health.
That`s why Dentists Management Corporation (DMC) today announced the launch of
the Dental Optimizer, a free online application connected to Microsoft
HealthVault, which is designed to help patients: 

&#9679; understand what they can do to prevent dental disease. 

&#9679; learn the latest about what treatments are the most effective. 

&#9679; enjoy less time in the dentist`s chair, or lower out-of pocket costs. 

Microsoft HealthVault, a personal health record platform, allows people to
gather, store and share their health data to better manage their overall health
and wellness. 

The application features easy-to-use, interactive tools such as risk assessment
quizzes and a treatment cost calculator. Patients can also create an online oral
health profile that allows them to get personalized, science-based suggestions
for how to better manage their oral health conditions. 

"Studies are beginning to establish a connection between oral infection and
other serious health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and preterm,
low birth-weight babies," says Dr. William Ten Pas, DMD, former president of the
American Dental Association and a senior executive at ODS, the Oregon-based
parent company of DMC. "When you maintain a healthy mouth, you can help keep the
rest of your body healthy, too." 

"We designed HealthVault to help people improve their health by enabling them to
digitally store information and share it with healthcare professionals and
third-parties," said David Cerino, general manager, Microsoft Health Solutions
Group. "With this partnership, we extend our HealthVault community to include a
tool that allows people to better manage their oral health, an important aspect
of overall wellness." 

Dentists Management Corporation is the first solution provider to partner with
Microsoft HealthVault, specifically focusing on oral health. Built on the
HealthVault platform, Dental Optimizer allows patients to store information
about their oral health and share it with caregivers. "We hope that providing
patients a means to easily share their information with both dentists and
physicians, will lead to more coordinated and effective care," said Rachel
Picado, director of informatics at ODS and one of the tool`s creators. "Dental
health is integral to a patient`s overall well-being."

&lt;p&gt;At one time, Microsoft was about as welcome in Silicon Valley as Darth Vader at a Jedi knight convention. Commonly referred to as the Evil Empire, the company was feared and hated in roughly equal measure when it opened its first Silicon Valley office in October 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that same year, for example, when U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft had used its monopoly power to the detriment of consumers and innovation in general, Gary Rivlin, author of The Plot to Get Bill Gates, told the San Francisco Chronicle, "I'm sure there are champagne corks being popped all over the Valley."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was no doubt right at the time. But recently, Sam Altman, co-founder of Mountain View-based Loopt, which makes a cell phone-based GPS sharing system, told the Chronicle that years ago, "I would have told you, 'Microsoft is really evil.' I would never work with them." Today, though, "they're an incredible partner," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altman isn't alone. Yahoo was once seen as the anti-Microsoft -- a laid-back, innovative, homegrown Silicon Valley firm diametrically opposed to what it saw as the sharklike business practices and buttoned-down culture of Microsoft. But earlier this month, Yahoo and Microsoft finalized a search and advertising deal that calls for Microsoft's Bing to power Yahoo search sites, and for Yahoo to handle premium search advertising services for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And how about open-source technology? There was a time when Microsoft used all of its considerable might to try to squash open source, and open-source proponents would have preferred to be stripped naked, covered with honey and forced to lie on top of a colony of fire ants than deal with Microsoft. But then, several years ago, Microsoft partnered with Novellto work on Linux initiatives. And recently, Microsoft even released as open source a download tool it developed -- because it had accidentally used an open-source component in the tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what happened? Why are we seeing a kinder, gentler Microsoft that many Silicon Valley companies regard as a potential business partner?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your point of view, it's either because Microsoft finally recognized that it's in its best interest to be a cooperator rather than a predator, or it's because Microsoft is on a long, slow decline, and economic realities are forcing it to act in ways contrary to its founders' DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who adhere to the Microsoft-as-cooperator theory trace the change to the antitrust suit. They say that losing that suit led to a period of soul-searching, with Microsoft recognizing that it could no longer thrive by going it alone. That ultimately prompted it to sponsor industry conferences, look for business partners rather than companies to consume, and expand its Silicon Valley presence to 1,300 workers, with another 700 elsewhere in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others say that Microsoft's sea change had nothing to do with soul-searching and everything to do with the company's growing irrelevance. The antitrust ruling took away many of the advantages the company had against its competitors, and so Microsoft simply could no longer use its monopoly power to crush competitors. In addition, it fell behind the times and allowed Google to go from start-up to monster in record time. Finally, operating systems are no longer particularly important, and the cloud is the future -- and that means Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which story tells the truth? Probably both. Any soul-searching that went on at Microsoft was likely caused not by a fit of conscience, but by a hard dose of economic reality. The truth is, Microsoft simply can't go it alone anymore, even if it wants to. But even though change may have been forced on it, the company truly has altered its outlook and its way of doing business. It has learned that in today's tech world, you've got to go along to get along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston Gralla is a contributing editor for Computerworld.com and the author of more than 35 books, including How the Internet Works (Que, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 21 (Reuters) - Atlantic Equities expects Goldman Sachs
Group Inc's (GS.N) quarterly revenue to fall 25 percent
sequentially in the fourth quarter, citing a sharp slowdown in
fixed income and equity trading activity. The brokerage said
the revenue weakness at Goldman -- where trading accounts for
about 75 percent of revenue -- appears to be caused by
investors locking in profits ahead of the year end and may
prove temporary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; However, it said the downward trend in revenues from $13.8
billion in the second quarter to $12.4 billion in the third
quarter raises questions about revenue sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage now expects fourth-quarter revenue of $9.3
billion, down from $11.6 billion earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Atlantic Equities also said a continuing debate about a
narrowing of trading spreads and impact of increasing
competition may cause near-term share price weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think the Q4 slowdown will be primarily caused by lower
volumes but a contraction in trading spreads may also play a
part," the brokerage wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Atlantic Equities, which maintained its "overweight" rating
and $163.19 price target on the stock, cut the bank giant's
fourth-quarter earnings estimate to $5.30 per share from its
previous estimate of $6 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares were trading up nearly 2 percent at $166.15

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) e XTO Energy Inc. hanno annunciato oggi una
transazione in titoli azionari, per un valore di 41 miliardi di dollari.
L`accordo, soggetto all`approvazione degli azionisti di XTO e all`autorizzazione
delle autorit&#224; competenti, andr&#224; ad accrescere la posizione di ExxonMobil nello
sviluppo di fonti non convenzionali di petrolio e gas naturale. 

In base all`accordo, approvato dai consigli di amministrazione di entrambe le
societ&#224;, ExxonMobil emetter&#224; 0,7098 azioni ordinarie per ciascuna azione
ordinaria di XTO. Ci&#242; corrisponde a un premio del 25 percento a favore degli
azionisti di XTO. Il valore della transazione include un preesistente debito di
XTO pari a 10 miliardi di dollari ed &#232; basato sul prezzo di chiusura dei titoli
ExxonMobil e XTO dell`11 dicembre 2009. 

"Siamo lieti che ExxonMobil e XTO abbiano raggiunto questo accordo" ha
dichiarato Rex W. Tillerson, Presidente e Amministratore Delegato della Exxon
Mobil Corporation. 

"XTO &#232; uno dei maggiori produttori statunitensi di gas naturale da fonti non
convenzionali, con grandi risorse, solide competenze tecniche e personale
altamente qualificato. I punti di forza di XTO, uniti alle avanzate competenze
di ExxonMobil nei settori della Ricerca e Sviluppo e operativo, alla sua
presenza globale e alla sua solidit&#224; finanziaria, dovrebbero permettere lo
sviluppo di ulteriori fonti alternative per l`approvvigionamento di petrolio e
gas naturale, a beneficio dei consumatori sia negli Stati Uniti che nel resto
del mondo." 

Tillerson ha dichiarato che l`accordo costituisce una buona notizia per
l`economia e la sicurezza energetica degli Stati Uniti in quanto favorir&#224;
opportunit&#224; di creazione di posti di lavoro e di investimenti nella produzione
nazionale di gas naturale. 

Le risorse di XTO ammontano a circa 1.274 miliardi di metri cubi di gas (45 mila
miliardi di piedi cubi) e includono gas e petrolio da scisti, tight gas (gas
naturale in depositi a bassa permeabilit&#224;) e coal bed methane (gas naturale in
carbone). Dette risorse andranno a integrare quelle di ExxonMobil negli Stati
Uniti, in Canada, Germania, Polonia, Ungheria e Argentina. 

Al perfezionamento della transazione, ExxonMobil intende costituire una nuova
organizzazione upstream per la gestione, a livello globale, dello sviluppo e
della produzione delle risorse non convenzionali che favorisca il rapido
sviluppo e l`implementazione di tecnologie e pratiche operative volte ad
accrescere la produzione e a massimizzare il valore delle risorse. La nuova
organizzazione avr&#224; sede a Fort Worth, Texas, presso l`attuale sede di XTO. 

Bob R. Simpson, Presidente e fondatore di XTO, ha affermato che nel corso dei 23
anni di vita della societ&#224;, XTO ha sviluppato competenze tecniche e ha acquisito
un ragguardevole portafoglio di risorse, diversificato e d`alta qualit&#224;, in
giacimenti produttivi negli Stati Uniti. 

"XTO vanta una comprovata capacit&#224; di continua e profittevole crescita di
produzione e riserve di fonti non convenzionali" ha dichiarato Simpson. "Quale
leader del settore energetico a livello mondiale, ExxonMobil potr&#224; ulteriormente
migliorare i nostri risultati aprendo nuove opportunit&#224; per lo sviluppo di
risorse di petrolio e gas naturale a livello globale." 

Tillerson ha affermato che l`accordo &#232; parte di un processo di continua e
rigorosa valutazione delle opportunit&#224; di investimento per creare valore per gli
azionisti e contribuire a soddisfare l'aumento della domanda globale di energia
nel lungo periodo. L`accordo &#232; in linea con il modello di business di ExxonMobil
incentrato sulla generazione di valore sostenibile e di lungo termine. 

Il perfezionamento della transazione &#232; previsto nel secondo trimestre del 2010.

&lt;p&gt;DETROIT/SEATTLE (Reuters) - General Motors Co has hired Chris Liddell, the chief financial officer of Microsoft Corp, as its new finance chief, filling a key position with the automaker's highest-profile hire since its July bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move, announced Monday, brings another well-known industry outsider to GM's shifting senior leadership team at a time when the automaker has been struggling to close deals to sell key assets and regain sales momentum in the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM has been operating since July with a new board vetted by the Obama administration and, since the start of December, under a new chief executive in Ed Whitacre, who had spent a career at telecommunications provider ATT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three weeks, Whitacre has shaken up GM's top management ranks by promoting two executives, reassigning two others, and bringing in GM director Steve Girsky as an adviser to management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As CFO, Liddell will face the challenge of readying the automaker for a stock offering to reduce the U.S. government's 60 percent stake in the company, and winning back investor trust after accounting missteps, mounting losses, a costly bankruptcy and $50 billion in government aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being CFO at Microsoft will seem like a breeze compared to what he has to do at GM," said Toan Tran, a Morningstar analyst who has followed Microsoft for several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's hard to be a bad CFO at Microsoft. You don't have to deal with much when the company generates a billon dollars (in profit) a month."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"GM will be a much bigger challenge," said Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddell, 51, will start at GM in January, the automaker said. He previously announced he would be leaving Microsoft at the end of December, indicating he was looking for a bigger job at another company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddell, a New Zealand native, joined Microsoft in 2005 from International Paper Co, where he was also CFO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Microsoft, Liddell was a key player in a range of initiatives that reflected the company's transition to a slower growth business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those included Microsoft's first debt offering, a failed bid to acquire Yahoo Inc, and a cost-cutting plan set in motion last January that included the biggest job cuts the company had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Chief Executive Fritz Henderson, who had been CFO, was dismissed by the automaker's board earlier this month. His successor as CFO, Ray Young, was reassigned to GM's international operations in Shanghai earlier this month as part of the shake-up announced by Whitacre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW GM ACCOUNTING KEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitacre had cautioned that federal pay restrictions were complicating GM's search for outside hires for key executive positions, but said last week that the company had found a replacement for Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddell earned just over $3.5 million at Microsoft last fiscal year -- about $1.1 million in salary and bonus and about $2.4 million in stock awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM did not immediately detail his compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first challenges for Liddell will be to oversee the process of preparing post-bankruptcy accounting statements for GM that revalue its assets and liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completing that "fresh start" accounting is a prerequisite for an initial public offering of GM shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM has lost $88 billion since 2005, excluding results for this year that included its bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Rattner, the former investment banker who headed the White House-appointed autos task force, said in October that he and other U.S. officials were surprised by the "stunningly poor management" at GM, especially in its finance operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last January GM settled a five-year probe of its accounting practices Securities and Exchange Commission related to errors in its treatment of pensions, derivatives and precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since emerging from bankruptcy, GM has also had a harder-than-expected time disposing of the smaller and money-losing brands it no longer wants, including Saturn, Saab and Hummer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal to sell Saturn to Penske Automotive Group collapsed in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week GM said it had been unable to find a buyer for Sweden-based Saab and would shut it down, but indicated this week that it could consider additional offers for the 60-year-old auto brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall, editing by Matthew Lewis and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

what he has to do at GM," said Toan Tran, a Morningstar analyst
who has followed Microsoft for several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's hard to be a bad CFO at Microsoft. You don't have to
deal with much when the company generates a billon dollars (in
profit) a month."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "GM will be a much bigger challenge," said Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liddell, 51, will start at GM in January, the automaker
said. He previously announced he would be leaving Microsoft at
the end of December, indicating he was looking for a bigger job
at another company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liddell, a New Zealand native, joined Microsoft in 2005
from International Paper Co (IP.N), where he was also CFO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Microsoft, Liddell was a key player in a range of
initiatives that reflected the company's transition to a slower
growth business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those included Microsoft's first debt offering, a failed
bid to acquire Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), and a cost-cutting plan set
in motion last January that included the biggest job cuts the
company had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former Chief Executive Fritz Henderson, who had been CFO,
was dismissed by the automaker's board earlier this month. His
successor as CFO, Ray Young, was reassigned to GM's
international operations in Shanghai earlier this month as part
of the shake-up announced by Whitacre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW GM ACCOUNTING KEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whitacre had cautioned that federal pay restrictions were
complicating GM's search for outside hires for key executive
positions, but said last week that the company had found a
replacement for Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liddell earned just over $3.5 million at Microsoft last
fiscal year -- about $1.1 million in salary and bonus and about
$2.4 million in stock awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM did not immediately detail his compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the first challenges for Liddell will be to oversee
the process of preparing post-bankruptcy accounting statements
for GM that revalue its assets and liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Completing that "fresh start" accounting is a prerequisite
for an initial public offering of GM shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM has lost $88 billion since 2005, excluding results for
this year that included its bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve Rattner, the former investment banker who headed the
White House-appointed autos task force, said in October that he
and other U.S. officials were surprised by the "stunningly poor
management" at GM, especially in its finance operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last January GM settled a five-year probe of its accounting
practices Securities and Exchange Commission related to errors
in its treatment of pensions, derivatives and precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since emerging from bankruptcy, GM has also had a
harder-than-expected time disposing of the smaller and
money-losing brands it no longer wants, including Saturn, Saab
and Hummer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A deal to sell Saturn to Penske Automotive Group (PAG.N)
collapsed in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week GM said it had been unable to find a buyer for
Sweden-based Saab and would shut it down, but indicated this
week that it could consider additional offers for the
60-year-old auto brand.

&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of newsletters we discussed some of the long-standing concepts that underlie cloud computing. We also discussed a few somewhat newer concepts, such as the dynamic movement of virtual machines (VM). In this newsletter we will discuss how the concept of dynamically moving VMs is causing us to lose sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the ability to dynamically move VMs between physical servers either over a LAN or a WAN is exceptionally powerful as it allows the IT organization to:&lt;/p&gt;

Optimize IT resources for maximum utilization, flexibility and availability.
Allow IT organizations to perform hardware maintenance without scheduled downtime.
Improve performance by moving virtual machines away from failing or under-performing servers.&lt;p&gt;There is also no doubt that it is extremely difficult to dynamically move servers between physical servers in part because it is not just the VM that has to be moved. As part of migrating a VM from one server to another, the IT organizations has to ensure that the migrated VM retains the same security, storage access and QoS configurations and policies as it had previously. If some form of server load balancing is being performed, another challenge is to ensure that the server load balancer can account for the fact that one or more VMs have been moved. If an application firewall was protecting the VM prior to its being moved, an equivalent application firewall must be in place to protect the VM after it has been migrated. If an IT organization is performing specific logging and/or auditing as a way of ensuring PCI compliance, then that functionality would have to migrate along with the VM that hosts the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As noted, ensuring that as a VM migrates from one physical server to another, that all of the requisite functionality follows it is extremely difficult. The only way that this will happen, if indeed it does, over the next few years is if IT organizations keep the environment as simple as possible. This means that IT organizations must choose one primary vendor for their virtualized data center. That is setting up to be a choice between HP, IBM and friends such as Juniper, and Cisco and friends such as VMware and EMC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do think the benefits of a virtualized data center are compelling. However, we also think that having to choose between Cisco, HP and IBM will be a wrenching decision for many IT organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following URLs point to a couple of exceptionally lucid and insightful discussions of cloud computing and the associated risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

 (Adds analyst comments, background, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Krishnakali Sengupta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGALORE, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Athersys Inc (ATHX.O) said it
sold the rights of its stem-cell therapy to treat inflammatory
bowel disease to Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's biggest
drugmaker, and shares of Athersys more than tripled in early
morning trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the agreement, Pfizer will pay Athersys $6 million
upfront and up to $105 million in milestones for the
investigational stem cell therapy, MultiStem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Athersys has been a widely undervalued stock for a while
and the fact that this deal adds on to almost one-third of its
total market capitalization and has potential to earn five
times of its market cap, is a huge boost to the stock," Steve
Brozak, an analyst with WBB Securities, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of Dec. 18, Athersys had a total market capitalization
of $18.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commenting on the deal, the analyst said that the biggest
hurdle for small biotechnology companies such as Athersys is to
get the first deal, and for a start, this deal with Pfizer
looks very positive. However, he added that what remains to be
seen is how aggressive Athersys can be with Pfizer going
forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Athersys may elect to co-develop the therapy with Pfizer
and both the companies will share expenses as well as profits
and losses on an agreed basis, beginning at late-stage study,
Athersys said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inflammatory bowel disease is a group of inflammatory and
autoimmune conditions that affect the colon and small
intestine, typically resulting in severe abdominal pain, weight
loss, vomiting and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Athersys' cells, which are derived from human bone marrow,
have yet to be tested in people with inflammatory bowel
disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MultiStem is currently being developed by Athersys for
several other conditions, including heart-attack, bone marrow
transplant support, and ischemic stroke, which results when an
artery to the brain is blocked often by a blood clot or a fatty
deposit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stem cell research-based companies Geron Corp (GERN.O) and
Cytori Therapeutics Inc (CYTX.O) have made similar deals with
U.S. conglomerate General Electric Corp's (GE.N) healthcare
unit. [ID:nBNG514055] [ID:nBNG387442]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Brozak believes that there are fewer small biotech
companies now than the beginning of the year, and thus he sees
more similar partnerships in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Athersys were up $2.12 at $3.12 in early morning
trade Monday on Nasdaq. They touched an all-time high of $3.95
earlier in the day.

&lt;p&gt;SAP/Business Objects and Four Top Wireless Providers Rank Last in Scores

5000 IT Pros Have Rated Vendors as Company Nears Two-Year Mark
LOS GATOS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
VendorRate (www.vendorrate.com), the only Web-based business information service
that offers quick, confidential performance ratings and comparisons of
technology vendors, announced today that IBM Informix, ChemSW, and 10ZiG
Technology were the top rated vendors for overall customer satisfaction in 2009.


IBM Informix` score of 94.3 out of a possible 100 was the top overall mark for
2009. The company has placed first or second on VendorRate in each quarter since
Q3 of 2008. ChemSW, last year`s top scoring vendor, was second with a 92.9 mark,
while newcomer 10ZiG Technology placed third with an overall rating of 91.6. 

SAP/Business Objects trailed the 2009 field with a low mark of 53.6. Also among
the bottom ten were four major wireless providers - AT Wireless, Verizon
Communications, T-Mobile USA and Sprint Nextel - along with internet-related and
telephone services from Cisco, Qwest and Bell Canada. 

As VendorRate nears completion of its second year, more than 5000
business-to-business IT professionals have now posted ratings on the company
website and at trade shows, professional conferences and virtual events. 

"It`s notable that emerging new vendors are scoring ahead of their big brand
counterparts," said Rick Schaefer, CEO of VendorRate. "The scores indicate that
vendor performance drops as vendors grow bigger, while the smaller companies are
able to maintain higher levels of customer satisfaction." 

VendorRate users rate vendors confidentially on ten specific performance
criteria that include customer service, reliability, integrity, budget and
effectiveness. The results produce a cumulative score up to 100. 

The full 2009 report also contains breakdowns of ratings submitted by small,
medium and enterprise companies, the highest and lowest scores in each of ten
performance criteria, and top category scores by software, hardware and service
providers. VendorRate is vendor neutral and accepts neither vendor sponsorship

Annual Program Raises Record Amount for Local Community Organizations
FAIRFAX, Va.--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil announced today that its employees in the Metropolitan D.C. area
raised more than $2.7 million for local community and charitable organizations
during the 2009 Employees' Favorite Charities Campaign. The amount is a record
level for the campaign, which has raised nearly $16 million for organizations in
the Metropolitan D.C. area since 2002. 

"Our employees feel honored to give back to their communities," said John
MacFarlane, chair of the 2009 ExxonMobil Employees' Favorite Charities Campaign.
"With 99 percent participation by our area employees, we are proud to continue
the ExxonMobil tradition of giving." 

This year, employees donated to over 500 charities with nearly half qualifying
for ExxonMobil`s charitable matching program. As a result, 230 local non-profit
organizations providing health and human services will receive contributions
from ExxonMobil in addition to the individual donations made by employees. 

ExxonMobil has a long history of supporting community groups and educational
organizations in the greater Washington D.C. area, not only with contributions
and grants, but also with thousands of employees and retirees who volunteer
their time and talent. 

Organizations receiving both individual employee and corporate matching
contributions include:

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Glide Browser OS for Microsoft Internet Explorer is available for download
today at http://www.GlideLife.com. Glide effectively transforms the Microsoft
Internet Explorer into a Browser OS with a complete application suite fully
compatible with Microsoft Office and 20GBs of free storage. Glide equips
Microsoft Explorer with automated data capture and file synchronization to speak
with multiple remote Windows, Mac and Linux desktops, automated file translation
so that Microsoft formats are automatically compatible with other file formats,
a rights based file management system, a word processor, presentation app,
spreadsheet, photo editor, email client, online meeting app, drawing tool, web
publishing app, contact manager, calendar and much more. 

Glide is a conduit between your desktop, browser and the cloud. Glide lives on
your desktop, in your browser and in the cloud accessible from virtually any
mobile phone or desktop. Glide creates a two way automated corridor of data from
any location on the web through your browser to your desktop automatically
capturing and translating web pages and multiple search results into files that
can be synchronized, accessed and edited on all of your devices. 

"Glide`s compatible and integrated platform is designed to free your data from
hardware replacement and software upgrade schemes, to move your data freely
between your desktops and the web and to collaborate with others regardless of
device, OS or software," said TransMedia Chairman and CEO, Donald Leka. 

Cloud Computing: The Glide Approach Versus The Microsoft Approach

First things first, the Glide cloud computing solution is free with 20GBs of
storage. 

Glide lands a native file synchronization application on your Windows desktop
and adds a browser OS component to your Microsoft Internet Explorer browser to
seamlessly move your data to and from the cloud. 

Glide transforms the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser into a free office
application suite and collaboration platform. 

Glide is designed to run on Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris, Android, Blackberry,
iPhone, Palm Pre, Symbian and Windows Mobile and to automatically translate file
formats between platforms based on automated device identification and file
transcoding. 

Glide is designed to free user data from hardware replacement and software
upgrade schemes. 

While Microsoft`s cloud computing plans are designed to keep users tethered to
Microsoft Office, Glide untethers you from any single OS or application suite
and makes it easier for users to collaborate with others on different platforms
and devices. 

Cloud Computing: The Glide OS Approach Versus The Google Chrome OS Approach

The Glide cloud computing solution is free of advertising and comes with 20GBs
of storage. 

Whereas the Google Chrome OS is hardware centric and will only run on a limited
number of devices with little or no distribution, Glide runs on virtually any
device and platform today. 

While Glide runs on Linux and Android, it also runs on Windows, Mac, Solaris,
Blackberry, iPhone, Palm Pre, Symbian and Windows Mobile. 

Whereas Google Chrome OS is "autocratic," requiring that you store your files in
their cloud, Glide allows you the option to work locally on your desktop. 

Glide makes it possible for users to work without latency by using native apps
on their local desktops and automatically syncing data when bandwidth is
available. 

Glide transforms virtually any major browser into an OS, not just Google Crome. 

A Bootable Glide OS for Netbooks

Netbooks and other mid sized devices have for the most part failed to meet a
clearly defined need for most consumers and business users. Furthermore, while
Glide believes that Linux is an important part of the cloud computing future and
supports Linux, Linux based Netbooks for the most part have failed to gain
significant market share. Hundreds of such devices will emerge over the next few
years. Some will find specialized applications and others will gain short-term
traction. But the problem remains that while both the cell phone and laptop have
clearly defined uses, the notion of users carrying a third device seems
implausible. More likely, the cell phone and the laptop will continue to evolve
to meet the needs that netbooks and other mid-sized devices seek to fill and
mid-sized devices will find important specialized niche markets. 

In the first half of 2010, Glide will release a bootable version of the Glide OS
for Netbooks making it possible to launch the Glide OS at startup. The Glide
Netbook OS will provide a unified desktop, file management system, a
comprehensive suite of native versions of the Glide Application Suite, offline
access to your communication and collaboration suite and data capture and sync
technology to provide a cost effective alternative to Windows for specialized
niche markets like healthcare and education. 

The Glide OS was first unveiled to the public on April 18, 2005 at The National
Association of Broadcasters (NAB) convention in Las Vegas followed by a Glide
Launch Party at the Bellagio Light Nightclub featuring a live performance by
Wyclef Jean.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Durata Therapeutics, Inc. announced today that it has acquired Vicuron
Pharmaceuticals from Pfizer (PFE). Durata is a newly formed biopharmaceutical
company that was created by a five-member venture capital syndicate to pursue
late-stage clinical development of novel antibiotic programs. The acquisition
was funded through a stock purchase by New Leaf Venture Partners, LLC, Domain
Associates, LLC, Aisling Capital, Sofinnova Ventures Inc. and Canaan Partners.
Durata is focused primarily on Vicuron`s antibiotic drug candidate, dalbavancin.
Durata`s product portfolio also includes two preclinical antibiotic programs.
Pfizer will retain the marketed anti-fungal agent, EraxisTM (anidulafungin),
which was formerly owned by Vicuron. 

Dalbavancin is a long-acting, injectable, lipoglycopeptide antibiotic in
late-stage clinical development. The product candidate has generated Phase 3
results in acute bacterial infections of the skin and skin structures and has
demonstrated the potential to offer a unique antibiotic product profile.
Specifically, dalbavancin has pharmacokinetic properties that enable convenient
once-a-week dosing, and it offers potent activity against Gram-positive
bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 

Ron Hunt, Managing Director at New Leaf Venture Partners (NLV Partners),
commented, "The venture investors have worked together closely to put
dalbavancin into a well-funded company that will be laser-focused on completing
its development and making it available to physicians and patients. Durata is a
unique opportunity for us, where we can pair the appropriate financial resources
and a talented team in an exciting new company that has the potential to take
this drug all the way through approval." 

Members of the Durata Board will be as follows:

* Nicole Vitullo, Partner at Domain Associates, LLC 
* Ron Hunt, Managing Director at NLV Partners 
* Dov A. Goldstein, M.D., Partner at Aisling Capital and former Executive Vice
President and CFO of Vicuron 
* James Healy, M.D., Ph.D., General Partner at Sofinnova Ventures 
* Brent Ahrens, General Partner at Canaan Partners 
* George Horner, an Executive Partner at Sofinnova Ventures and former CEO of
Vicuron, will serve as an independent director on the Board.

Additional details about Durata Therapeutics will be announced in the future.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does not offer a specific, purpose-built VDI tool comparable to XenDesktop or VMware View, so we did not include Microsoft in our test. In fact, based on Microsoft's longstanding relationship with Citrix, Microsoft suggests using XenDesktop for VDI &#8212; especially for Windows 7 hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guide to Microsoft's dizzying array of desktop virtualization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, you could patch together a VDI solution using a mix of general purpose Microsoft tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, should your organization have Windows Server 2008 R2 with the Hyper-V2 virtualization platform, you're in luck. Microsoft's Systems Center-Virtual Machine Manager (SC-VMM) becomes the orchestration system behind VDI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft provides two flavors of VDI, a Standard and Premium Suite. Running Windows 7 as a hosted VDI-controlled virtual machine requires a Remote Data Services CAL along with Microsoft's Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP). These two pieces are controlled with SC-VMM and SCCM &#8212; the Systems Center Configuration Manager (Standard License).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring and performance management are added by the final component, the System Center Operations Manager. The SCCM doesn't handle dual virtualization schemes, as in VDI and server virtualization &#8212; but the premium license does.Also added in the Premium Suite is App-V for RDS, an enhanced flavor of App-V that allows hosted sessions to use App-V so that the applications can be 'sandboxed' and, if group policy controls are effectively implemented, the application is one more step removed in terms of protection from muddling, data copying, and hosted session malware and potentially, subterfuge. The premium suite also permits non-persistent sessions, as well as persistent or 'owned' VM VDI sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return to main test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;Dec 21 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's biggest
drugmaker, is buying the rights to a stem-cell therapy to treat
inflammatory bowel disease from Athersys Inc (ATHX.O), the New
York Times said on its website late on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer will pay Athersys $6 million initially and up to
$105 million in the future, according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Athersys's cells, which are derived from human bone marrow,
have yet to be tested in people with inflammatory bowel
disease, the paper said.
 Pfizer and Athersys could not be immediately reached for
comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stem cells are the body's ultimate master cells. They make
up days-old embryos and have the power to give rise to all the
cells and tissues in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists hope to use them to transform medicine by
growing new tissue and repairing damage. Opponents say it is
wrong to destroy human embryos for any reason.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney XD, a cable channel targeting young boys, is going royal with a series order for the live-action comedy pilot "Pair of Kings."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The series, which will start production in March for a fall premiere, stars "Hannah Montana" veteran Mitchel Musso and "House of Payne" regular Doc Show as 16-year-old fraternal twins (one white and one black). They are typical teenagers in Chicago raised by their aunt and uncle until they find out that they are heirs to the throne of the island of Kinkou; they relocate there to become kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the cast are Geno Segers as the Royal Secretary, Kelsey Chow as his daughter and Ryan Ochoa as their disgruntled cousin and wannabe king. "Kings" was created by Dan Cross and Dave Hoge of the Disney XD flagship series "Aaron Stone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musso, who is signed by Walt Disney Records, was a regular on "Hannah Montana" and might appear on the show's upcoming fourth season, reprising his role as Oliver. He also voices a character on Disney Channel's "Phineas and Ferb." In addition to his co-starring role on "Payne," Show has had a recurring role on Disney Channel's "The Suite Life on Deck."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney XD's next series, "I'm in the Band," premieres January 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it will tweak its Word application to remove a feature judged to be a breach of patent, ensuring that it will be able to continue selling one of its most widely used programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company made the announcement shortly after a U.S. court of appeals upheld a $290 million jury verdict against it for infringing a patent held by a small Canadian software firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court also affirmed an injunction that prevents Microsoft from selling versions of its Word program which contain the offending software, set to take effect January 11, 2010. Older versions of Word are not affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it is taking steps to remove the feature from Microsoft Word 2007 and Microsoft Office 2007 put on sale from that date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disputed patent feature relates to the use of XML, or extensible markup language, used for manipulating text, in the 2007 versions of Word. Microsoft described it on Tuesday as a "little-used feature".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft did not rule out further appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we are moving quickly to address the injunction issue, we are also considering our legal options," said Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman. He said that could include a request for a rehearing by a full panel of judges at the appeals court, or a request for a review by the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I4i, the Toronto-based software company which owns the infringed patent, welcomed Tuesday's ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I4i is especially pleased with the court's decision to uphold the injunction, an important step in protecting the property rights of small inventors," said Michel Vulpe, founder and co-inventor of i4i, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;END OF CASE IN SIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling -- by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which handles many patent and trademark cases -- may signal the end-game of a long-running dispute between Microsoft and Toronto-based i4i Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 12, a jury in a federal U.S. district court in Texas ruled in favor of i4i against Microsoft, for infringing the XML patent in the 2003 and 2007 versions of Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury slapped more than $290 million in damages on Microsoft and the court granted i4i's motion for an injunction preventing Microsoft from selling versions of Word that contain the disputed patent technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That injunction was stayed while Microsoft appealed the case with the Court of Appeals, but will now go into effect on January 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 0.9 percent at $30.79 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is: i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc v. Microsoft Corp, an appeal from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in case no. 07-CV-113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Matthew Lewis and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;Toronto-based i4i LP has emerged victorious once again in its ongoing patent battle against Microsoft. An appeals court has upheld the earlier judgment and has imposed a deadline of January 11, 2010 for Microsoft to either modify Word to remove the patented technology or cease selling Microsoft Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trio of judges on the appeals court panel stated "A small company was practicing its patent, only to suffer a loss of market share, brand recognition, and customer goodwill as the result of the defendant's infringing acts," adding "The district court found that Microsoft captured 80 percent of the custom XML market with its infringing Word products, forcing i4i to change its business strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Vulpe, founder and co-inventor of the i4i technology in question, applauded the judgment "I4i is especially pleased with the court's decision to uphold the injunction, an important step in protecting the property rights of small inventors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft must now pay the $290 million in fines and damages, and figure out what its next step is for Microsoft Word. The first two of the five reasons I listed in an earlier article on why you don't need to be concerned that Word will go away are no longer on the table after the appeals decision, but that still leaves some options on the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft can still work with i4i to negotiate an amicable arrangement that allows Microsoft to license the technology for a fee and pay royalties to i4i. Depending on the licensing costs, if might be a wiser investment for Microsoft to simply purchase i4i--and its intellectual property with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another option for Microsoft is to comply with the court order to modify the software. Microsoft would still have to pay the $290 million in damages and awards from the lawsuit, but it could continue to sell Microsoft Word, just without the functionality derived from the patent-infringing technology, or by developing an alternative solution that does not breach i4i's intellectual property rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odds that an injunction banning the sale of Microsoft Word will actually come to pass are slim because too many businesses and government agencies rely on the software. Having a dominant market share in a software segment does not give Microsoft license to break laws or bully smaller companies, but it does create a special situation when it comes to managing the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I pointed out in my previous article about the i4i patent case against Word, "The United States Supreme Court has ruled previously that injunctions are generally not a reasonable consequence in a patent challenge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In past cases where national commerce would be significantly affected, the government has stepped in to override court orders and block injunctions. A recent example of the United States government stepping in is when it intervened in an injunction against RIM Blackberry comes to mind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bradley tweets as @PCSecurityNews, and can be contacted at his Facebook page .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.pcworld.com/article/185296&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court today ordered Microsoft to stop selling its popular Word software in less than three weeks, rejecting the company's appeal and confirming the ruling of a lower court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will comply with the injunction, a company spokesman said today. "We are moving quickly to comply with the injunction, which takes effect on January 11, 2010," said Kevin Kutz, the director of public affairs for Microsoft, in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit follows a late-September hearing before a panel of three judges, during which Microsoft argued that a jury verdict earlier this year should be overturned or a retrial should be ordered. It also asked that an injunction ordered by U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Davis be struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has attracted interest primarily because of that injunction, which originally was to bar Microsoft from selling Word as of Oct. 10, 2009. That injunction, however, was suspended after Microsoft threatened that sales chaos would result , and several major computer makers, including Hewlett-Packard and Dell, stepped forward to say the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, it would take five months to modify Word, and the company wouldn't be able to sell Word 2007, and the Office 2007 suite that includes the word processor, during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court agreed with Microsoft on the five-month delay. "We conclude that the district court erred by ordering Microsoft to comply with the injunction within sixty days," the Court of Appeals' order read. Instead, said the judges, the only evidence entered into the record was Microsoft's five-month timetable, which the Jan. 11, 2010, deadline allows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian developer i4i first sued Microsoft in 2007, accusing the U.S. company of illegally using its XML editing technology in the popular Word software line. In May, a Texas jury said Microsoft violated i4i's patent, and ordered it to pay i4i nearly $300 million in damages. The judge issued his injunction on Aug. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Microsoft said it had been planning on this contingency. "With respect to Microsoft Word 2007 and Microsoft Office 2007, we have been preparing for this possibility since the District Court issued its injunction in August 2009 and have put the wheels in motion to remove this little-used feature from these products," Kutz said. "Therefore, we expect to have copies of Microsoft Word 2007 and Office 2007, with this feature removed, available for U.S. sale and distribution by the injunction date."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is not obligated to modify already-purchased copies of Word via a software update, but only to strip the i4i technology from the programs it sells as of Jan. 11, 2010. Currently, the only versions that Microsoft sells to distributors are Word 2007 and Office 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upcoming Word 2010 and Office 2010 -- which were released as previews a month ago -- do not require any changes, Kutz added. "The beta versions of Microsoft Word 2010 and Microsoft Office 2010, which are available now for downloading, do not contain the technology covered by the injunction," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is considering additional legal moves, said Kutz, including requesting a rehearing by the Court of Appeals, or asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals today also reaffirmed the jury verdict in the case, and said that Microsoft was obligated to pay i4i nearly $300 million in damages and interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives from i4i did not reply to a request for comment on today's appeals court ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;  PARSIPPANY, NJ and NEW YORK, NY, Dec 22 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
In the news release, "The Medicines Company Acquires ApoA-I Milano From
Pfizer," issued earlier today by The Medicines Company (NASDAQ: MDCO), we
are advised by the company that the Domestic Dial In number for the
Wednesday, December 23 conference call should be 866-825-1709 rather than
866-285-1709 as originally issued. Complete corrected text follows.

    The Medicines Company Acquires ApoA-I Milano From Pfizer

    Product Has Potential to Reverse Plaque Buildup in Arteries

    PARSIPPANY, NJ and NEW YORK, NY -- December 22, 2009 -- The Medicines
Company (NASDAQ: MDCO) today announced the exclusive worldwide licensing
of ApoA-I Milano from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE). ApoA-I Milano is a
naturally occurring variant of a protein found in human high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) that has the potential to reverse atherosclerotic
plaque development and reduce the risk of coronary events in patients
with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will receive an up-front payment
of $10 million for ApoA-I Milano and will receive additional payments upon
the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and sales milestones up to
a total of $410 million. Pfizer will also be eligible to receive
single-digit royalty payments on worldwide net sales of ApoA-I Milano. The
Medicines Company will also pay $7.5 million to third parties.

    "The acquisition of ApoA-I Milano provides The Medicines Company with a
significant asset that fits well within our current areas of business,"
said Clive Meanwell MD, PhD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The
Medicines Company. "By mimicking the actions of HDL, ApoA-I Milano has
been shown in an early clinical study, published in JAMA, to rapidly
reduce the size of atherosclerotic plaques. This is an area of
cardiovascular medicine that is not yet served by currently available
therapies -- and the potential to provide disease modification for
patients with high risk atheroma and associated acute coronary syndromes
represents a major innovation opportunity."

    "We are very pleased to partner with The Medicines Company to advance the
ApoA-I Milano program as part of our strategy of out licensing programs
that Pfizer no longer pursues internally. The ApoA-I Milano program has
the potential to become a valuable and innovative medicine for the
treatment of cardiovascular diseases. We look forward to seeing it
progress, thanks to The Medicines Company's experience in conducting
large clinical trials in cardiovascular patients as well as their
expertise in treating critical and intensive care patients," said David
K. Rosen DVM, Head of Out Licensing for Pfizer Inc.

    About ApoA-I Milano

    ApoA-I Milano is a naturally occurring variant of apolipoproteinA-I
(ApoA-I), the main protein component of the HDL lipoprotein particle. The
variant has been found in approximately 45 individuals from Limone sul
Garda, a small village in northern Italy. Carriers of this variant appear
to have reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Patented by the University
of Milan and Pharmacia, ApoA-I Milano was licensed to Esperion
Therapeutics. Esperion was subsequently acquired by Pfizer in 2004. Since
that time, Pfizer has moved development forward with improvements to the
original manufacturing process.

    In multiple non-clinical models, ApoA-I Milano rapidly removed excess
cholesterol from artery walls, thereby stabilizing and regressing
atherosclerotic plaque. A phase I-II study in 36 patients demonstrated
statistically significant reductions on coronary plaque volume by 4.2% in
6 weeks. These findings were published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association and continue to be widely referenced and discussed.

    The Medicines Company will host a conference call Wednesday, December 23,
2009 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The conference call will be available via
phone and webcast. The dial in information is listed below:

&lt;p&gt;One of the most heated battles among technology companies was waged this year between Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who think this corporate fight hit a crescendo in 2009, industry analysts say they better think again. It looks like this is just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle escalated this year as the two high-tech titans went after each other's market share and revenue stream in Internet search, operating systems,enterprise applications and browsers . With each company seeing the other as a major threat to its bread and butter products, 2009 may been just a warm-up for the battle that will ensue in the months to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These two companies really squared off this year," said Jim McGregor, an analyst with In-Stat. "Both are looking for dominant positions in the Internet. For Google to increase its business, it needs to move into other territory. For Microsoft to have significant growth opportunities, it needs to become an Internet powerhouse, and they know it. This is not a war that is going to be won by one or two battles. This is going to be a prolonged activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the battle isn't simply over which can be called top dog, because the fight is critical to both companies. "For Google, it's about expanding, and for Microsoft, it's about a life-or-death challenge," McGregor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies basically grew into this face-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, one of the great Internet success stories, has grown into an online behemoth . With a name that has evolved into a verb meaning "to search," Google grown so much that it has become a threat to Microsoft, which has had a long and storied history of high-tech industry dominance. There was a time not so long ago when few believed that any company could rattle Microsoft, let alone a Web company like Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those days are over. Google has rattled Microsoft's cage and, in turn, the software giant has set its sights on taking its new rival down a notch or two. Microsoft has spent millions of dollars and used countless manpower hours to grab a chunk of Google's search market share and topple the Web company from its new lofty perch above the high-tech industry - eliminating the threat to Microsoft's longheld industry dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reason that Microsoft is so focused on Google is because Google is chipping away at Microsoft's crown jewels of Office and Windows with their online applications," said Dan Olds, an analyst with The Gabriel Consulting Group. "While Microsoft plays defense on the applications/operating system front, they're attacking Google on search and online services. Search is the key to Google's success since Web ads account for more than 90% of its revenue. If you can steal some eyes from Google's search engine, you cut into their ad revenue and, perhaps over time, cripple them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This back and forth between the two companies intensified when Microsoft overhauled its far-from-beloved Microsoft Live Search and released the update, Bing search engine in June. But make no mistake about it - Google still owns the search market with a share of more than 64%. But Microsoft's Bing has failed to fail. The new search service has largely been gaining steam, albeit in small increments, but gaining nontheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has more reason to hope that Bing will take a significant chunk out of Google search since the company announced plans over the summer to team with Yahoo Inc. , which holds the second-place spot in the search market - nestled snugly between Google and third-place Bing. The deal, which still has to be approved in the U.S. and in Europe, would have Yahoo give up its own search technology to use Microsoft's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pooling their resources and industry might, the two companies hope to do together what neither has been able to do alone - significantly make gains on Google's ubiquitous search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search battle heated up this fall when both companies announced they had struck individual deals to serve up real-time search results. Microsoft will be offering users real-time tweets from Twitter and posts from Facebook, while Google has already begun working with Twitter to offer up tweets in its search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this fight extends beyond search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google pushed hard this past year to move its cloud-based office applications into the enterprise. Taking on Microsoft's ubiquitous Office applications was a bold move that could prove lucrative if it succeeds. Microsoft, however, isn't sitting back and watching Google move into that territory. The company announced this year that it plans to move its Office applications to the cloud and take on Google head-to-head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Google/Microsoft fight also extends into the browser arena with Google Chrome going up against Internet Explorer. Google also announced that it's working on the Linux-based Chrome OS operating system , which, if widely adopted, could help users see Google's Apps offering as a viable alternative to Microsoft's Office suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This battle was always looking like a long-term conflict," Olds said. "It's the equivalent of high-tech trench warfare. In 2010, we can expect to see the bitter competition continue, with each company keeping up the heat with new features and innovations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGregor noted that the next 18 to 24 months are looking to be fun to watch with the two giants pulling out all the stops, and all their weaponry, to try to take down the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the search market should expect to see a greater focus on real-time search and more advanced algorithms designed to help the search engines figure out what people are thinking and how to give them more information. For instance, instead of searching for pet stores and getting a list of stores in a certain area, users might be given a list of stores along with directions on how to get to each one from their current location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Enderle Group, said we're likely to see more industry players, such as Apple Inc. , Mozilla Corp. and News Corp. aligning against Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both companies are largely betting their collective futures on this battle so the stakes are huge," Enderle said. "Microsoft is going to partner and try to starve Google out of content and partners. Google is going to work against Microsoft's pricing model and starve them out of money. Both are, for once, largely going after each other's relative weaknesses and leveraging their respective strengths, so this will likely be a battle for the history books."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Gaudin covers Internet and Web 2.0, emerging technologies and desktop/laptop chips for Computerworld .

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

AIG Plans TARP Repayment

In a major revelation, American International Group Inc. (NYSE: AIG) has
disclosed its target of repaying the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) loan
back to the U.S. government within the next two years. For this, the company
expects to raise funds through earnings from business operations and also by
disposing of unnecessary businesses in the near term. 

Taking the repayment bull by its horns, AIG`s CEO Robert Benmosche recently
charted out his plan of repaying the $182 billion that it received as aid from
the U.S. government`s Federal Reserve and the Treasury. While the CEO believes
that if AIG gets more time for repayment, it will be in a better position to pay
in full without sacrificing its major assets. 

However, taking more time will also mean dishing out more interests on the loans
taken. For one example, AIG has to pay 3% plus 3-month Libor rate to the
government in interest on one $25 billion 5-year loan. 

Other concerns are the improvement in overall aggressive managerial efficiency,
regenerating confidence among the company's dispirited staff and withstanding
consistent pressure from the U.S. government to sell assets quickly to repay
debts. These issues have to be dealt with head on and immediately to help the
company from collapsing. 

The U.S. government already holds a significant share in AIG. Against one loan
of $26 billion, the government held preferred interest in entities holding all
the common stock of American Life Insurance Co. and American International
Assurance Co, two life insurance holding companies that are subsidiaries of AIG.


We believe that while most of the major institutions in the financial market
like Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC), Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE: WFC), Citigroup
Inc. (NYSE: C) and Goldman Sachs Inc. (NYSE: GS) have repaid or are on the verge
of repaying the TARP loan, AIG has to take vigorous and strategic steps to rid
the company of its TARP baggage and the ensuing government pressure. However,
given the huge amount of the loan, taking a longer time period compared to its
peers is inevitable.

U.S. Bank Failures Touch 140 in 2009

In the third quarter of 2009, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 552 from 416 in the second quarter. This is the highest
since 1993. Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are expected to
cause hundreds more bank failures in the next few years. 

The FDIC anticipates bank failures to cost about $100 billion over the next four
years. In order to replenish the depleting fund, the FDIC board recently
mandated U.S. banks to pay fees for three years in advance. 

Also, the regulators are considering requesting the healthy banks to bail out
the government as soon as it is necessary to refill the deposit insurance fund.
The FDIC also has access to the Treasury Department credit line of up to $500
billion. 

The failure of Washington Mutual last year was the largest in U.S. banking
history. It was acquired by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The other major
acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq:
FITB), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), Zions Bancorp (Nasdaq: ZION) and SunTrust Banks
(NYSE: STI).

&lt;p&gt;  PARSIPPANY, NJ and NEW YORK, NY, Dec 22 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
The Medicines Company (NASDAQ: MDCO) today announced the exclusive
worldwide licensing of ApoA-I Milano from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE). ApoA-I
Milano is a naturally occurring variant of a protein found in human
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that has the potential to reverse
atherosclerotic plaque development and reduce the risk of coronary events
in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will receive an up-front payment
of $10 million for ApoA-I Milano and will receive additional payments upon
the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and sales milestones up to
a total of $410 million. Pfizer will also be eligible to receive
single-digit royalty payments on worldwide net sales of ApoA-I Milano. The
Medicines Company will also pay $7.5 million to third parties.

    "The acquisition of ApoA-I Milano provides The Medicines Company with a
significant asset that fits well within our current areas of business,"
said Clive Meanwell MD, PhD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The
Medicines Company. "By mimicking the actions of HDL, ApoA-I Milano has
been shown in an early clinical study, published in JAMA, to rapidly
reduce the size of atherosclerotic plaques. This is an area of
cardiovascular medicine that is not yet served by currently available
therapies -- and the potential to provide disease modification for
patients with high risk atheroma and associated acute coronary syndromes
represents a major innovation opportunity."

    "We are very pleased to partner with The Medicines Company to advance the
ApoA-I Milano program as part of our strategy of out licensing programs
that Pfizer no longer pursues internally. The ApoA-I Milano program has
the potential to become a valuable and innovative medicine for the
treatment of cardiovascular diseases. We look forward to seeing it
progress, thanks to The Medicines Company's experience in conducting
large clinical trials in cardiovascular patients as well as their
expertise in treating critical and intensive care patients," said David
K. Rosen DVM, Head of Out Licensing for Pfizer Inc.

    About ApoA-I Milano

    ApoA-I Milano is a naturally occurring variant of apolipoproteinA-I
(ApoA-I), the main protein component of the HDL lipoprotein particle. The
variant has been found in approximately 45 individuals from Limone sul
Garda, a small village in northern Italy. Carriers of this variant appear
to have reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Patented by the University
of Milan and Pharmacia, ApoA-I Milano was licensed to Esperion
Therapeutics. Esperion was subsequently acquired by Pfizer in 2004. Since
that time, Pfizer has moved development forward with improvements to the
original manufacturing process.

    In multiple non-clinical models, ApoA-I Milano rapidly removed excess
cholesterol from artery walls, thereby stabilizing and regressing
atherosclerotic plaque. A phase I-II study in 36 patients demonstrated
statistically significant reductions on coronary plaque volume by 4.2% in
6 weeks. These findings were published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association and continue to be widely referenced and discussed.

    The Medicines Company will host a conference call Wednesday, December 23,
2009 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The conference call will be available via
phone and webcast. The dial in information is listed below:

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it will tweak its Word application to remove a feature judged to be a breach of patent, ensuring that it will be able to continue selling one of its most widely used programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company made the announcement shortly after a U.S. court of appeals upheld a $290 million jury verdict against it for infringing a patent held by a small Canadian software firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court also affirmed an injunction that prevents Microsoft from selling versions of its Word program which contain the offending software, set to take effect January 11, 2010. Older versions of Word are not affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it is taking steps to remove the feature from Microsoft Word 2007 and Microsoft Office 2007 put on sale from that date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disputed patent feature relates to the use of XML, or extensible markup language, used for manipulating text, in the 2007 versions of Word. Microsoft described it on Tuesday as a "little-used feature".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft did not rule out further appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we are moving quickly to address the injunction issue, we are also considering our legal options," said Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman. He said that could include a request for a rehearing by a full panel of judges at the appeals court, or a request for a review by the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I4i, the Toronto-based software company which owns the infringed patent, welcomed Tuesday's ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I4i is especially pleased with the court's decision to uphold the injunction, an important step in protecting the property rights of small inventors," said Michel Vulpe, founder and co-inventor of i4i, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;END OF CASE IN SIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling -- by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which handles many patent and trademark cases -- may signal the end-game of a long-running dispute between Microsoft and Toronto-based i4i Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 12, a jury in a federal U.S. district court in Texas ruled in favor of i4i against Microsoft, for infringing the XML patent in the 2003 and 2007 versions of Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury slapped more than $290 million in damages on Microsoft and the court granted i4i's motion for an injunction preventing Microsoft from selling versions of Word that contain the disputed patent technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That injunction was stayed while Microsoft appealed the case with the Court of Appeals, but will now go into effect on January 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 0.9 percent at $30.79 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is: i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc v.

&lt;p&gt;Apple is looking to add monthly subscriptions to the TV content available in its online iTunes store, and Disney and CBS are interested in signing on, according to a news report.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Apple's plan is to launch a service next year, The Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday. Currently, the company is pushing TV networks to sign licensing deals, but it is unclear whether any of them have signed on yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad-financed streaming will dominate TV distribution over the Internet going forward, but there will also be room for paid services, according to Ingrid Salomonsson, media analyst at Swedish market research company Mediavision. Content and price will decide whether a service becomes a success or not -- after all, content is queen, Salomonsson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CBS is considering offering programs from both the CBS and CW networks, and Disney is doing the same for content from ABC and the Disney Channel, according to the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An initial bundle of programs from CBS, Disney and other networks would be sold as a "Best of TV" package, and would cost US$30 a month, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new video strategy is part of an overhaul the iTunes store. Apple recently acquired online music streaming company Lala, but was secretive about its plans, only saying that it from time to time buys smaller technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TV push could also boost sales of Apple's TV box, which has been struggling compared to other Apple products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Dec 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Intermedia, the global leader in Microsoft Exchange hosting, today
enhanced its hosted Exchange 2010 offering with features that provide
additional controls to customers. Intermedia is the first and only
provider to launch hosted Exchange 2010 and recently enabled its partners
to resell it. The company remains the only hosted Exchange 2010 provider.

    The new features are part of Intermedia's HostPilot(R) Control Panel,
which enables business owners and IT managers to delegate complex Exchange
administration -- such as deleting data from a lost BlackBerry Wireless
Handheld(TM) -- to non-technical staff. Highlights of the new
features
include:


--  Properties Management Restrictions: Account administrators can set
    parameters for which properties -- such as passwords -- that their end-
    users can and cannot change.
--  Spam Kill Score: An enhancement to Intermedia's SpamStopper product,
    customers can set separate sensitivity levels for handling spam, marking
    spam for deletion or delivery to the Junk email folder dependent on the
    spam's characteristics.
--  Create Web Hosting Account from Exchange Account: Intermedia hosted
    Exchange customers can now add a web hosting account with a few clicks of
    their mouse. The account can be managed from HostPilot Control Panel
    alongside the Exchange environment.
    

    
Members of Intermedia's Affiliate Program -- companies or individuals
that resell Intermedia's services directly -- will also see greater
control with the addition of recurring commission to Intermedia's
commission model. Affiliates can now choose from a one-time commission or
a recurring commission model when they initially sign on. Affiliates will
also benefit from a redesign of the affiliate section of the HostPilot
Control Panel, including new reports and tools designed to increase their
sales. Intermedia's Partner Program continues to feature a "private
label" option to resell services under a partner's own brand.

    "As the first company to market with hosted Exchange 2010 and the first to
offer a hosted Exchange 2010 reseller program, we continue to enhance our
offering with proprietary features and management controls," says Jonathan
McCormick, chief operating officer, Intermedia. "These capabilities are
exposed in an intuitive way, saving time and simplifying administration of
the Exchange environment."

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, Dec 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Under proposals outlined in a recent report commissioned by the Home
Office, more graduates could be eligible for entry into the UK under the
Tier 1 (HSMP replacement) scheme. The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC)
report has suggested that Bachelor degrees should be taken into account
when processing applications for visas. This will mean that in the New
Year, millions of qualified migrant workers who are not currently
eligible for entry into the UK will be able to apply for a visa.

    This is part of measures outlined by the Government in their Highly
Skilled Migration Programme (HSMP). This has since been replaced by the
Tier 1 scheme, which aims to help those with desirable professional
skills, qualifications and experience to gain entry into the United
Kingdom.

    Tier 1 is the first of a new 5 part immigration system to assess
eligibility for UK entry. Applying for a Tier 1 visa is an applicant led
process and removes the need for candidates to apply for a UK work permit
visa. Successful candidates gain the right to live and work in the UK,
seek and undertake employment, set up a business or become self employed
as they see fit.

    The application process is based on a points system, which includes
factors such as age, qualifications and previous earnings. This is
designed to allow entry to those who will contribute the most to the UK
economy. Based on a similar system used in Australia and Canada,
candidates are also required to be proficient in the English Language.

    London-based Global Visas is a specialist immigration consultancy with
over 15 years experience in the sector. They offer a full UK visa service
to cater for all tiers of the new immigration system. The consideration
of Bachelor degrees in the Tier 1 application process has been welcomed
by Director Liam Clifford, who commented:

    "The MAC report to the Government suggesting they now accept Bachelor
degrees is fantastic news for UK employers. It is a fact that we do not
produce enough highly skilled workers and if the UK is to maintain its
competitive edge as a nation of invention and progress, our employers
need to be able to attract and retain the best candidates from around the
world."

    Continued:

    "Those highly skilled individuals who want to make the UK their home and
contribute to our economy can not currently do so. The UK can only
benefit from having these highly talented and motivated people in our
work force."

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Shares of biotechnology company Athersys Inc (ATHX.O) continued their rally for the second day on Tuesday, a day after the company inked a deal with pharma giant Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on its experimental stem cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, Pfizer will pay Athersys $6 million upfront and up to $105 million in milestones for Athersy's stem cell therapy, MultiStem, which is being developed for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Stephen Brozak of WBB Securities said, "this deal is an indication that Athersys is not only demonstrating confidence in the program, but also maintaining control of its destiny with regard to other, more advanced MultiStem applications, such as MultiStem for Bone Marrow Transplants and MultiStem for Acute Myocardial Infarctions (heart attack)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the applications are being tested in an early stage clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brozak upgraded the stock to "buy" but reiterated his $8 price target on the shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company were up 35 pct at $3.23 on Nasdaq. They rose to as much as $3.59 earlier in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 8 million shares changed hands in morning trade, more than 8 times their 10-day moving average volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Krishnakali Sengupta in Bangalore; Editing by Unnikrishnan Nair)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI Dec 22 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) on Tuesday said
it had signed a 10-year outsourcing deal with Indian cable and
broadband distribution firm Digicable, which will make an

significant growth in deals in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is the minimum commitment. As Digicable grows, there
is significant potential for this to grow," he said of the
Digicable deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has annual revenue of $2 billion globally from the

&lt;p&gt;Genuitec released earlier this month version 3.0 of its Pulse software lifecycle management product and is suggesting it as a possible enterprise-level replacement for IBM's Jazz application lifecycle management technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Available now, Pulse is a general purpose software management system geared toward software projects being built using Eclipse tools. Version 3.0 features a dashboard enabling developers, systems engineers, and architects to synchronize the process of software development and delivery, Genuitec said. The release introduces a capability for authorized team members to contribute to one or more projects that are standardized and shared, boosting collaboration. Administrators can set permissions and restrictions on project access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Mainsoft is integrating Jazz with Lotus Connections. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Pulse is] actually similar to a lot of the concepts that IBM's trying to do with Jazz but a little different in scope," said Todd Williams, vice president of technology at Genuitec. IBM with Jazz wants to offer an all-or-nothing proposition for handling all stages of a project, including requirements and defect tracking, Williams said. Genuitec offers integration with what developers already use in such areas as requirements and defect tracking and application creation tools, according to Genuitec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulse 3.0 Community Edition is a free hosted version for individual developers. Pulse 3.0 Freelance Team Edition, installed at a user site, enables users to share profiles and environment settings. It costs $6 per month per user or $60 per year. A free 30-day trial is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, "Genuitec looks to battle IBM Jazz in ALM product rollout," was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) issued a Complete Response letter regarding the company`s New Drug
Application (NDA) for Lyrica&#174; (pregabalin) capsules CV as a monotherapy
treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The FDA determined that the
data contained in the NDA were insufficient to support approval. The application
was a resubmission in response to a "not-approvable" letter issued by the FDA in
August 2004. The FDA continues to review a separate application for Lyrica as
adjunctive therapy for the treatment of GAD. 

"We are disappointed with the FDA`s decision and will work with the agency to
determine next steps," said Steve Romano, vice president, Medical Affairs Head,
Primary Care Business Unit. "Given the chronic nature of GAD and the number of
patients who continue to experience anxiety symptoms despite treatment, there is
a clear unmet need for new and different treatment options."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 24 (Reuters) - An early study of Pfizer's
(PFE.N) experimental drug figitumumab has found it could help
fight a rare bone cancer called Ewing's sarcoma, researchers
said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Scientists reporting in the Lancet Oncology journal said
their results showed the anti-cancer drug, which targets the
insulin-like growth-factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), was well
tolerated and should move to Phase 2 trials in Ewing's
sarcoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ewing's sarcoma is a rare cancer in which tumour cells are
found in the bone or soft tissue, most commonly the pelvis,
thigh, upper arm and ribs. It affects mainly male teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers at Britain's Institute for Cancer Research and
the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust analysed the effect of
the drug on some 28 patients with various types of sarcoma and
found some tumours in those with Ewing's sarcoma shrank when
they took figitumumab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Figitumumab is well tolerated and has antitumour activity
in Ewing's sarcoma, warranting further investigation in this
disease," the researchers wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer halted a Phase 3 trial of figitumumab in late stage
lung cancer in October after safety monitors overseeing the
study found more serious adverse events, including deaths.
[ID:nN09392583]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The British scientists said their study, funded by Pfizer,
found figitumumab can be safe for both adult and child sarcomas
and patients were now being recruited for Phase 2 trials.

royalties owed for natural gas produced from federal and Indian

all claims were resolved by mutual agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The agreement states that Chevron makes no admission of
any kind concerning improper or fraudulent actions or omissions
on its part and Chevron re-asserts that it did not engage in

 (Adds analyst comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alexei Oreskovic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
nominated Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg to its board on Wednesday,
a move by the 86-year-old media company to tap into the
younger, popular world of online social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, is 40, which

tripled in size during the past 16 months to more than 350
million users, gives Disney valuable first-hand insight from
one of the Web's fastest-growing companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It shows that Disney is committed to taking social
networking seriously, integrating social networking into its
traditional entertainment content," said Needham  Co analyst
Laura Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She added that bringing Sandberg to the board is a
cost-effective way for Disney to acquire Web expertise, as
opposed to acquiring a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News Corp (NWSA.O) paid $580 million for social networking

been eclipsed by Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Should Sandberg become a director, it would expand the size

said the board size has varied between 11 and 13 directors over
the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "She knows a lot about a lot of the areas of new media and

(GOOG.O) and who worked at the U.S. Treasury Department, was
not available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney, which generated $36 billion in revenues in its most
recent fiscal year, owns media properties, including the Walt
Disney Pictures movie studio, ABC Television Networks and cable
sports network ESPN and part of online video website Hulu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oppenheimer  Co analyst Jason Helfstein said Disney's
Internet operations are currently immaterial to its earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "None of the big media companies make much money on the

&lt;p&gt;BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) Board of Directors has nominated Sheryl
Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook Inc., to be a new independent
director, effective upon her election at the Company`s next annual meeting. 

"Sheryl is an outstanding executive who can add incredible value to what is
already a diverse and highly experienced group of directors," said John E.
Pepper Jr., Disney`s chairman. "She brings great expertise in the online world,
considerable international experience and a deep understanding of consumer
behavior." 

Sandberg has served as COO of Facebook, an online social utility company, since
March 2008. In that capacity, she has been responsible for building Facebook`s
operations globally and managing its sales, marketing, business development,
human resources, public policy, privacy and communications functions. Facebook
is now considered the number one global social network with more than 350
million members. 

Prior to joining Facebook, Sandberg was Vice President of Global Online Sales
and Operations for Google Inc., an Internet search engine company, a post she
assumed in 2001. In that role, she built and managed Google`s online sales
channels, which represents the majority of Google`s customers worldwide, for
both AdWords and AdSense. 

Sandberg, 40, is also a former Chief of Staff of the United States Treasury
Department and previously served as a management consultant with McKinsey &amp;
Company and as an economist with The World Bank. 

"Sheryl has been at the forefront of a technological revolution that`s opened up
a world of new possibilities for consumers and which has greatly affected the
way we do business," said Robert A. Iger, Disney`s President and Chief Executive
Officer. "Her unique insight, born of great practical experience, will be of
considerable value to Disney`s shareholders." 

"Disney has remained an entertainment icon around the world for over 80 years by
enthusiastically embracing change and new technologies," said Sandberg. "It`s a
tremendous honor to be nominated to the Disney board." 

Sandberg is also a director of Starbucks Corp. and serves on a number of
nonprofit boards including The Brookings Institution, The AdCouncil, Women for
Women International and V-Day. She received a Master`s Degree in business
administration from Harvard Business School and a Bachelor`s Degree in economics
from Harvard University. 

Disney shareholders will vote on Sandberg`s nomination and the re-election of
the Company`s other 12 directors at the next Disney annual meeting, March 10,
2010 in San Antonio, Texas.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft already has a patch available that strips out XML technology the company is barred from using after Jan. 11, in Word 2007 and Office 2007, according to a Microsoft Web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patch targets large computer makers that factory-install Microsoft Office on new PCs before they're shipped to dealers or customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ZDNet blogger Ed Bott first reported , Microsoft's OEM Partner Center now includes a prominent notice and a link to a 13MB update. "Microsoft has released a supplement for Office 2007 (October 2009)," the site reads. "The following patch is required [ emphasis in original ] for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After this patch is installed, Word will no longer read the Custom XML elements contained within DOCX, DOCM, or XML files," the notice continues. "These files will continue to open, but any Custom XML elements will be removed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal District ordered Microsoft to stop selling current versions of Word and Office as of Jan. 11, 2010, part of a ruling that rejected Microsoft's appeal of a jury verdict that awarded Canadian developer i4i nearly $300 million in damages. The lower court judge in the patent infringement case had also slapped an injunction on Microsoft to block it from selling Word in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injunction was to take effect Oct. 10, 2009, but Microsoft won a stay while the appeals court heard the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than stop selling Word 2007, and the money-making Office 2007 that includes the word processor, Microsoft will yank the offending XML editing technology -- dubbed "Custom XML" -- from Word. Tuesday, the company said it had been planning for the eventuality, and would have its ducks in a row by Jan. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With respect to Microsoft Word 2007 and Microsoft Office 2007, we have been preparing for this possibility since the District Court issued its injunction in August 2009 and have put the wheels in motion to remove this little-used feature from these products," said Kevin Kutz, the director of public affairs for Microsoft, in an e-mail. "Therefore, we expect to have copies of Microsoft Word 2007 and Office 2007, with this feature removed, available for U.S. sale and distribution by the injunction date."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is not obligated to modify already-purchased copies of Word via a software update, but only to remove the i4i technology from the programs sold starting Jan. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft will be responsible for revamping Word and Office for retail distribution, then swapping out new copies for those on shelves, many computer makers pre-load the popular suite on their PCs. They would need time to get the revised Word and Office onto new machines, and those machines into their retail and distribution channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bott, Microsoft's OEM partners were first notified Monday via e-mail of an upcoming patch required for Office 2007. The Tuesday release of the patch gives OEMs just under three weeks to re-load already-built PCs or replace them with machines with the revised Office 2007 before the Jan. 11 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's two largest computer sellers -- Dell and Hewlett-Packard -- sided with Microsoft in its appeal of the injunction last summer, and warned that the original Oct. 11 deadline would wreak havoc with sales. In their amicus curiae , or "friend of the court," briefs, Dell and HP asked that compliance with any injunction be delayed until 120 days after a decision was made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell and HP have far less time than that to implement the changes to Office 2007 on their inventory, or swap out PCs already in the channel with new ones. HP did not respond to a request for comment late Tuesday; the company's offices are closed until Jan. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;First, the good news: No, you won't have to turn in your copies of Office 2007, even now that Microsoft has lost its appeal of a lawsuit brought by the Canadian company, i4i. The lawsuit, a patent battle over a feature few business users ever see, will cost Microsoft $290 million to settle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, more good news: There is little to no chance Microsoft will be forced to stop selling Word 2007 and Office 2007 on Jan. 11, another potential outcome of the suit. Microsoft says it has been working on a fix that avoids the patent and will roll-out non-infringing versions of both Office and Word before the court's deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forthcoming Office 2010 and Word 2010 do not use the technology that was the subject of the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution could be simply removing the infringing code, which involves using customer XML data in Word documents. Microsoft might develop a non-infringing way to implement the feature. Or maybe it will buy i4i and its intellectual property, solving the patent problem that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, even if Microsoft did nothing, courts are unlikely to stop sales of such an important product, according to my colleague, Tony Bradley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2007 lawsuit, challenged Microsoft's use of XML technology covered by a patent awarded to iXi. Microsoft lost in federal district court in East Texas, and lost again before a three-judge appeals panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Coursey has been writing about technology products and companies for more than 25 years.

&lt;p&gt;TEL AVIV, Israel--(Business Wire)--
Compugen Ltd. (NASDAQ:CGEN) announced today that it has signed a collaboration
agreement with Pfizer for the predictive discovery by Compugen of therapeutic
peptide product candidates for three drug targets of interest to Pfizer. The
discovery process, which will be based on various Compugen discovery platforms
and funded by Pfizer, is expected to take a few months, following which the
predicted molecules will be synthesized and delivered to Pfizer. Following an
evaluation period, Pfizer will have the right to exercise options for worldwide
exclusive milestone and royalty bearing licenses to develop and commercialize
the selected product candidates or further optimize them to obtain final potent,
selective product candidates with favorable pharmacokinetic properties. 

"Although use of our various discovery platforms is now providing us with a
growing inventory of novel drug and target candidates for further development
and licensing, the most unique aspect of our capabilities is the ability to
systematically and within a short timeframe provide, what we call, discovery on
demand product candidates for selected areas of interest to our partners," Dr.
Anat Cohen-Dayag, president and co-CEO of Compugen said. "We are extremely
pleased to be entering into this multi-target collaboration with Pfizer, and we
look forward to entering into similar agreements with additional pharmaceutical
and biopharmaceutical companies." 

About Compugen`s Discovery Platforms

During the past few years, Compugen has designed, developed, validated and
disclosed ten product candidate discovery platforms directed at various
important areas of drug and diagnostic discovery. The development of this
diverse range of discovery platforms in such a short period of time was possible
only due to Compugen`s commitment since 1997 to understand deeply the science
underlying various important biological phenomena. Utilizing this continuously
growing base of scientific understanding, Compugen has created, and continues to
create, predictive models, algorithms and other computational biology
methodologies that provide a unique and rich infrastructure for the design of
systematic platforms for the predictive discovery of novel drug, target and
biomarker candidates. 

Most of Compugen`s ten discovery platforms developed to date are based on a
process of in silico prediction and selection, followed by synthesis and
experimental validation. The initial in silico predictions usually involve a
large number - often in the thousands or more - of possible candidates, with the
selection step resulting in a very small subset - usually dozens of molecules or
less - which are predicted to have the highest probability of success. These
molecules are then prioritized, synthesized, and experimentally validated. Among
the Compugen platforms developed to date based on this
prediction-selection-validation process are platforms designed for the discovery
of therapeutic proteins and peptides, targets for monoclonal antibodies, and
both molecular and genetic biomarkers. 

One of the key Compugen platforms to be utilized in the Pfizer collaboration
announced today was recently developed, and has not yet been publicly disclosed.
This undisclosed platform is based on a process which is different from the
prediction-selection-validation process underlying most of Compugen`s previously
announced discovery platforms as described above. In this second process,
Compugen`s multidisciplinary scientific team uses its understandings of certain
basic biological phenomena and advanced computational biology capabilities to
"design", in silico, molecules that should meet the specific requirements needed
for them to become optimal therapeutic candidates for the relevant target. As
with all of our in silico platforms, these predicted molecular sequences are
then synthesized and experimentally validated. This prediction-design-validation
approach is also the process utilized by Compugen`s previously disclosed Disease
Associated Conformations ("DAC") Blockers Platform, but in this case employing
different discovery principles and models. 

About Compugen

Compugen is a leading drug and diagnostic product candidate discovery company.
Unlike traditional high throughput trial and error experimental based discovery,
Compugen`s discovery efforts are based on in silico (by computer) prediction and
selection utilizing a growing number of field focused proprietary discovery
platforms accurately modeling biological processes at the molecular level. The
resulting product candidates are then validated through in vitro and in vivo
experimental studies and out-licensed for further development and
commercialization under various forms of revenue sharing agreements. Compugen`s
collaborations to date include Bayer Schering Pharma, Biosite, Medarex, Inc.,
Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Merck Serono, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics (a Johnson &amp; Johnson
company), Pfizer, Roche, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc., and Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries. In 2002, Compugen established an affiliate, Evogene
Ltd. www.evogene.com (TASE:EVGN.TA), to utilize certain of the Company`s in
silico predictive discovery capabilities in agricultural biotechnology. For

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Time Warner Eyes Cable Vision

Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE: TWC), the second largest cable MSO in the U.S.,
said it may try to acquire rival cable TV operators in order to consolidate its
position in the industry as well as to put pressure on its major rival Comcast
Corp. (Nasdaq: CMCSA). The company has decided to remain a pure play content
distribution platform. Investing in high-speed Internet and the commercial
business will remain the major growth initiative of Time Warner Cable. 

Despite recession, Time Warner Cable sharpened its focus on business telecom
services to make up for sagging revenues from residential subscribers. The
company has hiked its capital spending on commercial-related plant and equipment
upgrades while cutting its residential capital expenditure budget. Time Warner
Cable is aggressively rolling-out next-generation DOCSIS 3.0 (also called
Wideband) service. The company has decided to continue to roll-out switched
digital video (SDV). Deployment of SDV will free up bandwidth that can be used
by Time Warner Cable to offer 100 high-definition TV channels (HDTV), HD
video-on-demand programs, and DOCSIS 3.0. 

Time Warner Cable management indicated that the company may try to acquire its
rival cable MSO, Cable Vision Systems Corp. (NYSE: CVC) of New York or may
purchase the Los Angeles assets of Charter Communications Inc. However,
management clearly mentioned that it has no plans to acquire any content
producing company. Comcast, on the other hand, has recently acquired ownership
stake of NBC Universal from General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE). 

Time Warner Cable is giving emphasis on providing IP-Ethernet services
everywhere and booting up cloud computing services. Next-generation WiMAX
service is another major venture. Under the brand name of "Road Runner Mobile",
this super-fast mobile broadband network will provide its subscribers the
convenience of mobility so that customers can enjoy WiMAX services on their
devices anywhere they go within their service circle. Time Warner Cable will
utilize the nationwide WiMAX network infrastructure being set up by Clearwire
Corp. (Nasdaq: CLWR).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

AOL to Trim Headcount

AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL) recently declared that its Board of Directors has approved
a plan to trim one-third of its headcount, as a part of its restructuring
program, which also involves shedding some assets. 

AOL will incur a restructuring charge of $200 million, including approximately
$150 million related to employee severance and benefits. AOL`s divorce from Time
Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX), a global leader in media and entertainment businesses,
took place on Dec 9, 2009. 

AOL had been striving to revamp itself to become an independent online company
preparing to compete with Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG), Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO)
and Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT) in the U.S. market for online
advertising valued at $29 billion. The company will now focus more on capturing
online readership by increasing content offerings and providing an online
advertising platform. 

AOL`s revenue dipped 23% to $777 million in third-quarter 2009 due to a 29% drop
in subscription revenue, resulting from sustained subscriber losses and an 18%
fall in advertising revenue. AOL lost nearly 438,000 subscribers during the
period. 

AOL owns and operates more than 80 branded and niche content sites, which
include independent music site Spinner, sports site Fanhouse, Engadget for tech
news, MapQuest site and social-networking service Bebo.

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian developer that won a $290 million court judgment against Microsoft will be going over future Microsoft software "extremely carefully" to make sure its patent hasn't been infringed, the chairman of i4i said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Loudon Owen declined to say whether his company's software engineers had been picking through Office 2010 -- which Microsoft said did not use i4i's Custom XML technology -- he promised that they would be looking at all Microsoft software for evidence of wrongdoing. Microsoft released a public beta of Office 2010 in mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to look extremely carefully at all Microsoft products," Loudon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presumably, that also means the revised Word 2007 Microsoft must produce by Jan. 11, 2010 if it wants to continue selling Word, and the lucrative Office 2007 franchise that includes Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, a federal court rejected Microsoft's appeal and confirmed the ruling of a lower court that said the software giant owed i4i $290 million in damages and interest for infringing the Toronto-based firm's XML editing technology. Along with the financial judgment, the lower court judge also barred Microsoft from selling versions of Word that include the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit order on Tuesday set the start of that injunction as Jan. 11, less than three weeks from today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it will be ready with a revised, Custom XML-less version of Word 2007 and Office 2007 by that date. Computer makers already have been issued a patch that lets them factory-install a compliant edition of Office on new PCs before they're shipped to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its only public statement on the appeals ruling, Microsoft downplayed the significance of the move, calling the XML editing function it was stripping from Word a "little-used feature."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loudon said that was simply short-sighted. "There's a big missing link in Microsoft's [public] statement," he said in a telephone interview today. "That's something called a customer. Microsoft did not address customers [in its statement], but there are a lot of its customers using Custom XML in Word."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where i4i comes in, Loudon continued. "We'll be taking lots of calls from customers who want Custom XML," he argued. "We already are. The premise behind i4i is that this is a very, very important functionality, and a huge reason that Microsoft put forward to potential customers to buy the new Office 2003 and Office 2007. And now their patch is removing it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it appears Microsoft is moving forward with a technical fix to the problem -- rather than license i4i's Custom XML technology -- Loudon said that i4i is, even now, willing to talk to its legal rival about a licensing deal. "We're always open to talking to anyone reasonably," said Loudon. "We'll talk with Microsoft if they're reasonable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be a while before i4i sees the nearly $300 million from Microsoft that the appeals court confirmed the Redmond, Wash. developer must pay. According to Loudon, Microsoft is not obligated to settle its account until 15 days after they've exhausted the last possible appeal. Tuesday, Microsoft said it is keeping its legal options open and might request a rehearing by the Court of Appeals, or ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They owe us quite a bit of money," Loudon noted. "But we want to be the ones to make up our minds about who uses our technology. We're here to build a business. So the next step for us? Go back to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld .

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI (Reuters) - India softened its stand on Thursday on plans to tighten rules for Indian visas that were drafted following the arrest of a Chicago man alleged to have prior knowledge of the Mumbai attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On complaints from foreign missions about a proposal to restrict travelers on long-term multiple-entry tourist visas from entering India within two months of their last departure from India, the government said it would make some allowances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonafide tourists who planned to visit another country and re-enter India "may be permitted two or three entries, as the case may be, subject to their submission of a detailed itinerary and supporting documentation," a foreign ministry spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original proposal would have been a blow for many tourists who use India as a hub to visit other countries in the region, as well as for some businessmen who use long-term tourist visas for frequent trips to avoid red tape and paperwork delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign missions in India had complained of inconsistency and a lack of clarity in the new and proposed rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These new visa and registration regulations are being implemented inconsistently and are not finalized," the U.S. Mission in India said in a notice on its website, adding it had received complaints from several Americans about the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson, on a recent visit to India, raised the issue with Home Minister P. Chidambaram, home ministry officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have written to the government asking for some clarifications," a British High Commission official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's move comes on the heels of limits on business visas earlier in the year: India said those working in the country on business visas needed employment permits, which affected hundreds of Chinese engineers working on power projects in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chidambaram said on Wednesday there were gaps in the visa system, which were exposed in the case of Pakistan-born David Coleman Headley, accused of making five scouting trips to Mumbai for militant Pakistani groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headley allegedly used his associate's business as a cover during his trips to Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The compelling need to create a fool-proof system cannot be overstated," said Chidambaram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A draft for new rules "for facilitating legitimate travelers and strengthening security" is likely to be ready early in 2010.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/727977/the_greater_chines) has
announced the addition of the "The Greater Chinese Notebook PC Industry, 4Q
2009" report to their offering. 

This research report presents shipment volume and value forecast and recent
quarter review of the greater Chinese notebook PC industry. The report includes
shipment volume and value, ASP, manufacturer volume ranking, shipment by tier,
shipment by maker, and shipment by price point, and product mix analysis. The
content of this report is based on primary data obtained through interviews with
notebook PC makers. The report finds that although some notebook PC
manufacturers failed to reach shipment goals due to the shortage of some
components, the overall greater Chinese notebook PC shipment volume still scored
considerable growth in the third quarter of 2009. A major factor affecting the
greater Chinese notebook PC shipments in the third quarter of 2009 is the launch
of Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system, which has prompted vendors to
advance shipments and has stimulated consumer demand. At the same time though,
the market has seen the withholding of purchase anticipating the launch of
Windows 7. Boosted by the rollout of new operating system and new CPU platforms,
it is projected that a new wave of replacement demand will likely emerge
starting in 2010.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) issued a Complete Response letter regarding the company`s New Drug
Application (NDA) for Lyrica&#174; (pregabalin) capsules CV as a monotherapy
treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The FDA determined that the
data contained in the NDA were insufficient to support approval. The application
was a resubmission in response to a "not-approvable" letter issued by the FDA in
August 2004. The FDA continues to review a separate application for Lyrica as
adjunctive therapy for the treatment of GAD. 

"We are disappointed with the FDA`s decision and will work with the agency to
determine next steps," said Steve Romano, vice president, Medical Affairs Head,
Primary Care Business Unit. "Given the chronic nature of GAD and the number of
patients who continue to experience anxiety symptoms despite treatment, there is
a clear unmet need for new and different treatment options."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) has sued a former private banking executive arrested last year in Argentina on criminal charges, accusing him of stealing $2.8 million from a customer's account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. bank filed its civil lawsuit on Monday against former vice president Hernan Arbizu, 17 months after his July 2008 arrest in Buenos Aires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors charged Arbizu in a 15-count indictment unsealed that month with embezzling $5.4 million from customers at JPMorgan and a prior employer, UBS AG (UBSN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, JPMorgan accused Arbizu of arranging for funds to be wired to a customer account at UBS from which he had also stolen funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Arbizu committed this theft by lying to JPMorgan employees, falsifying documents, and forging the JPMorgan customer's signature on wire transfer authorizations, in order to mislead JPMorgan to believe that the JPMorgan customer had directed these transfers," the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said Arbizu served wealthy clients in Argentina and Chile before fleeing to Argentina in the spring of 2008. It said it fired Arbizu on May 30 of that year, and has reimbursed its customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reached by e-mail, Arbizu said he "had no idea" about the lawsuit and would consult with his lawyer. He also said he is trying to settle a related probe by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a U.S. brokerage regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counsel for Arbizu could not immediately be reached for comment. UBS spokesman Kris Kagel declined to comment. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in New York had no immediate comment. A FINRA lawyer handling Arbizu's case did not immediately return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbizu is in his early 40s, and face up to 30 years in prison if convicted on the criminal charges, which include wire fraud, bank fraud, embezzlement and identity theft. He remains in Argentina pending extradition, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The civil case is JPMorgan Chase Bank NA v. Arbizu, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-10496. The criminal case in the same court is U.S. v. Arbizu, No. 08-cr-615.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Additional reporting by Juan Lagorio in New York and Fiona Ortiz in Buenos Aires; editing by Gunna Dickson and Robert MacMillan)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Ford Shares Hit 4-Year High

Shares of Ford Motor (NYSE: F) exceeded $10 for the first time in more than four
years on Dec 23 as the automaker continues to benefit from market share gains
and other successes. The shares rose 18 cents to $10.08 on Dec 23 compared to
Dec 22. 

This is a recovery from a historic low of $1.50 in March this year, helped by
the company`s aggressive restructuring plan, which also helped it bypass
bankruptcy unlike its cross town rivals General Motors and Chrysler Group. 

According to Autodata, Ford`s market share has climbed 1 percentage point to
nearly 20% during the first 11 months of the year. In November, the automaker
succeeded in sustaining a strong position in the U.S. market by posting flat
sales at 122,846 vehicles. The automaker`s sales of crossovers grew 26% while
its car sales rose 14%, driven by a fuel-efficient product line. 

Ford`s sales in Europe`s 19 core markets have leapt 19.8% to 113,100 vehicles in
November. This resulted in a year-to-date market share of 9.1% for the company,
the highest since 1999. 

The European sales included a registration of 99,800 Ford cars, the highest
since November 1999. The automaker`s market share in the month went up in 14 out
of 19 European markets. 

Recently, a report suggested that the projected resale value of 2010 Ford
vehicles (Ford, Lincoln and Mercury) after 36 months in service has gone up by
an average of $1,310 per vehicle compared to the 2009 model year. This is the
largest increase compared to other automakers based in the U.S. 

With this, some of Ford`s vehicles have also succeeded in defeating Asian
automakers including Toyota (NYSE: TM), based on residual value after 36 months
in service. For example, the 2010 Ford Fusion midsized sedan has been expected
to be worth more than the 2010 Toyota Camry by $687. The residual value of the
2010 Ford Flex full-sized crossover also commands a $1,800 premium over Toyota
Highlander. 

Microsoft Loses to i4i

Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT), one of the world`s largest software
companies, has lost another battle. The company has been slapped with a $290
million penalty for infringement of Canada-based i4i`s patent number 5787449. 

The description of the i4i patent is very broad-"A system and method for the
separate manipulation of the architecture and content of a document,
particularly for data representation and transformations". What it basically
means is, the software enables editing of data presented in Extensible Markup
Language (XML) format. 

XML is an open standard programming language defined, recommended and maintained
by the World Wide Web Consortium. It enables the organization and presentation
of data through the allotment of tags and descriptions, resulting in structured
computer documents. 

The i4i technology is integral to Microsoft Word versions 2003 and 2007, a part
of the respective Microsoft office packages. 

Accordingly, the federal appeals court has upheld the Aug 2009 decision of the
Texas Court, requiring Microsoft to pay hefty damages to i4i and stop selling
any more products incorporating the offending technology. Moreover, while the
company is not debarred from supporting current Word users, it is no longer
allowed to help purchasers of the new version Word after Jan 11, 2009. 

Rating Action on Prudential

Earlier during the week, Fitch Rating affirmed the "BBB+" long-term issuer
default and the "BBB" senior debt ratings on Prudential Financial Inc. (NYSE:
PRU) and improved its outlook to "stable" from "negative". The rating action
follows the announcement made earlier during the month by Wells Fargo &amp; Co.
(NYSE: WFC) to purchase the 38% stake of Prudential in its retail brokerage
joint venture (JV), Wells Fargo Advisors, for a cash payment of $4.5 billion.
The deal is likely to close by Dec 31, 2009. These funds will add to the
company`s capital. 

The retail brokerage JV was initially launched by Wachovia Corp. (owning 62%)
with Prudential in July 2003. However, post Wachovia acquisition in Dec 2008,
the JV also became the property of Wells Fargo. The company at the time of the
Wachovia acquisition had reportedly assumed that it would acquire Prudential`s
stake in the near future. The acquisition will now give complete control to
Wells Fargo. Prudential, however, moves ahead with the sale of its stake to
boost its finances. 

Prudential with its right business mix is favorably positioned to drive
double-digit earnings growth and is poised to grow its earnings and expand its
return on equity faster than its peers over the next several years. Prudential
has among the strongest balance sheets in the life industry following its recent
capital raises. It has a strong international presence that provides it with
organic growth opportunities, which is not available to many of its peers As a
result, the company should be able to maintain its ratings and invest in its
business despite the prospect of high investment losses.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Initial Claims Fall

The economy got a Christmas present late last week in the form of a decline in
initial claims for unemployment insurance of 28,000. We are now down to 452,000,
almost 200,000 below the peak set back in April. The decline also reverses
increases in the last two weeks. 

The four-week average, which is generally considered a better measure given the
week-to-week volatility in the numbers, has been in a very steep downtrend for
most of the year and so far is showing no sign of a plateau as it did following
the last two recessions. It is acting much more like it did following recessions
of an earlier era, when it would pretty much go straight up and then straight
down. 

However, keep in mind that initial claims only capture one side of the
employment picture - the number of people losing their jobs - and it says
nothing about the number of people finding jobs. Even in the best of economic
times about 300,000 people lose their job every week. However in good economic
times, nobody cares, since they can find another job and often at better pay,
immediately. 

The employment numbers measure the net between job losses and new jobs. We
probably need to get down to the 400,000 to 425,000 level to indicate that the
economy is gaining jobs on balance. We are not there yet, but we are getting
much closer. The four-week average is now down to 465,250, a decline of 2,750
over the last week. 

We also saw some good news on the continuing claims front. Regular state
continuing claims, which run out after 26 weeks, dropped by 127,000 to 5.076
million this week. That brings them to their lowest level since early February,
and well off the peak of 6.904 million set in June. However one of the biggest
problems in this recession is that the duration of unemployment is unusually
long. Once people lose their jobs, they have a much more difficult time finding
a new job than they did in prior economic downturns. 

A key piece of evidence for this is the ratio of long-term unemployed (out of
work more than 26 weeks) to short-term unemployed (out of work less than 5
weeks). Prior to this downturn, it had never risen above 0.72 (late in the
1982-83 recession). As of November, it was 2.10. On average, someone who is out
of work has been out of work for more than 26 weeks. OK, the mean is a poor
measure since you cannot be unemployed for fewer than zero weeks, but even the
median is at a record high, and 38% of the unemployed have been out of work for
more than 26 weeks. 

Clearly, then, a measure that drops people after 26 weeks is not a very good one
under these circumstances. After the state benefits run out, extended claims,
which are paid by the Federal government mostly from ARRA funds (the stimulus
package), kick in. Those now total 4.732 million (two largest programs
combined). There was a little bit of good news there as extended claims fell by
2,900 on the week. The 2,900 drop is not that significant in and of itself, but
it means that the 127,000 decline in regular continuing claims is real, and not
just people having their benefits expire. 

It is possible that the decline in initial claims might just be a case of
businesses not wanting to look too much like Scrooge by laying off people just
before the holidays. It will be important to continue watching the numbers as we
move into the New Year. 

However, it looks like we will start to see job growth in 2010, which will help
to solve a multitude of problems. With a job, people will be able to pay their
mortgages and credit card bills. That would certainly be good news for firms
like Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM). People will be
able to go out to the mall again, helping out retailers like Macy`s (M) and J.C.
Penney (NYSE: JCP). With a job they have an income, and they will be paying
income taxes (and not drawing unemployment benefits), which could actually start
to make a serious dent in the deficit. That would make it a very Happy New Year.


China Refiners May Face Challenges

With a significant pace of expansion in processing capacity, Asia`s largest
refiner, China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, or Sinopec (NYSE: SNP)
believes that the macro environment will be challenging in the next year. With
increasing crude oil prices, fuel demand growth lags behind growing processing
capacity. 

Once the new refining facilities come on-stream and independent plants increase
output, the domestic refined products market will be oversupplied. 

China processed a record volume of crude in the last month. Refiners are
expanding refining capacity to meet industrial demand encouraged by the
government`s economic stimulus and to benefit from a fuel-pricing system
introduced last year that ensures a profit. 

Under the new system, the government may adjust fuel prices when crude oil costs
change more than 4% over 22 consecutive working days. China last raised gasoline
and diesel prices by as much as 8% on Nov 10, the country`s fifth increase this
year. 

The government caps the prices of refined-products to control inflation. While
growing product sales should offset some of the weakness in refining margins,
overall downstream earnings are expected to remain under pressure. In addition,
rising costs also remain a concern. Operating expenses of refiners have been
steadily going up over the last few years, a trend that is expected to remain in
place, going forward.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Wells Fargo Exits TARP

On Wednesday, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE: WFC) finally exited the Troubled Asset
Relief Program (TARP) by repaying the entire $25 billion that it had taken as
aid in October 2008. Accordingly, the company bought back the $25 billion of
series D preferred stock issued to the US Treasury under the TARP and also paid
accrued dividends of $131.9 million as part of the redemption. Last week, Wells
Fargo had sold 489.9 million new shares of its common stock at $25 each, raising
$12.25 billion to help repay the TARP money. 

Since issuing of the preferred stock in October 2008, Wells Fargo has paid a
total of $1.441 billion in dividends to the US Treasury and US taxpayers.
However, the timely repayment of TARP funds has helped the company save the
annual preferred stock dividend payment of $1.25 billion to the government. This
is projected to be slightly accretive to earnings in 2010. 

The repayment of the entire bailout money to the US Treasury has additionally
relieved Wells Fargo from pay restrictions and other government regulations. The
company will now be able to focus on its core growth strategies to rebuild its
historical position as the global economy goes into a recovery mode. 

Wells Fargo has been the third largest bank in the US to repay TARP loans in Dec
2009. Recently, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) exited TARP by repaying the
$45 billion that it had received in two government bailouts. On Wednesday,
Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) also announced its final departure from TARP after
buying back $20 billion of trust preferred securities it had sold to the
Treasury Department under TARP's Capital Purchase Program. About ten other giant
banks such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
(NYSE: GS).

 (Adds defendant's comment, background, potential criminal

has sued a former private banking executive arrested last year
in Argentina on criminal charges, accusing him of stealing $2.8
million from a customer's account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. bank filed its civil lawsuit on
Monday against former vice president Hernan Arbizu, 17 months
after his July 2008 arrest in Buenos Aires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. prosecutors charged Arbizu in a 15-count indictment
unsealed that month with embezzling $5.4 million from customers
at JPMorgan and a prior employer, UBS AG (UBSN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, JPMorgan
accused Arbizu of arranging for funds to be wired to a customer
account at UBS from which he had also stolen funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Arbizu committed this theft by lying to JPMorgan
employees, falsifying documents, and forging the JPMorgan
customer's signature on wire transfer authorizations, in order
to mislead JPMorgan to believe that the JPMorgan customer had

and Chile before fleeing to Argentina in the spring of 2008. It
said it fired Arbizu on May 30 of that year, and has reimbursed
its customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reached by e-mail, Arbizu said he "had no idea" about the
lawsuit and would consult with his lawyer. He also said he is
trying to settle a related probe by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a U.S. brokerage regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Counsel for Arbizu could not immediately be reached for
comment. UBS spokesman Kris Kagel declined to comment. A
spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in New York had no
immediate comment. A FINRA lawyer handling Arbizu's case did
not immediately return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arbizu is in his early 40s, and face up to 30 years in
prison if convicted on the criminal charges, which include wire
fraud, bank fraud, embezzlement and identity theft. He remains
in Argentina pending extradition, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The civil case is JPMorgan Chase Bank NA v. Arbizu, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-10496.
The criminal case in the same court is U.S. v. Arbizu, No.

&lt;p&gt;KOZMINO, Russia Dec 28 (Reuters) - Russia's Gazprom
(GAZP.MM) expects to wrap up a deal on gas supplies from the
ExxonMobil (XOM.N)-led Sakhalin-1 project next year, Gazprom's
deputy head told reporters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Russian energy giant has said it needs gas from
Sakhalin-1 to feed industrial growth in the Far East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think we will come to an agreement in 2010," Alexander
Ananenkov said on the fringes of a ceremony to mark the launch
of Russia's new Pacific oil terminal that will allow the world's
largest energy producer to service Asian markets.
[ID:nLDE5BR00F]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil has said it is studying all options for selling
gas from Sakhalin-1, which is owned by a consortium that also
includes Russian oil firm Rosneft (ROSN.MM), Japan's Itochu
(8001.T) and Marubeni (8002.T) and India's ONGC (ONGC.BO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ananenkov said Gazprom wants to buy up to 8 billion cubic
metres (bcm) of gas annually from the second stage of Sakhalin-1
development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said the firm will increase estimated gas reserves
at Kirinsky field, which is a part of Sakhalin-3 project, to 100
bcm from the current 75.4 bcm estimate. Gazprom is set to
commission the field in 2014.

&lt;p&gt;Findings to be Incorporated into Ongoing Clinical Trial Program
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. announced today the discontinuation of A4021016 (also known as
ADVIGO 1016), a Phase 3 trial examining the effects of investigational compound
figitumumab (CP-751,871) as first-line treatment in patients with advanced
non-adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) due to the study meeting
predefined boundaries for early termination. 

An analysis by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) showed
that the addition of figitumumab to paclitaxel plus carboplatin would be
unlikely to meet the primary endpoint of improving overall survival compared to
paclitaxel plus carboplatin alone. This discontinuation follows a halt in new
patient enrollment to A4021016 in September 2009 when the DSMC observed an
apparent imbalance of certain serious adverse events between the treatment arms
with more events, including fatalities, occurring in patients who were
randomized to receive figitumumab. 

"While these findings are disappointing, Pfizer is committed to using
information gained from this study to refine the design of future trials of
figitumumab in non-small cell lung cancer," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior
vice president of clinical development and medical affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology
Business Unit. "We are hopeful that we will be able to identify a subset of
patients who may have derived benefit from the addition of figitumumab to
chemotherapy. If this can be done, then future trials will focus on this group
of patients in our efforts to deliver this drug to the right patient." 

The Phase 3 study was initiated based on robust findings from a Phase 2 study
that identified patients of squamous cell histology, the most common form of
non-adenocarcinoma and a disease with a high unmet medical need, as those who
could potentially benefit most from figitumumab treatment. 

The Company has notified A4021016 clinical investigators and has initiated the
notification procedure for all involved regulatory agencies of the
discontinuation of A4021016. Investigators have been instructed to work with all
of their patients in the A4021016 study on an individual basis to determine an
appropriate course of action. 

A4021016 is part of a global Phase 3 clinical trial program, called ADVIGO
(ADVancing IGF-1R in Oncology), which is studying figitumumab in patients with
NSCLC. The program also includes A4021018 (also known as ADVIGO 1018), an
ongoing study in patients with refractory advanced non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC that
is evaluating figitumumab with erlotinib compared to erlotinib alone. A4021017
(also known as ADVIGO 1017), is a Phase 3 trial that will evaluate figitumumab
in combination with another chemotherapy regimen - cisplatin and gemcitabine -
as 1st-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. This trial is still in the planning
stage and will incorporate lessons learned from ADVIGO 1016 into the final
design. 

"While the clinical development of first-in-class agents in oncology is
challenging, Pfizer is determined to provide lung cancer patients with novel,
safe and effective therapeutic agents. We remain strongly committed to the
figitumumab clinical development program in NSCLC, in addition to other cancers
where treatment options are desperately needed," said Garry Nicholson, senior
vice president, general manager of the Oncology Business Unit. 

In addition to NSCLC, Pfizer is studying figitumumab in clinical trials for the
potential treatment of other cancers, including prostate and breast cancers, and
Ewing`s sarcoma. 

About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. NSCLC accounts for about 85
percent of lung cancer cases and 25 to 30 percent are of squamous histology.
Nearly 60 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with Stage IIIB/IV
advanced disease. Despite recent advances, NSCLC remains difficult to treat,
particularly in the metastatic setting. 

About Figitumumab (CP-751,871)

Figitumumab, an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody, is a highly
specific inhibitor of the insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway. The
IGF-1R pathway is thought to be one of the fundamental signaling pathways that
leads to uncontrolled growth and survival of tumor cells, and may represent a
resistance mechanism against EGFR inhibitors and other anti-cancer therapies. 

About Pfizer Oncology

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

FDA Backs Crestor`s Wider Use

AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN) received a positive opinion from the US Food and Drug
Administration`s (FDA) Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee
(EMDAC) regarding the expanded use of Crestor. AstraZeneca is seeking approval
for Crestor to treat patients with normal cholesterol levels but having other
risks of heart disease. The committee voted 12-4 in favor of Crestor after
analyzing its benefit against possible risk in some patients. However, they were
concerned that Crestor should not be used at random in patients with low risk. 

Following the recommendation, AstraZeneca has moved one step closer to FDA
approval. Although the FDA is not required to follow the committee`s opinion, it
generally does so. 

The panel`s recommendation was based on data presented from the JUPITER
(Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial
Evaluating Rosuvastatin) study conducted with 18,000 patients. It was observed
that Crestor lowered deaths, heart attacks and strokes in middle-aged people
(above 50 years) with normal cholesterol level having heart disease. 

Crestor is one of AstraZeneca`s key drugs logging sales of about $3.6 billion
last year. The FDA approval is likely to increase the targeted patient
population which in turn should boost sales. Wider application means Crestor
will be able to target about 6.5 million new patients who were not taking
cholesterol lowering drugs. However, the future growth trajectory of Crestor may
not be that smooth since Pfizer`s (NYSE: PFE) Lipitor will lose patent
exclusivity in 2011. This will increase competition in the cholesterol lowering
market with the entry of generics. 

In addition, AstraZeneca is tied in litigation with seven generic drug companies
including Mylan Laboratories (Nasdaq: MYL), Sandoz, the generics arm of Novartis
(NYSE: NVS) and Apotex among others who have challenged Crestor`s patent. The
trial is likely to begin in Feb 2010. 

BSX Settles DOJ Investigation

Boston Scientific Corp. (NYSE: BSX) recently settled the U.S. Department of
Justice (DOJ) investigation pertaining to certain post-market surveys conducted
by Guidant Corporation before being acquired by Boston Scientific in 2006. Per
the terms of the settlement, Boston Scientific has agreed to pay $22 million to
DOJ, which was already being fully accrued. The investigation began in 2005. 

Boston has also decided to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with
the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services that requires enhancements to certain compliance procedures related to
financial arrangements with health care providers. These enhancements are
related to Boston`s cardiac rhythm management business which it had acquired
from Guidant. 

We think that the expense of $22 million in relation to the DOJ investigation
will have minimal impact on Boston `s bottom-line. The company reported a strong
third quarter in fiscal 2009. Earnings per share were 19 cents, considerably
ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents and the year-ago earnings of
16 cents. Total revenues were $2,025 million, an increase of roughly 2% year
over year.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Dec 29 (Reuters) - A small Chinese power generator

for nearly $80 million lost on two oil hedging contracts, part
of a long-running dispute over how China deals with derivatives

[ID:nPEK242617]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shenzhen Nanshan Power 000037.SZ 200037.SZ said in a
statement that it received several notices from J. Aron 
Company, a trading subsidiary of Goldman Sachs (GS.N), for at
least $79.96 million as compensation for terminating oil option
contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will not accept the demand by J. Aron for all the
losses and related interests," said Nanshan, in line with the
stance it took last December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will try our best to negotiate with J. Aron and resolve
the dispute peacefully...but the possibility of using a lawsuit
can not be ruled out when talks fail," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "J. Aron told us in one notice that if we do not pay the
money, they will reserve the right to launch a lawsuit and will
not send us any further notice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission
said in September that it would back state-owned companies in
any legal action against the foreign banks that sold them oil
derivatives, which resulted in losses when oil prices dived
late last year. [ID:nPEK14474]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Beijing-based Goldman Sachs corporate communication
official declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nanshan said in October last year that two oil
option-related contracts with J. Aron were signed by its
officials without authorisation from the company. In December
2008 it said in a statement it had terminated the deals, and
that it would not accept J. Aron's demand for payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONG-TIME TUSSLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many Chinese firms, especially airliners, suffered huge
losses from complex oil options trading last year as oil price
collapsed to nearly $30 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A senior official from SASAC revealed last month that 68
Chinese firms suffered net losses of 11.4 billion yuan ($1.67
billion) by October 2008 on call and put options signed with
foreign banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far no legal action has been taken and many lawyers and
industry analysts believe that Chinese firms and their foreign
banks are quite likely to settle their disputes privately or
through arbitration, similar to a handful of previous cases in
the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only 31 firms are authorised in China to trade derivatives
directly in the overseas market and the regulators started
strictly prohibiting others from such trading since early 2009
after losses were exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SASAC said last month that it had suggested companies
without overseas derivatives trading licences trade on the
domestic market or through domestic financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a related analysis [ID:nSP69447]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a related factbox and scenario: [ID:nSP415840]

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Dec 29 (Reuters) - China is a vital market for
Microsoft's Web search business, as it chases leaders Baidu Inc
(BIDU.O) and Google (GOOG.O) in the world's biggest Internet
market, the world's largest software maker said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Since launching its English-language Bing search site in
June, Microsoft has been gaining steady share in the United
States, with 10.3 percent in November versus 17.5 percent for
Yahoo (YHOO.O) and 65.6 percent for dominant player Google,
according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft hopes to get off to a similar fast start with its
Chinese-language Bing site, which is still in its beta phase
following a low-key launch in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft is committed to the China market and the search
market in China is the most important strategic market for
Microsoft," the company said on Tuesday in emailed responses to
questions from Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We specially set the search technology center in China to
get a deeper understanding of what Chinese users need, to be
able to deliver the best product to them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's Internet market is a hot spot for global search
companies looking to expand overseas, but localisation issues
and tough domestic competition have made it tough to crack for
global titans such as Yahoo, eBay (EBAY.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China is home to the world's largest Internet market by
users at more than 350 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's search market was worth 2 billion yuan ($293
million) in the third quarter, up 38 percent, with homegrown
leader Baidu (BIDU.O) well ahead with 63.9 percent followed by
Google at 31.3 percent, according to research firm Analysys
International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Google is taking a big share of (the China market),
roughly 30 percent but it is not yet threatening Baidu. Bing is

beta version in June, the number of users who have visited the
site at least three times a month has increased 30 percent as
of October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Within one or two years, there could be large changes in
China's search market," she said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings takes various rating actions on J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Corp commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series
2005-LDP4 including downgrades of 13 classes. A detailed list of rating actions
follows at the end of this press release. 

The downgrades are the result of Fitch's loss expectations and its prospective
views regarding cash flow declines and commercial real estate market values.
Fitch forecasts potential losses of 7.4% for this transaction, should market
conditions not recover. Today's rating actions are based on the full losses of
7.4% as a majority of loans mature in the next five years. The bonds with
Negative Rating Outlooks indicate classes that may be downgraded in the future. 

To determine potential defaults for each loan, Fitch assumed cash flow would
decline by 10% from year-end 2008. That is consistent with the analysis used in
its review of recent vintage transactions whereby cash flow was assumed to
decline 15% from year-end 2007 projected over a three-year period. If the
stressed cash flow would cause the loan to fall below 0.95 times (x) debt
service coverage ratio (DSCR), Fitch assumed the loan would default during the
term. To determine losses, Fitch used the above stressed cash flow and applied a
market cap rate by property type, ranging between 7.5% and 10%, to derive a
value. If the loan balance at default is less than Fitch's derived value, the
loan would realize that amount of loss. These loss estimates were reviewed in
more detail for loans representing 52.7% of the pool and, in certain cases,
revised based on additional information and/or property characteristics. Loss
expectations attributed to loans reviewed in detail represent 78.2% of the 7.4%.


Approximately 89.9% of the mortgages mature within the next five years as
follows: 16.3% in 2010, 5.9% in 2011, 5.5% in 2012, 0.5% in 2013, 0.1% in 2014,
and 61.5% in 2015. 

Fitch identified 55 Loans of Concern (31.3%) within the pool, ten of which
(9.5%) are specially serviced. Five of the Fitch Loans of Concern (13.4%) are
within the transaction's top 15 loans, and two (6.4%) are specially serviced. 

Losses are expected on five (13.4%) of the loans within the Top 15; all have or
are expected to default during the term. Loss severities associated with these
loans range from 26% to 38%. The largest overall contributors to deal loss are
as follows: Silver City Galleria (25.3%), Western US Alliance Data Systems
Portfolio (15.2%), and Creekside Apartments (11.4%). 

The Silver City Galleria loan is collateralized by a 714,898 sf super regional
mall in Taunton, MA. The loan was transferred to Special Servicing on Dec. 11,
2008 due to imminent monetary default. As of the June 2009 rent roll, the
property was 80.5% occupied, down from 89.1% at issuance. The servicer-reported
DSCR as of June 30, 2009 was 0.99x reflecting decreasing occupancy. As of August
2009, comparable in-line sales of stores less than 10,000 sf were $286 psf over
the past 12 months, down approximately 10% from the prior year period. The
special servicer and borrower are currently negotiating a possible restructuring
of the loan. Fitch expects losses of 35% should the loan be liquidated, based on
adjustments to a recent appraised value by the special servicer, which is
in-line with current property cash flow. 

The Western US Alliance Data Systems Portfolio loan is secured by five class B
office buildings, totaling 485, in Dallas, TX, Los Angeles, CA, and Tigard, OR.
The servicer-reported DSCR as of June 30, 2009 was 2.00x with an occupancy of
97.6%. The major tenant, Alliance Data Systems, 47% of NRA, has indicated they
will not renew their lease which expires on Oct. 31, 2010. In the event of this
tenant's non-renewal, the borrower is required to make two deposits of $2.25
million; the borrower has indicated the second deposit will not be made.
Additionally, the second largest tenant, Allstate Insurance will vacate 11.3% of
NRA as of Dec. 31, 2009. Fitch expects this loan to default due to failure to
deliver cash or a letter of credit by the borrower. Upon liquidation, Fitch
expects a 38% loss. Fitch stressed market capitalization rates due to increased
vacancy and adjusted income downward based on vacating tenants. 

The Creekside Apartments loan is secured by a 1,026-unit multifamily property in
Bensalem, PA, 17 miles north of Philadelphia. The most recent servicer-reported
DSCR, reflecting trailing twelve month performance as of Sept. 30, 2009 is
1.21x, which is in-line with 1.27x at issuance. Occupancy as of September 2009
has declined to 79.6%, from issuance occupancy of 94.4%. Fitch expects the loan
to default due to conversion from interest only to amortizing in August 2010
based on current occupancy and cash flow. Fitch stressed the market
capitalization rate due to the property's location and determined a 30% loss
based on trailing 12 cash flows. 

Fitch has downgraded, removed from Rating Watch Negative, and assigned Loss
Severity (LS) ratings and Outlooks to the following classes as indicated: 

--$204.1 million class A-J to 'BBB/LS4' from 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

--$6.7 million class M to 'CCC/RR6' from 'B-'; 

--$3.3 million class N to 'CCC/RR6' from 'B-'. 

Fitch has revised the Recovery Rating (RR) for the following class as indicated:


--$10 million class P at 'CCC/RR6' from 'CCC/RR1'. 

Fitch also affirms the following classes and assigns LS ratings and Outlooks as
indicated: 

--$388.2 million class A-1A at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$198.9 million class A-2 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$175 million class A-2FL at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$180 million class A-3A1 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$75 million class A-3A2 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$580.3 million class A-4 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$130.4 million class A-SB at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--$267.7 million class A-M at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable.

Pfizer Inc. announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
not yet completed its review of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for
Prevnar 13, (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197
Protein]), the Company`s candidate 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. As
a result, the review will continue beyond the prescription drug user fee (PDUFA)
action date of December 30, 2009. 

"We remain confident that the data in the BLA support the approval of Prevnar
13," says Emilio Emini, Ph.D., chief scientific officer, Vaccine Research,
Pfizer Inc. "We will continue to work closely with the FDA to help expedite the
completion of its review of our BLA." 

In May 2009, Prevnar 13 was designated for priority review, which is given to
products that, if approved by the Center for Biologics Evaluation &amp; Research
(CBER), would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the
treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious or life-threatening disease. In
August 2009, the FDA extended its review by 90 days from the original action
date of September 30, 2009, to December 30, 2009, based on the submission of
additional manufacturing data requested by the FDA. Pfizer is seeking an
indication for Prevnar 13 for active immunization of infants and toddlers for
the prevention of invasive disease and otitis media caused by the 13
Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) serotypes in the vaccine. 

On November 18, 2009, the FDA`s Vaccines and Related Biological Products
Advisory Committee voted 10 to 1 that the data presented from the BLA for
Prevnar 13 support its safety and efficacy for the prevention of invasive
pneumococcal disease in infants and young children. On December 11, 2009, the
European Commission granted marketing authorization for Prevenar 13*
(Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]) - as it is
known outside the United States - for active immunization for the prevention of
invasive disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media caused by 13 S. pneumoniae
serotypes in infants and children from 6 weeks to 5 years of age. 

To date, Prevnar 13 has been approved for use in infants and young children in
34 countries. Further pediatric regulatory filings for Prevnar 13 are in
advanced stages of review in various countries spanning six continents. Prevnar
13 is also being studied in global Phase 3 clinical trials in adults, with
regulatory submissions expected in 2010. 

Prevnar 13 includes the seven serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) in
Prevnar&#174; (Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]),
plus six additional serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A). Together, these 13
serotypes are responsible for the majority of remaining invasive pneumococcal
disease in infants and young children in the United States. Serotype 19A is now
the most common serotype in the United States. 

The review of Prevnar 13 is based on data from 13 core Phase 3 studies involving
more than 7,000 children. 

Pneumococcal Disease

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) 2002 estimate, pneumococcal
disease is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death worldwide in children
younger than 5 years. Pneumococcal disease is complex and describes a group of
illnesses caused by the bacterium S. pneumoniae. It affects both children and
adults and includes invasive infections such as bacteremia/sepsis and
meningitis, as well as non-invasive disease including pneumonia and acute otitis
media. 

Indication for Prevnar

Prevnar is indicated for active immunization of infants and toddlers against
serious invasive disease caused by Streptococcuspneumoniae, including bacteremia
(bloodstream infection) and meningitis (infection of the membranes surrounding
the brain and spinal cord) caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine. The
seven serotypes (strains) of S. pneumoniae included in the vaccine (4, 6B, 9V,
14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) were the strains that most commonly caused these serious
diseases in children prior to the introduction of the vaccine. The routine
schedule is 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. 

Prevnar is also indicated for immunization of infants and toddlers against
otitis media (ear infections) caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine.
Protection against ear infections is expected to be less than that for invasive
disease. 

As with any vaccine, Prevnar may not protect all individuals receiving the
vaccine from serious invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae. This vaccine
should not be used for treatment of active infection. 

Important Safety Information for Prevnar

In clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse events included
injection site reactions, fever (&#8805;38&#186;C/100.4&#186;F), irritability, drowsiness,
restless sleep, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash. 

Risks are associated with all vaccines, including Prevnar. Hypersensitivity to
any vaccine component, including diphtheria toxoid, is a contraindication to its
use. Prevnar does not protect 100% of children vaccinated. Immunization with
Prevnar does not substitute for routine diphtheria immunization.

&lt;p&gt;Obama`s Extension of Trade Benefits Latest of Several Harsh Setbacks for Oil
Giant Over $27B Liability
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The signing this week by President Barack Obama of an extension of trade
benefits for Ecuador - over strenuous objections from Chevron -- caps a brutal
year of legal and lobbying setbacks for the oil giant in its attempts to evade a
multi-billion dollar liability for environmental damage in the Amazon
rainforest. 

Obama`s signature on the trade deal, consummated this week, is the fourth defeat
in three years for Chevron`s A-list lobbying team in its effort to cancel trade
preferences for Ecuador as "punishment" for allowing indigenous groups to sue
the oil giant in Ecuador`s courts. Chevron is charged in a class action lawsuit
brought by 30,000 Ecuadorians with dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste
when it operated several large oil fields in Ecuador`s Amazon from 1964 to 1990,
decimating indigenous groups and causing a spike in cancer rates and other
oil-related diseases. 

A court-appointed Special Master found 1,401 people had died of cancer due to
the contamination and pegged damages at $27.3 billion, with a final judgment
expected in 2010. Experts consider the disaster at least 30 times worse than the
damage caused by the Exxon Valdez. 

If Chevron had succeeded in canceling the trade benefits, Ecuador`s government
estimated the country would have lost 350,000 jobs. Similar lobbying efforts by
Chevron in prior years met stiff opposition from a number of Senators and
Congressmen, and also failed. Chevron`s effort to use the trade preferences as
leverage was led by outside lobbyists Wayne Berman, a longtime Republican
operative; Mac McLarty, White House Chief of Staff under President Clinton; and
Mickey Kantor, the U.S. Trade Representative under President Clinton. 

"The extension of the trade benefits to Ecuador is a major setback to Chevron's
campaign to undermine the rule of law in the environmental case," said Steven
Donziger, an American legal advisor to the plaintiffs. 

Chevron`s defeat over trade preferences capped a terrible 2009 for Chevron on
the 16-year Ecuador case, both legally and politically, in the media, and among
shareholders. 

On the legal front, Chevron suffered multiple defeats in U.S. federal court in
New York in its attempt to shift the liability for clean-up to Ecuador`s
government. Chevron lost a four-year trial, was unanimously denied on appeal,
and suffered the added indignity of being rebuffed by the U.S. Supreme Court
when it asked for a review of the case. 

In the separate environmental case in Ecuador, Chevron lost a number of motions
to delay the six-year proceedings, paving the way for a decision in 2010. 

Further, two Chevron lawyers are under criminal indictment in Ecuador for lying
about the results of a purported remediation to obtain a legal release from
Ecuador`s government. In the United States, New York Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo opened a probe of Chevron to determine if the company is misleading
shareholders over the Ecuador liability. 

Separately, the U.S. Department of Justice has been asked by the plaintiffs to
determine whether Chevron orchestrated the appearance of a bribery scheme in
Ecuador to undermine the trial. If so, the company might be found in violation
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 

Several large shareholders made it a tough year for Chevron management. At least
$37 billion in company shares voted to defy CEO David O`Reilly over human rights
issues, driven partly by the pending Ecuador liability. 

On the lobbying front, Chevron suffered a string of embarrassing defeats over
Ecuador in Washington. In December, 26 House members - including several members
of the leadership -- signed a letter to the United States Trade Representative
asking that the agency ignore Chevron`s efforts to use U.S. trade policy to
interfere in the Ecuador legal case. In June, four U.S. Senators wrote a similar
letter to the USTR, while no Senator or Congressman wrote a letter in favor of
Chevron. 

Separately, Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-CA) in November blasted Chevron`s lobbying
effort against Ecuador in testimony before the House Ways and Means Trade
Subcommittee, likening it to "extortion". "Apparently, if it can`t get the
outcome it wants from the Ecuadorian court system, Chevron will use the U.S.
government to deny trade benefits until Ecuador cries uncle," said Sanchez. 

Chevron suffered another setback in December when it was sued in U.S. federal
court by Ecuador seeking to enjoin the company`s second international
arbitration attempt designed to shift liability to Ecuador`s government. The
second arbitration, which would take place under the U.S.-Ecuador bilateral
investment treaty, was considered one of Chevron`s final legal options to evade
liability, but that effort is now in doubt. 

In the media, Chevron endured an unflattering 60 Minutes report that clearly
demonstrated the company built hundreds of unlined waste pits in Ecuador that
were designed to be drained into nearby streams and rivers; that it never kept a
list of the locations of its waste pits so as to warn local residents; and that
Chevron`s lawyers, in an effort to discredit Ecuador`s courts, are contradicting
years of sworn affidavits filed by the company in U.S. federal court praising
those courts as fair and competent. 

Chevron also reached a low point when a spokesperson, Sylvia Garrigo, became
flustered during her 60 Minutes interview and said the pollution in Ecuador was
no more harmful than the oil in the makeup on her face. 

Chevron also received unfavorable coverage about the case in The New York Times,
Washington Post, Forbes, The Associated Press, Bloomberg Markets magazine, and
on the editorial pages of the Los Angeles Times. The LA Times characterized
Chevron`s attempts to find a new court after arguing the case should be heard in
Ecuador as a "shifty shifting of venue". 

Kerry Kennedy, a lawyer who has led more than 40 international human rights
delegations and who is President of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and
Human Rights, visited the region and accused Chevron of being complicit in
cultural genocide. Her letter to Chevron`s CEO seeking a meeting was ignored. 

Rep. James McGovern (D-MA), the only member of Congress to have visited the
disaster zone, previously had called Chevron`s pollution a "terrible
humanitarian and environmental crisis" in a letter to President Obama. 

Finally, Chevron`s Ecuador liability - which could consume more than 20% of the
company`s market value -- appears to have accelerated a shift in the company`s
management. Thursday is longtime CEO David O`Reilly`s last day on the job, as he
announced his surprise departure earlier this year. O`Reilly had spearheaded the
purchase of Chevron in 2001 for $31 billion - an asset that now has a potential
liability of $27.3 billion due to the Ecuador problem.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch rates J.P. Morgan Resecuritization Trust 2009-13. This transaction
consists of two non-crossed groups. Each group is a resecuritization of a
residential mortgage backed securities certificate. Fitch is not rating Group 2
certificates. 

Group 1 is a resecuritization of 22.24% interest in WFMBS 2005-17, Class II-A-1.


As resecuritizations, the certificates will receive their cash-flows from the
underlying classes of certificates. The underlying certificates represent
beneficial ownership interest in fixed-rate, conventional, first lien
residential mortgage loans, substantially all of which have original terms to
stated maturity of 30 years. 

This transaction contains certain classes designated as Base Certificates and
others as Exchangeable Certificates. Class 1-A-1 certificate is a Base
Certificate and can be exchanged for certain combinations of 1-A-3 through
1-A-8. 

ResiLogic, the regression-based model used by Fitch, takes into account multiple
risk factors which can broadly be placed into three categories in the following
order of influence: seasoned loan risks, economic risks, and collateral risks.
For seasoned loan risks, the delinquency status and volatility are the most
important with regards to Frequency of Foreclosure (FOF), while change in home
price index and loan age are the most important with regards to Loss Severity
(LS). Economic risk is solely comprised of state and MSA level risk multipliers
as well as a national multiplier. In the category of collateral risk, the credit
score, credit sector, and combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio are the most
heavily-weighted risk factors in calculating the FOF. Closing balance,
loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and loan coupon are the most heavily-weighted risk
factors in calculating LS. Due to concerns over recent pool performance and
volatility, loss levels were adjusted higher than the ResiLogic model results. 

The loan level information used in analyzing pools is taken from the Loan
Performance database. In general, fields in the data tapes are complete unless
otherwise noted. In this transaction the back-end debt-to-income (DTI) ratio
field was missing. For loans missing DTI information, Fitch uses a standard
assumption of 35%. 

The underlying collateral and cashflow structure were analyzed according to
Fitch's 'Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria', 'U.S. Residential Mortgage
Re-REMIC', 'ResiLogic: U.S. Residential Mortgage Loss Model' and 'U.S. RMBS Cash
Flow Analysis' criteria. 

Fitch rates J.P. Morgan Resecuritization Trust 2009-13 as follows: 

--$25,903,000 class 1-A-1 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$23,266,000 exchangeable class 1-A-3 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$2,637,000 exchangeable class 1-A-4 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Educational Alliance Program Contributes $1.8 Million to Local
Schools
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
The ExxonMobil Educational Alliance Program announced today it awarded $1.8
million in grants this year to 2,400 schools to enhance math and science
programs across the United States. It is the 10th consecutive year for the
program, which has provided grants to K-12 educational institutions in 42 states
and the District of Columbia. 

Local schools are eligible to apply for Educational Alliance grants by
partnering with their nearby Exxon or Mobil branded retailer, the vast majority
of which are independently owned and operated. Since 2000, the program has
contributed more than $18 million to local schools through Exxon and Mobil
retailers. 

"We are excited to be the recipient of this grant. At Kishwaukee Elementary
(Belvidere, IL), we will be using the money to purchase equipment for our 5th
grade math students and science books for our library," said Debbie Anderson,
Principal. 

For the past decade, Educational Alliance grants have benefited students across
the country. Tri-State Petroleum, an ExxonMobil fuel distributor in West
Virginia has been a strong supporter since the program's inception. "It's really
satisfying to help our local schools and make a real difference in communities
where our stations are located. We are proud to be associated with Educational
Alliance," said Colleen McGlinn, CEO of Tri-State Petroleum. 

ExxonMobil is a long-standing supporter of math and science education, which
includes a $125 million commitment to the National Math and Science Initiative
in the United States. Other initiatives include partnerships with former
astronauts Bernard Harris and Sally Ride to encourage students to study math and
science, and the Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy, a partnership with PGA
golfer Phil Mickelson and his wife, Amy, which has equipped more than 2,000
teachers with innovative tools to inspire students in math and science.

Findings to be Incorporated into Ongoing Clinical Trial Program
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc. announced today the discontinuation of A4021016 (also known as
ADVIGO 1016), a Phase 3 trial examining the effects of investigational compound
figitumumab (CP-751,871) as first-line treatment in patients with advanced
non-adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) due to the study meeting
predefined boundaries for early termination. 

An analysis by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) showed
that the addition of figitumumab to paclitaxel plus carboplatin would be
unlikely to meet the primary endpoint of improving overall survival compared to
paclitaxel plus carboplatin alone. This discontinuation follows a halt in new
patient enrollment to A4021016 in September 2009 when the DSMC observed an
apparent imbalance of certain serious adverse events between the treatment arms
with more events, including fatalities, occurring in patients who were
randomized to receive figitumumab. 

"While these findings are disappointing, Pfizer is committed to using
information gained from this study to refine the design of future trials of
figitumumab in non-small cell lung cancer," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior
vice president of clinical development and medical affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology
Business Unit. "We are hopeful that we will be able to identify a subset of
patients who may have derived benefit from the addition of figitumumab to
chemotherapy. If this can be done, then future trials will focus on this group
of patients in our efforts to deliver this drug to the right patient." 

The Phase 3 study was initiated based on robust findings from a Phase 2 study
that identified patients of squamous cell histology, the most common form of
non-adenocarcinoma and a disease with a high unmet medical need, as those who
could potentially benefit most from figitumumab treatment. 

The Company has notified A4021016 clinical investigators and has initiated the
notification procedure for all involved regulatory agencies of the
discontinuation of A4021016. Investigators have been instructed to work with all
of their patients in the A4021016 study on an individual basis to determine an
appropriate course of action. 

A4021016 is part of a global Phase 3 clinical trial program, called ADVIGO
(ADVancing IGF-1R in Oncology), which is studying figitumumab in patients with
NSCLC. The program also includes A4021018 (also known as ADVIGO 1018), an
ongoing study in patients with refractory advanced non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC that
is evaluating figitumumab with erlotinib compared to erlotinib alone. A4021017
(also known as ADVIGO 1017), is a Phase 3 trial that will evaluate figitumumab
in combination with another chemotherapy regimen - cisplatin and gemcitabine -
as 1st-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. This trial is still in the planning
stage and will incorporate lessons learned from ADVIGO 1016 into the final
design. 

"While the clinical development of first-in-class agents in oncology is
challenging, Pfizer is determined to provide lung cancer patients with novel,
safe and effective therapeutic agents. We remain strongly committed to the
figitumumab clinical development program in NSCLC, in addition to other cancers
where treatment options are desperately needed," said Garry Nicholson, senior
vice president, general manager of the Oncology Business Unit. 

In addition to NSCLC, Pfizer is studying figitumumab in clinical trials for the
potential treatment of other cancers, including prostate and breast cancers, and
Ewing`s sarcoma. 

About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. NSCLC accounts for about 85
percent of lung cancer cases and 25 to 30 percent are of squamous histology.
Nearly 60 percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with Stage IIIB/IV
advanced disease. Despite recent advances, NSCLC remains difficult to treat,
particularly in the metastatic setting. 

About Figitumumab (CP-751,871)

Figitumumab, an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody, is a highly
specific inhibitor of the insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway. The
IGF-1R pathway is thought to be one of the fundamental signaling pathways that
leads to uncontrolled growth and survival of tumor cells, and may represent a
resistance mechanism against EGFR inhibitors and other anti-cancer therapies. 

About Pfizer Oncology

Pfizer Oncology is committed to the discovery, investigation and development of
innovative treatment options to improve the outlook for cancer patients
worldwide. Our strong pipeline, one of the most robust in the industry, is
studied with precise focus on identifying and translating the best scientific
breakthroughs into clinical application for patients across a wide range of
cancers, including breast, lung, prostate, sarcoma, melanoma, and various
hematologic cancers. Pfizer Oncology has more than 25 biologics and small
molecules in clinical development and more than 200 clinical trials underway. 

By working collaboratively with academic institutions, individual researchers,
cooperative research groups, governments, and licensing partners, Pfizer
Oncology strives to cure or control cancer with breakthrough medicines, to
deliver the right drug for the right patient at the right time.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, spokeswoman's remarks)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 31 (Reuters) - Oil major Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) on Thursday reported flaring but no production impact
from a snag on Wednesday at its giant 562,000-barrel-per-day
Baytown, Texas, oil refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the refinery's crude units -- known as Pipe Still
Unit 7 -- was cited as a source of emissions during the snag,
but a company spokeswoman told Reuters that the unit was
operational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The line restriction at a booster station occurred during
some routine maintenance on a compressor, spokeswoman Kristen
Hellmer said earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Baytown complex is the largest refinery in the United
States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Baytown plant is operating under normal conditions and
there's been no impact on production," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The flaring at flare stack 27 was due to a line restriction
at Booster Station 4, Exxon said earlier in a filing with the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The line was in the
process of being cleared, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, an Exxon filing said production at Baytown
was not affected by a process analyzer malfunction during
start-up of a sulfur gas unit. [ID:nN30219235]

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc shares fell 1 percent on Thursday after it said a U.S. decision on whether to approve the company's new version of its big-selling Prevnar vaccine that fights pneumonia and meningitis would push past the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Dec 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BioMedReports.Com, the news portal which covers Wall Street's biomedical
sector and delivers financial and investment intelligence to a community
of highly informed investors, is reporting Pfizer Inc. has announced that
it has decided to discontinue the late-stage study of its lung cancer
candidate figitumumab (CP-751,871) while Novelos' (OTCBB: NVLT) pivotal
Phase 3 trial, with a primary efficacy endpoint of improvement in median
overall survival, continues across approximately 12 countries and 100
clinical sites.

    Yesterday, it was reported that an independent data monitoring committee
found by analyzing data from Pfizer's late-stage study that the addition
of figitumumab to a combination of older medications -- paclitaxel and
carboplatin -- was unlikely to meet the primary endpoint of improving
overall survival compared to the combination of paclitaxel and
carboplatin alone.

    Meanwhile, Novelos' randomized, open-label, international, pivotal Phase 3
trial continues evaluating NOV-002 in combination with paclitaxel and
carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin alone, in approximately 900
patients with Stage IIIb/IV lung cancer.

    Other drugs like motesanib, by Takeda Pharmaceutical and Amgen and
Nexavar, from Bayer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, have shown negative effects
in that cell type, leaving the market wide open for Novelos' NOV-002.

    "We actually potentiate the chemotherapy," said Palmin in a recent
interview with BioMedReports. "We make the cancer cells more sensitive to
chemotherapy and we also inhibit the cancer's ability to metastasize
(spread), so there are all sorts of interesting effects that happen at
the tumor level. However, on the normal cells -- for example bone marrow

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
not yet completed its review of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for
Prevnar 13, (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197
Protein]), the Company`s candidate 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. As
a result, the review will continue beyond the prescription drug user fee (PDUFA)
action date of December 30, 2009. 

"We remain confident that the data in the BLA support the approval of Prevnar
13," says Emilio Emini, Ph.D., chief scientific officer, Vaccine Research,
Pfizer Inc. "We will continue to work closely with the FDA to help expedite the
completion of its review of our BLA." 

In May 2009, Prevnar 13 was designated for priority review, which is given to
products that, if approved by the Center for Biologics Evaluation &amp; Research
(CBER), would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the
treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious or life-threatening disease. In
August 2009, the FDA extended its review by 90 days from the original action
date of September 30, 2009, to December 30, 2009, based on the submission of
additional manufacturing data requested by the FDA. Pfizer is seeking an
indication for Prevnar 13 for active immunization of infants and toddlers for
the prevention of invasive disease and otitis media caused by the 13
Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) serotypes in the vaccine. 

On November 18, 2009, the FDA`s Vaccines and Related Biological Products
Advisory Committee voted 10 to 1 that the data presented from the BLA for
Prevnar 13 support its safety and efficacy for the prevention of invasive
pneumococcal disease in infants and young children. On December 11, 2009, the
European Commission granted marketing authorization for Prevenar 13*
(Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]) - as it is
known outside the United States - for active immunization for the prevention of
invasive disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media caused by 13 S. pneumoniae
serotypes in infants and children from 6 weeks to 5 years of age. 

To date, Prevnar 13 has been approved for use in infants and young children in
34 countries. Further pediatric regulatory filings for Prevnar 13 are in
advanced stages of review in various countries spanning six continents. Prevnar
13 is also being studied in global Phase 3 clinical trials in adults, with
regulatory submissions expected in 2010. 

Prevnar 13 includes the seven serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) in
Prevnar&#174; (Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]),
plus six additional serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A). Together, these 13
serotypes are responsible for the majority of remaining invasive pneumococcal
disease in infants and young children in the United States. Serotype 19A is now
the most common serotype in the United States. 

The review of Prevnar 13 is based on data from 13 core Phase 3 studies involving
more than 7,000 children. 

Pneumococcal Disease

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) 2002 estimate, pneumococcal
disease is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death worldwide in children
younger than 5 years. Pneumococcal disease is complex and describes a group of
illnesses caused by the bacterium S. pneumoniae. It affects both children and
adults and includes invasive infections such as bacteremia/sepsis and
meningitis, as well as non-invasive disease including pneumonia and acute otitis
media. 

Indication for Prevnar

Prevnar is indicated for active immunization of infants and toddlers against
serious invasive disease caused by Streptococcuspneumoniae, including bacteremia
(bloodstream infection) and meningitis (infection of the membranes surrounding
the brain and spinal cord) caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine. The
seven serotypes (strains) of S. pneumoniae included in the vaccine (4, 6B, 9V,
14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) were the strains that most commonly caused these serious
diseases in children prior to the introduction of the vaccine. The routine
schedule is 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. 

Prevnar is also indicated for immunization of infants and toddlers against
otitis media (ear infections) caused by the seven serotypes in the vaccine.
Protection against ear infections is expected to be less than that for invasive
disease. 

As with any vaccine, Prevnar may not protect all individuals receiving the
vaccine from serious invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae. This vaccine
should not be used for treatment of active infection. 

Important Safety Information for Prevnar

In clinical studies, the most frequently reported adverse events included
injection site reactions, fever (&#8805;38&#186;C/100.4&#186;F), irritability, drowsiness,
restless sleep, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash. 

Risks are associated with all vaccines, including Prevnar. Hypersensitivity to
any vaccine component, including diphtheria toxoid, is a contraindication to its
use. Prevnar does not protect 100% of children vaccinated. Immunization with
Prevnar does not substitute for routine diphtheria immunization.
