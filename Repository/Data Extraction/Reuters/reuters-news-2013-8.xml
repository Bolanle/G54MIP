&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A federal judge late on Thursday tossed out a securities arbitration ruling against an investor who sought to recoup $1.4 million from Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), citing an arbitrator's failure to fully disclose his involvement in an unrelated criminal proceeding, according to a court opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge J. Curtis Joyner of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania threw out the arbitration award after ruling that the investor's legal rights in the proceeding were compromised by an arbitrator who misled the parties about his indictment for the unauthorized practice of law and by not participating in the decision, according to the opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs did not immediately return phone calls or respond to an email requesting comment. The case already has led to a new initiative by FINRA beefing up oversight of its 6,500 securities arbitrators by conducting annual background checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investor, Athena Venture Partners LP, lost the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration against Goldman in May, after alleging it was misled by the firm in a private debt fund investment. Athena is the family investment vehicle of Richard Caruso, who founded Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caruso said he was pleased with the decision, but declined further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA, Wall Street's industry funded watchdog, also runs the arbitration forum where investors and their brokerages typically agree to resolve their arbitration disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is rare for the courts to overturn FINRA arbitration rulings, say lawyers. Arbitration rulings are typically binding, but parties may ask courts to overturn them in limited circumstances, such as when an arbitrator is biased. Parties who are successful at overturning their securities arbitration awards must present their arbitration cases again in FINRA's forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a rare step in a really unique case," said Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago-based securities arbitration lawyer. "The court reached the common sense conclusion it had to," said Stoltmann, who was not involved in the Goldman case, but who typically represents investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the three arbitrators who heard the case between Goldman and Athena, Demetrio Timban, had been indicted by the state of New Jersey for practicing law without a license, although charges were later dropped under a state program to deal with nonviolent offenses. He was also reprimanded by a Michigan regulator for the New Jersey incident and passing $18,000 in bad checks. FINRA did not learn of Timban's troubles until months after the case started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A disclosure Timban sent to the parties about his indictment was misleading, Athena alleged, because it described his law practice violations as a one-time incident when Timban was actually running an office in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athena also alleged that Timban did not participate in deciding the case because his signature did not appear on the award along with those of the two other arbitrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there is "no evidence" that FINRA took action to remove Timban from the case after learning of his troubles, the court wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A FINRA spokeswoman did not immediately return a call or respond to an email requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA rules "clearly entitled (Athena) to a panel composed of at least three qualified arbitrators," Judge Joyner wrote in a 19 page opinion.

&lt;p&gt;Aug 1 (Reuters) - A federal judge late on Thursday tossed
out a securities arbitration ruling against an investor who
sought to recoup $1.4 million from Goldman Sachs Group Inc
, citing an arbitrator's failure to fully disclose his
involvement in an unrelated criminal proceeding, according to a
court opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge J. Curtis Joyner of the U.S. District Court for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania threw out the arbitration award
after ruling that the investor's legal rights in the proceeding
were compromised by an arbitrator who misled the parties about
his indictment for the unauthorized practice of law and by not
participating in the decision, according to the opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs did not immediately return
phone calls or respond to an email requesting comment. The case
already has led to a new initiative by FINRA beefing up
oversight of its 6,500 securities arbitrators by conducting
annual background checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investor, Athena Venture Partners LP, lost the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration against
Goldman in May, after alleging it was misled by the firm in a
private debt fund investment. Athena is the family investment
vehicle of Richard Caruso, who founded Integra LifeSciences
Holdings Corp in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caruso said he was pleased with the decision, but declined
further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA, Wall Street's industry funded watchdog, also runs the
arbitration forum where investors and their brokerages typically
agree to resolve their arbitration disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is rare for the courts to overturn FINRA arbitration

practice violations as a one-time incident when Timban was
actually running an office in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athena also alleged that Timban did not participate in
deciding the case because his signature did not appear on the

to remove Timban from the case after learning of his troubles,
the court wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A FINRA spokeswoman did not immediately return a call or

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A jury found former Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice president Fabrice Tourre liable for fraud for his role in a failed mortgage deal that cost investors $1 billion, in a big victory for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre was found liable on six of seven counts by a Manhattan federal jury in the SEC's highest-profile trial to spill out of its investigations into causes of the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are gratified by the jury's verdict," said Andrew Ceresney, co-director of the regulator's enforcement division. "We will continue to vigorously seek to hold accountable, and bring to trial when necessary, those who commit fraud on Wall Street."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the jury was dismissed, Tourre raised his eyebrows to one of his lawyers. He and his lawyers left court without commenting on whether he plans to appeal, walking through drizzling rain followed by reporters and camera crews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest will now determine whether to order Tourre to pay financial penalties or to disgorge any illegal profits as a result of his misconduct. Tourre testified he earned $1.7 million in 2007. He could also be banned from the securities industry for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest asked both sides to submit proposals by August 23 for what she termed "next steps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC accused Tourre, 34, in a civil lawsuit of misleading investors in a product known as Abacus 2007-AC1 by failing to disclose that hedge fund billionaire John Paulson helped choose, and intended to bet against, mortgage securities underlying the 2007 deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also alleged that Tourre misled ACA Capital Holdings Inc, a company also involved in selecting assets for Abacus, into believing Paulson &amp; Co Inc would be an equity investor in the synthetic collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2007 email that was shown to jurors, Tourre told his girlfriend at the time that the "whole building is about to collapse anytime now," referring to financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab ... standing in the middle of all these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstrosities!!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson went on to make billions of dollars in 2007 betting against the U.S. housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Paulson &amp; Co made about $1 billion from his short position on Abacus, while investors including ACA and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG lost about the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre is pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University of Chicago after formally parting ways with Goldman at the end of 2012. Goldman is continuing to pay for his legal defense, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman agreed in July 2010 to pay $550 million to settle with the SEC over Abacus, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. But the bank did say that some of its marketing materials were misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a firm, we remain focused on being more transparent, more accountable and more responsive to the needs of our clients," said Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre himself received an SEC offer to settle around the same time, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe he really believed he was innocent; fraud is a funny thing," said Hillary Sale, a professor at the Washington University School of Law. "But poor Fabrice. You have to kind of feel bad for him; he was just a kid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jurors remained largely tight-lipped as they dodged reporters and walked quickly out of the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a long, slow process," said Reverend Beth Glover, 47, an Episcopal priest, outside of the courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the jurors would discuss the intricacies of their decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been a long day," said Reece Pate, 37, a graphic designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC VICTORY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The win could give the SEC ammunition to address critics who have long argued the agency has been insufficiently aggressive in holding individuals on Wall Street accountable for their roles in the events leading to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a great result for the SEC," said Mary Schapiro, who chaired the regulator when it brought the case against Goldman and Tourre, and now heads the governance and markets practice at consulting firm Promontory Financial Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This win reinforces that the agency can and will litigate appropriate cases," she continued. "That may make it easier to secure admissions (of wrongdoing)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Schapiro's successor as SEC chair, Mary Jo White, said the regulator plans to seek admissions of wrongdoing in select enforcement cases. It also still plans to let many targets settle cases without admitting or denying the charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The SEC win in this matter illustrates they have the trial ability to effectively present these complicated cases to jurors," said Stephen Crimmins, a former SEC lawyer at K Gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verdict may not assuage all the SEC's critics. Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of financial regulation advocacy group Better Markets, said in a statement all the SEC had done was "scapegoat a single mid-level Goldman Sachs' trader who bragged in emails to his girlfriend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wall Street crashed the global financial system and almost caused a second Great Depression," Kelleher said. "Yet, the SEC failed to go after Wall Street's bonus-bloated executives who ran the banks that sold trillions of dollars of worthless securities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC says it has brought charges against 157 entities and individuals in financial crisis-linked enforcement actions. It has obtained $2.68 billion in penalties and other judgments from defendants, largely through settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRIAL RECORD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The likelihood that the SEC would win was not clear cut before the verdict, and the agency's record in financial crisis-related cases before the Tourre trial had been less than perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a case that also involving a complex mortgage investment, a federal jury in Manhattan in July 2012 cleared former Citigroup Inc manager Brian Stoker on civil charges he misled investors in a $1 billion CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2012, the SEC dropped civil charges against Edward Steffelin, a former managing director at GSC Capital Corp, in light of what a spokesman said was "information that came to light as the litigation progressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit had accused Steffelin of failing to ensure marketing materials for a $1.1 billion CDO structured by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co disclosed the involvement of hedge fund Magnetar Capital LLC in selecting assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Stoker and Steffelin cases, the two banks that were also sued agreed to pay nine-figure settlements without admitting or denying allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tourre's case, the judge and lawyers alike had over the course of the trial expressed concerns that the five women and four men on the jury were growing bored and were struggling to stay awake during the complex trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers had also, in a sign of confidence, said on Monday they would call no witnesses after the SEC rested its case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nate Raymond; Additional reporting by Bernard Vaughan, Jonathan Stempel, Lauren LaCapra and Douwe Miedema; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Ex-Goldman VP liable on six of seven civil counts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Paulson hedge fund benefited by shorting Abacus CDO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - A jury found former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc vice president Fabrice Tourre liable for
fraud for his role in a failed mortgage deal that cost investors

what she termed "next steps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC accused Tourre, 34, in a civil lawsuit of

failing to disclose that hedge fund billionaire John Paulson
helped choose, and intended to bet against, mortgage securities
underlying the 2007 deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also alleged that Tourre misled ACA Capital Holdings Inc,
a company also involved in selecting assets for Abacus, into
believing Paulson &amp; Co Inc would be an equity investor in the
synthetic collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2007 email that was shown to jurors, Tourre told his
girlfriend at the time that the "whole building is about to
collapse anytime now," referring to financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab ... standing in
the middle of all these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades
he created without necessarily understanding all of the
implications of those monstrosities!!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson went on to make billions of dollars in 2007 betting
against the U.S. housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Paulson &amp; Co made about $1 billion from his

have long argued the agency has been insufficiently aggressive

perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a case that also involving a complex mortgage investment,
a federal jury in Manhattan in July 2012 cleared former
Citigroup Inc manager Brian Stoker on civil charges he misled
investors in a $1 billion CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2012, the SEC dropped civil charges against
Edward Steffelin, a former managing director at GSC Capital
Corp, in light of what a spokesman said was "information that
came to light as the litigation progressed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit had accused Steffelin of failing to ensure
marketing materials for a $1.1 billion CDO structured by
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co disclosed the involvement of hedge fund
Magnetar Capital LLC in selecting assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Stoker and Steffelin cases, the two banks that were
also sued agreed to pay nine-figure settlements without
admitting or denying allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tourre's case, the judge and lawyers alike had over the
course of the trial expressed concerns that the five women and
four men on the jury were growing bored and were struggling to
stay awake during the complex trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre's lawyers had also, in a sign of confidence, said on 
Monday they would call no witnesses after the SEC rested its
case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Reynolds Holding
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs minnow has finally landed in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s net. The federal jury verdict against Fabrice &#8220;Fabulous Fab&#8221; Tourre on Thursday ends a losing streak in the courts for the U.S. watchdog. But the former trader played a minuscule role in Wall Street machinations that led to the financial crisis. The SEC&#8217;s win won&#8217;t absolve it from letting the big fish get away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was, at least superficially, a resounding victory. Jurors found Tourre liable on six of seven counts for misleading investors about a mortgage-backed collateralized debt obligation called Abacus. They concluded that he had obscured hedge fund manager John Paulson&#8217;s role in picking the securities underlying the deal and then betting against it. ACA Capital and German bank IKB claimed they wouldn&#8217;t have invested in Abacus  and lost about $1 billion  had they known the facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre argued that they did know. Even if they didnt, CDOs of this type only work when someone expecting the securities in it to fail takes the short side of the transaction. So sure were his lawyers of the case&#8217;s flaws that they declined even to call witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC overcame the doubts to notch its first win in a high-profile trial involving the financial crisis. Last August, the watchdog failed to persuade jurors that a mid-level banker named Brian Stoker was responsible for Citigroup&#8217;s questionable disclosure in another CDO deal. Almost four months later, it lost a fraud trial against managers of the defunct Reserve Primary Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the victory feels like a letdown. Tourre was merely a mid-ranking Goldman employee. He almost certainly did not act alone, or at least not without the knowledge of others. Goldman settled SEC charges involving Abacus in 2010 for a whopping $550 million, acknowledging that disclosure to investors wasn&#8217;t complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the jury&#8217;s verdict on Thursday is at least in part an implicit judgment on the bank&#8217;s culture  though since its SEC fine Goldman has instituted a series of business standards procedures that executives say should prevent such dealings from happening in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year the Stoker jury sent the judge a note encouraging the SEC to continue pursuing financial wrongdoing. One juror later described Stoker as a scapegoat for &#8220;appalling&#8221; Wall Street behavior. Those words could just as easily apply to Tourre.&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms Fort Walton Beach, FL's Water  Sewer Revs at 'AA'; 
      Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings affirms the rating for the following Fort Walton Beach 
      City, (the city) outstanding revenue bonds:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$10.2 million water and sewer revenue bonds, Series 2005, at 'AA'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SECURITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bonds are secured by a pledge of and lien on the net revenues of the 
      combined water and sewer system (the system).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      STRONG HISTORICAL FINANCIAL MARGINS: All-in debt service coverage has 
      performed well over time, with over 4.0x in fiscal 2012, and 2.5x net of 
      general fund transfers. All-in coverage is expected to stay above 2.0x 
      with the onset of state revolving fund (SRF) payments in 2013, though 
      coverage net of transfers is anticipated to decline in the five year 
      forecast. Ample liquidity in fiscal 2012 provided 483 days of operating 
      cash on hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HIGH GENERAL FUND TRANSFERS: Annual transfers to the general fund have 
      comprised approximately 20% of operating revenues since fiscal 2008. 
      Cash flow remaining after debt service and transfer payments is limited, 
      albeit sufficient to fully cash-fund a very modest capital improvement 
      program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MODERATELY HIGH DEBT BURDEN: The system's debt burden is expected to 
      more than double with the SRF borrowing used to finance a large capital 
      project in fiscal 2013. Debt ratios will weaken but remain below average 
      for the rating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COMPETITIVE USER CHARGES: The city's rate structure and average monthly 
      charges yield moderate year-over-year revenue growth and comprise 1.3% 
      of median household income, which is below Fitch's affordability 
      benchmark. Customer bills are competitive relative to peer utilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AMPLE WATER SUPPLY  TREATMENT SERVICE: The utility maintains strong raw 
      drinking water supply and treatment capacity. Sewer treatment is 
      provided by Okaloosa County through a dependable, long term wastewater 
      treatment agreement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SOMEWHAT WEAK LOCAL ECONOMY: The economy is stable but inherently 
      cyclical with concentration in tourism and the area air force base.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DEBT AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT: The successful absorption of the SRF loan 
      in light of existing debt and ongoing transfers will require continued 
      rate increases and strong financial management. Given the utility's 
      ability to buffer previous subordinate debt loads historically, Fitch 
      anticipates that a weakening of key financial metrics is unlikely.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CREDIT PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fort Walton Beach, population 20,500, is located on the western gulf 
      coast of the Florida panhandle in Okaloosa County (Implied ULTGO rated 
      'A+' by Fitch). The city's median annual household income approximates 
      state and national averages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SUSTAINED FINANCIAL STRENGTH
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The system's financial margins have performed favorably over the past 
      five years. In fiscal 2011, management transferred wastewater treatment 
      services to Okaloosa County, causing expenditures to rise, and 
      liquidity, as measured by the number of days that unrestricted cash can 
      support operations, to decline to a five-year low of 381 days' cash on 
      hand. Cash levels rebounded by fiscal 2012 to 480 days' cash on hand, in 
      part due to a 7.4% rate increase. Fitch projects stable liquidity over 
      the near term given the utility's limited capital needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fiscal 2012 debt service coverage rebounded to a strong 4.2x on an 
      all-in basis, due to a rate increase and retirement of subordinate lien 
      debt. Fiscal 2011 all-in coverage of 2.2x was still favorable but lower 
      than the 3.4x reported for fiscal 2010 due to an increase in operating 
      expenditures as the city began payments to the county for wastewater 
      treatment service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The city issued a $13 million state revolving fund loan (SRF) in 2011 to 
      fund the reconstruction of a major force main and pump station. Annual 
      debt service payments will begin in fiscal 2013 and the city's 
      expectation to maintain over 2.0x all-in coverage over the next five 
      years appears reasonable given historic all-in coverage levels with 
      similar debt loads, as well as a commitment to annual rate increases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GENERAL FUND TRANSFERS LIMIT CASH FLOW
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The system makes substantial annual transfers to the general fund after 
      the payment of operations and maintenance expenses and debt service. 
      Transfers include the city's indirect cost allocation for administrative 
      and financial management services and a 4% franchise "right of way 
      access" fee. These costs have historically equated to an average of 20% 
      of utility operating revenues annually from 2008-2011; totaling closer 
      to 30% in fiscals 2008 and 2009. Current city projections show transfers 
      will remain stable in the near term, reflecting the fiscal 2012 level of 
      15% of utility operating revenues. Fitch is concerned that this amount 
      is subject to change based on historic transfer fluctuations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite strong senior and all-in debt service coverage levels, coverage 
      net of transfers is comparatively low. Fiscal 2010 marked a five-year 
      low when transfers, combined with the utility's maximum annual debt 
      service (MADS) payment, yielded just 1.1x coverage. Coverage net of 
      transfers improved in fiscals 2011 and 2012; however, the onset of new 
      payments for subordinate SRF debt in fiscal 2013 will cause coverage net 
      of transfers to decline to levels demonstrated in previous years. 
      Coverage, net of transfers, is expected to decline in fiscal 2013 to 
      1.8x, reflecting a partial SRF payment, and may drop further to 1.3x in 
      fiscal 2014 as payments fully amortize.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Free cash to depreciation, an indicator of the system's ability to fund 
      capital projects from user charges after paying debt service 
      obligations, has been historically low due to the majority of leftover 
      cash being appropriated to the city's general fund. Actual capital 
      spending in fiscal 2012 was 157% of depreciation due to the partial 
      completion of a large capital project funded mainly from the SRF. 
      However, capital spending averaged just 61% of depreciation the prior 
      four years ('AA' median is 171%). Planned rate increases are expected to 
      maintain an adequate, albeit narrow operating margin net of transfers, 
      and provide enough cash flow to internally fund the utility's modest 
      near-term capital improvement plan without drawing on cash reserves.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RISING BUT STILL MODERATE DEBT BURDEN, LIMITED CAPITAL NEEDS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fiscal 2012 debt levels equate to 51% of net plant, consistent with the 
      'AA' median. Long term debt ratios are favorable; debt-per-customer is 
      at $562 in fiscal 2012 compared to the 'AA' median of $1,828, and debt 
      carrying charges (annual debt service as a percent of gross revenues) 
      are low, at only 9%, compared to the 'AA' median average of 17%. Though 
      the debt burden is projected to nearly double with the onset of annual 
      debt payments towards a 20-year SRF loan in 2013, debt ratios will 
      remain favorable relative to the medians for systems rated in the 'AA' 
      category.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Capital needs remain minimal. Apart from the near-completion of a 
      sizeable, SRF-funded project to replace a force main and pump station, 
      the utility's $1.3 million five-year capital improvement plan (CIP) 
      addresses renewal and replacement projects. As the Fort Walton Beach 
      service area is already largely built out, most new development is 
      primarily infill over existing water and sewer infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The challenge presented by the redevelopment of existing buildings into 
      larger complexes with more units is to keep capacity and supply apace 
      with growth. Management explains that the utility still retains 
      significant capacity after having planned and allocated water supply for 
      significant growth leading up to the recession. Ample unrestricted cash 
      balances lend the city flexibility for addressing unforeseen capital 
      needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AFFORDABLE USER CHARGES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The utility is responsible for billing for both the water and wastewater 
      services, and roughly 85% of customer accounts are residential. Water is 
      provided directly to the customer, and includes a lifeline charge for 
      the first 2,000 gallons, and a tiered volumetric charge structure. The 
      average residential customer pays about $16 for water per month for 
      4,900 gallons of water consumed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wastewater treatment is provided by the county however customers pay the 
      city directly for this service. The average customer pays $36 per month 
      for 4,900 gallons of wastewater, based on a resident's water intake. 
      This bill also includes the lifeline, and a per-1,000 gallon volumetric 
      rate. Fixed charges for both bills comprise over 50% of the total cost 
      for a typical residential consumer, a feature that ensures a stable 
      revenue stream despite volumetric volatility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Utility rates were increased by 3% annually from 2011 - 2013, and are 
      estimated to rise by 5%, 9%, 3% and 3% from 2014 - 2017. If approved, 
      this rate setting dependability is a credit positive. The current 
      combined water and sewer bill, based on actual average residential 
      consumption, equates to approximately 1.3% of median household income. 
      Fitch believes the utility maintains ample rate setting flexibility, as 
      Fitch views monthly charges of 2.0% or less to be affordable. Fort 
      Walton Beach's customer charges are competitive, and rank mid-range 
      relative to neighboring utilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The city has a 30 year contract (with a 20-year automatic renewal) for 
      which it pays the county a monthly sewer readiness fee plus a volumetric 
      rate per 1,000 gallons of metered water, both of which increase by a 
      fixed percentage each year. The city paid the county $2.61 per 1,000 
      gallons and $3,978 per month for the sewer fee in fiscal 2012. This 
      amounted to almost $1.9 million, or approximately 35% of utility 
      operating expenditures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SOUND OPERATIONAL PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The city's water and waste water networks are interconnected and serve 
      three distinct jurisdictional areas: The City of Fort Walton Beach, the 
      Town of Cinco Bayou, and parts of an unincorporated area known as the 
      Eglin Heights Subdivision (water service only). The system served 
      approximately 8,500 water customers in fiscal 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The city's ample water supply is drawn from the Floridan Aquifer by nine 
      wells. Average consumption totals just over 3 million gallons per day 
      (mgd), or about 60% of the permitted 5 mgd permitted allowance. The 
      utility's well and treatment system are capable of drawing and 
      distributing over 9 mgd, more than the permitted allowance. The city has 
      not requested permission to increase the allocation from current levels 
      and Fitch believes significant additional capacity need is unlikely. The 
      current Northwest Florida Water Management District 20-year consumptive 
      use permit was renewed in June 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wastewater treatment for the city's approximately 9,300 connections has 
      been provided by the Okaloosa County water and sewer system (rated 'AA-' 
      by Fitch) since 2010. The service area is considered built out; however 
      there are several infill projects currently underway that are in some 
      cases more than doubling customer units where there is already water and 
      sewer infrastructure in place. Customer growth is therefore expected to 
      steadily rise but not require service area extension.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wastewater capacity is ample at the county's three treatment plants, as 
      well as a fourth plant co-owned and operated by the Florida Department 
      of Environmental Protection. Clauses in the county contract preclude the 
      city from paying for additional flows to the county arising from 
      significant rainfall resulting in inflow and infiltration to the sewer 
      network.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MODERATE ECONOMIC STABILITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The area economy is supported by tourism and proximity to the adjacent 
      Eglin and Hurlburt Air Force Bases, which comprise roughly half of the 
      land area of Okaloosa County. A large industrial park located within 
      city limits houses multiple military contractors and other businesses 
      incidental to the large military installment. Management has expressed 
      some uncertainty regarding potential effects of the federal 
      sequestration policy on the military operations, particularly as it 
      pertains to staff furloughs or reduction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch cautioned in March 2013 that smaller localities that are heavily 
      dependent on federal defense and military activity will be more 
      vulnerable to the economic and revenue impact of the sequester, and will 
      have to carefully monitor their respective budgets to maintain balance 
      should cuts take place locally. Fitch will monitor the potential impact 
      of the sequester on demand and/or future transfers out of the system. To 
      the city's credit, the mayor and local elected officials are in constant 
      communication with the air force base leadership to monitor the 
      sequester's potential impacts and plan accordingly.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) olive branch to beleaguered metals customers will do little to help bring down the high cost of securing aluminum, but even critics praised the proposal as a smart move to placate regulators and silence complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman responded to mounting political pressure and regulatory scrutiny of its Metro International metals business on Wednesday, by offering customers immediate access to aluminum stored in its warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement outlining the bank's proposals to cut waiting times at all London Metal Exchange-registered warehouses, Goldman said it would let major consumers swap aluminum held in its warehouses for metal the bank has acquired, without the need to pay a steep cash premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With all this pressure from regulators it looks like Goldman wants to come clean," Kamil Wlazly, a senior analyst at Metal Bulletin Research, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But aluminum queues were one of the reasons why aluminum consumers have increasingly decided to shy away from procuring metal through the LME warehousing network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novelis Inc NVLX.UL, the world's biggest maker of flat-rolled aluminum used to make beverage cans, received Goldman's offer last week, but said it is of "no benefit" to the company or other industrial users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that other physical users of aluminum, like Novelis, are unlikely to be in the queue because no manufacturing business can tolerate a 19-month delay between buying metal and achieving delivery," said Nick Madden, chief supply chain officer, in an email to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madden, a longtime critic of the warehouse system, said he stopped securing supplies from warehouses in 2011 after waiting five months to get metal from Metro's Detroit facility for its Oswego, New York plant. The wait time has since ballooned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers and U.S. lawmakers have accused Goldman Sachs and other warehouse owners of artificially inflating wait times and lines to boost rents for warehouse owners and cause metal costs to rise. One major customer estimated the delays have cost consumers more than $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warehouse owners and outgoing LME CEO Martin Abbott have said the complaints over long lines are unjustified, arguing there is no shortage of metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they said the long lines have been created by traders trying to move metal to rival warehouses that are offering financial incentives in a bid to boost their own rental income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madden said Goldman's offer does not deal with the record high physical prices being paid by steelmakers and carmakers and other industrial customers, even though the market is in a chronic surplus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the focus should remain on the warehouse ownership issue and the reform of LME warehousing rules," Madden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLEVER BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this proposal is a very smart move on Goldman's part," said one source with knowledge of the warehousing business. "They have always claimed that the objections from the consumers are spurious because they are not the ones that are actually in the queues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said its offer applies only to large metal consumers like carmakers and soft drink producers, not to financial traders like hedge funds, or rival merchant commodity traders like Glencore Xstrata (GLEN.L) or Trafigura TRAFGF.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If no-one takes them up on this, they turn around and say there you are, told you!

&lt;p&gt;* Proposal will not cut costs of securing metal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Novelis says move is 'no benefit' to industrial users&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Plan seen as placating regulators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Lasting change seen coming from LME proposal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Susan Thomas and Silvia Antonioli&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' olive branch
to beleaguered metals customers will do little to help bring
down the high cost of securing aluminium, but even critics
praised the proposal as a smart move to placate regulators and
silence complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman responded to mounting political pressure and
regulatory scrutiny of its Metro International metals business
on Wednesday, by offering customers immediate access to aluminum
stored in its warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement outlining the bank's proposals to cut waiting
times at all London Metal Exchange-registered warehouses,
Goldman said it would let major consumers swap aluminum held in
its warehouses for metal the bank has acquired, without the need
to pay a steep cash premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With all this pressure from regulators it looks like
Goldman wants to come clean," Kamil Wlazly, a senior analyst at
Metal Bulletin Research, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But aluminium queues were one of the reasons why aluminium
consumers have increasingly decided to shy away from procuring
metal through the LME warehousing network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novelis Inc, the world's biggest maker of
flat-rolled aluminum used to make beverage cans, received
Goldman's offer last week, but said it is of "no benefit" to the
company or other industrial users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that other physical users of aluminum, like
Novelis, are unlikely to be in the queue because no
manufacturing business can tolerate a 19-month delay between
buying metal and achieving delivery," said Nick Madden, chief
supply chain officer, in an email to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madden, a longtime critic of the warehouse system, said he
stopped securing supplies from warehouses in 2011 after waiting
five months to get metal from Metro's Detroit facility for its
Oswego, New York plant. The wait time has since ballooned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers and U.S. lawmakers have accused Goldman Sachs and
other warehouse owners of artificially inflating wait times and
lines to boost rents for warehouse owners and cause metal costs
to rise. One major customer estimated the delays have cost
consumers more than $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warehouse owners and outgoing LME CEO Martin Abbott have
said the complaints over long lines are unjustified, arguing
there is no shortage of metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they said the long lines have been created by
traders trying to move metal to rival warehouses that are
offering financial incentives in a bid to boost their own rental
income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madden said Goldman's offer does not deal with the record
high physical prices being paid by steelmakers and carmakers and
other industrial customers, even though the market is in a
chronic surplus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the focus should remain on the warehouse
ownership issue and the reform of LME warehousing rules," Madden
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLEVER BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this proposal is a very smart move on Goldman's
part," said one source with knowledge of the warehousing
business. "They have always claimed that the objections from the
consumers are spurious because they are not the ones that are
actually in the queues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said its offer applies only to large metal consumers
like carmakers and soft drink producers, not to financial
traders like hedge funds, or rival merchant commodity traders
like Glencore Xstrata or Trafigura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If no-one takes them up on this, they turn around and say
there you are, told you! Nobody needs to swap warrants to take
physical delivery," the first source said. "To people not really
in the know, they will say that's great, so it's a clever piece
of business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In testimony to the U.S. Senate banking committee last week,
brewer MillerCoors LLC complained aluminium users like
themselves were being forced to wait in some cases over 18
months to take physical delivery of metal, or pay the high
physical premium to get aluminium today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman President Gary Cohn told CNBC television on
Wednesday that no consumers had stepped forward to take up the
offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not surprising, consumers said. Most end users have
purchasing contracts with producers and do not have to queue for
metal, but they do end up paying the price of the metal being
tied up and unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Packaging producers buy aluminium sheet so they don't take
aluminium from LME warehouses, but they still suffer the
consequences of the queues at warehouses propping up the
premium," Gino Schiona, director general of Italian aluminium
packaging association CiAl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The concentration of metal in warehouses and the rising

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leak in Exxon Mobil Corp's nearly 70-year-old Pegasus pipeline, which spilled thousands of barrels of crude oil in a small Arkansas town in March, appears to have been caused by an original manufacturing defect, U.S. regulators said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 95,000-barrel-per-day pipeline, which has been shut since March after spilling about 5,000 barrels of Canadian crude in Mayflower, Arkansas, will remain shut until it can be restarted safely, a spokesman for the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial review of the ruptured pipeline, prepared by Hurst Metallurgical Research Laboratory, found the pipeline failure "resulted from an original manufacturing defect of the electronic resistance welded pipe," the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 185-page review concluded it was "highly probable" some micro-cracking might have occurred immediately following the pipe's manufacturing, which likely led to further cracking and thinning of the pipeline during service, and ultimately causing the rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report did not give an opinion as to who was to blame for the failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether Exxon Mobil was responsible for the defect, company spokesman Aaron Stryk said the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, from Ohio, was the original maker and was no longer in business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Exxon completed a three-year project to reverse the Pegasus line to run north to south and increase its capacity by 50,000 bpd.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 1 (Reuters) - Jurors considering the fate of
Fabrice Tourre sought clarity Thursday on two of the lesser
charges facing the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice
president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the second day of deliberations in a civil fraud trial
brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, jurors
passed three notes to the federal judge in Manhattan presiding
over the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two notes concerned what jurors need to find to hold Tourre
liable on two counts that require at least a showing of
negligence for there to be liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other counts facing Tourre have a higher standard requiring
a finding he acted with intent to defraud or with reckless
disregard for the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC accuses Tourre of failing to tell investors that the
hedge fund of billionaire John Paulson selected mortgage
securities linked to a 2007 investment vehicle called Abacus
2007-AC1 and planned to short - or bet against - the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC also contends that Tourre misled ACA Capital
Holdings Inc, a company hired to select assets linked to Abacus,
into thinking Paulson &amp; Co Inc would invest in the equity of the
synthetic collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre denies wrongdoing. Goldman, which had been a
defendant when the lawsuit was filed in 2010, settled for $550
million without admitting or denying wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two notes on the elements of the law for the so-called
negligence claims stemmed from charges the SEC brought under the
Securities Act of 1933.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of the notes, jurors asked whether either Tourre's
base salary or the amount of money Goldman earned on Abacus
satisfies a requirement that "money or property" be obtained to
hold him liable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of the jurors' presence, Matthew Martens, a lawyer
for the SEC, urged the judge to say either would work. Goldman
Sachs earned $15 million in fees on Abacus, and Tourre said he
earned $1.7 million in salary and bonus in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe base salary should be enough on whether he
received money or property," Martens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest expressed skepticism
that a base salary alone rather than Tourre's bonus tied to
Goldman profits would satisfy the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When jurors returned, the judge referred them to
instructions she gave Wednesday, in which she said it would be
sufficient to find he obtained compensation directly or
indirectly tied to a misstatement or omission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told jurors that any money Goldman earned on Abacus
wouldn't suffice "unless it found its way down to Mr. Tourre in
some way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another note also addressing a charge requiring a finding
of at least negligence, jurors asked about the SEC's claim that
Tourre engaged in the offer or sale of Abacus notes and in two
credit default swaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do we need to find that he operated as a fraud or deceit
for all three of those or is any one of them sufficient to find
liability on this charge?" the note asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest told jurors any one of those securities offers or
sales would satisfy the charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;

revenue of $473 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter's shares fell 2 percent to $10.98.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enterprise performance management startup Tidemark has raised $13 million in new capital as it continues to grow and take on enterprise giants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we&#8217;ve mentioned before, Tidemark&#8217;s array of apps assist companies with financial planning, operational planning, and metrics management. The software goes head to head with big dogs like SAP, Oracle, and IBM and even competes with younger analytics companies like Tableau Software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tidemark CEO Christian Gheorghe (pictured above), a former CTO of SAP and CEO of TIAN Software, says what sets his software apart from the crowd is its fast and sleek design. He also said that, unlike the others, his apps can help businesses turn statistics &#8220;into a story.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Modern analytics need to solve modern problems,&#8221; Gheorghe told us. &#8220;And these apps need to be beautiful and engaging.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editor&#8217;s note: Our upcoming CloudBeat conference, Sept. 9-10 in San Francisco, will be tackling revolutionary cases of enterprise cloud usage, including how next generation apps should be built from ground up to integrate with other apps and data. Register today! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traction has been quite decent since the company came out of stealth mode in Oct. 2011. With its sights set on medium and large enterprises, Tidemark has added about 50 customers in the past six months. Revenue has grown 250 percent year-over-year as of the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new funding was led by new investor Tenaya Capital, with participation from prior investors Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners, and Redpoint Ventures. Including the new round, Tidemark has raised $48 million to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redwood City, Calif.-based Tidemark has about 100 employees.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's top broadcaster Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) on Thursday said it paid 7 billion pesos ($545 million) in seeking to acquire a controlling stake in Mexican cable company Cablecom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, would give Televisa control over 51 percent of Cablecom with the option to purchase the remaining 49 percent, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cablecom has 1.2 million cable, Internet and voice subscriptions, the company said. Televisa reported 4.68 million cable, Internet and voice subscriptions at the end of the second quarter.

Televisa bought convertible debt in Tenedora Ares, the holding company behind Cablecom.

&lt;p&gt;* Proposal will not reduce costs of securing metal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Plan seen as a smart move to placate regulators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Lasting change seen coming from LME proposal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Susan Thomas and Silvia Antonioli&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' olive branch
to beleaguered metals customers will do little to help bring
down the high cost of securing aluminium, but even critics
praised the proposal as a smart move to placate regulators and
silence complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman responded to mounting political pressure and
regulatory scrutiny of its Metro International metals business
on Wednesday, by offering customers immediate access to aluminum
stored in its warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement outlining the bank's proposals to cut waiting
times at all London Metal Exchange-registered warehouses,
Goldman said it would let major consumers swap aluminum held in
its warehouses for metal the bank has acquired, without the need
to pay a steep cash premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With all this pressure from regulators it looks like
Goldman wants to come clean," Kamil Wlazly, a senior analyst at
Metal Bulletin Research, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But aluminium queues were one of the reasons why aluminium
consumers have increasingly decided to shy away from procuring
metal through the LME warehousing network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers and U.S. lawmakers have accused Goldman Sachs and
other warehouse owners of artificially inflating wait times and
lines to boost rents for warehouse owners and cause metal prices
to rise. One major customer estimated the delays have cost
consumers more than $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warehouse owners and outgoing LME CEO Martin Abbott have
said the complaints over long lines are unjustified, arguing
there is no shortage of metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they said the long lines have been created by
traders trying to move metal to rival warehouses that are
offering financial incentives in a bid to boost their own rental
income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLEVER BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this proposal is a very smart move on Goldman's
part," said one source with knowledge of the warehousing
business. "They have always claimed that the objections from the
consumers are spurious because they are not the ones that are
actually in the queues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said its offer applies only to large metal consumers
like carmakers and soft drink producers, not to financial
traders like hedge funds, or rival merchant commodity traders
like Glencore Xstrata or Trafigura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If no-one takes them up on this, they turn around and say
there you are, told you! Nobody needs to swap warrants to take
physical delivery," the first source said. "To people not really
in the know, they will say that's great, so it's a clever piece
of business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In testimony to the U.S. Senate banking committee last week,
brewer MillerCoors LLC complained aluminium users like
themselves were being forced to wait in some cases over 18
months to take physical delivery of metal, or pay the high
physical premium to get aluminium today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman President Gary Cohn told CNBC television on
Wednesday that no consumers had stepped forward to take up the
offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I certainly would not go and cancel 10,000 tonnes of
aluminium in a Goldman warehouse in the hope that they will swap
it for me. This company is not a charity," said one physical
aluminium trader in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it doesn't solve end-users big bugbear. I&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The queues have caused the price premium on some metals,
like oversupplied aluminum and zinc, to surge, prompting
accusations that the banks and traders that own storage
facilities are artificially inflating prices and distorting
supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of premiums, there is no big change on the ground.
Maybe a very gradual reduction but nothing steep," the European
trader said. "If you want to buy aluminium you will still
struggle to find any cheap metal. I can't find anybody who has
drastically reduced their premium."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any lasting changes though will have to include all
companies in the LME's network of warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under mounting pressure to ease the problem with wait times,
the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd owned LME
announced on July 1 sweeping reform of its warehousing policy,
its third attempt to placate angry users. If approved, those
changes will come into effect in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it might just work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LME's warehousing committee, which includes Metro and
Glencore's Pacorini, held an extraordinary meeting this week,
and all but one of its members voted in favour of the new deal,
three sources with knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is a big accomplishment," said one of the sources.
"With the pressure on various parties from regulators I think
the general feeling is that people don't want to go into battle
on this one. Whether they like it or not, something has to
change. There is an air of inevitability about it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) on Thursday reported a sharp fall in quarterly profit on lower oil and gas output production and weaker earnings from its refining business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think the (earnings) shortfall was across the board," Brian Youngberg, oil analyst at Edward Jones in St Louis. "The biggest miss was on the downstream, the refining margins were well below expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest publicly traded oil company reported profit at $6.9 billion, or $1.55 per share, down 57 percent from $15.9 billion, or $3.41 per share in the same period a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had forecast a profit of $1.90 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural gas production fell 1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit in Exxon's refining business was $396 million, down sharply from $6.6 billion in the 2012 second quarter. Year-ago results included a $5.3 billion gain related to restructuring in Japan, but weaker margins and maintenance also weighed on results, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon edged down 1 percent to $92.40 in premarket trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Anna Driver; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Sofina Mirza-Reid)&lt;/p&gt;

			EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;ExxonMobil&#8217;s second quarter results reflect continued strong 
      operational performance and investments to meet growing demand for oil, 
      natural gas and chemical products in the years ahead.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Second quarter earnings were $6.9 billion, down 57% from the second 
      quarter of 2012.
			Excluding the prior year net gain of 
      $7.5&#160;billion associated with divestments and tax-related items, earnings 
      were down 19%.
			Weaker refining margins and volumes associated 
      with planned refinery turnaround and maintenance activities negatively 
      impacted Downstream earnings.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Capital and exploration expenditures were $10.2&#160;billion in the 
      second quarter and $22&#160;billion for the first six months of 2013, in line 
      with anticipated spending plans.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;The Corporation distributed $6.8&#160;billion to shareholders in the 
      second quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares 
      outstanding.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Earnings of $6,860&#160;million decreased $9,050&#160;million or 57% from the 
        second quarter of 2012 reflecting the absence of a prior year net gain 
        of $7.5&#160;billion associated with divestments and tax-related items.
      
			
        Earnings per share (assuming dilution) were $1.55, a decrease of 55%. 
        Excluding prior year divestments and tax-related items, earnings per 
        share were down 14%.
      
			
        Capital and exploration expenditures were $10.2&#160;billion, up 10% from 
        the second quarter of 2012, in line with anticipated spending plans.
      
			
        Oil-equivalent production decreased 1.9% from the second quarter of 
        2012. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects 
        and divestments, production was essentially flat.
      
			
        Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.0&#160;billion, which 
        includes an unfavorable working capital impact of about $5&#160;billion 
        primarily related to the timing of tax payments and planned 
        operational events. Proceeds associated with asset sales were 
        $0.3&#160;billion.
      
			
        Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $4&#160;billion.
      
			
        Dividends per share of $0.63 increased 11% compared to the second 
        quarter of 2012.
      
			
        As announced on April 27, 2013, production started from the Kearl oil 
        sands project in Alberta, Canada. The initial phase is expected to 
        produce 110,000 barrels per day, with the expansion project expected 
        to double production capacity by late 2015.
      
			
        Rosneft and ExxonMobil announced the achievement of several milestones 
        under their 2011 Strategic Cooperation Agreement, including the 
        formation of joint ventures for the Kara Sea and Black Sea projects, 
        and the establishment of foundations for joint ventures to explore 
        seven other licenses in the Russian Arctic and to manage the joint 
        West Siberia tight oil project. The companies have also agreed to move 
        to the next planning phase for an LNG development in the Russian Far 
        East.
      
			
        ExxonMobil recently announced expansions to increase premium base 
        stocks production at the Baytown, Texas and Singapore refineries, with 
        production expected to be available by early 2015. The projects will 
        increase capacity by 30%, maintaining our position as one of the 
        industry&#8217;s leading global suppliers of high-quality base stocks.
      
			
        ExxonMobil&#8217;s Singapore Chemical Plant began producing ethylene from 
        the facility&#8217;s second world-scale steam cracker, more than doubling 
        steam-cracking capacity at the site and significantly increasing 
        specialties capacity. The new steam cracker improves feedstock 
        flexibility and well positions the Singapore complex to serve growth 
        markets in Asia Pacific.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Second Quarter 2013 vs. Second Quarter 2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upstream earnings were $6,305&#160;million in the second quarter of 2013, 
      down $2,053&#160;million from the second quarter of 2012. Higher natural gas 
      realizations, partially offset by lower liquids realizations, increased 
      earnings by $90&#160;million, while lower volumes reduced earnings by 
      $70&#160;million. All other items reduced earnings by about $2.1&#160;billion, 
      primarily reflecting the absence of a prior year gain in Angola and 
      higher operating expenses, including reimbursement of past exploratory 
      costs to Rosneft for the Black Sea and Kara Sea Joint Ventures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 1.9% from the second 
      quarter of 2012. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC 
      quota effects and divestments, production was essentially flat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquids production totaled 2,182&#160;kbd (thousands of barrels per day), 
      down 26&#160;kbd from the second quarter of 2012. Excluding the impacts of 
      entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids 
      production was flat, as field decline was offset by project ramp-up and 
      lower downtime.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Second quarter natural gas production was 11,354&#160;mcfd (millions of cubic 
      feet per day), down 307&#160;mcfd from 2012. Excluding the impacts of 
      entitlement volumes and divestments, natural gas production was flat, as 
      field decline was offset by higher demand, lower downtime and project 
      ramp-up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,096&#160;million, $418&#160;million

      $5,209&#160;million, down $2,471&#160;million from the prior year.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Downstream earnings were $396&#160;million, down $6,250&#160;million from the 
      second quarter of 2012, due primarily to the absence of the $5.3&#160;billion 
      gain associated with the Japan restructuring. Weaker margins, mainly in 
      refining, decreased earnings by $510&#160;million. Volume and mix effects 
      decreased earnings by $370&#160;million, due primarily to higher planned 
      maintenance. All other items, primarily higher expenses, decreased 
      earnings by $70&#160;million.

      Petroleum product sales of 5,765&#160;kbd were 406&#160;kbd lower than last year's

      effects increased earnings by $120&#160;million. All other items, including 
      higher operating expenses, decreased earnings by $80&#160;million. Second 
      quarter prime product sales of 5,831&#160;kt (thousands of metric tons) were

      During the second quarter of 2013, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 
      45&#160;million shares of its common stock for the treasury to reduce the 
      number of shares outstanding at a cost of $4.0&#160;billion. Share purchases 
      to reduce shares outstanding are currently anticipated to equal 
      $3&#160;billion in the third quarter of 2013. Purchases may be made in both

        Earnings were $16,360&#160;million, down $9,000&#160;million or 35% from the 
        first half of 2012. Lower net gains from divestments impacted earnings 
        by $8.8&#160;billion.
      
			
        Earnings per share decreased 32% to $3.67. Excluding net gains from 
        divestments, earnings per share increased 4%.
      
			
        Oil-equivalent production was down 2.7% from 2012. Excluding the 
        impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, 
        production was down 0.9%.
      
			
        Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $21.9&#160;billion, including 
        proceeds associated with asset sales of $0.7&#160;billion.
      
			
        The Corporation distributed over $14&#160;billion to shareholders in the 
        first half of 2013 through dividends and share purchases to reduce 
        shares outstanding.
      
			
        Capital and exploration expenditures were $22&#160;billion, up 21% from the 
        first half of 2012, in line with anticipated spending plans.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upstream earnings were $13,342&#160;million, down $2,818&#160;million from the 
      first half of 2012. Lower liquids realizations, partially offset by 
      higher gas realizations, reduced earnings by $140&#160;million. Lower sales 
      volumes decreased earnings by $340&#160;million. All other items, including 
      lower net gains on asset sales, mainly in Angola, and higher expenses, 
      reduced earnings by $2.3&#160;billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On an oil-equivalent basis, production was down 2.7% compared to the 
      same period in 2012. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC 
      quota effects and divestments, production was down 0.9%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquids production of 2,188&#160;kbd decreased 23&#160;kbd compared with 2012. 
      Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and 
      divestments, liquids production was down 0.9%, as field decline was 
      partly offset by project ramp-up and lower downtime.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Natural gas production of 12,278&#160;mcfd decreased 571&#160;mcfd from 2012. 
      Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes and divestments, natural 
      gas production was down 0.9%, with field decline partly offset by higher 
      demand, lower downtime and project ramp-up.

      Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2013 were $1,955&#160;million, up 
      $267&#160;million from 2012. Earnings outside the U.S. were $11,387&#160;million, 
      down $3,085&#160;million from the prior year.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Downstream earnings of $1,941&#160;million decreased $6,291&#160;million from 2012 
      driven by the absence of the $5.3&#160;billion gain associated with the Japan 
      restructuring. Higher margins increased earnings by $230&#160;million, while 
      volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $640&#160;million. All other 
      items, including higher operating expenses and lower divestments, 
      decreased earnings by $580&#160;million. Petroleum product sales of 5,760&#160;kbd 
      decreased 483&#160;kbd from 2012.

      $6,141&#160;million from last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chemical earnings of $1,893&#160;million were $257&#160;million lower than 2012. 
      The absence of the gain associated with the Japan restructuring 
      decreased earnings by $630&#160;million. Higher margins increased earnings by 
      $210&#160;million, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by 
      $130&#160;million. All other items increased earnings by $30&#160;million. Prime 
      product sales of 11,741&#160;kt were down 568&#160;kt from 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Corporate and financing expenses were $816&#160;million in the first half of 
      2013, down $366&#160;million from 2012, as favorable tax impacts were 
      partially offset by the absence of the Japan restructuring impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gross share purchases through the first half of 2013 were $9.7&#160;billion,

			Actual results, 
      including project plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital and 
      exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and share purchase 
      levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in oil 
      or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil 
      and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic 
      recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes

			Frequently used terms
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This press release includes cash flow from operations and asset 
      sales, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.
			Because of the 
      regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we 
      believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with 
      the sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and 
      returns of investments together with cash provided by operating 
      activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business 
      and financing activities.
			A reconciliation to net cash provided 
      by operating activities is shown in Attachment II.
			References to 
      quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe 
      will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as &#8220;proved 
      reserves&#8221; under SEC definitions.
			Further information on 
      ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other 
      terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available 
      through the &#8220;Investors&#8221; section of our website at exxonmobil.com.

			Reference to Earnings
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			References to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to 
      ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income statement.
			Unless 
      otherwise indicated, references to earnings, Upstream, Downstream, 
      Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per 
      share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to 
      noncontrolling interests.

			The term &#8220;project&#8221; as used in this release can refer to a variety of

&lt;p&gt;Aug 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Thursday
reported a sharp fall in quarterly profit on lower oil and gas
output production and weaker earnings from its refining
business.
    "I think the (earnings) shortfall was across the board,"
Brian Youngberg, oil analyst at Edward Jones in St Louis. "The
biggest miss was on the downstream, the refining margins were
well below expectations."
    The world's largest publicly traded oil company reported
profit at $6.9 billion, or $1.55 per share, down 57 percent from
$15.9 billion, or $3.41 per share in the same period a year
earlier.
    Analysts on average had forecast a profit of $1.90 per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  
    Oil and natural gas production fell 1.9 percent.
    Profit in Exxon's refining business was $396 million, down
sharply from $6.6 billion in the 2012 second quarter. Year-ago
results included a $5.3 billion gain related to restructuring in
Japan, but weaker margins and maintenance also weighed on
results, Exxon said.
    Shares of Exxon edged down 1 percent to $92.40 in premarket
trading.

			&lt;p&gt;Achieved Revenues of $441 Million on 2.4 Million Metric Tons of Met Coal Sales

Company Implementing Further Reductions in Capital Expenditures and SGA Expenses

&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;BIRMINGHAM, AL--(Marketwired - August 01, 2013) -
 Walter Energy Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT), a leading, publicly traded "pure-play" producer of metallurgical (met) coal for the global steel industry, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our mines continue to perform well, as our focus on cost reduction and improving productivity continued in the second quarter, further improving our cost competitiveness," said Walt Scheller, Chief Executive Officer. "In a difficult met coal pricing environment, we continue to pursue measures to reduce operating costs, SGA expenses and capital spending." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated Financial Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy reported a net loss of $34.5 million, or $0.55 loss per diluted share, in the second quarter 2013, compared to net income of $31.9 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2012. Second quarter 2013 consolidated revenues totaled $441.5 million, a decrease from $677.6 million in the second quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower met coal prices and lower coal sales volume. Partially offsetting the declines in volume and pricing, consolidated financial results for the second quarter reflect the favorable impact of lower costs, including improved met coal cost performance and continued reductions in selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income for the second quarter of 2013 includes charges of $3.3 million, net of tax, or $0.05 per diluted share, primarily related to proxy contest expenses and a restructuring and asset impairment net benefit of $3.4 million, net of tax, or $0.05 per diluted share. These charges and adjustments are reconciled in the Company's "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures." The adjusted net loss for the second quarter totaled $34.7 million, or $0.55 loss per diluted share, and second quarter 2013 adjusted EBITDA totaled $36.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Sales Volume and Pricing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second quarter of 2013 met coal sales volume, including both hard coking coal (HCC) and low-volatility (low-vol) PCI, was 2.4 million metric tons (MMTs), representing a decrease of 0.4 MMTs from second quarter 2012. HCC sales volume was 2.0 MMTs in the second quarter of 2013, a decrease of 13.8% compared to the second quarter of 2012. Low-vol PCI sales volume declined 15.8% in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the prior-year comparable quarter. Second quarter 2013 shipments were impacted by vessel delays at the Port of Ridley, with over 200,000 metric tons (MTs) of June shipments moved to the third quarter at carryover pricing. Met coal sales tonnage was approximately 89% of total coal sales volume in the second quarter of 2013 compared to 76% for the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal sales price per ton averaged $150.41 in the second quarter 2013, down from second quarter 2012 pricing of $193.31 per metric ton (MT), due to weak global met coal market conditions. The average selling price for low-vol PCI was $135.55 per MT as compared to $163.51 per MT in the prior year comparable quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Cash Cost of Sales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated cash cost of sales for the second quarter 2013 averaged $122.04 per MT, down 9.7% compared to the second quarter of 2012, reflecting a reduction of 5.7% in cash cost of sales per MT in the Company's U.S. operations and a reduction of 10.4% per MT in the Canadian operations. The Company recorded a lower of cost or market (LCM) charge, of which approximately $19.0 million related to the effect of the decline in third quarter 2013 met coal prices on valuing second quarter ending inventory, primarily relating to the Company's Canadian operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical Coal Production&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal production was 2.9 MMTs in the second quarter of 2013, comprised of 2.5 MMTs of HCC and 0.4 MMTs of low-vol PCI. Met coal production increased 9.2% compared to 2.7 MMTs produced in the second quarter of 2012. The strong performance in the current quarter was driven by a production increase of 0.4 MMTs, a 26% improvement, at the Company's premium HCC mines in Alabama as compared to the second quarter in the prior year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met coal cash cost of production averaged $78.47 per MT in the second quarter of 2013, down 23.3% compared to the prior-year comparable quarter. Cash cost of production per MT in the Company's Alabama low and mid-vol mines decreased by $5.84 per MT, or 8.2%, in the second quarter of 2013 as compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to improved productivity. Cash cost of production per MT in the Canadian operations decreased by $50.39 per MT, or 32.9%, as compared to the second quarter of 2012. Strong productivity increases at Brule led to significantly improved cost performance, with cash cost of production totaling $79.82 per MT, compared to $101.68 per MT in the first quarter of 2013. Results for the Wolverine mine were negatively impacted by property development costs&#160;along with&#160;costs and downtime from unanticipated repairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Expenses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SGA expenses totaled $27.1 million in the second quarter 2013, representing a decline from $35.8 million in the second quarter of the prior year. SGA expenses in the second quarter of 2013 included expenses of $5.4 million, primarily related to the proxy contest. Compared to the prior-year comparable period, second quarter 2013 SGA expenses reflect the reclassification of $8.1 million from SGA expenses to cost of sales, comprised of operations-related direct administrative charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest expense for the second quarter of 2013 totaled $53.1 million compared to $31.1 million in the second quarter of 2012, with the increase primarily driven by an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates. Also included in interest expense is a non-cash component, primarily made up of amortization of debt expense, which totaled $5.6 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $4.7 million in the prior-year comparable period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results for the second quarter 2013 included a restructuring and asset impairment pre-tax net benefit of $9.1 million associated with the amendment of a sales contract eliminating commitments to deliver coal, thus allowing for the accelerated closure of the Company's North River mine in Alabama, partially offset by an asset impairment charge related to the closure. The Company also recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $3.3 million related to the previously announced curtailment of operations in April 2013 at Willow Creek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital Expenditures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Company's capital expenditures totaled $46 million for the second quarter of 2013, representing a decrease of 63% from the second quarter 2012. Capital expenditures for the first six months of 2013 totaled $80 million compared to $246 million in the first six months of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquidity &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available liquidity was $487.5 million at the end of the second quarter of 2013, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $170.9 million plus $316.6 million of availability under the Company's $375 million revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit of $58.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Company executed an amendment to its credit facility in July 2013, improving its financial flexibility in addressing the current difficult global met coal cycle. The amendment modifies related covenants, suspending interest coverage ratio compliance until March 31, 2015 and senior secured leverage ratio compliance until June 30, 2014. In addition, compliance in both covenants was made less restrictive once reinstated. The Company incurred fees and charges of $18.3 million in July 2013 associated with execution of the amendment, and interest margins on the debt under the credit facility increased by 1% going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong met coal production performance in the Company's Alabama underground mines has continued in the third quarter; however, volumes for the third quarter are expected to be lower than the second quarter due to a planned longwall move. Production in the Company's Canadian operation is also expected to be lower in the third quarter, as the Wolverine mine has moved into a less favorable phase of its mining cycle. The Company remains on track to achieve its full-year met coal production target of approximately 11 million metric tons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Company is planning further reductions in SGA expenses and capital expenditures. SGA expenses have been targeted for additional reductions of $10 million, with an annual targeted run rate of $80 million. In addition, the Company has reduced its capital spending target to approximately $150 million for the full-year 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of Non-GAAP Measures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This release contains the use of certain U.S. non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures. These non-GAAP measures are provided as supplemental information for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide additional insights into the performance of the Company, and they reflect how management analyzes Company performance and compares that performance against other companies. These non GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other entities. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is provided in the financial section of this release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conference Call Webcast &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Company will hold a webcast to discuss second quarter 2013 results on Thursday, August 1, 2013, at 10:00 a.m. ET.

						Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton is based on reported Cost of Sales and includes items such as freight, royalties, manpower, fuel and other similar production and sales cost items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost of Production per Ton is based on period costs of mining and includes items such as manpower, fuel and other similar production items but excludes depreciation, depletion and post retirement benefits. Average Cash Cost per Ton is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe Average Cash Cost per Ton is a useful measure of performance and we believe it aids some investors and analysts in comparing us against other companies to help analyze our current and future potential performance. Average Cash Cost of Sales per Ton may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

						During the third quarter of 2012, in our Canadian and U.K. operations certain metrics around tons included in production were realigned to align with how we account for production in the U.S. operations. Historically, the Canadian and U.K. operations were not recording tons produced until they were deemed finished goods. We revised this methodology to include all tons mined, no matter if in process or finished, as produced based on a clean coal tonnage equivalent. Our Form 8-K filed on November 5, 2012, includes a reconciliation of production statistics previously presented as compared with the realigned methodology from the Western Coal acquisition date of April 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with GAAP, and we believe items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant to a reader in understanding and assessing our financial condition. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, nor as an alternative to net income, income from operations, cash flows from operations or as a measure of our profitability, liquidity or performance under generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a useful measure of our ability to incur and service debt based on ongoing operations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Sheppard and Susan Thomas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON Aug 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' 
effort to diffuse intensifying pressure over its commodity
business by throwing open its metal warehouse doors likely comes
too late to head off further scrutiny of Wall Street's commodity
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks of escalating criticism of banks that own
commodity assets and trade raw materials has shaken executives
and the industry, with little sign of the pressure relenting.
Britain's financial watchdog is considering its own
investigation of metals warehouses, sources said, and two
lawmakers questioned whether power regulators were tough enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years of growing frustration over long waiting times and
rising prices at metals warehouses across the world spilled into
Washington this month, with lawmakers questioning why financial
banks are so deeply involved in commercial activity and metal
users including American brewer MillerCoors calling for a
clamp-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its first major effort to appease consumers, Goldman
offered on Wednesday to immediately swap aluminum for any
end-users holding metal at its Metro International warehouses,
allowing them to avoid year-long waits and high premiums. It
also refuted the notion that it was causing a shortage of metal,
saying none of its customers had yet taken up the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the effort met with a skeptical response among some
traders who said the bank had failed to address the big
financial incentives paid by warehouses to attract metal into
their facilities, which critics say have stoked prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also took issue with the bank's decision to limit the
offer to end-users, excluding the hedge funds and other traders
who are believed to account for most of the stockpiled metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It sounds to me like they're offering ice in the winter,"
said U.S. anti-trust lawyer Robert Bernstein, a partner at New
York-based Eaton &amp; Van Winkle LLP, who works on behalf of U.S.
copper fabricators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is the latest effort by Wall Street's biggest banks
to fend off a barrage of criticism of their role in the raw
materials supply chain, where they do everything from
stockpiling metal for clients to shipping gasoline to New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co said it was getting
out of the physical commodity business, quitting a sector it
paid billions of dollars over five years to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman's Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn defended the
bank's role in commodities and J Aron, its commodities trading
arm, calling it a "core" business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Commodity hedging is a core competence and one of the most
important things we do in the firm and our clients really need
us to be in that business," Cohn, who once ran J Aron, said on
CNBC. "We are staying in the commodity hedging business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the measures will ease pressure from
Washington, where a handful of lawmakers are pressing regulators
including the Federal Reserve and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) to bring banks to account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOUBTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's move will intensify scrutiny of other merchants
and banks, including Glencore Xstrata and JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co that have bought warehouses in the past three years,
and also the London Metals Exchange itself, which is in the
midst of its third effort to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lengthy waits to receive metal shipments are "a systemic
problem which goes broader than Metro International," said
American Beverage Association spokesman Christopher
Gindlesperger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In London, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is weighing
whether to launch a probe of the London Metal Exchange (LME)
warehousing system, an about-face from the past few years when
the agency said it did not have authority to delve beyond
derivative markets into the physical trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice industrial clients needing metal sometimes have
to queue for up to a year while warehouse companies -
increasingly owned by banks or trading houses - benefit from
rents they charge during the wait or traders focus on using
metal in finance deals rather than providing it to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One source at a competing warehousing company was critical
of Goldman's offer: "If they had said we're going to deliver out
faster, that would be a different story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHEN SEPTEMBER COMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the commotion over commodities trade has focused most
intensely on the warehousing issue, lawmakers are also looking
more broadly at whether banks should be allowed in the
commercial business of crude oil cargoes and power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While welcoming Goldman's effort as "great news", Democrat
CFTC commissioner Bart Chilton said the "the larger issue of
banks owning physical commodities, warehousing and delivery
mechanisms" remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of increasingly frenetic activity and vocal
debate, many industry officials expect the din to subside during
August, typically a slow month for the markets and also a
five-week hiatus for legislators in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may again reach fever pitch in September, with
Senator Sherrod Brown expected to call Federal Reserve and bank
officials to another hearing of the powerful banking committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That month also marks the end of a five-year grace period
granted to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to comply
with commercial banking regulations after they gave up their
independence at the height of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman has already sold its power plants and trades
little physical oil, Morgan Stanley faces an unknown outcome for
its massive global oil business, its 49 percent share in oil
tanker firm Heidmar and its cherished U.S. logistics and
pipelines business TransMontaigne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the banks say they should be allowed to trade and
invest in commodity businesses more broadly than their rivals
because of an exemption granted to investment banks in a 1999
law, it is unclear how much the Fed will allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed announced earlier this month that it was "reviewing"
the landmark 2003 decision that first allowed banks to trade
physical commodities, a shock decision that raised the specter
of even deeper restrictions than banks had been bracing for. It
is unclear when that review may conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The banks went a little bit too far with the Fed's
authorization to get into the commercial side of commodities
business and I think that the Senate is more than shocked about
what they saw when they started investigating into this
situation," said Richard Bove, a veteran banking analyst
currently working as an equity research analyst for Garden City,
New York-based Rafferty Capital Markets LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I doubt that any bank will have any, if you will,
commercial commodities business in 12 to 18 months from now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPENING THE DOOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately on Wednesday, two Democratic senators questioned
whether a landmark $410 million settlement with JPMorgan earlier
this week over alleged power market manipulation had included
"adequate refunds to defrauded ratepayers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The penalty is the second-largest ever by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC), but is "equal to roughly 1.3
percent of JPMorgan's 2012 profits", Senators Elizabeth Warren
and Edward Markey, both of Massachusetts, wrote to the FERC
chairman. They also questioned why JPMorgan executives were not
punished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crack-down is opening opportunities for less-restricted
competitors, particularly foreign banks not overseen by the Fed,
potentially leading to the biggest reshuffling of market power
since the 1990s era of the "Wall Street refiners."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's Grupo BTG Pactual SA, the privately held bank run
by billionaire Andr&#233; Esteves, is forging ahead with a $300
million-plus expansion plan to create a global powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just months after hiring former Noble Group Chief Executive
Ricardo Leiman to lead the drive, BTG has recruited nearly a
dozen traders, managers and analysts in London, Geneva and New
York to cover everything from freight to grains to natural gas,
according to headhunters and a source familiar with the plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a regulatory perspective they may try to become like
Macquarie, a representative of a foreign bank," said Peter
Henry, senior consultant at Commodity Search Partners in New
York. "There's an angle there."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) effort to diffuse intensifying pressure over its commodity business by throwing open its metal warehouse doors likely comes too late to head off further scrutiny of Wall Street's commodity trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks of escalating criticism of banks that own commodity assets and trade raw materials has shaken executives and the industry, with little sign of the pressure relenting. Britain's financial watchdog is considering its own investigation of metals warehouses, sources said, and two lawmakers questioned whether power regulators were tough enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years of growing frustration over long waiting times and rising prices at metals warehouses across the world spilled into Washington this month, with lawmakers questioning why financial banks are so deeply involved in commercial activity and metal users including American brewer MillerCoors calling for a clamp-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its first major effort to appease consumers, Goldman offered on Wednesday to immediately swap aluminum for any end-users holding metal at its Metro International warehouses, allowing them to avoid year-long waits and high premiums. It also refuted the notion that it was causing a shortage of metal, saying none of its customers had yet taken up the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the effort met with a skeptical response among some traders who said the bank had failed to address the big financial incentives paid by warehouses to attract metal into their facilities, which critics say have stoked prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also took issue with the bank's decision to limit the offer to end-users, excluding the hedge funds and other traders who are believed to account for most of the stockpiled metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It sounds to me like they're offering ice in the winter," said U.S. anti-trust lawyer Robert Bernstein, a partner at New York-based Eaton &amp; Van Winkle LLP, who works on behalf of U.S. copper fabricators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is the latest effort by Wall Street's biggest banks to fend off a barrage of criticism of their role in the raw materials supply chain, where they do everything from stockpiling metal for clients to shipping gasoline to New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) said it was getting out of the physical commodity business, quitting a sector it paid billions of dollars over five years to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman's Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn defended the bank's role in commodities and J Aron, its commodities trading arm, calling it a "core" business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Commodity hedging is a core competence and one of the most important things we do in the firm and our clients really need us to be in that business," Cohn, who once ran J Aron, said on CNBC. "We are staying in the commodity hedging business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the measures will ease pressure from Washington, where a handful of lawmakers are pressing regulators including the Federal Reserve and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to bring banks to account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOUBTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's move will intensify scrutiny of other merchants and banks, including Glencore Xstrata (GLEN.L) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co that have bought warehouses in the past three years, and also the London Metals Exchange itself, which is in the midst of its third effort to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lengthy waits to receive metal shipments are "a systemic problem which goes broader than Metro International," said American Beverage Association spokesman Christopher Gindlesperger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In London, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is weighing whether to launch a probe of the London Metal Exchange (LME) warehousing system, an about-face from the past few years when the agency said it did not have authority to delve beyond derivative markets into the physical trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice industrial clients needing metal sometimes have to queue for up to a year while warehouse companies - increasingly owned by banks or trading houses - benefit from rents they charge during the wait or traders focus on using metal in finance deals rather than providing it to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One source at a competing warehousing company was critical of Goldman's offer: "If they had said we're going to deliver out faster, that would be a different story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHEN SEPTEMBER COMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the commotion over commodities trade has focused most intensely on the warehousing issue, lawmakers are also looking more broadly at whether banks should be allowed in the commercial business of crude oil cargoes and power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While welcoming Goldman's effort as "great news", Democrat CFTC commissioner Bart Chilton said the "the larger issue of banks owning physical commodities, warehousing and delivery mechanisms" remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of increasingly frenetic activity and vocal debate, many industry officials expect the din to subside during August, typically a slow month for the markets and also a five-week hiatus for legislators in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may again reach fever pitch in September, with Senator Sherrod Brown expected to call Federal Reserve and bank officials to another hearing of the powerful banking committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That month also marks the end of a five-year grace period granted to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to comply with commercial banking regulations after they gave up their independence at the height of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman has already sold its power plants and trades little physical oil, Morgan Stanley faces an unknown outcome for its massive global oil business, its 49 percent share in oil tanker firm Heidmar and its cherished U.S. logistics and pipelines business TransMontaigne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the banks say they should be allowed to trade and invest in commodity businesses more broadly than their rivals because of an exemption granted to investment banks in a 1999 law, it is unclear how much the Fed will allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed announced earlier this month that it was "reviewing" the landmark 2003 decision that first allowed banks to trade physical commodities, a shock decision that raised the specter of even deeper restrictions than banks had been bracing for.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Aug. 2, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz Grossman Hufford Dahlstrom  Gross LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Walter Investment Management Corp. ("Walter Investment" or the "Company")(NYSE:WAC) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, and docketed under 13 cv 1916 T27TBM, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of Walter Investment between May 9, 2012 and June 6, 2013 both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"). This class action seeks to recover damages against the Company and certain of its officers and directors as a result of alleged violations of the federal securities laws pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you are a shareholder who purchased Walter Investment securities during the Class Period, you have until September 23, 2013 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll free, x237.

	Walter Investment is a loan servicer and business solutions provider focused on generating recurring, fee-based revenues from an "asset-light" platform. The Company specializes in offering creative, structured solutions to owners of less-than-prime, non-conforming and other credit-challenged mortgage assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company lacked adequate internal controls over financial accounting; (2) the Company's internal controls were not effective; (3) the Company's financial statements contained false and misleading statements; (4) the Company had failed to disclose material weaknesses in the internal controls of its recent acquisition Reverse Mortgage Solutions, Inc. ("RMS"); (5) the Company had overstated the value of RMS; and (6) as a result of the foregoing, the Company's statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On March 18, 2013, the Company shocked investors by disclosing that, based on an evaluation by the Company's Board of Directors and management, "our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of this material weakness, management has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective." On this news the Company's shares fell $8.61 per share or over 20% percent to close at $32.98 per share on March 19, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On June 6, 2013, the Company reported that, [s] "Subsequent to the completion of the RMS Acquisition, the Company discovered a failure to record certain estimated liabilities to investors relating to servicing errors by RMS." The Company concluded after preliminary review that RMS historical financial statements, and the related reports of RMS historical independent registered public accounting firm, "should no longer be relied upon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what you think of the business of litigation funding, its here to stay. There are now hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars of capital invested in commercial litigation and arbitration in the United States, Britain and Australia, and some of the biggest litigation funding firms in the United States have begun to show a good enough return for their investors to justify the risk of taking sides in inherently lengthy and uncertain cases. Business groups that oppose investment in litigation tried mightily, but they simply havent managed to stem the industrys steady spread, either through legislation or regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For leading litigation financiers, the most significant impediment to growth is probably vestigial suspicion of their business by the big companies and major law firms they want to partner with. Thats why a newly released unredacted version of a filing by Patton Boggs in Chevrons Manhattan federal court fraud litigation against the onetime lawyer for Ecuadorians with a $19 billion judgment against the oil company is so interesting. (Ted Folkman at Letters Blogatory was the first to spot the unredacted filing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Patton Boggs brief addresses the relationship between the law firm, which is counsel to the Ecuadorian claimants in some of the multipronged litigation between them and Chevron, and Burford Capital, which once invested in the Ecuadorians case but has since alleged that it was deceived into taking part in the litigation. Precisely what Burford knew, and when it knew it, is yet another treacherous cul de sac on the long and ugly road of the Chevron litigation; Burford principal Christopher Bogart and Chevron itself present an abundance of contemporaneous evidence to rebut Patton Boggss premise that Burford knew more about flaws in the Ecuadorians case than Bogart said in a declaration to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in April. But the newly released brief quotes internal Burford communications showing the funders fear that the taint of its investment in the Chevron litigation would hurt not only its prospects but those of the entire litigation finance industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you dont recall, Burford co-founder Bogart made a splash this spring when he filed his declaration, which described how Patton Boggs and Steven Donziger  the New York lawyer who championed the Ecuadorians environmental claims against Chevron for years, until Chevron lawyers at Gibson, Dunn  Crutcher revealed such allegedly illicit tactics as bribing Ecuadorian judges  had falsely assured Burford about the legitimacy of the case in Ecuador. Bogarts declaration was rightly regarded as a boon to Chevron, a repudiation of the Ecuadorians and their advisers by another of their onetime supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patton Boggs was, of course, infuriated by Bogarts assertions, which it considered a betrayal. Patton Boggs partner James Tyrrell had been a big supporter of Burford in its early days. He is a personal friend and former law firm partner of Burford co-founder Selvyn Seidel; Patton Boggs even provided office space to Burford when the funder launched. Burford and the law firm worked hand-in-glove in the early days of the funders investment in the Ecuadorian case. But Patton Boggs contended in a motion to strike Bogarts declaration from the record in the case before Kaplan that everything changed when Seidel left Burford and former Latham  Watkins partner Ernest Getto  a onetime outside counsel for Chevron  joined Burfords board. According to Patton Boggs, after Gettos arrival, Burford schemed with Chevron to renounce the Ecuadorians and exit a messy case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, Chevron vehemently disputes Patton Boggss account of collusion between Chevron and Burford, calling it a fantastical narrative and an attempt to hide the obvious, namely that Burford was appalled by revelations about Patton Boggs in a March 2013 ruling by Judge Kaplan. (A Burford representative told me by email: Burford is not a participant in the ongoing Lago Agrio saga. We sold our interest in 2010 and terminated our agreement in 2011. We dont think it is appropriate to engage in public dialog about ongoing litigation matters outside of the judicial process and we are surprised that Patton Boggs has been willing to do so. We obviously have a different view of the history of this matter  a view that is supported by the contemporaneous documents  but we do not see any purpose in debating the issues in the press.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patton Boggs and Chevron (and Burford) dispute the significance of contacts between Getto and Chevron, but from a Bogart email quoted in the Patton Boggs brief, it seems clear that by early 2011 Bogart wanted Getto to pass along a message of conciliation to Chevron general counsel Hewitt Pate, with whom Getto was dining on Jan. 27. In a preparatory email to Getto, Bogart said that the Chevron case was not a typical matter for Burford, which preferred investing in commercial disputes and working with law firms like Latham or Gibson Dunn. Burford would, frankly, be happier not to be in the middle of this mess, especially given that it is relatively far afield from our core business of financing corporate litigation, Bogart wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litigation funder, according to Patton Boggs, apparently felt torn between the business harm it feared from its involvement in a non-commercial contingency-fee litigation and from stranding a law firm it had agreed to back when (at that point) the law firm hadnt been accused of doing anything improper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burford documents indicate that the company tried to quietly ditch the Chevron case while its involvement was still undisclosed publicly. Once Roger Parloff of Fortune (a friend and former colleague of mine) got wind of Burfords role, Burfords concern about business impact deepened. Getto relayed to Bogart and others that a chief litigator from one major firm told him that she had partners who were interested in Burford, but the firm was being pressured by their insurance clients to stay away because of the Ecuador matter, the newly released Patton Boggs memo said. Getto complained that the Ecuador investment cuts against Burfords message that it holds itself out as different from most funders in that it funds business disputes, a representation that was front and center in Gettos presentations to potential clients. Bogart, according to the Patton brief, was upset that the Chevron case made Burford seem less like a Goldman to the Am Law 100 than like a contingency-fee plaintiffs firm. Getto complained about a meeting with a general counsel in which the first topic of conversation was how Burfords investment in the Chevron litigation squared with its description of itself as a specialist in funding commercial disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, according to documents Patton Boggs cites, was the possibility that Burfords Chevron investment would damage the inchoate alternative litigation finance industry. It wont take much to push a number of established law firms and GCs away from ALF, which seems to me the bigger risk, Getto said in an email. With Big Oil, the insurance industry and the Chamber of Commerce allied in trying to shut ALF down, I would expect to see some bills in at least a few states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patton Boggss brief paints Burfords desperation over potential harm to its business model as the reason the funder ditched the case and the law firm; Chevron and Burford say the funder publicly repudiated Patton Boggs when it became convinced of the law firms deception. In any event, the Chevron mess does not seem to have slowed the litigation funding movement, despite Burfords fears. Burford principal Bogart told me in an email Friday that the Chevron matter is so sui generis that it doesnt really have much of an impact on anything normal, and I think lawyers and clients all understand that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HAVANA (Reuters) - Cubans are cheering a U.S. visa policy that gives them five years to travel to the United States, while Cuba's government and state-run media have largely remained silent about the new travel measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They still are allowed to remain in the United States for only six months, but the change in U.S. policy, which took effect on Thursday, allows them to make multiple U.S. visits over the five years instead of repeatedly applying and paying the $160 fee for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Havana retiree Antonio Fernandez, who has visited his children and other family members in the United States, welcomed the new policy, which he said would allow more contact between divided Cuban families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am in the process of applying for a visa at this very moment," Fernandez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And I know well how many steps and how much money you have to pay. This measure will eliminate these problems," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuba liberalized travel restrictions earlier this year, making it easier and less expensive for residents to travel and return home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Cuban travel measures extend to 24 months the amount of time Cubans can be out of the country without losing rights and they can seek an extension of up to 24 additional months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 900,000 Cubans traveled abroad in 2012, according to the government and more than 46,000 emigrated, the highest number since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cubans and Cuban-Americans had increasingly complained about the difficulty and cost for Cubans seeking to obtain a U.S. visa, although Cuban applications for U.S. visas increased by some 30 percent after Havana lifted its restrictions in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the only comment so far on the new visa change, an article in Friday's edition of Granma, the Communist Party daily, carried a headline that read, "New Tool, Same Policy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This new visa policy does not imply a significant change in the hostile policy of the United States toward Cuba," the article said, quoting local commentators who characterized it as a pragmatic step by the United States to reduce costs to process Cuban visa requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Cuban diplomat Ramon Sanchez-Parodi told Granma that Washington's new policy would "save (the United States) expenses, time and financial and human resources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanchez-Parodi said the measure also gave "the impression - and only the impression - of a more flexible policy toward Cuba."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each week, hundreds of Cubans line up outside the U.S. Interests Section in Havana to apply for a visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The office serves as a lower-level diplomatic mission between the two ideological foes who do not have full diplomatic ties. The United States maintains a more than half-century-old trade embargo against the Caribbean island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosa Maria Rodriguez, a retiree who lives in Santiago de Cuba, some 550 miles east of Havana, said the new visa policy would mean she would no longer have to make repeated trips to the Cuban capital to apply for a visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can you imagine how much money and work I will save?" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, there was a sense of growing excitement among Cubans lined up outside the Interests Section as news of the visa policy spread through the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Cubans left the premises with stoic expressions, others in tears after being denied a visa, but many emerged thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman, who walked out with her visa in hand and asked that her name not be used, said, "people are ecstatic in there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Kevin Gray and Jackie Frank)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings affirms the following classes of JPMorgan Commercial 
      Mortgage-Backed Securities Trust 2009-RR1:
    &lt;/p&gt;

      This transaction contains certain classes designated as exchangeable 
      certificates and others as regular certificates. The Class A4A, A4A-V 
      and A4A-Z certificates are exchangeable certificates; classes A4A-V and 
      A4A-Z had previously been erroneously classified as paid in full . The 
      rest of the classes are regular certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are the result of the mostly stable ratings or shadow 
      ratings of the underlying bonds. All but two of the underlying bonds 
      have a Fitch rating or shadow rating of 'AAAsf'. Class A-4 in GSMS 
      2007-GG10 is rated 'Asf'; Negative Outlook and class A-4 in JPM 
      2006-CIBC15 is rated 'AAsf'; Negative Outlook. These ratings were 
      incorporated into Fitch's analysis of the Re REMIC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This transaction is a resecuritization of the ownership interest in 15 
      commercial mortgage-backed certificates which total $582,383,700. 
      Principal and interest from the underlying commercial mortgage-backed 
      certificates are pooled and applied first to the A-4A certificates pro 
      rata and second to the A-4B certificates pro rata. Losses are applied 
      first to the A-4B certificates pro rata and then to the A4-A 
      certificates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Credit enhancement for classes A4A, A4A-V, and A4A-Z is approximately 
      50% and is provided by the structural support of the underlying 
      transactions and the A4B certificates. Credit enhancement for the A4B, 
      A4B-1 and A4B-2 certificates is approximately 30% and provided by the 
      structural support of the underlying transactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Re REMIC bonds continue to have Stable Outlooks as no rating changes 
      are expected at this time. Further negative migration of the underlying 
      bonds may lead to downgrades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials paved the way on Friday for same-sex spouses to visit or live in the United States, announcing the State Department will give equal treatment to visa applications of gays and lesbians who want to travel with their partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State John Kerry, announcing the measure at the U.S. embassy in London, said the shift will allow the department to start processing requests from married gay couples the same way it handles those from heterosexual spouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as a marriage has been performed in the jurisdiction that recognizes it, then that marriage is valid under U.S. immigration laws. Every married couple will be treated exactly the same, and that is what we believe is appropriate," Kerry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move, which follows similar action last month by U.S. immigration officials, would help U.S. citizens live and travel with their same-sex spouse in the United State as well as allow married couples from other countries to visit the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will mostly affect married gay couples overseas, gay rights advocates said. For example, if one spouse has a visa to travel to the Unites States for work or study, their spouse can apply to come along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would also help gay Americans living in other countries bring their spouse to the United States, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is exciting news for couples who are living abroad," said Victoria Neilson, legal director for the advocacy group Immigration Equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes after the Obama administration urged all U.S. agencies to review their polices after the U.S. Supreme Court in June struck down a key part of the federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. immigration law requires visa travel documents for those who want to live in the United States permanently or to stay temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, the Department of Homeland Security said its U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) would begin reviewing petitions filed on behalf of same-sex spouses the same way as those for spouses in heterosexual marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's announcement by the State Department gives U.S. embassies and consulates around the world the same power to do so on applications filed overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you are the spouse of a U.S. citizen, your visa application will be treated equally. If you are the spouse of a non-citizen, your visa application will be treated equally. If you are in a country that doesn't recognize your same-sex marriage, then your visa application will still be treated equally at every single one of our 222 visa processing centers around the world," Kerry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen countries outside the United States recognize same-sex marriage, according to Immigration Equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Additional reporting by Susan Heavey in Washington; Editing by Vicki Allen)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Braden Reddall
    Aug 2 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp posted on Friday a
steeper-than-expected 26 percent drop in quarterly profit on
softer oil prices and thinner refining margins.
    Shares of the second-largest U.S. oil company slipped 2
percent as quarterly oil and gas volumes weakened to a level
well below Chevron's full-year target.
    Achieving increased production from oil wells has been a
struggle for Chevron and larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp,
which reported disappointing results on Thursday along with
Royal Dutch Shell Plc. 
    Chevron's second-quarter net income fell to $5.37 billion,
or $2.77 per share, from $7.21 billion, or $3.66 per share, a
year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected $2.96 per share,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  
    Chevron produced 2.58 million barrels of oil equivalent per
day, down from 2.62 million bpd a year earlier. The company is
targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year, and reiterated that
goal on Friday, with output then expected to grow by 25 percent
by 2017. 
    A big chunk of that growth will be from its huge Australian
liquefied natural gas projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone. Once they
are complete, Chevron will see a "flattening" of annual capital
spending, Vice Chairman George Kirkland said, after the budget
ballooned by $7 billion in two years to $36.7 billion in 2013.
    In British Columbia, Chevron is marketing LNG from the
Kitimat project to Asian buyers and will not make a final
investment decision on that until it has sold between 60 percent
and 70 percent of the LNG, with equity stakes on the table to
sweeten the deal for buyers. 
    So a final decision on Kitimat is unlikely until next year,
Kirkland said on a call with analysts, while acknowledging the
competition within Chevron to sell the expected output of both
Kitimat and Gorgon.
    "There is a little bit of a horse race between them at this
point in our own shop," he said, adding that he believed both
had a timing advantage over competing LNG capacity from East
Africa.
    
    OIL PRICE HIT
    In the second quarter, non-U.S. exploration and production
earnings fell 10 percent to $3.87 billion, with costs up and the
average sale price for liquids down to $94 per barrel from $99 a
year before. Output also declined, by 42,000 bpd. 
    U.S. upstream earnings dropped 18 percent to $1.08 billion,
while U.S. refining and marketing earnings tumbled 83 percent as
refinery crude input fell 114,000 bpd to 814,000 bpd, mainly due
to the fire at its plant in Richmond, California, last August. 
    Lower margins hit all U.S. refiners, with the discount they
enjoyed from cheaper U.S. crude narrower than before.
 
    Shares of Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, were down
2.3 percent at $123.51 on Friday.
    The stock has comfortably outperformed peers in 2013, rising
15 percent, compared with 6 percent for Exxon. Chevron's market
capitalization of $240 billion is now larger than PetroChina
 - making it the world's second-largest publicly

      Fitch Downgrades 2 Non-Investment Grade Classes of JPMCC 2005-CIBC12
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded two classes and affirmed 18 classes of J.P. 
      Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC), 2005-CIBC12. 
      A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press 
      release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades are primarily based on incurred losses and an increase in 
      expected losses to specially serviced loans. The affirmations are due to 
      sufficient credit enhancement relative to the ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 7% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the 
      original pool balance total 9.8%, including $124.4 million (5.6% of the 
      original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 
      34 loans (21.8%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes eight 
      specially serviced assets (7%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the July 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 39.1% to $1.35 billion from $2.22 billion at 
      issuance. Per the servicer reporting, five loans (2.3% of the pool) are 
      defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes E through 
      NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is a specially-serviced loan 
      (3% of the pool), which is secured by a 289,000 square foot (sf) office 
      complex located in Atlanta, GA. The loan transferred to special 
      servicing in April 2012 for imminent default following a notice from the 
      sole tenant that it intended to downsize and renew its lease at market 
      rates, which was significantly lower. The special servicer reports that 
      the sole tenant now occupies 83% of the space with the remainder still 
      vacant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is a 248-unit 
      multifamily property located in North Las Vegas, NV (0.8%). The loan 
      transferred to special servicing in November 2010 and became real estate 
      owned (REO) in December 2012. The special servicer reports that the 
      current occupancy is approximately 70%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is a specially-serviced 
      loan (0.6%), which is secured by an 87,330 sf office building located in 
      New London, CT. The loan transferred to the special servicer in February 
      2007. The borrower filed an appeal with Connecticut's Appellate Court 
      and Connecticut Supreme Court upheld the foreclosure. Special servicer 
      has reopened the foreclosure process and expects the foreclosure to 
      occur in October 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlooks on classesA-3A2 through B remain Stable due to 
      increasing credit enhancement and continued paydown.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades the following classes, assigns Rating Outlooks and 
      Recovery Estimates (REs) as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$43.3 million class B to 'Bsf' from 'BBsf'; Outlook to Stable from 
      Negative;

		&lt;p&gt;
      --$19 million class C to 'CCCsf' from 'Bsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes and revises REs as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$49.2 million class A-3A2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$42.3 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$216.7 million class A-M at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      --$32.5 million class D at 'CCCsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      --$27.1 million class E at 'CCsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$24.4 million class F at 'Csf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$122,853 class G at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class H at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      --$0 class L at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class M at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class N at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class P at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$50 million class UHP at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A-1, A-2 and A-3A1 certificates have paid in full. Fitch does 
      not rate the class NR certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the 
      ratings on the interest-only class X-1 and X-2 certificates.

</body></entry><entry author="Suzanne Barlyn" date="2013-08-02T14:28:01+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/02/us-goldman-finra-idUSBRE9710PW20130802"><headline>U.S. judge tosses out Goldman ruling, points to arbitrator</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A federal judge late on Thursday tossed out a securities arbitration ruling against an investor who sought to recoup $1.4 million from Goldman Sachs Group Inc, citing an arbitrator's failure to fully disclose his involvement in an unrelated criminal proceeding, according to a court opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge J. Curtis Joyner of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania threw out the arbitration award after ruling that the investor's legal rights in the proceeding were compromised by an arbitrator who misled the parties about his indictment for the unauthorized practice of law and by not participating in the decision, according to the opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs did not immediately return phone calls or respond to an email requesting comment. The case already has led to a new initiative by FINRA beefing up oversight of its 6,500 securities arbitrators by conducting annual background checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investor, Athena Venture Partners LP, lost the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration against Goldman in May, after alleging it was misled by the firm in a private debt fund investment. Athena is the family investment vehicle of Richard Caruso, who founded Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caruso said he was pleased with the decision, but declined further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA, Wall Street's industry funded watchdog, also runs the arbitration forum where investors and their brokerages typically agree to resolve their arbitration disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is rare for the courts to overturn FINRA arbitration rulings, say lawyers. Arbitration rulings are typically binding, but parties may ask courts to overturn them in limited circumstances, such as when an arbitrator is biased. Parties who are successful at overturning their securities arbitration awards must present their arbitration cases again in FINRA's forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a rare step in a really unique case," said Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago-based securities arbitration lawyer. "The court reached the common sense conclusion it had to," said Stoltmann, who was not involved in the Goldman case, but who typically represents investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the three arbitrators who heard the case between Goldman and Athena, Demetrio Timban, had been indicted by the state of New Jersey for practicing law without a license, although charges were later dropped under a state program to deal with nonviolent offenses. He was also reprimanded by a Michigan regulator for the New Jersey incident and passing $18,000 in bad checks. FINRA did not learn of Timban's troubles until months after the case started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A disclosure Timban sent to the parties about his indictment was misleading, Athena alleged, because it described his law practice violations as a one-time incident when Timban was actually running an office in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athena also alleged that Timban did not participate in deciding the case because his signature did not appear on the award along with those of the two other arbitrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there is "no evidence" that FINRA took action to remove Timban from the case after learning of his troubles, the court wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A FINRA spokeswoman did not immediately return a call or respond to an email requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA rules "clearly entitled (Athena) to a panel composed of at least three qualified arbitrators," Judge Joyner wrote in a 19 page opinion. Athena's rights were prejudiced by Timban's behavior and, as a consequence, a "mutual, final and definite award was not made," Judge Joyner wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn; Editing by Linda Stern and Chris Gallagher)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vanity Fair has timed the publication of its latest 11,000-word Michael Lewis opus perfectly to coincide with Fabrice Tourre being found liable on six counts of misleading investors while he worked at Goldman Sachs. Lewis also profiles a former Goldman employee charged with serious misdeeds; in his case, its Sergei Aleynikov. And in both cases  Aleynikov and Tourre  the government ended up in a position of overstretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big difference between the two cases is that while Tourre was defended by Goldman Sachs, Aleynikov was prosecuted by them: Lewis leaves the reader in no doubt that the decision to prosecute, along with all the supporting arguments, while nominally taken by the FBI, was essentially made by Goldman Sachs itself. The irony is painful: the government, acting against Goldman Sachs, could only manage a civil prosecution. But Goldman Sachs, acting through the government, managed to secure itself a highly-dubious criminal prosecution, complete with an eight-year prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis doesnt delve too deeply into the jurisprudence here. But its obvious that the case would never have been brought without Goldmans aggressive attempt to cause as much personal destruction as possible to Aleynikov  and its also obvious that Aleynikov neither meant nor caused any harm to Goldman whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has consistently attempted to paint Aleynikov as a stealer of valuable secrets  but if anything in Goldmans high-frequency trading code was valuable, it was Goldmans trading strategies, and Aleynikov had zero interest in those. Whats more, he wasnt interested in the code itself, a big buggy mess which he was happy to leave behind: his new job was to build an entirely new system from scratch, in a completely different computer language to that used at Goldman. All that Aleynikov did, in substance, was to email to himself a bunch of files which included open-source code he had managed to find, over the years, online. He thought it might come in handy, one day, but it never really did: most of the files, when they were seized, were unopened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Aleynikovs prosecution is a depressing one  one of the experts Lewis assembled to judge the coders claims was literally nauseated by the banks actions. The story is pretty simple: there are smart HFT shops, and then theres Goldman Sachs. The smart shops execute their strategies using lightweight, open-source, flexible code. Goldman, by contrast, considers its enormous, clunky, proprietary codebase to be a source of competitive advantage  it has to, in order to justify the bonuses it gives to the people in charge of that codebase. Goldman knew that Aleynikov was its best programmer, but it never really grokked why he was good: he was an expert at replacing clunky Goldman code with much simpler and more elegant open-source solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while Aleynikov thought he was streamlining Goldmans technology, Aleynikovs bosses got million-dollar bonuses by claiming that he was adding to a proprietary codebase in which they placed enormous value. And when Aleynikov thought that he was simply emailing his own notes to himself, Goldman decided that he was stealing proprietary information of enormous value  and that, since it was enormously valuable, of course Aleynikov intended to use that code against Goldman in his new job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, maybe thats the charitable explanation, and the real explanation is just that Goldman lost their star programmer, and reacted with violent petulance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, Im increasingly coming to the conclusion that Americas system of jurisprudence simply isnt up to the task of holding banks and bankers accountable for their actions. The only people who ever get prosecuted are small fry and insider traders, rather than the people who really caused the biggest damage. And the lesson of Sergei Aleynikov is that if and when the laws get beefed up, the banks will simply end up taking advantage of those laws for their own vindictive purposes, rather than becoming victims of them. Given the ease with which Goldman got the FBI to do its bidding, one has to assume that, most of the time, the government will be working on the same side as the big banks, rather than working against them. Do we really want to give those banks ever more powerful weapons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors in small-cap funds may be in for a big surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many portfolio managers hold heavyweight stocks like Verizon Communications, Boeing and Pfizer in funds that claim to focus almost exclusively on shares of small-capitalization companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, 211 out of the 476 actively managed small-cap funds tracked by Lipper own companies with market capitalizations of $10 billion or more. That is more than twice the size of companies that Lipper defines as the focus of small-cap funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors in these actively managed funds - which include those from such well-known firms as Gabelli, Charles Schwab and T. Rowe Price - have several reasons to worry, fund experts and financial advisers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, small companies typically outperform over time, because they have greater growth prospects than established large-cap companies whose days of rapid expansion are behind them. That said, large caps may offer dividends and hold up better during downturns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1927 and 2012, for instance, small-cap stocks produced average annual returns of 12.9 percent, compared with a 9.9 percent gain for large companies, according to data from Vanguard. This year, the Russell 2000 index has gained 24 percent since the start of January, compared with a 19.7 percent gain for the large-cap Standard and Poor's 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every dollar in a small-cap fund invested in a mature company like Pfizer - with a market cap of $206 billion - is not going toward what could be its more upwardly mobile competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And second, the presence of big companies in small-cap funds can skew an investor's overall asset allocation, effectively giving extra exposure to large companies. That can increase overall risk by giving investors less diversification than they may think they have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is something I absolutely worry about," said Richard Weeks, a managing director at HighTower Advisors in Vienna, Virginia who oversees $800 million in client assets, and carefully balances the assets in his portfolios. "The only way I can try to have a risk managed portfolio is to construct a diversified group of different assets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STYLE DRIFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say that small-cap funds are particularly vulnerable to the phenomenon known as style drift - going far afield of their mandates. Part of the reason is that small-cap companies are more likely to become large-caps than vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any good small-cap stock will become a mid-cap stock in time, and managers may not want to sell out of what they see as good companies just because their market caps increased," said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S Capital IQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T. Rowe Price's New Horizons fund, for instance, has its largest weighting in Netflix, whose market-cap has swelled from about $5.4 billion at the start of the year to $14.3 billion as its shares have rallied 164 percent. The fund has returned an annualized 15.6 percent over the last five years, putting it in the top 1 percent among small-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even with that strong performance, "the risk for investors is double dipping, and you have an overlap in your holdings," Rosenbluth added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors who are concerned about overlap can check the fund's holdings through fund trackers like Lipper and Morningstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Horizons fund, for instance, has nearly 7 percent of its assets in large companies, according to Morningstar, compared with an average stake of 0.5 percent among other small-cap growth funds. The Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund, by comparison, has 0.3 percent of its assets in large companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much style drift can be a worrisome sign, says Marcin Kacperczyk, an assistant professor at New York University's Stern School of Business who studies mutual funds. Though some managers end up with big company stocks because of short-term liquidity issues, "it's a big red flag that makes you wonder what else the manager is doing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMALL-CAP HEAVYWEIGHTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most small-cap funds give their managers some leeway to hold companies with market caps greater than $3 billion, to give them time to sell out of a position or as a place to park cash while shopping for small-cap stocks. These funds can present challenges when they grow too large, effectively hamstringing a portfolio manager who doesn't have enough good ideas to invest in without becoming a majority owner in a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But small-cap fund managers say that there are other reasons why giant companies end up in their portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some blame it on so-called legacy positions, in which a fund is left with a large-cap holding when shares of a small-cap company that the fund owns is later acquired by the large cap. The $2.8 billion Gabelli small-cap Growth Fund, for instance, holds 37,584 shares of Verizon, an approximately $1.8 million stake that makes up about 0.1 percent of its assets. The fund has held Verizon, now with a $144 billion market cap, since 2000 after the telecom giant purchased fund holding Price Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabelli would not comment on why the fund has held the position for so long or if it plans on selling it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $12.2 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons fund, meanwhile, owns 25,814 shares of Priceline.com, a $21.3 million stake that represents about 0.2 percent of assets. The fund originally owned shares in Kayak before the company was bought by Priceline.com in late 2012. Priceline's market cap is now $44.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others say their funds have been miscategorized by fund trackers like Lipper, which is owned by Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Barone, the head of the Ancora Group, said that his $10.1 million Ancora Special Opportunity fund owns Pfizer and Citigroup because it was "never intended to be a small-cap fund" but is nevertheless categorized as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipper, for its part, defines a small-cap fund as one that holds 75 percent of its assets or more in companies with market caps of $4.7 billion or less. Small-cap index funds, by comparison, tend to hew to the weighting of the Russell 2000 benchmark, which does not contain any companies with market caps greater than $8 billion. So those funds may hold larger companies on average but don't hold any $200 billion behemoths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipper reviews a fund's classification twice a year, and allows funds to request a category change every time they send in a new set of holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Linda Stern and Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

			Portland General Electric Announces Second Quarter Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR)
			today reported a net 
      loss of $22 million, or 29 cents per diluted share, for the second 
      quarter of 2013. This compares with net income of $26 million, or 34 
      cents per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2012. Results for the 
      quarter were driven by several factors, including the suspension of the 
      Cascade Crossing Transmission Project and increased operating and 
      maintenance expense related to the company&#8217;s generation plants and 
      distribution system. The increase in operating and maintenance expense 
      is in-line with full-year expectations of $440 million to $460 million 
      for 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Although several factors impacted our operating and financial 
      performance this quarter, our outlook for 2014 and beyond is positive,&#8221; 
      said Jim Piro, president and chief executive officer. &#8220;We are moving 
      forward on our three new generation projects, have reached substantial 
      settlement on our 2014 General Rate Case and have successfully completed 
      debt and equity financings, positioning the company for strong 
      operations and growth over the next few years.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Company updates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				General Rate Case&#8212;PGE filed a 2014 General Rate Case in 
        mid-February and has reached settlement with OPUC staff and 
        interveners on all items except pension expense. Stipulating parties 
        have settled on an allowed ROE of 9.75 percent, a capital structure of 
        50 percent debt and 50 percent equity, and an average rate base of 
        $3.1 billion. The stipulated items, along with recently filed updates 
        of power costs and the load forecast, result in a revised increase of 
        $79 million in annual revenue requirement.
      
			
				Generating Projects&#8212;On June 3, PGE announced the completion of 
        the competitive bidding process for baseload and renewable generation 
        plants. PGE has entered into an agreement for the construction of a 
        new 440 MW natural gas-fired baseload plant called Carty, to be built 
        by a third party next to the Boardman coal plant. On August 1, PGE 
        closed on an agreement to acquire development rights for the 
        construction of a new 267 MW wind farm, which the company will now 
        call Tucannon River Wind Farm. In addition, PGE has begun construction 
        on Port Westward Unit 2, the 220 MW natural gas-fired capacity 
        resource announced earlier this year. Together, these three projects 
        represent an investment of approximately $1.3 billion (excluding AFDC) 
        and are scheduled to come online in 2015 and 2016.
      
			
				Cascade Crossing&#8212;On June 3, PGE announced a new non-binding 
        memorandum of understanding with Bonneville Power Administration. 
        Under this MOU, the parties will explore a transmission capacity 
        option whereby BPA could provide PGE with ownership of approximately 
        1,500 MW in transmission capacity, in exchange for certain PGE assets, 
        investments and/or PGE transfer capabilities to BPA. Timing and costs 
        of potential options under the MOU will need to be clarified through 
        further discussions and are contingent upon reaching a definitive 
        agreement with BPA. As a result of the changed conditions reflected in 
        the MOU, PGE suspended permitting and development of Cascade Crossing 
        and charged $52 million of capitalized costs related to Cascade 
        Crossing to expense in the second quarter of 2013.
      
			
				Equity Financing&#8212;On June 11, PGE completed a public offering of 
        12,765,000 shares of common stock at an offering price per share of 
        $29.50. 11,100,000 shares were offered pursuant to a forward sale 
        transaction and are expected to be issued over a two-year period 
        ending June 11, 2015. The remaining 1,665,000 shares were issued in 
        June. Proceeds from the offering will be used for capital 
        expenditures, debt repayment and general corporate purposes.
      
			
				Debt Financing&#8212;On June 27, PGE agreed to issue $225 million of 
        4.47% series First Mortgage Bonds in the private placement market. The 
        bonds consist of $150 million due in 2044, which were issued in June, 
        and $75 million due in 2043, which are expected to be issued in 
        August. This financing will support capital expenditures, debt 
        repayment and general corporate purposes.
      
			
				Credit Ratings Upgrade&#8212;On June 28, Moody&#8217;s Investor Service 
        upgraded the long-term ratings of the company. The issuer rating 
        improved from &#8216;Baa2.&#8217; to &#8216;Baa1&#8217; and the First Mortgage Bonds improved 
        from &#8216;A3&#8217; to &#8216;A2.&#8217; The credit rating upgrades reflect a constructive 
        regulatory environment with the timely recovery of prudently incurred 
        costs, and a strong and stable financial profile with adequate 
        liquidity to support a significant construction cycle.
      
			
				Generating Plant Outages&#8212;As disclosed on July 15, the Boardman 
        and Colstrip Unit 4 coal plants went offline at the beginning of July 
        due to specific equipment failures.

        
					
            Boardman, of which PGE owns 65%, experienced a thermal hammer 
            event in the cold reheat line causing structural damage, and came 
            back online July 31, 2013.
          
					
            Colstrip Unit 4, of which PGE owns 20%, experienced vibration and 
            rotor issues. PGE is working closely with PPL Montana, the 
            operator of the facility, to assess the damage and necessary 
            repairs. Colstrip is expected to be offline for the remainder of 
            2013.
          
				
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company estimates 2013 replacement power costs for the two plants 
      combined to be between $10 and $12 million. The estimated repair costs 
      are expected to be approximately $10 million for Boardman and $30 to $40 
      million for Colstrip Unit 4. Insurance recovery of repair costs is 
      subject to a $2.5 million deductible at each plant; insurance carriers 
      have been notified of potential claims.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Second quarter operating results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenues decreased $10 million, or 2 percent, to $403 million in 
      the second quarter of 2013 from $413 million in the second quarter of 
      2012 primarily due to the net effect of the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        $10 million decrease in average retail price primarily driven by lower 
        power costs as established in the 2013 annual power cost update tariff;
      
			
        $9 million decrease related to an industrial customer refund recorded 
        in the second quarter of 2013 for a billing error covering a period of 
        several years; and
      
			
        $2 million decrease related to lower volume of retail energy sold and 
        delivered, with total volume down approximately 1 percent from the 
        second quarter of 2012 largely as a result of warmer weather during 
        the second quarter of 2013. Residential and industrial volumes were 
        down 3 percent and 1 percent, respectively, which were offset by a 2 
        percent increase in commercial volumes; partially offset by
      
			
        $12 million, or 133 percent, increase in wholesale revenues consisting 
        of a 101 percent increase in the average price of wholesale power and 
        a 10 percent increase in the volume sold.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Purchased power and fuel expense for the second quarter of 2013 was 
      comparable to the second quarter of 2012. A decrease primarily due to 
      more generation from lower-cost coal-fired resources was substantially 
      offset by decreases in the volume of purchased power and energy received 
      from hydro resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Production and distribution expense increased $13 million, or 25 
      percent, in the second quarter of 2013 compared with the second quarter 
      of 2012, primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs related 
      to the company&#8217;s generating plants and distribution system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cascade Crossing transmission project consists of $52 million of costs 
      charged to expense in the second quarter of 2013 that were previously 
      capitalized in connection with this project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other income, net increased $2 million in the second quarter of 2013 
      compared with the second quarter of 2012, primarily due to higher 
      earnings from non-qualified benefit plan trust assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interest expense decreased $2 million, or 7 percent, in the second 
      quarter of 2013 compared with the second quarter of 2012, primarily due 
      to the redemption of $100 million of first mortgage bonds in October 
      2012 and $50 million in April 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Income tax benefit was $11 million in the second quarter of 2013 
      compared with income tax expense of $9 million in the second quarter of 
      2012. The change is primarily due to the decrease in the annual 
      estimated pre-tax income for 2013 compared to 2012, which was driven by 
      costs expensed related to Cascade Crossing and an industrial customer 
      refund recorded in 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2013 earnings guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PGE is reducing full-year 2013 earnings guidance to $1.25 to $1.40 per 
      diluted share. This is a $0.10 decrease from the June 3 guidance 
      revision of $1.35 to $1.50, driven by $10-12 million of estimated 
      replacement power costs for the Boardman and Colstrip coal plant 
      outages. This revised guidance also includes the following assumptions:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Energy deliveries comparable to weather-adjusted 2012;
      
			
        Normal hydro conditions and wind conditions in line with expectations;
      
			
        Ongoing operating and maintenance costs between $440 million and $460 
        million;
      
			
        Depreciation expense between $240 million and $250 million; and
      
			
        Capital expenditures between $710 million and $730 million.

      On 30 July 2013, Vodafone Vierte Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH (whose 
      change of legal form into a German stock corporation under the company 
      name Vodafone Vierte Verwaltungs AG has been resolved upon), D&#252;sseldorf, 
      Germany (the "Bidder"), published the offer document for its 
      voluntary public takeover offer (the "Takeover
			Offer") 
      to the shareholders of Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, Unterf&#246;hring, 
      Germany ("Target Company"), to acquire all non-par value 
      bearer shares (ISIN DE000KD88880) in the Target Company (collectively 
      the &#8220;KDH Shares&#8220; and individually "KDH Share"). The 
      acceptance period for the Offer expires on 11 September 2013, 24:00&#160;hrs 
      (local time at Frankfurt am Main, Germany), unless extended pursuant to 
      the statutory provisions of the Wp&#220;G.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On 1&#160;August&#160;2013, Vodafone&#160;Group Plc, Newbury, England (&#8220;Vodafone&#8221;), 
      a person acting jointly with the Bidder within the meaning of 
      section&#160;2&#160;para.&#160;5 Wp&#220;G, has purchased 285 KDH Shares outside the 
      Takeover Offer via the stock exchange against payment of a cash 
      consideration. The average purchase price per KDH Share amounted to EUR 
      84.45. The highest purchase price per KDH Share was EUR 84.45. These KDH 
      Shares correspond to approximately 0.0003% of the share capital and the 
      voting rights of the Target Company. Title to these KDH Shares will 
      presumably be transferred to Vodafone on 5&#160;August&#160;2013.

      business model similar to Walter Investment.

      Company&#8217;s internal controls were not effective; (3) the Company&#8217;s

      Company had failed to disclose material weaknesses in the internal 
      controls of RMS; (5) the Company had overstated the value of its recent 
      acquisition, RMS; and (6) as a result of the foregoing, the Company&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Northern California city of Richmond on Friday sued Chevron Corp, saying the company was willfully negligent in a massive refinery fire and a smoke cloud last year that sent thousands of people to hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richmond city officials filed the lawsuit in Contra Costa Superior Court seeking unspecified damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health workers, environmental and community groups planned to rally in Richmond on Saturday in advance of the one-year anniversary of the August 6 fire.

At least 15,000 people went to hospitals with respiratory complaints in the hours and days after the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By January, Chevron said it had paid $10 million in claims connected to the blaze, with over 23,300 claims made, according to a letter from Chevron to a local health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitre said the city waited a year to sue Chevron because it first attempted to negotiate with the company.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Aug 2 (Reuters) - The Northern California
city of Richmond on Friday sued Chevron Corp, saying the company
was willfully negligent in a massive refinery fire and a smoke

of pipe corrosions and delayed repairs and inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also stated that the fire was not unavoidable and

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Aug 5 (Reuters) - A U.S. class action alleging
an illegal agreement to inflate aluminium prices may be just the
start of aluminium buyers' legal assault against warehouse
owners such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc, lawyers with antitrust
expertise said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, other warehouse owners and the London Metal
Exchange were named as defendants in the lawsuit filed last week
alleging anticompetitive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and LME owner HKEx said the suit was meritless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit fits a pattern of 'follow-on' class actions
typically filed after the U.S. Justice Department or other
government authority opens an investigation, lawyers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Antitrust exposure is not limited merely to government
enforcement but also to private enforcement," said Daniel Sokol,
who writes about competition and antitrust law at the University
of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exposure is significant, Sokol added, because damages
for price-fixing are tripled under U.S. law if a defendant is
found liable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers and U.S. lawmakers have accused Goldman and other
warehouse owners of artificially inflating waiting times to
boost rents for warehouse owners and lift metal prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criticism of banks that own commodity assets and trade raw
materials has ratcheted up after the U.S. Department of Justice
started what sources said was a preliminary probe into the
metals warehousing industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class action so soon after the revelation of a government
inquiry has at least two purposes, lawyers said: to jockey for a
lead position among the many class action lawyers who may
eventually sue, and to be in a position to benefit if
information leaks about the government's probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Justice Department has a way of shaking the tree and
getting information that otherwise wouldn't be available," said
Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private plaintiffs such as the one who filed the class
action - aluminium-buyer Superior Extrusion Inc - generally have
limited means to find out new information until their suit
progresses much further. Unlike the government, they do not have
subpoena power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts have said the Justice Department would launch
an official investigation only if it found evidence of true
collusion or monopolistic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'EXTREME MONOPOLY' ALLEGED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superior Extrusion filed its suit on Aug. 1 in U.S. District
Court in Detroit. The suit also targets "John Does": any other
warehouse owner that may have participated in the alleged
price-fixing conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit said that warehouse owners realized "extraordinary
revenues from inefficiencies and deadweight restraints on the
economy," reflecting their "extreme monopoly pricing power and
abusive agreements in very unreasonable restraint of trade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and HKEx are fighting the claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this suit is without merit and we intend to
vigorously contest it," a Goldman Sachs spokesman said. "I would
also note that aluminium prices are down 40 percent from their
peak in 2006," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HKEx said: "LME management's initial assessment is that the
suit is without merit and LME will contest it vigorously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's financial watchdog is also investigating the LME's
warehousing system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman on Wednesday tried to diffuse years of frustration
over long waiting times and inflated prices at metals warehouses
across the world, by offering immediate access to aluminium for
end users holding metal at its Metro warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman President Gary Cohn told CNBC television on
Wednesday that no consumers had stepped forward to take up the
offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the class action said it was curious that
Goldman waited until Wednesday to make its offer, after years of
complaints. "Goldman's professed feeling and promises are
contrary to defendants' conduct from 2010 until July 2013," the
suit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London Metal Exchange aluminium for three months delivery
 closed on Friday at $1,809 per tonne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warehouse owners and outgoing LME CEO Martin Abbott have
said complaints over long lines are unjustified, arguing there
is no shortage of metal.&lt;/p&gt;

citations of willful neglect to Chevron's Richmond refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for Chevron did not immediately return a
call or email seeking comment on the protest and lawsuit on
Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 15,000 people went to hospitals with respiratory
complaints in the hours and days after the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Keystone XL pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels a day
of crude from Canada's oil sands and the Bakken shale in North
Dakota and Montana to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama's administration is expected to
decide whether to approve the pipeline by early 2014.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp agreed to pay $2 million in fines and restitution after pleading no contest to six misdemeanor charges on Monday stemming from the August 6, 2012 explosion and fire at its San Francisco Bay refinery, according to the local district attorney&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a plea agreement worked out before Monday with the California attorney general's office and the Contra Costa County district attorney, Chevron will also spend 3-1/2 years on probation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are committed to continuous improvement in process safety and reliability at the refinery," Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contra Costa County District Attorney Mark Peterson said Chevron's cooperation was key to Monday's agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The criminal case achieves our goals of holding Chevron accountable for their conduct, protecting the public, and ensuring a safer work environment at the refinery," Peterson said in statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This historic resolution is also possible due to Chevron's commitment to do more than what is required by law in order to help ensure nothing like this ever happens again," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an arraignment Monday in the California Superior Court in Martinez, California, Chevron pleaded no contest to charges of failing to maintain equipment in safe working order in addition to labor codes and environmental violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is continuing an inspection of 16,000 individual piping components, Chevron spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are also implementing a multimillion-dollar expansion of our air monitoring system to include several sites in the surrounding communities," Ritchie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Richmond, where the 245,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery is located, is suing Chevron over the fire as are hundreds of Bay-area residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, 1,000 people protested outside the refinery in Richmond and 200 were arrested by police for trespassing on Chevron property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The August 6, 2012 fire began as firefighters at the Richmond refinery were attempting to find the source of a leak in piping on the refinery's crude distillation unit, which does most of the refining of crude oil at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No workers were killed and a few minor injuries were reported among Chevron employees, but the resulting blaze sent a gigantic plume of black smoke over the Bay area. In the following days, over 15,000 area residents appeared at local hospitals complaining of respiratory distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crude distillation unit was shut for nine months of repairs and gasoline production was cut by at least 50 percent during that time, the company has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron reported $26.2 billion in earnings for 2012, down 3 percent from $26.9 billion in 2011. Last week the company reported second-quarter net income of $5.4 billion, down from $7.2 billion a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the $2 million in fines and restitution, Chevron has paid more than $10 million to affected community members and local government agencies for incident response and medical-related costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kristen Hays; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Jeffrey Goldfarb and Grace Dai
The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney boss Bob Iger has another Pixar hit on his hands. &#8220;Monsters University&#8221; should provide an eighth consecutive animated lift to Disney&#8217;s bottom line when it reports quarterly results on Tuesday. The upcoming &#8220;Planes,&#8221; derived from Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Cars,&#8221; is bound to be a success, too. But a Breakingviews analysis suggests the studio&#8217;s value to the Magic Kingdom falls short of the $7.4 billion purchase price. High-priced deals for Marvel and Lucasfilm may also disappoint investors in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorting out Disney&#8217;s relationship with Pixar was one of the first things on Iger&#8217;s agenda when he took over in 2005 and remains a hallmark of his tenure. Their lucrative co-production and distribution deal was on the rocks after Pixar Chief Executive Steve Jobs clashed with Iger&#8217;s predecessor Michael Eisner. The successful Weinstein brothers also were expected to decamp. Disney&#8217;s own storied cartoon shop was struggling. The whole movie division was in trouble. Allowing Pixar to fall into a rival&#8217;s hands only would have further weakened the company&#8217;s position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying Pixar was practically a necessity, one that brought more than just technology and a small library that included &#8220;Finding Nemo.&#8221; Jobs became Disney&#8217;s biggest shareholder and a director. Pixar&#8217;s creative force, John Lasseter, also infused Disney with a fresh spark. To acquire all that from a position of weakness, Disney paid over the odds at an estimated 45 times earnings when the deal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney says Pixar&#8217;s value &#8220;far exceeds&#8221; the acquisition price calculated using &#8220;net present value&#8221; across its businesses. Absent more specifics, the statement requires a certain amount of wishing upon a star. Begin in the theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Box Office Mojo, &#8220;Toy Story 3,&#8221; &#8220;Brave&#8221; and the other films have generated some $4.5 billion in ticket receipts worldwide. Margins generally clock in at about 10 percent. Generously assume Disney makes 15 percent, and that&#8217;s $675 million of pre-tax profit over the seven years to 2012, excluding the still-developing &#8220;Monsters University.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer products are the second-biggest source of revenue. Some Pixar flicks, like critically-acclaimed &#8220;Up,&#8221; may not lend themselves well to toys and T-shirts, but others like &#8220;Cars&#8221; certainly do. Princesses, pirates and Mickey Mouse and his pals are still big sellers. Pixar films account for 12 percent of Disney&#8217;s lifetime box-office revenue, including oldies like &#8220;The Little Mermaid&#8221; and &#8220;Aladdin.&#8221; Suppose they represent the same percentage of merchandise sales. At a 25 percent margin, that would mean some $580 million of profit before tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DVDs are another big contributor. Using estimates by research firm The Numbers and an industry standard 50 percent profit margin, this form of home entertainment has reaped around $575 million. Finally, if income from broadcast and pay television, along with streaming video, amounts to 20 percent of total box office &#8211; a figure based loosely on estimates by analysts for other film franchises and studios &#8211; that would translate into $900 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tot it all up and the average annual profit from Pixar, excluding &#8220;Monsters University,&#8221; has been about $390 million. If accurate, that&#8217;s an impressive 60 percent more than the pre-tax income Pixar generated in the year before selling itself. Subtract the 33 percent that goes to Uncle Sam, however, and put the after-tax figure on the 20 multiple of earnings at which Disney trades, and Pixar would still only be worth around $5.2 billion, or about two-thirds of what Disney paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn&#8217;t account for any extra allure Pixar characters and rides may bring to Disney&#8217;s theme parks. It&#8217;s hard to gauge the impact, especially considering the related costs that are attached to revamping these properties. Disney last year, for example, wrapped up a $1 billion renovation of its California Adventure park with new Pixar-themed rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After taking all that into consideration, though, shareholders seem to be under a spell, believing Disney &#8211; and Iger &#8211; can work magic through acquisitions. Another $8 billion has been splashed out on Marvel and its superheroes &#8211; again at some 40 times earnings &#8211; and Lucasfilm&#8217;s &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; franchise. Disney nevertheless still regularly trades at a stock market valuation higher than those of its competitors. Suspension of disbelief is part of what Disney sells, but investors shouldn&#8217;t so easily fall for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA (Reuters) - Coca cultivation in Bolivia, the world's third-biggest cocaine producer after Peru and Colombia, fell for the second consecutive year in 2012 as the government stepped up eradication efforts, official data released on Monday showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of coca leaves, which can be used to make cocaine, also declined, according to an annual survey compiled by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Bolivian government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultivation of coca bushes fell by around 7 percent to roughly 25,300 hectares, following a 12 percent drop in 2011, the survey found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonino De Leo, UNODC representative in Bolivia, said government-led eradication efforts as well as dialogue with farmers and social incentives had helped curb the crop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Bolivian authorities should keep reducing coca crop surpluses by enhancing alternatives for farmers and strengthening counter-narcotics enforcement programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government eradicated some 11,000 hectares of coca crop last year, up 5 percent from the 2011 figure. The potential coca leaf yield stood at around 45,000 metric tons, down 6 percent from the previous year's total, the survey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca leaf prices fell 5 percent, fetching $7.40 per kg in the country's two authorized markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolivians have chewed raw coca leaves for centuries as a mild stimulant that reduces hunger and altitude sickness. Growing coca is not illegal in Bolivia but the government aims to eradicate excess crops that could be diverted to illicit markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Evo Morales, himself a former coca leaf farmer, says the plant offers health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seizures of cocaine base rose 13 percent to around 32 tons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Shields; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIVERHEAD, N.Y., Aug. 5, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Suffolk Bancorp (the "Company") (Nasdaq:SUBK), parent company of Suffolk County National Bank (the "Bank"), today announced that the Bank sold 50,000 shares of its Visa, Inc. ("Visa") Class B common stock at a pre-tax gain of approximately $3.8 million. Given the significant rise in the price of Visa common stock over the past twelve months, the Bank thought it prudent to monetize the gain of a portion of the Class B shares it holds in portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Bank was issued 226,016 shares of Visa Class B common stock in the initial public offering of Visa in 2008. Of those shares, 87,378 were redeemed in connection with the initial public offering. After the current sale, the Company will continue to hold 88,638 Class B shares. The Class B shares are reflected on the Company's balance sheet at zero due to certain pending litigation against Visa, as described below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Visa Class B shareholders are obligated to fund a litigation escrow until such time as the litigation pending against Visa is finally determined. This obligation is satisfied by changes to the conversion ratio of Class B shares as measured against shares of Visa Class A common stock. Currently, that conversion ratio is .4206 of the Visa Class A shares. The Company will retain the risk of changes to the litigation escrow for the shares sold. The Company has established a reserve of approximately $0.5 million in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Corporate Information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Suffolk Bancorp is a one-bank holding company engaged in the commercial banking business through the Suffolk County National Bank, a full service commercial bank headquartered in Riverhead, New York and Suffolk Bancorp's wholly owned subsidiary. Organized in 1890, the Bank has 30 branch offices in Suffolk County, New York. For more information about the Bank and its products and services, please visit www.scnb.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

	This press release includes statements that look to the future. These can include remarks about the Company, the banking industry, the economy in general, expectations of the business environment in which the Company operates, projections of future performance, and potential future credit experience. These remarks are based upon current management expectations, and may, therefore, involve risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted or quantified and are beyond the Company's control and are subject to a variety of uncertainties that could cause future results to vary materially from the Company's historical performance, or from current expectations. These remarks may be identified by such forward-looking statements as "should," "expect," "believe," "view," "opportunity," "allow," "continues," "reflects," "typically," "usually," "anticipate," or similar statements or variations of such terms. Factors that could affect the Company include particularly, but are not limited to: a failure by the Company to meet the deadlines under SEC rules for filing its periodic reports (or any permitted extension thereof); increased capital requirements mandated by the Company's regulators; the Company's ability to raise capital; changes in interest rates; increases or decreases in retail and commercial economic activity in the Company's market area; variations in the ability and propensity of consumers and businesses to borrow, repay, or deposit money, or to use other banking and financial services; results of regulatory examinations; any failure by the Company to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; larger-than-expected losses from the sale of assets; potential litigation or regulatory action relating to the matters resulting in the Company's failure to file on time its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2011 or resulting from the revisions to earnings previously announced on April 12, 2011 or the restatement of its financial statements for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2010 and year ended December 31, 2010; and the potential that net charge-offs are higher than expected or for further increases in our provision for loan losses. Further, it could take the Company longer than anticipated to implement its strategic plans to increase revenue and manage non-interest expense, or it may not be possible to implement those plans at all. Finally, new and unanticipated legislation, regulation, or accounting standards may require the Company to change its practices in ways that materially change the results of operations.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Gothenburg, August 5 2013Cryptzone, the IT security and threat mitigation specialist, exhibiting at SharePoint Fest&#160;in Washington DC this week, today released version 4.14 of its Simple Encryption Platform (SEP) Client, delivering improved support for Microsoft software technologies, including Microsoft SharePoint 2013, Outlook 2013 and Windows 8. The integrated encryption platform enables organizations to secure digital information assets wherever they are stored or distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;New and Improved Client Functionality for SEP modules&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				&lt;p&gt;Proxy support for SharePoint communication with &#160;Secured eCollaboration required in enterprise installations;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
				&lt;p&gt;Superior email encryption for Microsoft Outlook 2013;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
				&lt;p&gt;Better graphics display and support for portable devices using Windows 8;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
			
				&lt;p&gt;Office 365 and Exchange 2013 support for email encryption.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;The Cryptzone release of the SEP Server 4.14 and Secured eCollaboration incorporates new concepts and feature improvements inspired by feedback from enterprise customers. They include a simpler automated installation process, user interface enhancements and an SDK, making it possible for the first time, to integrate other document classification systems into Secured eCollaboration for SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;New and Improved Server Functionality for Secured eCollaboration&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				&lt;p&gt;Windows Powershell&#174; installation script: The installation of Secured eCollaboration has been simplified through the introduction of a Windows Powershell&#174; installation script for SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013. Automating this process with more advanced and intelligent logic reduces the potential for administration errors during installation.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
		
		
			
				&lt;p&gt;SDK developer toolkit: The new SDK enables developers to write custom conditions for Secured eCollaboration, so that a custom condition can be integrated with external/third party document classification systems, enabling them to more precisely influence the data classification process.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
		
		
			
				&lt;p&gt;New signature based file type detection engine: A new signature based file type detection engine has been added, which automatically identifies document content type based on its internal structures to prevent anyone from overriding the security controls set to regulate any given file format. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
		
		
			
				&lt;p&gt;Improved block-checkin: Enhanced capabilities have been introduced for content checking even for encrypted content.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;"Cryptzone has consistently delivered encryption solutions that transparently integrate within enterprise networks." says Anders Hansson, Product Portfolio Manager at Cryptzone. "As a Microsoft Gold Partner, it is important that Cryptzone's development roadmap responds to changes in Microsoft software technologies." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. class action alleging an illegal agreement to inflate aluminum prices may be just the start of aluminum buyers' legal assault against warehouse owners such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc, lawyers with antitrust expertise said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman (GS.N), other warehouse owners and the London Metal Exchange were named as defendants in the lawsuit filed last week alleging anticompetitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and LME owner HKEx said the suit was meritless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit fits a pattern of 'follow-on' class actions typically filed after the U.S. Justice Department or other government authority opens an investigation, lawyers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Antitrust exposure is not limited merely to government enforcement but also to private enforcement," said Daniel Sokol, who writes about competition and antitrust law at the University of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exposure is significant, Sokol added, because damages for price-fixing are tripled under U.S. law if a defendant is found liable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers and U.S. lawmakers have accused Goldman and other warehouse owners of artificially inflating waiting times to boost rents for warehouse owners and lift metal prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criticism of banks that own commodity assets and trade raw materials has ratcheted up after the U.S. Department of Justice started what sources said was a preliminary probe into the metals warehousing industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class action so soon after the revelation of a government inquiry has at least two purposes, lawyers said: to jockey for a lead position among the many class action lawyers who may eventually sue, and to be in a position to benefit if information leaks about the government's probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Justice Department has a way of shaking the tree and getting information that otherwise wouldn't be available," said Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private plaintiffs such as the one who filed the class action - aluminum-buyer Superior Extrusion Inc - generally have limited means to find out new information until their suit progresses much further. Unlike the government, they do not have subpoena power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts have said the Justice Department would launch an official investigation only if it found evidence of true collusion or monopolistic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'EXTREME MONOPOLY' ALLEGED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superior Extrusion filed its suit on August 1 in U.S. District Court in Detroit. The suit also targets "John Does": any other warehouse owner that may have participated in the alleged price-fixing conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit said that warehouse owners realized "extraordinary revenues from inefficiencies and deadweight restraints on the economy," reflecting their "extreme monopoly pricing power and abusive agreements in very unreasonable restraint of trade."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and HKEx are fighting the claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this suit is without merit and we intend to vigorously contest it," a Goldman Sachs spokesman said. "I would also note that aluminum prices are down 40 percent from their peak in 2006," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HKEx said: "LME management's initial assessment is that the suit is without merit and LME will contest it vigorously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's financial watchdog is also investigating the LME's warehousing system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman on Wednesday tried to diffuse years of frustration over long waiting times and inflated prices at metals warehouses across the world, by offering immediate access to aluminum for end users holding metal at its Metro warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman President Gary Cohn told CNBC television on Wednesday that no consumers had stepped forward to take up the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the class action said it was curious that Goldman waited until Wednesday to make its offer, after years of complaints. "Goldman's professed feeling and promises are contrary to defendants' conduct from 2010 until July 2013," the suit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London Metal Exchange aluminum for three months delivery closed on Friday at $1,809 per ton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warehouse owners and outgoing LME CEO Martin Abbott have said complaints over long lines are unjustified, arguing there is no shortage of metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Veronica Brown and Josephine Mason; Editing by Joseph Radford)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Second lawsuit in a week against industry players&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Lawsuit filed by small aluminium user in Florida,
individual plaintiff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Melanie Burton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Glencore Xstrata and
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co face a U.S. lawsuit, along with the
London Metal Exchange, alleging they artificially inflated
aluminium prices, in the second legal challenge related to metal
warehousing in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit, which also names Goldman Sachs and
subsidiaries of both Goldman and JP Morgan, accuses the firms of
engaging in anti-trust and racketeering practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest case, filed by Florida-based aluminium user
Master Screens and an individual plaintiff, expands the
geography and number of companies being sued in the unfolding
legal battle over warehousing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan dismissed the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this suit is without merit and we intend to
vigorously contest it. We also note that aluminium prices are
down 40 percent from their peak in 2006," a Goldman Sachs
spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no queues at our warehouses. We believe this suit
has no merit," a JPMorgan spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, owner of
the LME, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glencore could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators are scrutinizing ownership of commodity
storage facilities by major U.S. banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Goldman and the LME were named as defendants in a
separate Detroit lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida lawsuit alleges "manipulation of the aluminium
market through supply price fixing," among other practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, which is seeking class
action status and was filed on Aug. 6 in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Florida, is Master Screens Inc. and
Daniel Price Bart, described in the filing as "a purchaser of
beverages sold in aluminium cans."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co expects to lose between $160 million and $190 million on its expensive summer movie bomb "The Lone Ranger," the media giant said on Tuesday as it reported a small gain in quarterly profit that beat Wall Street forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss for "The Lone Ranger," a Western starring Johnny Depp, will be recorded for the quarter that ends in September, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares dropped 1.9 percent in after-hours trading to $65.79 from a $67.05 close on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lone Ranger" opened July 3 with a dismal $29 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales over its first weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There has been a lot said, I know, about the risk of basically high cost, tent pole films," Disney CEO Bob Iger said, "and we certainly can attest to that given what happened with Lone Ranger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still think the tentpole strategy is a good strategy," he said.

      Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) today announced it 
      earned $11.2 million, or basic net income per share of $1.21, on net 
      sales of $429.0 million for the second quarter of 2013, compared to net 
      income of $10.7 million, or basic net income per share of $1.16, on net 
      sales of $430.7 million for the second quarter of 2012. The results for 
      the second quarter of 2013 included a $0.1 million increase in income 
      tax expense due to the recording of a valuation allowance for certain 
      deferred tax assets and other income tax changes. The results for the 
      second quarter of 2012 included a $0.4 million increase in income tax 
      expense due to the recording of a valuation allowance for certain 
      deferred tax assets and other income tax changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a comparable basis, the Company earned $11.3 million in the second 
      quarter of 2013, or comparable basic net income per share of $1.22, 
      versus $11.1 million in the second quarter of 2012, or comparable basic 
      net income per share of $1.20.

      of after-tax losses ($0.5 million on a pre-tax basis) due to 
      mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges and a $0.3 million net

			a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow 
      investors to more clearly evaluate operating performance and business 
      trends for the first six months of 2013 and 2012. Management uses this 
      information to review results excluding items that are not necessarily 
      indicative of ongoing results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, &#8220;We are pleased to 
      report that despite a very challenging environment for virtually all 
      beverage categories, our earnings per share for the second quarter grew 
      from the prior year. The Company has, and will continue to have, a 
      long-term focus. The benefits of our commitment to reducing our debt 
      over the past decade and strengthening the Company&#8217;s financial position 
      were clearly evident in the second quarter and first half of 2013 as 
      lower interest cost helped to mitigate softer than expected operating 
      results. We will continue to focus our efforts on driving value for our 
      shareholders. As part of our long-term strategy, we continue to work 
      diligently on the potential acquisition of new territories in Eastern 
      Tennessee and Kentucky from The Coca-Cola Company. Our team is making 
      good progress and we continue to be excited about the possibility of 
      bringing these employees and new markets into the Company in late 2014.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hank Flint, President and COO, added, &#8220;The trends we experienced in the 
      second quarter were similar to those in the first quarter with softer 
      than expected volume and revenue. We continued to experience much cooler 
      and wetter weather compared to recent historical patterns, which 
      adversely impacted some of our most important selling periods including 
      the Memorial Day holiday and early summer. Lower than expected revenue 
      was partially offset by lower than projected increases in key raw 
      material components of our cost of sales. Additionally, our SDA 
      expenses were flat for both the second quarter and first half of 2013 as 
      we continue to focus on operating efficiencies. We are prepared for a 
      more favorable selling environment in the second half of 2013, which 
      should allow us to grow revenue and earnings.&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Cautionary Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;

      shareholders; continue to work diligently on the potential acquisition 
      of new territories in Eastern Tennessee and Kentucky and bringing these 
      employees and new markets into the Company in late 2014; continue our

      environment in the second half of 2013 should allow us to grow revenue 
      and earnings.

      benefits; product liability claims or product recalls; technology 
      failures; changes in interest rates; the impact of debt levels on 
      operating flexibility and access to capital and credit markets; adverse 
      changes in our credit rating (whether as a result of our operations or 
      prospects or as a result of those of The Coca-Cola Company or other 
      bottlers in the Coca-Cola system); changes in legal contingencies; 
      legislative changes affecting our distribution and packaging; adoption 
      of significant product labeling or warning requirements; additional 
      taxes resulting from tax audits; natural disasters and unfavorable

      The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today reported earnings for its 
      third fiscal quarter and nine months ended June&#160;29, 2013. Diluted 
      earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter of $1.01 was equal to the 
      prior-year quarter. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, EPS 
      for the quarter increased 2% to $1.03 compared to $1.01 in the 
      prior-year quarter. Diluted EPS for the nine months ended June&#160;29, 2013 
      was $2.61 compared to $2.44 in the prior-year period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We are pleased with the results we delivered in the third quarter," 
      said Robert A. Iger, Chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Company. "We 
      are confident that our strategy of creating high-quality branded content 
      positions us well for the future."

      Operating income at Cable Networks increased $229 million to $2.1 
      billion for the quarter due to growth at ESPN, AE Television Networks 
      (AETN) and the domestic Disney Channels, partially offset by a decrease 
      at ABC Family. Higher operating income at ESPN was due to increased 
      affiliate revenues and, to a lesser extent, higher advertising revenues, 
      partially offset by increased programming and production costs. 
      Increased affiliate revenues at ESPN were due to contractual rate 
      increases and higher recognition of previously deferred revenues related 
      to annual programming commitments. During the quarter, ESPN recognized 
      $274 million of previously deferred revenue compared to $210 million in 
      the prior-year quarter. Growth in ESPN advertising revenues was 
      primarily due to an increase in units sold and higher rates, partially 
      offset by lower ratings. The increase in programming and production 
      costs was due to contractual rate increases for Major League Baseball 
      rights and production costs for new X Games events. Higher equity income 
      from AETN reflected higher advertising and affiliate revenues, along 
      with the benefit of the increase in the Company's ownership interest 
      from 42% to 50%. Growth at the domestic Disney Channels was due to 
      higher affiliate revenues from contractual rate increases and higher 
      program sales. The decrease in operating income at ABC Family was due to 
      higher programming costs driven by more hours of original scripted 
      programming.

			Broadcasting
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Broadcasting decreased $55 million to $213 million 
      for the quarter due to higher primetime programming costs, lower program 
      sales and decreased advertising revenue, partially offset by higher 
      affiliate revenues. Higher primetime programming costs were driven by a 
      shift of hours from self-produced to acquired programming, which had a 
      higher average cost per hour compared to programming in the prior-year 
      quarter. The decline in program sales reflected higher sales of Grey's 
      Anatomy and Castle in the prior-year quarter. Lower 
      advertising revenue was driven by a decline in network ratings and a 
      decrease in rates and political advertising at the owned television 
      stations, partially offset by higher network rates and growth in online 
      advertising. Affiliate revenue growth was primarily due to higher 
      contractual rates.

			Parks and Resorts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter increased 7% to $3.7 billion 
      and segment operating income increased 9% to $689 million. Operating 
      income growth for the quarter was driven by increases at our domestic 
      parks and resorts. Parks and Resorts results for the quarter include an 
      unfavorable impact due to a shift in the timing of the Easter holiday 
      relative to our fiscal periods.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher operating income at our domestic parks and resorts was primarily 
      due to increased guest spending, occupied room nights and attendance at 
      Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort, partially offset by 
      higher costs. Increased guest spending was due to higher average ticket 
      prices and food and beverage spending. Higher costs were driven by 
      spending on new guest offerings and labor and other cost inflation. 
      Significant new guest offerings include MyMagic+, Disney's Art of 
      Animation Resort, which opened in the third quarter of the prior year, 
      and the expansion of the Magic Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Studio Entertainment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Studio Entertainment revenues decreased 2% to $1.6 billion and segment 
      operating income decreased $112 million to $201 million, primarily due 
      to a decrease in worldwide theatrical distribution results. Lower 
      theatrical results reflected pre-release marketing costs for The Lone 
      Ranger and the performance of Marvel's Iron Man 3 in the 
      current quarter compared to Marvel's The Avengers in the 
      prior-year quarter, partially offset by better performance of Monsters 
      University in the current quarter compared to Brave in the 
      prior-year quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Consumer Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumer Products revenues increased 4% to $775 million and segment 
      operating income increased 5% to $219 million. Higher operating income 
      was due to increases at our Merchandise Licensing and Retail businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase in operating income at Merchandise Licensing was due to the 
      inclusion of Lucasfilm and the performance of Monsters University 
      and Disney Junior merchandise, partially offset by lower Spider-Man 
      revenue and higher revenue share with the Studio Entertainment segment. 
      The increased revenue share reflected a higher mix of revenues from 
      properties subject to revenue share in the current quarter. At our 
      Retail business, higher operating income was driven by comparable store 
      sales growth in North America and Japan and higher online sales in North 
      America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Interactive
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interactive revenues for the quarter decreased 7% to $183 million and 
      segment operating results decreased by $16 million to a loss of $58 
      million. Lower operating results were primarily due to lower minimum 
      guarantee recognition, a decline in console game sales as there were no 
      new releases in the current quarter, and a decrease at our social games 
      business due to a favorable acquisition accounting adjustment recognized 
      in the prior-year quarter. These decreases were partially offset by 
      growth at our Japan mobile business.

      The increase in the effective income tax rate for the quarter was driven 
      by changes in our estimated full year effective income tax rate, which 
      is the rate used to determine the quarterly tax provision. The estimated 
      full year effective rate is adjusted each quarter based on information 
      available at the end of that quarter. This impact was unfavorable in the 
      current quarter whereas it was favorable in the prior-year quarter.

			Non-GAAP Financial Measures
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This earnings release presents EPS excluding the impact of certain 
      items, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating income, all of 
      which are important financial measures for the Company but are not 
      financial measures defined by GAAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP 
      financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of EPS, 
      cash flow or net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. EPS 
      excluding certain items, free cash flow, and aggregate segment operating 
      income as we have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly 
      titled measures reported by other companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EPS excluding certain items &#8211; The Company 
      uses EPS excluding certain items to evaluate the performance of the 
      Company&#8217;s operations exclusive of certain items that impact the 
      comparability of results from period to period. The Company believes 
      that information about EPS exclusive of these impacts is useful to 
      investors, particularly where the impact of the excluded items is 
      significant in relation to reported earnings, because the measure allows 
      for comparability between periods of the operating performance of the 
      Company&#8217;s business and allows investors to evaluate the impact of these 
      items separately from the impact of the operations of the business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following table reconciles reported EPS to EPS excluding certain 
      items:

			Free cash flow &#8211; The Company uses free cash 
      flow (cash provided by operations less investments in parks, resorts and 
      other property), among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its 
      operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than 
      capital expenditures. Management believes that information about free 
      cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash 
      available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments 
      and pay dividends or repurchase shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Aggregate segment operating income &#8211; The 
      Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on 
      segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment 
      operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses 
      separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that 
      information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors 
      by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the 
      Company&#8217;s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors 
      that affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both 
      operations and the other factors that affect reported results.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows

      Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or

        technological developments.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Such developments&#160;may affect travel and leisure businesses generally and 
      may, among other things, affect:

      CompanionLink Software has released DejaOffice for Windows Phone&#174; 
      8 including USB Sync for Microsoft&#174; Outlook&#174;. 
      DejaOffice synchronizes PC Outlook Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, and Notes 
      over USB cable to the 41-megapixel Nokia&#174; Lumia&#174; 
      1020, the 4G-connected Lumia 625, and the slim and sharp Lumia 925. DejaOffice 
      provides a robust Contact, Calendar, Task and Memo app suite that 
      includes advanced features like day and month calendar views and private 
      memos. CompanionLink supports Lumia USB sync with Outlook 2013 and prior 
      versions, Act!, GoldMine&#174;, and IBM&#174; Notes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Hot Sync is not dead; direct USB sync remains the most secure way to 
      move data from computers to devices!&#8221; says Wayland Bruns, CTO of 
      CompanionLink Software, a leading developer of USB sync for PC and 
      modern mobile platforms. &#8220;Recent NSA disclosures indicate that Cloud 
      data may be passed on to outside parties without you knowing. Office 365&#174; 
      licensing allows you to download 
      Office 2013. With local data and USB Sync, your Contact and Calendar 
      management is faster and more secure than web based services.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			DejaOffice 
      for Windows Phones 8 is a free download from the Windows Phone 
      Store. You can download a 14-day trial of CompanionLink from www.companionlink.com/windowsphone/outlook. 
      If you like it, a lifetime license costs just $49.95. CompanionLink also 
      offers a RunStart service, and for $39 a technician will remotely log 
      into your computer and set up everything for you.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most investors clung to their outlook on the direction of U.S. Treasuries yields after a disappointing July payrolls report did little to shift expectations the Federal Reserve might pare its bond purchases later this year, a survey released on Tuesday showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neutral outlook came in advance of this week's U.S. government debt sales of $72 billion. The majority of the proceeds will be used to repay investors on maturing government debt they own, with only $2.4 billion of new cash being raised for the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of investors who said on Monday they held longer-dated U.S. government debt equal to their portfolio benchmarks dipped to 70 percent from 72 percent a week earlier, J.P. Morgan Securities, which conducted the survey, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The all clients survey shows flat net positioning," it said of the latest survey results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of J.P. Morgan's other Treasuries clients, 15 percent said they were "long" in their duration on U.S. government debt, or owned more longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks, down from 17 percent last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen percent of its Treasuries clients said they were "short" in duration of Treasuries, or owning fewer longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks, up from 11 percent from a week earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By holding fewer longer-dated Treasuries, investors trim duration, or interest rate, risk to their portfolios in anticipation of a market sell-off, when longer-dated bonds generate bigger losses than shorter-dated debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of "longs" matched "shorts" in the latest week, compared with a week ago when the share of longs exceeded the share of shorts by 6 percentage points, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balance between longs and shorts in the survey seemed consistent with the rise in Treasuries yields on Monday due to surprisingly strong data on the U.S. services sector following a drop on Friday in reaction to data that showed a lower-than-forecast 162,000 in net U.S. jobs created in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early Tuesday trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields ticked up 1 basis point to 2.654 percent, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among active clients, viewed as making speculative bets in Treasuries, 77 percent said their longer-dated Treasuries holdings matched benchmarks, down from 92 percent the prior week - which was the highest since August 22, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight percent of active investors said they held more longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks, up from zero last week, while 15 percent said they were short in duration versus their benchmarks, up from 8 percent the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 6 (Reuters) - Most investors clung to their
outlook on the direction of U.S. Treasuries yields after a
disappointing July payrolls report did little to shift
expectations the Federal Reserve might pare its bond purchases
later this year, a survey released on Tuesday showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neutral outlook came in advance of this week's U.S.
government debt sales of $72 billion. The majority of the
proceeds will be used to repay investors on maturing government
debt they own, with only $2.4 billion of new cash being raised
for the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of investors who said on Monday they held
longer-dated U.S. government debt equal to their portfolio
benchmarks dipped to 70 percent from 72 percent a week earlier,
J.P. Morgan Securities, which conducted the survey, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The all clients survey shows flat net positioning," it said
of the latest survey results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of J.P. Morgan's other Treasuries clients, 15 percent said
they were "long" in their duration on U.S. government debt, or
owned more longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks, down
from 17 percent last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen percent of its Treasuries clients said they were
"short" in duration of Treasuries, or owning fewer longer-dated
Treasuries than their benchmarks, up from 11 percent from a week
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By holding fewer longer-dated Treasuries, investors trim
duration, or interest rate, risk to their portfolios in
anticipation of a market sell-off, when longer-dated bonds
generate bigger losses than shorter-dated debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of "longs" matched "shorts" in the latest week,
compared with a week ago when the share of longs exceeded the
share of shorts by 6 percentage points, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balance between longs and shorts in the survey seemed
consistent with the rise in Treasuries yields on Monday due to
surprisingly strong data on the U.S. services sector following a
drop on Friday in reaction to data that showed a
lower-than-forecast 162,000 in net U.S. jobs created in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early Tuesday trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields
 ticked up 1 basis point to 2.654 percent, according
to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among active clients, viewed as making speculative bets in
Treasuries, 77 percent said their longer-dated Treasuries
holdings matched benchmarks, down from 92 percent the prior week
- which was the highest since Aug. 22, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight percent of active investors said they held more
longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks, up from zero last
week, while 15 percent said they were short in duration versus
their benchmarks, up from 8 percent the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan surveys 40 to 60 of its Treasuries clients
weekly, of which 60 percent are fund managers, 25 percent are
speculative accounts, and 15 percent are central banks and
sovereign wealth funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It asks 10 to 20 of its active clients each week about their
Treasuries holdings, of which 70 percent are speculative
accounts and the rest are money managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has boosted
its forecast for 2013 U.S. corn production due to good crop
weather, and lowered its price forecast for the crop, the
investment banking company said in a note to clients on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman lowered its price forecast for CBOT corn to $4.25
per bushel from its previous forecast of $4.75. CBOT December
corn futures were trading at $4.60 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also lowered to $10.50 per bushel its outlook for
CBOT soybean prices from its previous $11.00. CBOT November
soybean futures were trading at $11.75 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said that while U.S. weather remains volatile it has
turned favorably cool and wet during the key corn pollination
window. Goldman increased its forecast for corn yield per acre
to 161 bushels from the previous outlook of 156 bushels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDA in its July crop report estimated corn yield per acre
at 156.5 bushels, and may adjust the estimate in its August crop
report set to be released on Monday. USDA is currently
forecasting a record U.S. corn output of 13.950 billion bushels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased production and stable demand will result in
greater corn inventories than previously expected, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDA is currently forecasting ending corn inventory for the
2013/14 marketing year at 1.959 billion bushels, the most in
nearly a decade and well above this season's forecast ending
inventory of 729 million bushels, the lowest in nearly 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With August weather key to soybean yields, we maintain our
43 bushel-per-acre U.S. soybean yield forecast which remains
conservative," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDA's current forecast soybean yield is 44.5 bushels per
acre, and it put total production at a record 3.420 billion
bushels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it remained conservative in its acreage
assumptions due to record late planting dates caused by wet
weather, "adopting the USDA's soybean acreage estimate and
keeping our corn harvested acreage 1.3 million acres lower."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDA in July said U.S. harvested corn acreage would total
89.1 million, down from its June forecast of 89.5 million, and
it pegged soybean harvested area at 76.9 million acres, up from
its previous estimate of 76.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

      Expanding its national reach and expertise, award-winning communications

      Media Group today announced it is opening a new office in 
      Washington, D.C. Media relations expert and former journalist Mark 
      Pankowski will head the office.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The announcement marks an important milestone for Sachs Media Group, a 
      Florida-based agency established in 1996 that has grown rapidly into one 
      of the nation&#8217;s leading communications and marketing firms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to assert an important presence in our nation&#8217;s capital 
      with the very talented Mark Pankowski at the helm,&#8221; said Ron 
      Sachs, founder and CEO of Sachs Media Group. &#8220;Mark brings more than 
      25 years of experience as a communications specialist and an 
      award-winning journalist. He&#8217;s a great friend who is renowned for 
      effective crisis management and innovative media campaigns that far 
      exceed expectations, and we are delighted to have him in the Sachs 
      family.&#8221;

      Sachs Media Group, which also has offices in Tallahassee and Orlando, is

      Fortune 500 companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Joining Sachs Media Group is a bit of a homecoming for Pankowski. After 
      graduating from Notre Dame, Pankowski spent a decade as a reporter, news 
      editor and business editor at the&#160;Tallahassee Democrat&#160;and Orlando 
      Sentinel newspapers. He then joined the Sachs firm &#8211; at the time 
      known as Ron Sachs Communications &#8211; as a senior vice president leading 
      communications efforts for a variety of high-profile clients. In his new 
      role, he will be lead executive representing the National League of 
      Cities, among other clients and projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After Pankowski left Tallahassee, he joined a D.C.-based crisis 
      communications firm as senior vice president. He led that firm&#8217;s media 
      efforts for major associations and corporations in the chemical, 
      plastics, pharmaceutical and food-ingredient industries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Deal excludes precious metals, index trades&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* UBS has exited most commodities, slims down investment
bank&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* JPM seeking alternatives for physical commodity business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - U.S. bank JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co
, which plans to stop trading in physical commodities,
has bought the over-the-counter business in commodity
derivatives of Switzerland's UBS AG, the banks said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal excluded precious metals and index-based trades,
but included hedge positions on financial exchanges, UBS said in
a statement. No financial details were released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zurich-based UBS said in October it was closing the majority
of its commodities "flow" trading business involving raw
materials and financial derivatives as part of a slimming down
last year, in which it withdrew from large parts of fixed income
and laid off 10,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank retained, however, its precious metals and
commodities index business as part of a strategy that put
increased emphasis on global asset management and wealth
management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS also remains active in commodity trade finance and has 
expanded by hiring 10 bankers in Geneva in the sector since the
start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's UBS statement said: "Risk on the portfolio has
been assumed by J.P. Morgan and they (the two banks) will work
together in the coming months with their clients to fully assign
contracts for individual trades to J.P. Morgan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This transaction is a further step for UBS in executing its
strategic plan to refocus and simplify the investment bank".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan confirmed the purchase but offered no further
comment or details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, JP Morgan announced plans to exit physical
commodities trading and pursue "strategic alternatives", but
said it would continue to trade in financial commodities such as
 derivatives and precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;

			Highlights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2006, Pfizer sold its Pfizer Consumer Healthcare business to Johnson 
       Johnson for $16.6 billion. This division of the business included the 
      company's OTC healthcare products and represented a departure from this 
      market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Chairman and CEO Hank McKinnell described the decision to sell 
      the Consumer Healthcare division as being an important step to create 
      value for our shoulders while transforming our company. He went on to 
      describe how the strategy of the company had changed, with the plan 
      being to focus on the core pharmaceutical business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following its departure from OTC Healthcare with the sale of its 
      Consumer Healthcare division in 2006, just 3 years later Pfizer 
      re-entered the market with its acquisition of Wyeth. The main reason for 
      this shift back towards OTC healthcare has been the so-called patent 
      cliff.

		&lt;p&gt;
      On 30 July 2013, Vodafone Vierte Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH (whose 
      change of legal form into a German stock corporation under the company 
      name Vodafone Vierte Verwaltungs AG has been resolved upon), D&#252;sseldorf, 
      Germany (the "Bidder"), published the offer document for its 
      voluntary public takeover offer (the "Takeover
			Offer") 
      to the shareholders of Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, Unterf&#246;hring, 
      Deutschland (the "Target Company"), to acquire all non-par 
      value bearer shares (ISIN DE000KD88880) in the Target Company 
      (collectively the &#8220;KDH Shares&#8220; and individually "KDH Share"). 
      The acceptance period for the Offer expires on 11&#160;September 2013, 24:00 
      hrs (local time at Frankfurt am Main, Germany), unless extended pursuant 
      to the statutory provisions of the Wp&#220;G.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On 5 August 2013, 5:30 pm (local time at Frankfurt am Main, Germany) 
      (the &#8220;Reference Date&#8220;), the Vodafone Group Plc, Newbury, England 
      (&#8220;Vodafone&#8221;), a person acting jointly with the Bidder within the 
      meaning of section 2 para. 5 Wp&#220;G, held 3,750,747 KDH Shares; this 
      corresponds to approximately 4.24% of the share capital and voting 
      rights of the Target Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Until the Reference Date, the Takeover Offer has been accepted for a 
      total of 7,223 KDH Shares. This corresponds to approximately 0.01% of 
      the share capital and voting rights of the Target Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vodafone has purchased further 22,122 KDH Shares, corresponding to 
      approximately 0.02% of the share capital and the voting rights of the 
      Target Company, after the publication of the offer document outside the 
      Takeover Offer via the stock exchange against payment of a cash 
      consideration, whose transfer of title is still outstanding. Transfer of 
      title to these KDH Shares to Vodafone will presumably take place on 6 
      August&#160;2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Furthermore, neither the Bidder, nor any person acting in concert with 
      it within the meaning of section 2 para. 5 Wp&#220;G, nor any of their 
      subsidiaries, held any additional KDH Shares or financial instruments or 
      other instruments within the meaning of sections 25, 25a WpHG on the 
      Reference Date. Moreover, no further voting rights from KDH Shares were 
      attributed to them as of the Reference Date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the Reference Date, the aggregate number of KDH Shares held by the 
      Bidder and persons acting jointly with the Bidder plus the number of 
      KDH&#160;Shares for which the Takeover Offer has been accepted until the 
      Reference Date plus the number of KDH Shares purchased whose transfer of 
      title is still outstanding, amounts to 3,780,092 KDH Shares. This 
      corresponds to approximately 4.27% of the share capital and voting 
      rights of the Target Company.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said on Wednesday that it faces a criminal probe by the U.S. Department of Justice over sales of mortgage-backed securities and that civil investigators have already concluded it violated securities laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, JPMorgan said it is responding to "parallel investigations" being conducted by the civil and criminal divisions of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California over mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, JPMorgan received a notice that the department's civil division had preliminarily concluded that the firm violated federal securities laws in offerings of subprime and Alt-A residential mortgage securities during 2005 to 2007, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said that it has received requests concerning mortgage securities from the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, the SEC's enforcement division and the inspector general for the government's primary bank bailout program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined additional comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disclosures came one day after government lawyers filed an $850 million civil lawsuit against Bank of America Corp over the sale of bonds backed by jumbo mortgages. The lawsuit followed a disclosure by Bank of America on August 1 that it expected to be sued by the Department of Justice and SEC over mortgage bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of the investigations comes after President Barack Obama vowed to hold companies responsible for breaking the law in financing the housing bubble that caused the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement on Tuesday that Obama's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, which brought the latest lawsuit against Bank of America, "will continue to take an aggressive approach to combating financial fraud and uncovering abuses in the residential mortgage-backed securities market," and is pursuing "a range of additional investigations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRITICISMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the major criticisms by homeowners, investors and politicians is that federal and state investigators have failed to bring criminal charges against high-level executives over lending and securitization activities that contributed to the housing and financial crises.

reputation for controlling risks after losing more than $6.2
billion in 2012 on its so-called "London Whale" derivatives
trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the filing, the company also raised its estimate of
possible legal losses in excess of reserves to $6.8 billion at

				&lt;p&gt;Management Commentary &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strong contributions from our growth investments drove the year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA," said Al Cadotte, President and CEO of Newalta.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the second half of the year, Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be at least 20 percent higher than last year, driven by returns from our growth capital over the past 18 months.&#160;We anticipate commodity prices will remain at current levels for the remainder of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our capital investment plans for 2013 remain on budget and we are well-positioned with a solid balance sheet and excellent organization to drive growth in 2014. We remain on track in the execution of our business plan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consolidated Overview &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second quarter revenue was up 15% to $196.1 million.&#160;Adjusted EBITDA increased 27% to $38.4 million compared to Q2 2012.&#160;Improved results were primarily driven by contributions from growth investments in New Markets and Oilfield, further enhanced by a positive impact from commodity prices.&#160;Net earnings in the quarter decreased to $4.9 million compared to $18.6 million in the prior year. Excluding higher stock-based compensation expense and net finance charges related to a non-cash loss on embedded derivatives, net earnings would have increased 138% to $11.9 million compared to Q2 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2013, revenue increased 9% to $367.5 million compared to prior year, while Adjusted EBITDA was $66.1 million, flat to 2012.&#160;Returns from growth capital investments in New Markets and Oilfield were partially offset by the impact of lower commodity prices.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operational Overview &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from New Markets in the quarter and year-to-date increased 45% and 30%, respectively, to $56.1 million and $97.0 million compared to prior year. Gross profit in the quarter and year-to-date increased 38% and 15%, respectively, to $19.3 million and $32.3 million compared to 2012.&#160;Strong performance in the quarter and year-to-date was primarily driven by returns from growth investments, including our two onsite contracts to process mature fine tailings ("MFT"). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Oilfield in the quarter and year-to-date was $39.5 million and $88.1 million, respectively, essentially flat to prior year.&#160;Gross profit in the quarter and year-to-date increased 32% and 10%, respectively, compared to prior year. Improved results, primarily driven by contributions from growth capital, were partially offset by declines in drilling activity year-over-year.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Industrial increased 7% and 5%, respectively, to $100.5 million and $182.4 million in Q2 2013 and year to date, compared to the prior year.&#160;Gross profit in the quarter and year-to-date declined $2.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively, to $12.3 million and $17.9 million compared to the prior year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Highlights &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta's Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.11 per share ($0.44 per share annualized) paid July 15, 2013 to shareholders of record June 28, 2013. This higher dividend rate established earlier this year reflects our positive long-term outlook for the business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from contracts generated 11% of consolidated revenue trailing twelve months ("TTM") Q2 2013, compared to 6% in TTM Q2 2012.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital expenditures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 were $35.0 million and $55.5 million, respectively, focused primarily on growth capital projects in New Markets and Oilfield. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio improved to 2.74 in Q2 2013, from 2.94 in Q1 2013.&#160;We anticipate ending the year at or near 2.50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newalta amended and extended its credit facility effective July 12, 2013.&#160;Key changes to the agreement included: extending it by one year, to July 12, 2016, increasing the amount available from $225 million to $250 million and improved pricing.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outlook &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2013 is expected to be at least 20% higher than last year driven by continued strong returns on our growth investments.&#160;We anticipate commodity prices to remain at current levels for the balance of 2013, better than prior year.&#160;We expect Ville Ste-Catherine ("VSC") volumes to be in line with our historical quarterly average and SCL to be at the annual permitted capacity by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continue to focus on growing our portfolio of longer term contracts, strengthening our foundation of stable cash flow, and maximizing cash flow from our existing assets.&#160;We have good visibility on our pipeline of organic growth capital projects, extending well into 2014.&#160;We are well-positioned to deliver our 2013 capital budget of $190 million.&#160;Capital spending will be allocated to projects and long-term contracts which provide the highest returns and more stable cash flows among other factors.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly Conference Call &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management will hold a conference call on Thursday, August 8, 2013 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss Newalta's performance for the second quarter ended June 30, 2013.

				fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates;
				supply of waste lead acid batteries as feedstock to support direct lead sales;

            the highly regulated nature of the environmental services and waste management business in which we operate;
            dependence on our senior management team and other operations management personnel with waste industry experience;
            the competitive environment of our industry in Canada and the U.S.;
            success of our growth, acquisition and technical development strategies including integration of businesses and processes into our operations and potential liabilities from acquisitions;
            potential operational and safety risks and hazards and obtaining insurance for such risks and hazards on reasonable financial terms;

			&lt;p&gt;By their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, that contribute to the possibility that the predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not occur.&#160;Many other factors could also cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.&#160;Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as intended, planned, anticipated, believed, estimated or expected.&#160;Furthermore, the forward-looking statements contained in this document are made as of the date of this document and are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.&#160;Unless otherwise required by law, we do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information contained on our website does not form part of this press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Press Release contains references to certain financial measures, including some that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS" or "GAAP") and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other corporations or entities.&#160;These financial measures are identified and defined below: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"EBITDA", "EBITDA per share", "Adjusted EBITDA", and "Adjusted EBITDA per share" are measures of our operating profitability.&#160;EBITDA provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to how these activities are financed, assets are amortized or how the results are taxed in various jurisdictions.&#160;In addition, Adjusted EBITDA provides an indication of the results generated by our principal business activities prior to recognizing stock-based compensation.&#160;Stock-based compensation, a component of employee remuneration, can vary significantly with changes in the price of our common shares.&#160;As such, Adjusted EBITDA provides improved continuity with respect to the comparison of our operating results over a period of time.&#160;EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.&#160;EBITDA per share and Adjusted EBITDA per share are derived by dividing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by the basic weighted average number of shares.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

      follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      * Interest only and notional amount
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expected ratings are based upon information received by the issuer 
      as of Aug. 6, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates in this transaction represent the beneficial interests 
      in a trust that holds a $250 million mortgage loan secured by 79 
      assisted living and congregate care properties located in 15 states 
      across the U.S. The loan is sponsored by TPG Capital, L.P., a global 
      private investment firm with $56.7 billion of assets under management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Low Leverage Metrics: The $250 million loan has a Fitch LTV of 56.7% and 
      a debt per key of $67,531, which is lower than similar transactions 
      rated by Fitch. No additional debt is allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      New Sponsor Equity Contribution: The sponsor of the transaction is TPG 
      Capital, L.P. (TPG), and the loan is financing the assets in conjunction 
      with an affiliate of TPG's acquisition of Assisted Living Concepts, LLC 
      (ALC). Total acquisition costs were approximately $538.2 million with 
      TPG Capital contributing approximately $281.5 million of cash equity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Experienced Corporate Management: Upon completion of the acquisition the 
      sponsor, TPG, replaced the existing management with a new CEO and COO 
      with significant experience in the senior living industry, including 
      leading the turnaround of another underperforming assisted living 
      facility operator.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Diverse and Granular Portfolio: The portfolio exhibits geographic 
      diversity across secondary markets in 15 states. The largest state 
      exposure is Indiana with 15 facilities representing 19% by number of 
      properties and 16.9% by allocated loan balance. No single facility 
      contributes more than 4% of net cash flow (NCF).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 72.4% decline in value and 
      an approximately 68.2% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings of class A (rated 'AAAsf' 
      by Fitch) and found that a 26.9% decline in Fitch NCF would result in a 
      one category downgrade, while a 44% decline would result in a downgrade 
      to below investment grade. The Rating Sensitivity section in the presale 
      report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and 
      sensitivities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report. The presale report is available to all

      The affirmations reflect stable portfolio performance since issuance. 
      Fitch has not designated any loans as Fitch Loans of Concern, nor have 
      there been any specially serviced or delinquent loans. As of the July

      30-year amortization and a 2021 maturity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second-largest loan in the pool (9.9%) is secured by a portfolio of 
      119 SunTrust bank retail branches and two single-tenant office 
      buildings. The portfolio is part of a larger 218-property portfolio. The 
      properties are located across seven states and range in size from 1,110 
      sf to 78,308 sf.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest loan in the pool (7.4%) is secured by a 323,832 sf 
      portion of a 974,316 sf enclosed regional mall located in Asheville, NC. 
      The collateral was 100% occupied as of December 2012 compared to 95.4% 
      at issuance.

      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics. Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in 
      the 'JPMCC 2011-C5 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates' (Oct. 
      3, 2011) new issue report, available at www.fitchratings.com.

      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2012-FL2 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Thru Certificates
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed all rated classes of J.P. Morgan Chase 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-FL2 floating-rate commercial 
      mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed list of rating actions 
      follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Affirmations are warranted due to stable or improved performance of the 
      underlying collateral since issuance. As of the July 2013 distribution 
      date, the transaction's aggregate principal balance remained at $466.3 
      million the same as issuance. There are no delinquent, watch list or 
      specially serviced loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlooks are expected to remain Stable. Upgrades will be 
      limited due to the transaction's concentration and relatively short 
      expected life. Additional information on rating sensitivity is available 
      in the report 'JPMCC 2012-FL2 ', dated Oct. 2, 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All of the pool's original six floating rate loans remain outstanding: 
      The Carousel Mall, Roosevelt Hotel, Ashford Hotel Portfolio, Curtis 
      Center, Wyvernwood Apartments and the Westin DFW.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest loan in the transaction is the Carousel Mall (33.2%), a 1.5 
      million sf super-regional shopping mall located in Syracuse, NY. The 
      property opened in 1990 and is anchored by Macy's, JCPenney, Lord  
      Taylor, and Bon-Ton. Major tenants include Best Buy, Sports Authority, 
      and a 17-screen Regal Cinema. The mall was recently expanded to include 
      the Destiny USA expansion portion of the property; however collateral 
      for this loan is the original Carousel Mall space only. Collateral 
      square footage for the loan is 1.2 million SF and excludes the Macy's 
      and Lord  Taylor spaces, which are owned by the tenants. As of YE 2012 
      the servicer reported mall net cash flow (NCF) was up 35% compared to 
      issuance underwriting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest loan is the Ashford Hotel Portfolio (16.9%) which is 
      backed by a portfolio of nine hotels, totaling 1,337 keys, located 
      across six states. The first mortgage, along with $60,000,000 of 
      mezzanine debt and approximately $5 million of new sponsor equity, was 
      used to refinance a previous loan which was originally securitized in 
      the WBCMT 2007-WHL8 transaction. The loan is sponsored by Ashford 
      Hospitality Trust, a publicly traded hotel REIT that owns a total of 127 
      properties across the U.S. comprising over 27,600 rooms. Remington 
      Lodging and Hospitality, LLC, a sponsor affiliated company, manages 
      seven of the nine properties. The remaining properties are managed by 
      their respective flags. As of YE 2012 the servicer reported NCF was up 
      approximately 13% compared to issuance underwriting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Roosevelt Hotel loan (16.9%) is secured by a 1,015-room full-service 
      hotel located in the Midtown Manhattan, two blocks north of Grand 
      Central Station. The property was originally built in 1924 and underwent 
      a substantial renovation in 1997 at an estimated cost of $65 million 
      ($64,039 per room). Amenities include a 24-hour fitness center, business 
      center, and the rooftop bar -- Mad46. The property completed an $8.3 
      million ($7,882 per room) room renovation in early 2012. As of YE 2012 
      revenue per available room (RevPAR) had improved to $194.60 from $174.92 
      at YE 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$345 million class A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      --$466.3 million interest-only class X-EXT at 'BB+sf'; Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not rate the interest-only class X-CP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      A comparison of the transaction's Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement (RWE) mechanisms to those of typical RWEs for the asset

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Glencore Xstrata (GLEN.L) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) face a U.S. lawsuit alleging they artificially inflated aluminum prices and disrupted supplies, as legal challenges related to metal warehousing piled up this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in a district court in Florida on Tuesday, also named Goldman Sachs (GS.N), the London Metal Exchange (LME) and subsidiaries of both JPMorgan and Goldman and accused the companies of antitrust practices and racketeering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the second suit since last Thursday and expanded the geography and number of companies targeted. The first, filed last week in Detroit, named Goldman and the LME as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming hot on the heels of the first two, River Parish Contractors Inc, an aluminum and steel fabricator based in Reserve, Louisiana, registered its own action in a Louisiana district court on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three seek class action status. Allegations center on Goldman and its warehouse company Metro, which plaintiffs accuse of violating antitrust laws by restraining supplies and inflating aluminum prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frustration over long waiting times and inflated prices at metals warehouses across the world has led to growing criticism of banks that own commodity assets and trade raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators are scrutinizing ownership of commodity storage facilities by major U.S. banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies could face fines if the lawsuits are successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warehouse owners and outgoing LME CEO Martin Abbott have said the complaints over long lines at warehouses are unjustified, arguing there is no shortage of metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan dismissed the Florida suit, filed by Florida-based aluminum user Master Screens and an individual plaintiff. Goldman Sachs has dismissed all three suits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank tried last week to defuse the criticism over warehousing by offering immediate access to aluminum for end users holding metal at its Metro warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this suit is without merit and we intend to vigorously contest it. We also note that aluminum prices are down 40 percent from their peak in 2006," a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no queues at our warehouses. We believe this suit has no merit," a JPMorgan spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (0388.HK), owner of the LME, also said the lawsuits were without merit and the LME would contest them vigorously. It has not been served with any of the suits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Glencore spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida lawsuit alleges "manipulation of the aluminum market through supply price fixing," among other practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, which is seeking class action status and was filed on August 6 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, is Master Screens Inc and Daniel Price Bart, described in the filing as "a purchaser of beverages sold in aluminum cans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Susan Thomas and Josephine Mason in London; Editing by Amran Abocar, Tom Pfeiffer and Jim Marshall)&lt;/p&gt;

down 40 percent from their peak in 2006," a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no queues at our warehouses. We believe this suit
has no merit," a JPMorgan spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, owner of the
LME, also said the lawsuits were without merit and the LME would
contest them vigorously. It has not been served with any of the
suits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Glencore spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida lawsuit alleges "manipulation of the aluminum
market through supply price fixing," among other practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, which is seeking class
action status and was filed on Aug. 6 in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Florida, is Master Screens Inc and
Daniel Price Bart, described in the filing as "a purchaser of
beverages sold in aluminum cans."&lt;/p&gt;

			MakerBot&#174; Replicator&#174; 2 Desktop 3D Printers and Filament Coming To A 
      Microsoft Retail Store Near You
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft Retail Stores Expand the &#8220;MakerBot Experience&#8221; to 
      Additional U.S. Stores
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This summer, MakerBot&#174; Replicator&#174; 2 Desktop 3D Printers have been 
      making appearances at select Microsoft retail stores on the West Coast. 
      As of August 5th, the &#8220;MakerBot Experience&#8221; will expand, 
      adding 15 
      additional Microsoft Stores across the country to the mix.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The &#8220;MakerBot Experience&#8221; is a hands-on 3D printing demonstration on 
      MakerBot Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printers inside select Microsoft retail 
      stores. Microsoft customers get to see 3D printing in action as well as 
      purchase a MakerBot Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printer and MakerBot PLA 
      Filament.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to offer the MakerBot Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printer 
      and our MakerBot PLA Filament in Microsoft Stores,&#8221; said Bre Pettis, CEO 
      of MakerBot. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen tremendous interest and enthusiasm at the three 
      initial &#8216;MakerBot Experience&#8217; stores. Rolling the program out to 15 
      additional Microsoft Stores supercharges our mission to bring 3D 
      printing to more people.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In June, MakerBot and Microsoft announced their collaboration at 
      Microsoft&#8217;s BUILD conference, where MakerBot unveiled a 3D printer 
      driver for Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 8.1 3D print pipeline. The companies also 
      announced that MakerBot Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printers would be 
      available at select Microsoft retail stores and on microsoftstore.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;3D printing is a significant technological innovation, and we want all 
      our customers to experience it first-hand, to learn how they can use and 
      benefit from it in their own lives,&#8221; said David McAughan, chief 
      operating officer for Microsoft retail stores. &#8220;The relationship with 
      MakerBot has been very successful so far, and Microsoft looks forward to 
      seeing the &#8216;MakerBot Experience&#8217; rolled out into more stores.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We want to empower more people to create and make things, and working 
      with a technology leader like Microsoft helps further our mission,&#8221; said 
      Pettis. &#8220;Together we are bringing the tools to innovate and invent to 
      the world in ways never before possible.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Goodwin Procter Named a &#8220;Best Law Firm for Women&#8221; by Working Mother 
      for Fourth Consecutive Year
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goodwin 
      Procter, a national Am Law 50 firm, has been named as a &#8220;Best Law 
      Firm for Women&#8221; by Working Mother and Flex-Time Lawyers for the 
      fourth year in a row. The annual list recognizes 50 
      law firms across the nation whose family-friendly policies and 
      business development initiatives are retaining female attorneys and 
      advancing them into their leadership pipeline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goodwin&#8217;s work/life and women-friendly policies will be featured in the 
      August/September issue of the magazine, and are among those profiled at www.workingmother.com 
      and www.flextimelawyers.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goodwin actively supports the development and retention of its attorneys 
      through a number of efforts, including its firm-sponsored Women&#8217;s 
      Initiative. Goodwin&#8217;s Women&#8217;s Initiative maximizes networking and career 
      opportunities for women at the firm through programming and support in 
      areas including professional development, training, career growth, 
      business development and work/life effectiveness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re extremely honored to be recognized as one of the best law firms 
      for women by Working Mother,&#8221; said Regina 
      M. Pisa, Chairman of Goodwin Procter. &#8220;Receiving this award for the 
      fourth consecutive year is a testament to the hard work and vision of so 
      many at the firm and to the progress we have made through the efforts of 
      our Women&#8217;s Initiative.&#8221; Pisa broke new ground in the legal industry 
      when she became the first female chairman and managing partner of an Am 
      Law 100 law firm in 1998.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Best 50 Law Firms for Women have created the ultimate benchmark in 
      the profession. They not only offer excellent flexibility and 
      advancement policies to retain and grow their female talent, they fight 
      for issues crucial to women worldwide through their powerful pro bono 
      programs,&#8221; said Carol Evans, president of Working Mother Media. 
      &#8220;Last year, 69% of the Best Law Firms had one or more women in their top 
      ten rainmakers; this year, the number has gone up to 78%, a testament to 
      the firms&#8217; management and those who are rising through the ranks.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All law firms with more than 50 attorneys were eligible to submit 
      responses to detailed questions on the issues that are most important to 
      the retention and promotion of female lawyers. The 50 winning firms were 
      selected based on factors that included their workforce profile, 
      family-friendly benefits and policies, flexibility, leadership, 
      compensation, and advancement and retention of women.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Glencore Xstrata (GLEN.L) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) face a U.S. lawsuit alleging they artificially inflated aluminum prices, the second legal challenge related to metal warehousing in a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in a district court in Florida, also names Goldman Sachs (GS.N), the London Metal Exchange (LME) and subsidiaries of both JPMorgan and Goldman and accuses the companies of anti-trust practices and racketeering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frustration over long waiting times and inflated prices at metals warehouses across the world has led to growing criticism of banks that own commodity assets and trade raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators are scrutinizing ownership of commodity storage facilities by major U.S. banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Goldman and the LME were named as defendants in a separate Detroit lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest case, filed by Florida-based aluminum user Master Screens and an individual plaintiff, expands the geography and number of companies being sued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies could face fines if the lawsuits are successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warehouse owners and outgoing LME CEO Martin Abbott have said the complaints over long lines at warehouses are unjustified, arguing there is no shortage of metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan dismissed the Florida suit. Goldman tried last week to diffuse the criticism over warehousing by offering immediate access to aluminum for end users holding metal at its Metro warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this suit is without merit and we intend to vigorously contest it. We also note that aluminum prices are down 40 percent from their peak in 2006," a Goldman Sachs spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no queues at our warehouses. We believe this suit has no merit," a JPMorgan spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (0388.HK), owner of the LME, also said both lawsuits were without merit and the LME would contest them vigorously. It added that it had not been served with either of the suits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Glencore spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida lawsuit alleges "manipulation of the aluminum market through supply price fixing," among other practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, which is seeking class action status and was filed on August 6 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, is Master Screens Inc. and Daniel Price Bart, described in the filing as "a purchaser of beverages sold in aluminum cans".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Susan Thomas in London; Editing by Amran Abocar and Tom Pfeiffer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has stepped up a probe in recent weeks into Bear Stearns mortgage dealings in the run-up to the financial crisis, adding to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's legal problems, according to three sources familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bought failing Bear Stearns with government encouragement during the financial crisis in 2008, but then became embroiled in private lawsuits by mortgage bond insurers alleging that home loans underlying securities were rotten from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The probe, news of which was first reported by Reuters in February, has picked up steam in recent weeks. Justice Department officials have taken sworn testimony from at least three people, including former Bear Stearns employees, about mortgage-backed securities, according to one of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developments follow new mortgage-related investigations by the Eastern District of California. All are fresh obstacles for CEO Jamie Dimon who is striving to restore the bank's reputation for controlling risks after losing more than $6.2 billion in 2012 on its so-called "London Whale" derivatives trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of California has been conducting criminal and civil investigations into the bank's mortgage securities, the bank said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those investigations, government lawyers have already concluded that JPMorgan committed civil violations of securities laws in offering mortgage bonds in 2005 to 2007 that were backed by subprime and other residential mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the situation said on Thursday that the California probes involve mortgage bonds offered by JPMorgan itself, and not those by companies the largest U.S. bank bought during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the "London Whale" debacle, the bank is working to reach a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by year-end, in which it will pay a penalty and admit faults, according to a person familiar with that matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than five years after the onset of the financial crisis, and 17 months after President Barack Obama formed a task force of federal and state law enforcers to bring cases, the government is finally gaining some traction against alleged wrongdoing in housing finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the JPMorgan mortgage investigations, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit on Tuesday against Bank of America Corp over $850 million in mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My office anticipates further action in the coming months," New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a co-chair of the mortgage-securities working group, said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest Justice Department probes of JPMorgan piggyback on previous cases by the New York attorney general and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman sued JPMorgan last October over alleged improper sales of pools of home loans by Bear Stearns in 2006 and 2007. That case is ongoing. In November, JPMorgan agreed to pay $296.9 million to settle an SEC complaint over improper mortgage securities sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has also disclosed that it faces probes and sanctions from multiple government entities over collections of consumer credit card debt, risk controls, anti-money laundering practices and systems for management of the capital it is required to have to absorb losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOUNTING LEGAL BILL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, may have little choice but to seek deals with the authorities, as continuing public anger over the financial crisis is encouraging regulators to impose tougher and costly safety requirements on banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank will likely see its high legal expenses continue for longer than many people expect, analyst Charles Peabody of Portales Partners said in a research note on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though JPMorgan has settled some matters and booked $3 billion of legal expenses in the 12 months through June, the company has said that costs for lawsuits could still exceed its undisclosed litigation reserves by $6.8 billion, some $1.5 billion more than it had estimated the same time a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts expect JPMorgan to earn more than $22 billion in net profit this year, so the bank can cover the costs. But the outlook for continuing legal expense will likely bring down those estimates, Peabody predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Peter Rudegeair and Carrick Mollenkamp in New York; Editing by Gary Hill, Paritosh Bansal and Edwina Gibbs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks advanced on Thursday, snapping a three-day losing skid as a rally in Microsoft helped lift the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three major U.S. stock indexes shook off early losses as Microsoft shares (MSFT.O) climbed. The stock closed up 2.6 percent at $32.89 in heavy volume. The S information technology sector index .SPLRCT rose 0.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) jumped 14.3 percent to $153.48 a day after the electric car maker posted an unexpected quarterly profit. The stock has been a major momentum favorite this year, up almost 350 percent in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There definitely seems to be some big runners. Microsoft was up quite a bit," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could be people decided there are some bargains out there. It's kind of odd that we had a fair amount of this tapering talk the past few days. So I'm surprised in that regard that people have decided to step back in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks had inched lower much of this week, pulling back from last week's record levels, on concerns that the Federal Reserve will start to reduce its stimulus efforts this year as the economy recovers. Gains in equities have been closely linked to the Fed's stimulative policy, and many investors are worried that economic growth may stall without the Fed's intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest comments from a Fed official, Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, reiterated that the central bank will probably begin cutting back on its massive bond-buying stimulus next month, as long as economic data continues to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 27.65 points or 0.18 percent, to end at 15,498.32. The S 500 .SPX gained 6.57 points or 0.39 percent, to 1,697.48. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC added 15.115 points or 0.41 percent, to 3,669.124.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume was once again light, with about 5.81 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE MKT and the Nasdaq, below the daily average of 6.35 billion. Volume has yet to climb above 6 billion for any trading day this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groupon Inc (GRPN.O) shares soared 21.6 percent to $10.60. Late Wednesday, the online coupon company reported revenue that exceeded expectations and named its co-founder as chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) was among the Dow's worst performers. The stock fell 0.9 percent to $54.83. JPMorgan Chase, which is the biggest U.S. bank ranked by assets, faces a criminal probe by the U.S. Department of Justice over sales of mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data showed U.S. weekly jobless claims rose less than expected to 333,000 in the latest week, while the four-week average fell to 335,500, its lowest level since before the recession in 2007 through 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orbitz Worldwide Inc (OWW.N), an online travel agency, reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings as it sold more hotel and vacation packages, and forecast full-year revenue above analysts' estimates. Orbitz shares surged 36.7 percent to $12.62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the closing bell, Priceline.com (PCLN.O) shares rose 5.1 percent to $981.46 after the online travel agency said quarterly profit rose on improved hotel and car-rental reservations. The stock had ended regular trading at $933.75, up 0.7 percent ahead of its earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 442 companies in the S 500 that had reported earnings through Thursday morning, Thomson Reuters data showed that 67 percent topped analysts' expectations, matching the beat rate over the past four quarters. In terms of revenue, 53.6 percent exceeded estimates, more than the 48 percent rate over the past four quarters, but below the 61 percent average since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a ratio of 2 to 1, while on the Nasdaq, three stocks rose for every two that fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2010-C2
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 11 classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2010-C2. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are a result of stable pool performance since issuance. 
      Fitch modeled losses are in line with the 2.2% modeled at issuance. The 
      pool has experienced no realized losses to date. Fitch has not 
      designated any loans as Fitch Loans of Concern, and no loans are in 
      special servicing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the July 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 3.9% to $1.06 billion from $1.1 billion at 
      issuance. No loans are defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently 
      affecting class NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlooks on classes A-1 through H remain Stable due to stable 
      pool performance, increasing credit enhancement and continued paydown.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$223.7 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$243.1 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$390.5 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$857.3 million class X-A at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$37.2 million class B at 'AAsf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$53.7 million class C at 'Asf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$33 million class D at 'BBB+sf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$22 million class E at 'BBB-sf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$16.5 million class F at 'BBsf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$13.8 million class G at 'Bsf', Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.8 million class H at 'B-sf', Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not rate the class NR certificates.

Thursday, snapping a three-day losing skid as a rally in
Microsoft helped lift the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three major U.S. stock indexes shook off early losses as
Microsoft shares moved higher before closing up 2.6
percent at $32.89 in heavy volume. The S information
technology sector index rose 0.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Tesla Motors Inc jumped 14.3 percent to

that people have decided to step back in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks had inched lower much of this week, pulling back from
last week's record levels, on concerns that the Federal Reserve
will start to reduce its stimulus efforts this year as the
economy recovers. Gains in equities have been closely linked to
the Fed's stimulative policy, and many investors are worried
that economic growth may stall without the Fed's intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Sandra Pianalto

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA/VIENNA Aug 8 (Reuters) - Coca planting in Colombia
fell by a quarter last year as the government bolstered efforts
to stop the crop being turned into cocaine and crime gangs
shifted to other ways of funding their operations, the United
Nations said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca, the raw material for cocaine production, covered
48,000 hectares of Colombia in 2012, down 25 percent from the
year before, according to the annual report by the United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The figure is the
lowest since records started in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the world's top cocaine producers, Colombia has been
battling drug-funded rebels and criminal gangs for decades. Even
as a U.S.-backed military offensive has helped improve security,
coca output and drug trafficking continues to help finance a
50-year conflict that has killed more than 200,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have noticed that terrorists are looking for other
sources of funding, but drug trafficking continues to fund their
operations," Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurgent groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia and the National Liberation Army, as well as criminal
bands, have moved into illegal mining for gold as an easier way
to pay for their operations, Bo Mathiasen, the UNODC
representative in Colombia, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca leaf yield per hectare also declined last year. The
United Nations estimates that potential cocaine production in
2012 was 309 tons, down 10 percent from 345 tons in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drop in cultivation followed an increase of 3 percent
during 2011. This year's number is far below Colombia's 2001
peak, when coca fields occupied more than 140,000 hectares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government's crackdown on the drugs trade and a steady
increase in metals prices in recent years, including a fivefold
jump in gold prices over the last decade, has led criminal gangs
to seek easier profit in the illegal extraction of minerals such
as gold, coltan and tungsten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocaine is no longer a sufficient source of funding for
8,000-member FARC because distribution - the most lucrative side
of the cocaine market - is now largely controlled by Mexican
cartels, said Adam Isacson, an analyst at the Washington Office
on Latin America, a U.S. non-governmental organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it was easier for rebel bands and criminal gangs to
operate an illegal mine than a coca field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no risk of fumigation and the United States is not
complaining, so the government doesn't feel pressure to crack
down on unlicensed mines," Isacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N. report estimated the farm-gate value of coca leaf
and its derivatives, such as coca paste and cocaine base, at
$370 million in 2012 - down from $422 million in 2011. It said
it amounted to just 0.2 percent of Colombia's economic output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While prices were mostly stable for cocaine base and paste,
the coca leaf yield per hectare fell, and 3 percent fewer
households were linked to coca production, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the average gross income of a farmer selling coca leaf
estimated at $1,220 per year, coca production does not fetch the
same lucrative rewards as in the past," the report said.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors investigating JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) for allegedly violating securities laws are looking at mortgage bonds created by the bank itself, and not by companies it bought, according to a source familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disclosed on Wednesday that was the subject of investigations by the criminal and civil divisions of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California, which includes the state capital and Central Valley region in which communities were hit hard by the collapse of house prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual during the financial crisis in 2008. Both those firms had also created mortgage bonds that contributed to the housing bubble and have since been subjects of lawsuits as well. But the current criminal probe focuses on bonds JPMorgan created, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, JPMorgan was informed the office's civil division had made a preliminary conclusion that the firm violated federal securities laws in offerings of subprime and Alt-A residential mortgage securities during 2005 to 2007, the company said in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation is part of drive by President Barack Obama to hold companies responsible for breaking the law in financing the housing bubble that caused the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) was sued by federal prosecutors on Tuesday for alleged civil violations of laws over the sale of bonds backed by jumbo mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also adds a new hurdle to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's campaign to restore the bank's reputation for controlling risks after losing more than $6.2 billion in 2012 on its so-called "London Whale" derivatives trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Doina Chiacu)&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global E-commerce Software Market 2012-2016 with 
      Hybris, IBM Corp., and Oracle Corp. Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7qnmlc/global_ecommerce) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      E-commerce Software Market 2012-2016" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global E-commerce Software market to grow at a 
      CAGR of 11.73 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors 
      contributing to this market growth is the high growth of the Global 
      E-tailing market. The Global E-commerce Software market has also been 
      witnessing an increasing popularity of mobile commerce. However, threat 
      from open-source solution providers could pose a challenge to the growth 
      of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this space include Demandware, Inc., Hybris, 
      IBM Corp., and Oracle Corp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in this report are Cleverbridge, Digital 
      River, Ebay GSI Commerce, Intershop, Jagged Peak, MarketLive, Magento, 
      SAP AG, Venda, and Volusion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: One of the main 
      trends witnessed in the Global E-commerce Software market is growing 
      popularity of mobile commerce. It has been established that more half of 
      the online consumers are either using smartphones or tablets. Viewing 
      the high opportunity from mobile commerce (or m-commerce), several 
      retailers have adopted smartphone applications as a mean to facilitate 
      online sales. Consumers are using Android-enabled smartphones and 
      iPhones for surfing the internet, making reservations, online payments, 
      and for online shopping. This has made mobile commerce as an emerging 
      channel for e-tailing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges is 
      availability of open-source e-commerce Solutions. Magento is one of the 
      leading open-source vendors that enjoy high popularity among 
      enterprises. Magento Enterprise Edition and Magento Community Edition 
      are its popular offerings, of which Magento Community Edition is an 
      open-source offering.

      Baron and Budd Reports That Lipitor Lawsuit Plaintiffs Are Urging 
      Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to Order a 
      Multidistrict Litigation (MDL)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lawsuits involved in the proposed MDL assert that the plaintiffs 
      allegedly incurred type 2 diabetes as a direct result of Lipitor use
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The national law firm of Baron 
      and Budd reports that plaintiffs involved in the Lipitor lawsuits 
      are urging the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to 
      order a Multidistrict Litigation (MDL). Cases like the Lipitor lawsuit 
      are typically consolidated in a MDL in order to speed up the trial 
      process. Most of the Lipitor lawsuit claims involve women who allegedly 
      developed type 2 diabetes while taking the popular cholesterol-lowering 
      drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Both male and female patients have taken Lipitor to treat their LDL, or 
      &#8220;bad cholesterol,&#8221; for over twenty-five years; however, only recently 
      has the associated risk of developing type 2 diabetes come into 
      question. In 2012, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes was brought to 
      the attention of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), initiating 
      a label update for the product to warn about the heightened risk of 
      elevated blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Concerned about recent studies signifying the link between Lipitor and 
      the development of type 2 diabetes, the FDA has also begun to require 
      manufacturers of other cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, such as 
      Pfizer, the manufacturer of Lipitor, to cite the associated sugar level 
      risk on their warning labels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Lipitor is allegedly associated with a higher rate of type 2 diabetes 
      in women,&#8221; said Russell Budd, president and managing shareholder of 
      Baron and Budd. &#8220;Finding whether or not Pfizer sufficiently tested their 
      product for this risk will be imperative to the future of Lipitor 
      lawsuit cases. We are confident that our justice system will support 
      those allegedly harmed by Lipitor use."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The lawyers at Baron and Budd are currently looking into claims 
      involving the alleged development of type 2 diabetes during the use of 
      Lipitor. You may be eligible to file a Lipitor lawsuit with us at no 
      cost to you; for a free evaluation of your potential case, please

      plaintiffs&#8217; law firms in the country. Recently, Baron and Budd was 
      chosen as a finalist for the Public Justice 2013 Trial Lawyer of the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) plans to sell a majority stake in its European insurance business over the next year, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK-based life insurer, Rothesay Life, was established in 2007 and is run by Goldman partner Addy Loudiadis, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of June, Rothesay had $9.66 billion in assets, Goldman said in a quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Last year, the company earned a pretax operating profit of 266 million pounds ($430 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman sold 80 percent of another insurance business it owned, reinsurer Global Atlantic Financial Group, earlier this year because of the way new capital rules would treat its ownership of the business.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aug 8 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors investigating JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co for allegedly violating securities laws are
looking at mortgage bonds created by the bank itself, and not by
companies it bought, according to a source familiar with the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disclosed on Wednesday that was the subject of
investigations by the criminal and civil divisions of the U.S.
Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California, which
includes the state capital and Central Valley region in which
communities were hit hard by the collapse of house prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual during
the financial crisis in 2008. Both those firms had also created
mortgage bonds that contributed to the housing bubble and have
since been subjects of lawsuits as well. But the current
criminal probe focuses on bonds JPMorgan created, the source
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, JPMorgan was informed the office's civil division
had made a preliminary conclusion that the firm violated federal
securities laws in offerings of subprime and Alt-A residential
mortgage securities during 2005 to 2007, the company said in a
quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation is part of drive by President Barack Obama
to hold companies responsible for breaking the law in financing
the housing bubble that caused the 2007-2008 financial crisis
and the Great Recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp was sued by federal prosecutors
on Tuesday for alleged civil violations of laws over the sale of
bonds backed by jumbo mortgages.(ID:nL1N0G71LM)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also adds a new hurdle to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's
campaign to restore the bank's reputation for controlling risks
after losing more than $6.2 billion in 2012 on its so-called
"London Whale" derivatives trades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 8 (Reuters) - Offshore drilling contractor Transocean
Ltd added nearly $2 billion to a near-$28 billion
backlog of work with extensions for two ultra-deepwater rigs in
the Gulf of Mexico for Chevron Corp, an executive said
on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Discoverer Clear Leader, on a four-year contract at
$566,000 per day until September 2014, had its lease extended
four years at $590,000, said Terry Bonno, the vice president of
marketing. The Discoverer Inspiration contract, now at $521,000
a day until March 2015, was extended for five years at $585,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have a lot of work to do in the Gulf of Mexico, and it
certainly makes sense for both of us," Bonno said on a
conference call to discuss quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonno added a note of caution to a generally upbeat
deepwater outlook, saying there may be idle time for rigs as
shorter-term contracts ended and new ones entered the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will be rolling over some of these vessels, and there
may be some time between contracts," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Transocean were down more than 1 percent at $47.90
in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since Transocean's new chief financial officer, Esa
Ikaheimonen, took on his new role after a transformative stint
at rival Seadrill, investors have wondered if
Transocean would put together a tax-advantaged master limited
partnership like Seadrill did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ikaheimonen said there should be clarity on whether 
Transocean would move forward with an MLP within a couple
months, though the company stressed it was an open question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not going to do an MLP for the sake of doing an MLP,"
Chief Executive Steve Newman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLPs pay almost no corporate tax since they deliver nearly
all profits to owners of the MLP units, which trade like stocks.
They tend to be set up for long-lived assets with steady cash
flows, such as pipelines and oil wells, and offshore rigs with
longer contracts can fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Jobless claims rise less than expected in latest week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Indexes: Dow down 0.2 pct; S flat; Nasdaq up 0.2 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Angela Moon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed
on Thursday after an earlier rebound, following three days of
declines, fizzled by mid-morning as investors booked recent
profits amid a dearth of market catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co was among the largest decliners
on the Dow Jones industrial average; shares fell 1.3 percent to
$54.60. The biggest U.S. bank by assets faces a criminal probe
by the U.S. Department of Justice over sales of mortgage-backed
securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S financial sector index was off 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks had inched lower much of this week, pulling back from
record levels, on concerns the Federal Reserve will start to
reduce its stimulus efforts this year as the economy recovers.
Gains in equities have been closely tied to the Fed's
stimulative policy, and many investors are concerned economic
growth may lose steam without the Fed's help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we end lower, this would be the first four straight days
of losses this year. We've had this tremendous rally this year
so the market is just taking a breather, digesting the good
earnings season winding down," said Ryan Detrick, senior
strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was down 33.87
points, or 0.22 percent, at 15,436.80. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index  was down 0.28 points, or 0.02 percent, at
1,690.63. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 7.11
points, or 0.19 percent, at 3,661.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark S 500 is now about 20 points away from the
all-time high of 1,709.67 set last week. Earlier in the session,
it had risen above its 14-day moving average of 1,694.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifting the Nasdaq, Microsoft Corp shares rose 2.5
percent to $32.86.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Tesla Motors Inc jumped 14.2 percent to
$153.46 a day after the electric car maker posted an unexpected
quarterly profit. The stock has been a major momentum favorite
this year, up almost 350 percent in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the data front, U.S. weekly jobless claims rose less than
expected to 333,000 in the latest week. Overseas, China's July
exports rose 5.1 percent, topping expectations and spurring hope
the world's second-largest economy might be stabilizing after
more than two years of slowing growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costco Wholesale Corp's July sales were below
expectations, sending shares 1.2 percent lower to $117.90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Groupon Inc shares soared 24 percent to $10.83.
Late Wednesday, the online coupon company reported revenue that
exceeded expectations and named its co-founder as chief
executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orbitz Worldwide Inc, an online travel agency,
reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings as it booked
more hotel and vacation packages, and it forecast full-year
revenue above current analysts' estimates. 
Shares jumped 34 percent to $12.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priceline.com Inc and Nvidia Corp are
scheduled to report results later Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 434 companies in the S 500 that reported earnings
through Wednesday morning, Thomson Reuters data showed that 66.8
percent topped analysts' expectations, in line with the 67
percent beat rate over the past four quarters. In terms of
revenue, 54.1 percent beat estimates, more than in the past four
quarters, but below the 61 percent average since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

			Chief Operating Officer of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation 
      (MMRF), Walter Capone, Named to the 2013 PharmaVOICE 100
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Capone Honored for Building Collaborative Partnerships to Drive 
      Toward a Cure
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) is proud to announce 
      that Walter M. Capone, MMRF Chief Operating Officer, has been selected 
      for the 2013 PharmaVOICE&#160;100. This annual award recognizes 
      top industry leaders for their positive contributions across sectors 
      such as pharmaceutical, biotechnology, contract research, clinical 
      trial, research and development, patient education, advocacy and more. 
      Kathy Giusti, Founder and CEO of the MMRF, was named to the PharmaVOICE&#160;100 
      in 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As Chief Operating Officer of the MMRF, Capone is focused on 
      accelerating a cure by bringing together researchers and clinicians with 
      the pharmaceutical, biotech, and diagnostic industries, as well as 
      government agencies and informatics technology partners. Capone took a 
      lead role in developing C-MAP, an unprecedented early-access program 
      with partner Onyx Pharmaceuticals, to make Kyprolis&#174; 
      (carfilzomib) available prior to FDA approval.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			PharmaVOICE editors recognized Capone for his innovative 
      leadership of the MMRF: &#8220;Collaboration and inventiveness define Walter 
      Capone. These are the characteristics that have helped him in 
      contributing to changing the treatment landscape for multiple myeloma 
      patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Capone has also helped to spearhead the development of the 
      groundbreaking MMRF CoMMpass&#8480; Study, a longitudinal study involving more 
      than 50 academic and community centers in following 1,000 myeloma 
      patients from the time of their diagnosis through their journey with the 
      disease. To enable the CoMMpass Study, Capone led the development of a 
      novel pre-competitive consortium of pharmaceutical, biotech, and 
      technology companies that, along with all participating centers, agreed 
      to give up intellectual property rights in order to create the richest 
      clinical and molecular database of any cancer available publicly. The 
      comprehensive clinical and molecular data from CoMMpass will be placed 
      in an open-access data portal, which will launch later this year and be 
      available to researchers and clinicians worldwide to drive discoveries 
      and hypotheses to enable precision medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am honored to be named to the PharmaVOICE 100 and to be 
      recognized by my peers is such a humbling experience unto itself,&#8221; said 
      Mr. Capone. &#8220;I have been incredibly fortunate to work closely with such 
      extremely talented and passionate researchers, scientists and other 
      partners who are accelerating the development of the next generation of 
      myeloma treatments. These efforts would not have been possible without 
      the support of patients who inspire our work, and the efforts of my 
      talented colleagues at the MMRF backed by our CEO Kathy Giusti.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2013 PharmaVOICE&#160;100 Honorees were selected by&#160;PharmaVOICE 
      editors based on thousands of nominations, and judged on their ability 
      to motivate and influence research and development, technology, 
      creativity and strategy &#8211; positively impacting the Life Sciences 
      industry through their actions. Winners are published in the July/August 
      issue of PharmaVOICE, which was released on August 1, 2013.

			About Multiple Myeloma
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer. The five-year relative 
      survival rate for multiple myeloma is approximately 41 percent, one of 
      the lowest of all cancers. In 2013, more than 20,000 adults in the 
      United States will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma and nearly 11,000 
      people are predicted to die from the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) was established in 1998 
      as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization by twin sisters Karen Andrews and 
      Kathy Giusti, soon after Kathy's diagnosis with multiple myeloma. The 
      mission of the MMRF is to relentlessly pursue innovative means that 
      accelerate the development of next-generation multiple myeloma 
      treatments to extend the lives of patients and lead to a cure. As the 
      world's number-one private funder of multiple myeloma research, the MMRF 
      has raised over $225 million since its inception and directs 90% of 
      total budget to research and related programming. As a result, the MMRF 
      has been awarded Charity Navigator&#8217;s coveted four-star rating for 10 
      consecutive years, the highest designation for outstanding fiscal 
      responsibility and exceptional efficiency. For more information about

			SHARE in Boston Conducting Special Sessions Focused on IBM 
      zEnterprise BC12
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Conference for enterprise technology professionals will be one of the 
      first places to learn more about and discuss IBM&#8217;s new entry-level 
      enterprise computing offering
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Enterprise technology professionals will have an opportunity to get a 
      first look at and discuss IBM&#8217;s recently introduced zEnterprise BC12 
      (zBC12) platform at the upcoming SHARE 
      in Boston conference, happening August 11-16 at the Hynes Convention 
      Center in Boston, Massachusetts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new zBC12, which offers twice the capacity at the entry level at the 
      same low price as its predecessor the z114, will be featured in multiple 
      sessions beginning Monday, August 12. Attendees will be able to 
      listen to presentations from IBM experts that explain the technical 
      features and practical benefits of moving to the zBC12 platform from 
      other technologies, and will have the opportunity to ask questions and 
      participate in discussions before, during and after these formal 
      sessions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Announced July 23, 2013, zBC12 is designed as an entry point for 
      enterprise computing. It embodies the same innovation and value, 
      flexible growth options, industry-leading virtualization, trusted 
      resiliency, secure cloud, enterprise mobility and operational analytics 
      capabilities as the massively scalable IBM zEnterprise EC12. The zBC12 
      delivers a lower and more granular cost structure with significant 
      improvements in packaging, performance and total system scalability over 
      prior generations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With challenges such as Big Data, cloud and mobile computing 
      top-of-mind with enterprises right now, the mainframe is going through a 
      renaissance,&#8221; said Brian Peterson, SHARE President. &#8220;More organizations 
      are rediscovering that the mainframe already does the things they want 
      to do, such as manage unpredictable or &#8216;spikey&#8217; workloads and protect 
      their data. The zBC12 provides an affordable entry point to it. We are 
      excited that SHARE in Boston will provide one of the first opportunities 
      for enterprise technology professionals to dig in deeply to its 
      capabilities, and hear about its benefits directly from the experts. 
      Anyone who is even remotely interested in improving their organization&#8217;s 
      computing performance should plan to attend these sessions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Beyond educational sessions, SHARE in Boston also offers ample 
      opportunities for attendees to make new contacts through social and 
      networking events. The events are invaluable in helping conference 
      attendees in building their personal and professional networks. 
      Registration for SHARE in Boston is 
      still open, and one-day passes are available for all days, including 
      Wednesday, August 14 when the bulk of the sessions on zBC12 are being 
      held.

			SED Hosts Cutting Edge Reseller Event in Atlanta Partnered with 
      Lenovo and Microsoft around Touch Technology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SED 
      International Holdings, Inc. (NYSE MKT: SED), completed 
      its first Touch focus group partnered with Microsoft and Lenovo July 18th 
      in Atlanta. This cutting edge event hosted reseller companies from 
      various geographic regions to discuss opportunities around the growing 
      SMB touch market. The benefits of the event went far beyond information 
      sessions alone and extended into business planning geared towards 
      equipping resellers with the knowledge and marketing resources needed to 
      dominate in the emerging and exciting touch market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The sessions kicked off with Dan Shapero, Founder ClikCloud, providing a 
      research overview and market trends driving touch technology. Dan 
      brought a wealth of expertise in devising go-to-market strategies for 
      the technology industry. Dan has a proven track record of driving 
      revenue growth, and his enthusiasm, energy and ability to execute have 
      benefited a wide range of hi-tech companies. Dan and Robert O&#8217;Malley, 
      SED&#8217;s President and CEO, co-authored a whitepaper titled &#8220;Is Your 
      Business Built for Touch?&#8221; which was released at the event.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;SED is really taking the lead in driving awareness, understanding, and 
      readiness of its VAR partners on the opportunities surrounding touch 
      devices. This event was a great combination of insightful information 
      delivered directly from Microsoft and its partners, and interactive 
      discussion among all the participants. Our VAR attendees seemed to 
      really embrace Microsoft&#8217;s message around the market opportunities 
      surrounding Touch devices. Microsoft looks forward to being a part of 
      SED&#8217;s next Touch event,&#8221; said Vic Barakat, Senior OEM Distributor PAM, 
      Microsoft Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft&#8217;s Bret Rohloff, OEM Technical Marketing Lead, led an 
      interactive discussion on touch infrastructure from an operating 
      standpoint. That discussion was followed by Chun Lee, Lenovo US 
      Distribution Leader, taking the group through touch technology from 
      Lenovo&#8217;s perspective. Lee&#8217;s session covered Lenovo&#8217;s exciting array of 
      hardware and the market opportunity driving touch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;SED has partnered with Lenovo in educating VAR&#8217;s on the opportunities 
      surrounding Windows XP migration, new touch devices, and upcoming 
      industry trends. Knowledge is key to building the right strategy, with 
      the right OS on the right set of devices. Lenovo&#8217;s focus is to train 
      VAR&#8217;s on how to navigate device confusion and changes to worker 
      productivity to recommend the right business investment for their 
      customers. The SED authored Touch whitepaper coupled with Lenovo&#8217;s 
      Combat demo kits provides VAR&#8217;s a hands on solution when discussing 
      OS/hardware refresh. Lenovo looks forward to continuing this important 
      dialogue with more VARs with SED,&#8221; said Chun Lee, US Distribution 
      Leader, Lenovo North America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The later part of the event was utilized as a workshop for personalized 
      business plan development. The group ended the productive day with the 
      rollout of 10 end user SMB leads for real life execution of Lenovo touch 
      devices into the marketplace.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We believe that by addressing the SMB market with Lenovo Touch 
      solutions, including the marketing support SED is offering, will 
      positively impact our business,&#8221; said Jimmy Maher, President and Owner, 
      Computer Warehouse of Central Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SED&#8217;s Touch Events are helping to give resellers a clear market 
      advantage in this explosive growth area. If you are a reseller 
      interested in this important project or for a copy of SED&#8217;s white paper, 
      &#8220;Is Your Business Built for Touch?&#8221; please call SED at 1.800.444.8962.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is selling its stake in a Canadian oil sands project to Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO) for about $720 million as it focuses on its U.S. shale oil and natural gas operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-cash deal involves the sale of 226,000 acres of undeveloped land, roughly 93 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta, to Exxon Mobil's Canadian unit and Imperial, which is 70 percent controlled by Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the deal closes, Exxon Canada will own a 72.5 percent interest in the land, known as the Clyden oil sands leasehold, with Imperial controlling the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is a natural fit for Exxon, which has invested $11 billion in its Kearl oil sands project in northwest Alberta, and gives it access to even more oil to boost its global daily production, which has slid in recent quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calgary-based Imperial already operates four oil sands projects in Canada and said the stake it is buying from Conoco is a "high-quality addition" to its portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conoco, which has been trying to sell the Clyden stake for months, expects to record a after-tax gain of about $450 million from the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, worth about $3,186 per acre, is a "fair price" for Conoco, said Simmons &amp; Co analyst Jeff Dietert, considering the Clyden land is largely undeveloped and similar deals since 2005 have sold for an average price of $2,550 per acre,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think this is a positive deal for (Conoco) and marks the first of potentially more deals in their oil sands rebalancing efforts as they reduce their oil sands footprint through the remainder of this year and into next," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploration and production companies such as Conoco and Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) have placed billions of dollars of oil and gas properties up for sale in the past year to focus capital on projects that generate higher returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of 2012, Conoco has sold stakes in projects in Montana, North Dakota, Australia, Nigeria and Algeria for a total of about $13.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call last week with investors, Conoco Chief Executive Ryan Lance said the company would continue to sell "non-strategic assets," such as oil sands properties, and use the cash to invest in growth areas like the Texas Eagle Ford shale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are great assets, but one where we believe we're a bit overweighted in our portfolio today," Lance said on the call, speaking of Canadian oil sands and other assets he may sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Conoco spun off its refining operations into Phillips 66 (PSX.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors mostly shrugged off the deal. Shares in Conoco rose 0.6 percent to $66.91. Exxon added 0.4 percent to $91.66, while Imperial dipped 0.1 percent to $41.94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder in New York and Sayantani Ghosh in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ernest Scheyder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aug 8 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips is selling its
stake in a Canadian oil sands project to Exxon Mobil Corp
 and Imperial Oil Ltd for about $720 million as
it focuses on its U.S. shale oil and natural gas operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The all-cash deal involves the sale of 226,000 acres of
undeveloped land, roughly 93 miles (150 kilometers) south of
Fort McMurray, Alberta, to Exxon Mobil's Canadian unit and
Imperial, which is 70 percent controlled by Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the deal closes, Exxon Canada will own a 72.5 percent
interest in the land, known as the Clyden oil sands leasehold,
with Imperial controlling the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is a natural fit for Exxon, which has invested $11
billion in its Kearl oil sands project in northwest Alberta, and
gives it access to even more oil to boost its global daily
production, which has slid in recent quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calgary-based Imperial already operates four oil sands
projects in Canada and said the stake it is buying from Conoco
is a "high-quality addition" to its portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conoco, which has been trying to sell the Clyden stake for
months, expects to record a after-tax gain of about $450 million
from the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, worth about $3,186 per acre, is a "fair price" for
Conoco, said Simmons &amp; Co analyst Jeff Dietert, considering the
Clyden land is largely undeveloped and similar deals since 2005
have sold for an average price of $2,550 per acre,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think this is a positive deal for (Conoco) and marks the
first of potentially more deals in their oil sands rebalancing
efforts as they reduce their oil sands footprint through the
remainder of this year and into next," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploration and production companies such as Conoco and
Marathon Oil Corp have placed billions of dollars of oil
and gas properties up for sale in the past year to focus capital
on projects that generate higher returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of 2012, Conoco has sold stakes in
projects in Montana, North Dakota, Australia, Nigeria and
Algeria for a total of about $13.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call last week with investors, Conoco Chief
Executive Ryan Lance said the company would continue to sell
"non-strategic assets," such as oil sands properties, and use
the cash to invest in growth areas like the Texas Eagle Ford
shale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are great assets, but one where we believe we're a
bit overweighted in our portfolio today," Lance said on the
call, speaking of Canadian oil sands and other assets he may
sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Conoco spun off its refining operations into
Phillips 66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors mostly shrugged off the deal. Shares in Conoco
rose 0.6 percent to $66.91. Exxon added 0.4 percent to $91.66,
while Imperial dipped 0.1 percent to $41.94.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leasehold is located near the southern edge of the

      this week, which feature company co-founder and social entrepreneur 
      Russell Simmons in a variety of unexpected cameo roles. The 60-second

      10-year anniversary.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Emily Flitter and Matthew Goldstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 9 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities are considering
arresting two former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co employees for
their alleged role in masking  $6.2 billion "London Whale"
losses, according to two people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest twist in a scandal that has tainted the
reputation of the largest U.S. bank and led to calls for greater
oversight of its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, the main target
of the investigation is Javier Martin-Artajo, who worked in
London as the direct supervisor of Bruno Iksil, the trader who
became known as "the London Whale," the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States is also looking at Julien Grout, Iksil's
junior trader, according to one of the sources. Both sources
spoke on condition that they not be otherwise identified as the
investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported on Thursday that Iksil, who earned his
nickname after making outsized bets in a thinly traded
derivatives market, is cooperating with the government and will
not face any charges. His cooperation is essential to any
arrest, the same sources said. [ID: nL1N0G924R]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of the possible arrests, which would take place
in London, was not clear, the sources said. U.S. authorities
plan to extradite the former employees to the United States,
they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Martin-Artajo, Iksil and Grout did not
immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. All three
employees have since left the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A HARD YEAR FOR JPMORGAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had to scramble to unwind Iksil's derivatives
positions after they came to light in April 2012, leading to the
massive loss. The loss highlighted the scale of the bank's
risk-taking activities and sparked public outrage. Critics said
JPMorgan should not have been able to engage in such risky
behavior while it engaged in commercial banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil and his team were employees of the bank's chief
investment office, a group of traders and strategists whose
mandate to earn money through bets on exotic products increased
after the 2008 financial crisis. Martin-Artajo's boss, Achilles
Macris, the chief investment officer for Europe and Asia, earned
billions for the investment office, buying cut-price
mortgage-backed securities in the immediate aftermath of the
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trading losses also sparked civil and criminal
investigations, and led to multiple Congressional hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a dozen of the bank's employees changed jobs and
several, including Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, left the
firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's board cut Dimon's 2012 bonus and a shareholder
movement to strip Dimon of his dual role as chairman of the
board drew some support, though it ultimately failed. Two
JPMorgan directors left earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A QUESTION OF MARKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal investigation is focusing on whether anyone
responsible for the trades tried to deliberately hide the losses
them by inflating the value at which they were recorded on
JPMorgan's books at the height of the scandal, during the first
half of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the structure of the group said Grout
recorded the prices of positions on the trading book for the
team. [ID: nL2E8K47A3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of communications between Iksil, Martin-Artajo and
others in the bank also show that throughout the early spring,
as losses mounted in the portfolio, Iksil argued for the group
to cut their losses and sell their positions, but he was ordered
to keep increasing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - For a film once slated to go straight to DVD, Disney's animated adventure "Planes" has some lofty ambitions: it not only wants to be a worthy spin-off of the "Cars" franchise, it also aspires to tell a global story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out in U.S. theaters on Friday, "Planes" portrays a fleet of aircraft that is as loveable as the automobiles in "Cars," an underdog story of Dusty Crophopper who aspires to win the air racing championship that challenges contenders to fly around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modest crop duster faces two problems, sizable ones at that: he's not built for racing and he is terrified of great heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all odds seemingly against him, Dusty trains with veteran naval plane Skipper and qualifies for the race. In his journey, Dusty befriends other racers such as El Chupacabra, a Mexican plane with mannerism and dress of a luchador wrestler, and Ishani, an exotic plane from India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought it would be a great opportunity to throw this hurdle at Dusty, who is a small-town American guy, and actually get him out there to experience the world with all these different cultures and ethnicities and colors and sights," "Planes" director Klay Hall told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film features voice actors including Dane Cook, Teri Hatcher and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, but to tap into the global scope of the story, Hall brought on veteran British actor John Cleese as Bulldog, the oldest racing contender, and Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra to play Ishani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one scene, Chopra's character Ishani flies over India's Taj Mahal with Dusty and says, "I have a billion fans and I can't disappoint them." Hall said that Chopra's own background as a Bollywood celebrity helped bring authenticity to Ishani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAKING A CUE FROM 'CARS'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Planes," made by Walt Disney Picture's DisneyToon Studios for $50 million, was originally planned as a direct-to-DVD release.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Aug 9 (Reuters) - For a film once slated to go
straight to DVD, Disney's animated adventure "Planes" has some
lofty ambitions: it not only wants to be a worthy spin-off of
the "Cars" franchise, it also aspires to tell a global story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out in U.S. theaters on Friday, "Planes" portrays a fleet of
 aircraft that is as loveable as the automobiles in "Cars," an
underdog story of Dusty Crophopper who aspires to win the air
racing championship that challenges contenders to fly around the
globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modest crop duster faces two problems, sizable ones at
that: he's not built for racing and he is terrified of great
heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all odds seemingly against him, Dusty trains with
veteran naval plane Skipper and qualifies for the race. In his
journey, Dusty befriends other racers such as El Chupacabra, a 
Mexican plane with mannerism and dress of a luchador wrestler,
and Ishani, an exotic plane from India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought it would be a great opportunity to throw this
hurdle at Dusty, who is a small-town American guy, and actually
get him out there to experience the world with all these
different cultures and ethnicities and colors and sights,"
"Planes" director Klay Hall told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film features voice actors including Dane Cook, Teri
Hatcher and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, but to tap into the global
scope of the story, Hall brought on veteran British actor John
Cleese as Bulldog, the oldest racing contender, and Bollywood
actress Priyanka Chopra to play Ishani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one scene, Chopra's character Ishani flies over India's
Taj Mahal with Dusty and says, "I have a billion fans and I
can't disappoint them." Hall said that Chopra's own background
as a Bollywood celebrity helped bring authenticity to Ishani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAKING A CUE FROM 'CARS'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Planes," made by Walt Disney Picture's DisneyToon
Studios for $50 million, was originally planned as a
direct-to-DVD release. It was heavily inspired by the success of
"Cars," the Disney-Pixar hit film that made more than $461
million at the worldwide box office, according to Box Office
Mojo. The sequel, "Cars 2," garnered $559 million in global
ticket sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be tough for "Planes" to match the success of
"Cars." The film's opening weekend at the box office is
projected to come in at under $25 million, according to Box

openings in the more attractive release month of June. However,
the "Cars" films cost $120 million and $200 million to make,
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall said he was under strict instruction from "Cars"
director and Pixar co-founder John Lasseter to create new
characters and a universe that would be loosely connected to
"Cars" but not overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the aircraft look credible and adorable is straight
out of the "Cars" playbook. Hall said the biggest challenge was

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Televisa's IDR at 'BBB+', Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed Grupo Televisa, S.A.B.'s (Televisa) foreign 
      and local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB+' as well as 
      the company's long-term national scale rating at 'AAA(mex)'. A complete 
      list of related rating actions follows at the end of this release. The 
      Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Televisa's 'BBB+' ratings continue to reflect the company's strong 
      business position as the leading Mexican TV Broadcaster and one of the 
      largest media companies in the Spanish-speaking world, diversified media 
      and telecommunications portfolio, solid financial position characterized 
      by its robust free cash flow generation and liquidity, as well as 
      extended debt maturity profile. Televisa's ratings factor in the 
      company's exposure to economic cycles, strong competition across 
      business segments and increased regulation in Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings incorporate the company's strategy to expand its business 
      lines through organic growth and acquisitions, which include the recent 
      cash investment in convertible debt of MXN7,000 million and debt 
      instruments (approximately MXN2,500 million) of Tenedora Ares, S.A.P.I. 
      de C.V. (ARES), owner of 51% of Grupo Cable TV, S.A. de C.V. (Cablecom), 
      as well as the investments in Univision Communications, Inc. (Univision) 
      and Mexican mobile operator Iusacell. The company's growth strategy 
      continues focused in the Mexican telecommunications sector and in the US 
      TV broadcasting segment. If Televisa receives regulatory approval to 
      convert its recent investment in ARES into equity, its business position 
      and cash generation will strengthen, while maintaining a stable credit 
      profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Robust Cash Flow from Content Segment:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Televisa's high quality in-house content production has allowed it to 
      maintain its leading position as the largest television broadcaster in 
      Mexico, with stable audience and market shares in the national 
      advertising industry. In addition, the company distributes its content 
      to more than 50 countries, more importantly in the United States (U.S.) 
      through a Program License Agreement (PLA) with Univision in place at 
      least until 2025 and as long as Telvisa remains as a shareholder, which 
      provides additional revenue at minimal cost, strengthening its 
      geographic and currency diversification. Television advertising business 
      in Mexico is in a mature stage and is the largest mass media. The 
      company's network subscription and licensing and syndication businesses 
      are the main growth drivers for this segment, as a result of increased 
      pay TV subscribers in Mexico and higher royalties from Univision.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Economic Activity Correlation and Regulatory Environment:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings consider the exposure to domestic economic activity and 
      increased regulation going forward as a result of the telecommunications 
      constitutional reform approved in the summer of 2013. For Televisa, the 
      impact on its operations could come from the obligation to implement 
      must-offer and must-carry provisions for over-the-air content 
      broadcasted by Pay TV operators, affecting the company's programming 
      segment revenues, as well as the proposal of at least two additional 
      open TV national networks and the authorization of additional foreign 
      investment participation in the industry. On the other hand, Televisa's 
      DTH (Sky) and Cable and Telecom segments could face a more favorable 
      competitive environment given its relative position within the industry. 
      Fitch believes that Televisa's cash generation allows it to maintain a 
      stable financial profile and provides flexibility to manage its leverage 
      levels and debt structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Diversifying Operations:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Televisa's growth in the telecom and Pay TV businesses has resulted in 
      increased diversification from the Content segment revenues (includes 
      Advertising, Network Subscription Revenue and Licensing and 
      Syndication). This diversified business portfolio underpins the 
      company's stable operating and financial performance. Integration 
      between content production and solid distribution channels is strategic 
      for the company, which in turn strengthens the company's business 
      profile compared to its peers in other countries. For the last twelve 
      month (LTM) period ended Jun. 30, 2013, the company generated EBITDA 
      (according to Fitch, Consolidated Operating Income plus Depreciation and 
      Amortization) of MXN27.7 billion, from which the Content segment 
      represented 53%, Sky 24%, and Cable and Telecom 21%. Growth in 
      Televisa's Sky and Cable and Telecom business units has maintain a 
      strong pace, with double digit percentage increases in the past two 
      years, while advertising had a modest growth between 1.5 and 3%. This 
      could result in lower operating margins with sustained CFO generation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Strong Cash Generation:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Televisa's FCF continues robust and sufficient to finance growth and 
      maintenance capex. During the past three years (2010-2012), Televisa 
      invested in Capex approximately USD850 million on average per year, 
      mainly to increase and improve its market and business position in the 
      DTH and Cable and Telecom segments, as well as investments required in 
      the broadcasting assets for the digitalization program, among others. In 
      the same period, given this important capex deployment, dividend 
      payments have remained at the minimum authorized representing 
      approximately USD80 million per year. For 2013 the company's capex 
      guidance is USD1.0 billion and Fitch believes the company's financial 
      position and expected cash flow for the year will be sufficient to 
      complete it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Solid Financial Profile:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings incorporate for the long term a total debt to EBITDA ratio 
      of close to 2.0x and net debt to EBITDA between 1.0x -1.5x. For the LTM 
      ended Jun. 30 2013, total debt including satellite leases to EBITDA 
      (calculated by Fitch) was 2.3x compared to those registered at the end 
      of 2012 and 2011 of 2.2x and 2.4x, respectively. During LTM Jun 2013 net 
      debt (considering total debt - cash and temporary investments) to EBITDA 
      was 1.3x, from 1.3x and 1.5x in FY2012 and FY2011, respectively. Fitch 
      expects Televisa will generate robust cash flow from operations in the 
      next years as business investments mature, in addition to relatively 
      stable debt levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total debt at the end of Jun. 30 2013 is USD5.0 billion, an increase 
      from USD4.5 billion at year-end 2012 as a result of the recent issuance 
      of MXN6.5 billion notes in May 2013, which proceeds are intended to be 
      used to refinance debt and fund capex and other investments. Short-debt 
      of USD67 million is very manageable and large debt maturities are 
      scheduled until 2016, when approximately USD700 million come due. 
      Televisa's liquidity position remains strong with cash and temporary 
      investments as of Jun. 30, 2013 of USD2.1 billion and an extended debt 
      maturity profile. Fitch factors in Televisa's ratings that the company's 
      leverage will remain within its expectations, on a pro-forma basis 
      considering the recent Cablecom transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATINGS SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Expectations of sustained increases in leverage could pressure 
      Televisa's credit quality. On the other hand, international and business 
      diversification in conjunction with constant strengthening of free cash 
      flow and reductions in leverage levels could be seen as positive for the 
      ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In conjunction with the affirmation of Televisa's IDRs at 'BBB+' and the 
      long-term national scale rating at 'AAA(mex)', Fitch affirmed the 
      following ratings:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --USD500 million 6% senior unsecured notes due 2018 at 'BBB+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --USD600 million 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2025 at 'BBB+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --USD300 million 8.5% senior unsecured notes due 2032 at 'BBB+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --MXN4.5 billion 8.49% senior unsecured notes due 2037 at 
      'BBB+/AAA(mex)';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --USD600 million 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2040 at 'BBB+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Assigns IDRs of 'A/F1' to Goldman Sachs AG
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'A/F1' to 
      Goldman Sachs AG (GSAG), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs 
      Group, Inc. (Goldman). The Rating Outlook for GSAG is Stable, in line 
      with the Rating Outlook of Goldman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IDRs of GSAG are equalized with Goldman's IDRs reflecting Fitch's 
      view that GSAG is core and integral to Goldman's business strategy and 
      operations. Fitch believes Goldman would fully support GSAG in the event 
      of need.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSAG is a key part of Goldman's investment banking franchise in Germany. 
      There is a high level of financial, management, and operational 
      integration with other core Goldman operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSAG maintains strong liquidity and capitalization which are augmented 
      by the capacity to tap liquidity and additional capital from Goldman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSAG's IDRs would change in conjunction with any changes to Goldman's 
      IDRs, given Fitch's view that GSAG is a core subsidiary. Please see 
      'Fitch Affirms Goldman Sachs' IDRs at 'A/F1'; Outlook Stable' dated May 
      16, 2013. The IDRs of GSAG could be negatively affected in the unlikely 
      event that Fitch no longer considers GSAG as a core part of Goldman's 
      operations.Fitch assigns the following ratings with a Stable 
      Outlook

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, August 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Issuer
Default Ratings 
(IDRs) of 'A/F1' to Goldman Sachs AG (GSAG), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The 
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Goldman). The Rating Outlook for GSAG
is Stable, in 
line with the Rating Outlook of Goldman.  
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The IDRs of GSAG are equalized with Goldman's IDRs reflecting
Fitch's view that 
GSAG is core and integral to Goldman's business strategy and
operations. Fitch 
believes Goldman would fully support GSAG in the event of need.
GSAG is a key part of Goldman's investment banking franchise in
Germany. There 
is a high level of financial, management, and operational
integration with other 
core Goldman operations. 
GSAG maintains strong liquidity and capitalization which are
augmented by the 
capacity to tap liquidity and additional capital from Goldman.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
GSAG's IDRs would change in conjunction with any changes to
Goldman's IDRs, 
given Fitch's view that GSAG is a core subsidiary. Please see
'Fitch Affirms 
Goldman Sachs' IDRs at 'A/F1'; Outlook Stable' dated May 16,
2013. The IDRs of 
GSAG could be negatively affected in the unlikely event that
Fitch no longer 
considers GSAG as a core part of Goldman's operations. 
Fitch assigns the following ratings with a Stable Outlook
Goldman Sachs AG
--Long-term IDR at 'A';
--Short-term IDR at 'F1'.

      Fitch Downgrades 13 Distressed Classes of JPMCC 2008-C2 on Dos Lagos Sale
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded 13 and affirmed nine classes of J.P. Morgan 
      Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust, series 2008-C2. A detailed 
      list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades reflect the expected losses after the sale of the largest 
      asset in the pool, The Shops at Dos Lagos (12.4% of the pool).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Shops at Dos Lagos, a $124 million real estate owned (REO) retail 
      property, was sold July 23, 2013 for $30 million. Including advances, 
      appraisal subordinate entitlement reductions (ASERs), fees and other 
      unpaid amounts of approximately $41 million, the loan loss severity will 
      be approximately 109% on the current loan balance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Realized losses to the trust will reflect the full principal balance of 
      $124 million. Losses are expected to be incurred as of the Aug. 12, 2013 
      distribution date. Classes C through Q, currently rated 'Csf' or 'Dsf' 
      by Fitch, will be affected. These classes rated 'Csf' are downgraded to 
      'Dsf'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The additional amount of $11.4 million will cause permanent shortfalls 
      to the transaction. These amounts were part of the total $27 million 
      ASER (advances not made due to an appraisal reduction). Therefore, the 
      sales proceeds of $30 million will be used to pay fees, expenses, 
      advances and $16 million of the total $27 million in ASER amounts. The 
      remaining $11.4 million in ASER amounts will not be repaid, while the 
      most senior bondholders with an interest shortfall will recover $16 
      million in interest. No additional interest is expected to be taken from 
      the trust due to the disposition of the Dos Lagos asset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The property is a 345,847 square foot (sf) lifestyle/entertainment 
      retail center built in 2006/2007; therefore, the property was not fully 
      stabilized, with no operating history. The loan transferred to special 
      servicing in October 2008 for monetary default after the borrower 
      indicated the property was significantly affected by the downturn in the 
      economy. The special servicer foreclosed on the property and, along with 
      a third party management team, worked to stabilize occupancy. The last 
      reported occupancy was 72.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The property represented phase one of a two-phase, 534 acre development 
      that was significantly pressured by economic conditions in 2009. The 
      development included a residential subsection, a golf course, hotel, 
      office building, a senior housing development and a 135 acre wildlife 
      preserve. The retail center was 95% occupied at issuance; however, 
      occupancy steadily declined to a low of 68% in early 2012. The borrower 
      cited slower-than-anticipated growth in the residential neighborhood for 
      the decline in performance, as tenant sales, rental rates and ultimately 
      occupancy declined.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The super senior classes' Rating Outlooks are revised to Negative due to 
      the erosion in credit enhancement and continued risk of both principal 
      and interest losses as the pool becomes more concentrated. After the 
      sale of The Shops at Dos Lagos, eight loans (18.4%), including three 
      REOs (1.8%) remain in the pool. Downgrades are possible if expected 
      losses increase or if these classes are affected by repeated interest 
      shortfalls.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades the following classes and revises Recovery Estimates as 
      indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING/MOSCOW (Reuters) - China's biggest energy firm PetroChina (0857.HK) will join Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) in developing Iraq's giant West Qurna oilfield and is in talks with Russia's Lukoil (LKOH.MM) to buy into a second project at the field, industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is already the top foreign player in Iraq's oilfields. A deal at West Qurna, which is around 50 km northwest of the southern oil hub of Basra, would boost its dominance and could make PetroChina the biggest single foreign investor in Iraqi oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Qurna is central to Iraq's oil expansion plans, with enough reserves to pump more than 5 million barrels per day (bpd), and it could rival the world's biggest producer, Saudi Arabia's Ghawar field, when its two phases are running fully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"PetroChina will participate in developing the field," an industry source with direct knowledge of the deal with Exxon said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement would be announced in weeks, the source said, but declined to give further details on how the world's two most valuable listed energy firms would work together in Iraq. Both PetroChina and Exxon declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PetroChina already partners BP (BP.L) at Rumaila, now Iraq's largest producer, and operates the Halfaya and al-Ahdab fields. The company was the first foreign firm to sign an oil service deal in Iraq after U.S.-led forces toppled Saddam Hussein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad signed a series of service contracts in 2009 that committed international oil companies to raising Iraq's oil output by 2017 beyond 12 million bpd - more than Saudi Arabia produces now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure and security problems have since forced the government to cut the target to 9 million bpd by 2020. The issues are so acute Iraq could report a year-on-year output fall for 2013, its first after two years of robust gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the frustrations, Exxon, which holds a 60 percent stake in West Qurna-1, has made steady progress with minority partner Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and the field, a $50 billion investment project, is pumping around 480,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, PetroChina's ex-chairman Jiang Jiemin told Reuters the Chinese energy major was willing to team up with Exxon at West Qurna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GUARANTEED MARKET FOR OIL SALES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PetroChina is also in talks with Lukoil for a stake in another development project at the field, West Qurna-2, a Lukoil source said. The source declined to reveal the size of the stake under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lukoil bosses have already said they would prefer an Asian partner, a Chinese partner, in the project to secure a guaranteed market for oil sales," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lukoil's Chief Executive Vagit Alekperov has said that the company wanted a Chinese firm to replace Norway's Statoil (STL.OL) at the project. Statoil agreed last year to sell its 18.75 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is the world's second-largest oil importer after the United States, and its growth in fuel consumption has driven global oil demand expansion for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with falling demand for imported oil in the United States and Europe, producers from the Middle East, Russia, Africa and Latin America are all competing for a bigger share of China's growing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Qurna-2 is expected to start up this year, produce 500,000 bpd in 2014, and need total investment of $30 billion. Lukoil plans to invest $5 billion in the project in 2013 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Exxon offered to sell its West Qurna-1 stake after a dispute with Baghdad over contracts it signed with autonomous Kurdistan in the north, deals the central government rejects as illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with PetroChina's operations in Iraq said in March the two companies were discussing a deal that would enable Exxon to retain operator status at the oilfield, where Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) is minority partner with 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some industry sources said it was unlikely that PetroChina would buy stakes in both projects, due to their sheer size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Iraq's oilfields are the largest in the Middle East open to foreign investment, making them hard to resist as China's dependency on imports rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"PetroChina is under big pressure to add output and reserves for its size," said a second industry official, who has direct knowledge of PetroChina's investment strategy abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Iraq, given its attractive contract terms, was among the brightest spots for PetroChina's international operations over the past three years, working shoulder by shoulder with global oil majors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate deal, Exxon and PetroChina agreed in late July to jointly study the 3,830 square-km Changdong block in northern China's Ordos basin, the companies said, which industry officials described as containing gas that is hard to access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Peg Mackey in London; Editing by Simon Webb, Ed Davies and Anthony Barker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. authorities are considering arresting two former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co employees for their alleged role in masking $6.2 billion "London Whale" losses, according to two people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest twist in a scandal that has tainted the reputation of the largest U.S. bank and led to calls for greater oversight of its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, the main target of the investigation is Javier Martin-Artajo, who worked in London as the direct supervisor of Bruno Iksil, the trader who became known as "the London Whale," the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States is also looking at Julien Grout, Iksil's junior trader, according to one of the sources. Both sources spoke on condition that they not be otherwise identified as the investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported on Thursday that Iksil, who earned his nickname after making outsized bets in a thinly traded derivatives market, is cooperating with the government and will not face any charges. His cooperation is essential to any arrest, the same sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of the possible arrests, which would take place in London, was not clear, the sources said. U.S. authorities plan to extradite the former employees to the United States, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Martin-Artajo, Iksil and Grout did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. All three employees have since left the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A HARD YEAR FOR JPMORGAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had to scramble to unwind Iksil's derivatives positions after they came to light in April 2012, leading to the massive loss. The loss highlighted the scale of the bank's risk-taking activities and sparked public outrage. Critics said JPMorgan should not have been able to engage in such risky behavior while it engaged in commercial banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil and his team were employees of the bank's chief investment office, a group of traders and strategists whose mandate to earn money through bets on exotic products increased after the 2008 financial crisis. Martin-Artajo's boss, Achilles Macris, the chief investment officer for Europe and Asia, earned billions for the investment office, buying cut-price mortgage-backed securities in the immediate aftermath of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trading losses also sparked civil and criminal investigations, and led to multiple Congressional hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a dozen of the bank's employees changed jobs and several, including Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, left the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's board cut Dimon's 2012 bonus and a shareholder movement to strip Dimon of his dual role as chairman of the board drew some support, though it ultimately failed. Two JPMorgan directors left earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A QUESTION OF MARKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal investigation is focusing on whether anyone responsible for the trades tried to deliberately hide the losses them by inflating the value at which they were recorded on JPMorgan's books at the height of the scandal, during the first half of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the structure of the group said Grout recorded the prices of positions on the trading book for the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of communications between Iksil, Martin-Artajo and others in the bank also show that throughout the early spring, as losses mounted in the portfolio, Iksil argued for the group to cut their losses and sell their positions, but he was ordered to keep increasing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Emily Flitter, Matthew Goldstein and Sam Forgione; Editing by Ken Wills and David Brunnstrom)&lt;/p&gt;

			Law Offices of Howard G. Smith Announces Investigation on Behalf of 
      Investors of Walter Investment Management Corp.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Law Offices of Howard G. Smith announces that it is investigating 
      potential claims on behalf of purchasers of the securities of Walter 
      Investment Management Corp. (&#8220;Walter&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NYSE:WAC) 
      concerning possible violations of federal securities laws. The 
      investigation focuses on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial 
      condition between May 9, 2012 and June 6, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walter, together with its subsidiaries, provides business services, 
      including non-prime and non-conforming mortgage asset solutions, to the 
      residential mortgage industry in the United States. The investigation 
      concerns allegations that the Company misled investors regarding the 
      integrity of its financial reporting, including the reporting of 
      expenses associated with certain financing transactions, and the 
      liabilities of its recent acquisition of Reverse Mortgage Solutions, 
      Inc. (&#8220;RMS&#8221;), a mortgage company with a business model similar to Walter 
      Investment. The investigation further seeks to determine whether the 
      Company lacked adequate internal controls over financial accounting or 
      failed to disclose material weaknesses in the internal controls of RMS, 
      and whether the Company had overstated the value of the RMS acquisition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you purchased Walter shares, if you have information or would like to 
      learn more about these claims, or if you purchased Walter shares prior

&lt;p&gt;(Refiles to fix typo in second paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Both get Russian visas, to go "very soon"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Won't disclose time of travel because of "frenzy" over
affair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Elder Snowden dismisses Obama reform talk as "superficial"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Paul Eckert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The father of Edward Snowden,
the fugitive former U.S. spy agency contractor, has received a
Russian visa and will travel there shortly to see his son, he
and his lawyer said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Bruce Fein said in a television appearance that he
and Lon Snowden were skeptical about President Barack Obama's
pledge to limit government surveillance programs, and they
remain doubtful that young Snowden can receive a fair trial in
the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have visas. We have a date, which we won't disclose
right now because of the frenzy" over the affair, Fein told the
ABC News program "This Week," on which they both appeared. They
will travel to Russia "very soon," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We intend to visit with Edward and suggest criminal defense
attorneys who have got experience in Espionage Act
prosecutions," Fein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lon Snowden told a reporter outside his home in Lehigh
County, Pennsylvania, that he "absolutely" had received his
visa, but had not yet set a date for the trip to Russia to see
his son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The younger Snowden was stuck at a Moscow airport for more
than five weeks before Russia granted him a year's asylum on
Aug. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lon Snowden told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that
he has not spoken to his son since the former National Security
Agency contractor left the United States for Hong Kong, just
before news broke in June of the disclosures he made about the
U.S. surveillance programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the elder Snowden criticized the Obama
administration's handling of his son's case and dismissed the
president's vow on Friday to improve oversight of surveillance,
transparency and other efforts to restore public trust in the
government's programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe much of what he suggested is superficial," Lon
Snowden said on ABC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PUBLIC CRITICISM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snowden's father added that he is "not open" to a plea deal
that would allow his 30-year-old son to return to the United
States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only deal will be true justice," he said, repeating his
concern that his son won't be treated well because his right to
a fair trial has been compromised by public criticism by U.S.
officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you consider many of the statements made by our
leaders, leaders in Congress, they are absolutely irresponsible
and inconsistent with our system of justice," said Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have poisoned the well, so to speak, in terms of a
potential jury pool," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington's inability to persuade Russia to return Snowden
to the United States has curdled U.S. relations with Russia.
Obama canceled a planned summit in Moscow with President
Vladimir Putin, although the two countries held high-level
political and defense talks in Washington on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior U.S. lawmaker from Obama's Democratic Party told
the ABC program that it seemed Washington was more interested
than Putin in forging a productive relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems to me that as we've tried to restart this
relationship several times, that maybe now is a moment to pause
and think about how we're going to move forward with Russia,"   
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez
told ABC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin's government is "unresponsive" to U.S. concerns about
issues such as the civil war in Syria, nuclear disarmament and 
draconian Russian legislation against gays and lesbians, said
Menendez.

			Robbins 
      Geller Rudman  Dowd LLP (&#8220;Robbins Geller&#8221;) (http://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases/microsoft/) 
      today announced that a class action has been commenced in the United 
      States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of 
      purchasers of Microsoft Corporation (&#8220;Microsoft&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) 
      (Nasdaq:MSFT) common stock during the period between April 18, 2013 and 
      July 18, 2013 (the &#8220;Class Period&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later 
      than 60 days from August 12, 2013. If you wish to discuss this action or 
      have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, 
      please contact plaintiff&#8217;s counsel, Samuel 
      H. Rudman or David 
      A. Rosenfeld of Robbins Geller at 800/449-4900 or 619/231-1058, or 
      via e-mail at djr@rgrdlaw.com. If 
      you are a member of this class, you can view a copy of the complaint as 
      filed or join this class action online at http://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases/microsoft/. 
      Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead 
      plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing 
      and remain an absent class member.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complaint charges Microsoft and certain of its officers with 
      violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Microsoft is the 
      world&#8217;s largest software company, primarily as a result of its 
      near-monopoly on Windows personal computer (&#8220;PC&#8221;) operating system 
      software and its Microsoft Office collection of productivity programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants issued 
      materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company&#8217;s 
      financial performance and its tablet computer, the Surface RT. 
      Specifically, defendants misrepresented and failed to make public the 
      following adverse facts: (i)&#160;that the Company&#8217;s Surface RT product was 
      experiencing poor customer demand and lackluster sales; (ii)&#160;that the 
      Company&#8217;s Surface RT inventory experienced a material decline in value 
      during the quarter ended March 31, 2013; (iii) that the Company&#8217;s 
      financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 were 
      materially false and misleading and violated Generally Accepted 
      Accounting Principles and Microsoft&#8217;s publicly disclosed policy of 
      accounting for inventories; (iv) that the Company&#8217;s Form 10-Q for its 
      third quarter of 2013 failed to disclose then presently known trends, 
      events or uncertainties associated with the Surface RT product that were 
      reasonably likely to have a material effect on Microsoft&#8217;s future 
      operating results; and (v)&#160;that based on the foregoing, defendants 
      lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the 
      Company&#8217;s Surface RT product during the Class Period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On July 18, 2013, Microsoft issued a press release announcing its 
      financial results for the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and year end, the 
      periods ended June 30, 2013. For the quarter, the Company reported 
      revenue of $19.9 billion and net income of $4.97 billion, or $0.59 per 
      share. The Company&#8217;s results for the quarter were adversely impacted by 
      a $900 million inventory charge, or an amount equal to $.07 per share, 
      related to Surface RT &#8220;inventory adjustments.&#8221; On this news, Microsoft 
      common stock suffered its biggest price decline in more than four years, 
      plunging $4.04 per share, or 11.4%, on very heavy trading volume to 
      close at $31.40 per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Plaintiffs seek to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of 
      Microsoft common stock during the Class Period (the &#8220;Class&#8221;). The 
      plaintiffs are represented by Robbins Geller, which has expertise in 
      prosecuting investor class actions and extensive experience in actions 
      involving financial fraud.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: Global Output Management Software Market 2012-2016 
      with Esker Software Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., and IBM Corp. Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7qn6hn/global_output) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Output Management Software Market 2012-2016" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Output Management Software market to 
      grow at a CAGR of 1.89 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key 
      factors contributing to this market growth is the need to improve 
      efficiency and reduce the overall cost of document delivery. The Global 
      Output Management Software market has also been witnessing the 
      increasing demand for software-as-a-service based solutions. However, 
      high implementation costs could pose a challenge to the growth of this 
      market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this space include Adobe Systems Inc., Esker 
      Software Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., and IBM Corp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in this report are ASG-Cypress, BMC Software 
      Inc., CA Technologies Inc., Emtex Inc., LRS Inc. Macro 4, Oce Corp., and 
      Solimar Systems Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: One of the main 
      trends witnessed in the Global Output Management Software market is the 
      growth of the social media network. The social media network has become 
      a major data source for many organizations. The increasing advancements 
      in text and the low utilization of paper documents are encouraging 
      organizations to include social media network in their business process. 
      This is because the usage of the social media enables organizations to 
      provide instant feedback through blogs and social networking websites. 
      With the rise of the social media, there is also a high demand to track 
      user interactions on these sites.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the main factors driving the market is 
      the need for fast and easy access to data. Output solutions provide 
      transparent information on enterprise performance and provide better 
      output through the right channel. These solutions also help enterprises 
      to store a large volume of data relating to product portfolios and 
      employee details for future use.

      Leading Food and Beverage Cooperative Selects JunctionFB and Microsoft 
      Dynamics AX for Dairy-Specific Functionality and To Improve Operational 
      Excellence
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Junction Solutions, a leading provider of vertical market-specific 
      on-premise and on-demand software applications and services for the food 
      and beverage and multi-channel retail sectors, announced today that 
      Upstate Niagara Cooperative, Inc., a food and beverage cooperative, will 
      implement JunctionFB&#8482; and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 to support its 
      growth and improve operational efficiency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upstate Niagara is a farmer-owned cooperative consisting of more than 
      360 family-owned dairy farms throughout Western New York and operates 
      five production facilities. The cooperative markets a wide variety of 
      products including milk, dip, ice cream mix, yogurt, cottage cheese, 
      juice and flavored milk-based beverages, under several brands and also 
      is a private-label manufacturer for regional and national retailers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After an evaluation of several leading enterprise applications, Upstate 
      Niagara specifically selected Junction Solutions for its extensive dairy 
      experience and successful customer references, and the rich dairy 
      functionality in JunctionFB that includes dairy accounting and 
      financials, producer payroll, fluid milk and juice production, lot 
      trace, trade promotions management, direct store delivery, wireless 
      warehouse functionality and Genetic Optimizer, an advanced production 
      scheduling application.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JunctionFB provides real-time visibility of a dairy enterprise&#8217;s entire 
      business across its manufacturing and distribution operations. The 
      direct store delivery application optimizes a company&#8217;s routes, and 
      improves the tracking and managing of load and deliveries, all of which 
      ultimately reduces spoilage, decreases costs, improves worker 
      productivity and optimizes margins.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Junction Solutions is delighted to add Upstate Niagara to our large and 
      growing base of dairy customers,&#8221; said Christian Hutter, senior vice 
      president, Manufacturing, Distribution, Junction Solutions. &#8220;JunctionFB 
      specifically addresses the unique challenges of the dairy industry and 
      can accommodate a dairy producer&#8217;s distinct requirements in variability 
      in ingredient quality, availability, costing, regulatory compliance, and 
      speed-to-market in short-life products.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Specifically designed for the food and beverage industry, JunctionFB is 
      an end-to-end enterprise suite of software applications with 
      comprehensive functionality that includes Dairy Accounting, order 
      management, inventory management, batching and blending, production

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prime money market funds raised their holdings of European bank debt in July as investors moved some cash back into money funds from government securities at the start of the third quarter, according to a report by JPMorgan Securities released on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prime money funds' exposure to euro zone banks increased by $12 billion to $212 billion last month after a $18 billion decline in June. Since the end of 2012, the funds have raised their holdings of that region's bank paper by about $16 billion, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the July increase was in French bank debt, which grew by $8 billion to $123 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prime money market funds are seen as slightly riskier alternatives to bank accounts. They could invest in very short-dated bank debt in addition to U.S. Treasury bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. prime money market funds tracked by J.P. Morgan had $1.437 trillion in total assets at the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These funds also raised their holdings of other European bank debt last month, particularly bank paper from Sweden and the United Kingdom by $11 billion to $230 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, prime funds reduced their exposure to Swiss, Canadian, Australian and U.S. banks in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined $15 billion decline in Canadian and Australian exposure last month brought the year-to-date drop in those two countries to $36 billion, J.P.

      Long summer days give people plenty of time to have fun in the sun and 
      stay physically active. There&#8217;s no shortage of pick-up ball games or 
      relay races at the local pool. Through grants to promote healthy living, 
      The Coca-Cola Foundation is making it even easier to get active.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Boys  Girls Club Canada will use its funding to support the Youth 
      Ability to Bring Change program. Through this initiative, more than 
      1,300 youth, ages 6-18, will participate in nutrition, active lifestyles 
      and healthy behaviors programming.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Newark, Foundation support will provide daily basketball clinics for 
      250 youth through the YMWCA of Newark. Players will learn basic game 
      skills as well as the importance of teamwork and living an active 
      lifestyle.

			SUPPORT FOR EDUCATION HEATS UP

		&lt;p&gt;
      Several colleges and universities across the U.S. will receive support 
      for education through the Coca-Cola First Generation Scholars program. 
      The program provides scholarships to students who are the first in their 
      families to attend college. The American Indian College Fund, Indiana 
      University and College of Charleston are among this quarter&#8217;s grant 
      recipients.

			Etron Announces USB3.0 Flash Driver Controller EV266W Receives

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Plug In, Boot and Go with Microsoft Windows To Go
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft Windows 8 introduced the innovative Windows&#174; To Go (WTG) 
      feature, which enables people to enjoy their own applications and access 
      their personal data via any smart display that supports the Windows 
      operating system, as long as they have a thumb-sized flash disk with 
      them. Etron Technology, Inc. (Taiwan GTSM: 5351) today announces that 
      its EV266W Flash Driver Controller has received Windows&#174; To Go 
      certification from Microsoft. EV266W employs a dual-channel design and 
      advanced 72-bit Error Check and Correction (ECC) functionality. It 
      supports 8 CE (Channel Enable) pins per channel, with up to a total of 
      16 CE pins, in a 64-QFN (9x9 mm) package or an 88-QFN (10x10 mm) 
      package. The EV266W Flash Driver Controller and platform enables system 
      manufacturers of USB3.0 flash drives to develop a new generation of 
      USB3.0 device end products and accelerate their technologies to market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To end customers, Microsoft&#8217;s WTG delivers the convenience of smart 
      living with Plug In, Boot and Go capabilities. This allows users to (1) 
      travel light anywhere with their familiar Windows operating system, 
      applications and personal data on a thumb-sized flash drive; (2) turn 
      any display that supports the Windows operating system into a dedicated 
      PC; (3) achieve hassle-free Windows usage without the need to sync 
      programs and personal data across multiple devices; (4) stay fully 
      productive despite computer hardware failure since people can connect to 
      any PC of their choice; and (5) prevent data loss and compute securely 
      and with privacy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since WTG requires frequent remote dataset access, USB3.0 Flash Drives 
      that support WTG must achieve high levels of system stability and 
      reliability as well as excellent random read and write performance. 
      EV266W exceeds these technical demands. EV266W features Etron&#8217;s 
      self-developed, proprietary, and high-speed USB Flash Drive (UFD) 3.0 
      technology which is enhanced by its superb software and firmware 
      development capabilities and its proven world-class circuit design 
      skills. It provides high-speed access technologies that shorten system 
      ON/OFF times, thus accelerating system performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Windows&#174; To Go is one of the most important new features of Windows 8. 
      WTG enables enterprise users to boot a full version of Windows 8 from an 
      external USB drive on multiple host PCs. Since USB3.0 flash drive 
      technology supports a theoretical data transfer speed of up to 5Gb per 
      second, it is considered the best storage carrier for WTG. Leveraging 
      this great opportunity, Etron&#8217;s EV266W USB3.0 Flash Driver Controller 
      and development platform enables system developers to speed their USB3.0 
      flash drive product development. Thus, EV266W meets the need of USB 
      flash driver developers and consumers, allows users to access USB3.0 
      capabilities, supports WTG and shall accelerate the popularity of the 
      overall USB3.0 flash drive market.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most investors increased their holdings of longer-dated Treasuries, betting their yields will decline after last week's $72 billion supply for the government's quarterly refunding, according to a survey released on Tuesday by J.P. Morgan Securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of investors who said on Monday that their holdings of longer-dated U.S. government debt topped their holdings of portfolio benchmarks rose to 21 percent from 15 percent a week earlier, J.P. Morgan Securities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By holding more longer-dated Treasuries, investors increase the duration, or interest rate, risk to their portfolios in expectation of a market rally, which generally causes longer-dated bonds to generate higher returns than shorter-dated debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In J.P.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 13 (Reuters) - Most investors increased their
holdings of longer-dated Treasuries, betting their yields will
decline after last week's $72 billion supply for the
government's quarterly refunding, according to a survey released
on Tuesday by J.P. Morgan Securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of investors who said on Monday that their
holdings of longer-dated U.S. government debt topped their
holdings of portfolio benchmarks rose to 21 percent from 15
percent a week earlier, J.P. Morgan Securities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By holding more longer-dated Treasuries, investors increase
the duration, or interest rate, risk to their portfolios in
expectation of a market rally, which generally causes
longer-dated bonds to generate higher returns than shorter-dated
debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In J.P. Morgan's survey of its Treasuries clients, 64
percent said they were "neutral" in their duration on U.S.
government debt, or owned longer-dated Treasuries equal to their
benchmarks, down from 70 percent last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen percent of its Treasuries clients said they were
"short" in duration of Treasuries, or owning fewer longer-dated
Treasuries than their benchmarks, unchanged from a week earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of "longs" exceeded "shorts" in the latest week by
6 percentage points, compared with a week ago when the share of
longs matched shorts, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early Tuesday trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields
 rose 9 basis points to 2.714 percent following data
that supported a view of moderate U.S. economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among active clients, viewed as making speculative bets in
Treasuries, 62 percent said their longer-dated Treasuries
holdings matched benchmarks, down from 77 percent the prior
week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-three percent of active investors said they held more
longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks, up from 8 percent
last week, while 15 percent said they were short in duration
versus their benchmarks, unchanged from last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan surveys 40 to 60 of its Treasuries clients
weekly, of which 60 percent are fund managers, 25 percent are
speculative accounts, and 15 percent are central banks and
sovereign wealth funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It asks 10 to 20 of its active clients each week about their
Treasuries holdings, of which 70 percent are speculative
accounts and the rest are money managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 13, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Law Offices Bernard M. Gross, P.C. filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court of Massachusetts, 13cv01923, on behalf purchasers of the common stock of MICROSOFT CORPORATION (Nasdaq:MSFT) between April 18, 2013 and July 18, 2013, inclusive (the "Class Period"), seeking to pursue remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than October 11, 2013.&#160;If you wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff's counsel, Deborah R. Gross or Susan R. Gross at 866-561-3600 or 215-561-3600 or via email at debbie@bernardmgross.com or susang@bernardmgross.com.&#160;&#160; Any person who purchased MSFT securities during the Class Period may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of his choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The complaint alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's financial performance and its tablet computer, the Surface RT. Specifically, defendants misrepresented and failed to make public the following adverse facts: (i) that the Surface RT product was experiencing poor customer demand and lackluster sales; (ii) that the Surface RT inventory experienced a material decline in value during the quarter ended March 31, 2013; (iii) that the financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 were materially false and misleading and violated GAAP and Microsoft's publicly disclosed policy of accounting for inventories; (iv) that the Form 10-Q for its third quarter of 2013 failed to disclose then presently known trends, events or uncertainties associated with the Surface RT product that were reasonably likely to have a material effect on Microsoft's future operating results; and (v) that based on the foregoing, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the Company's Surface RT product during the Class Period. On July 18, 2013, shares of Microsoft fell $4.04 or 11.4% to close at $31.40 per share after the company announced its financial results for the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and year end, the periods ended June 30, 2013. &#160;Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all Microsoft shareholders who purchased common stock during the Class Period described above.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all persons who purchased the common stock of MICROSOFT CORPORATION (Nasdaq:MSFT) between April 18, 2013 and July 18, 2013, inclusive.&#160;&#160;The plaintiff is represented by Law Offices Bernard M. Gross P.C.&#160;The firm has expertise in prosecuting investor class actions and extensive experience in actions involving financial fraud.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Law Offices Bernard M.

			Assay Depot Announces Creation of Virtual Research Platform for 
      Pfizer Scientists
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Market Exchange for Innovative Services to Support Innovation, 
      Reduce Costs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Assay 
      Depot Inc., the world&#8217;s leading provider of outsourced scientific 
      services today announced the launch of MXIS (Market 
      Exchange for Innovative 
      Services), a virtual outsourcing platform 
      for Pfizer scientists. MXIS, an Assay 
      Depot Enterprise Solution, brings together research services from 
      thousands of global vendors (aka CROs) into one secure website, enabling 
      Pfizer scientists to communicate with any research vendor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Using MXIS, Pfizer researchers can query the marketplace for services, 
      request quotes, find and compare outsourced services, place orders, 
      track projects, create reports and much more. It is a centralized IT 
      platform that enables Pfizer scientists to create, customize and 
      purchase any research service, and to manage the sourcing project from 
      initial request to service delivery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;MXIS gives scientists rapid and efficient access to innovative research 
      services from any global service provider in Assay Depot&#8217;s network,&#8221; 
      said Robert Kaufman, Assay Depot&#8217;s VP of Engineering. &#8220;With just a few 
      mouse clicks, scientists can quickly order or custom design a research 
      service and then work closely with their outsourcing partners, 
      significantly reducing the time it takes to complete a research project.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MXIS has many of the same features as today&#8217;s popular consumer websites. 
      Researchers can access it from anywhere they access the Internet, 
      including tablets and mobile devices. They also can view ratings and 
      reviews and then add research services and products to their shopping 
      carts and checkout in just a few minutes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The MXIS sourcing system fosters transparency across Pfizer&#8217;s global 
      research operations and external services,&#8221; said Sylvie Sakata, Pfizer&#8217;s 
      Senior Director, External Research Solutions. &#8220;It&#8217;s a new way to empower 
      our scientists and strengthen relationships with our external research 
      partners, promoting innovation across the entire Pfizer research 
      community.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MXIS serves as a benchmarking tool and a research platform designed to 
      benefit the entire chain of RD stakeholders. Additional benefits 
      include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Greater level of integration with preferred service providers
      
			
        Process simplification for sourcing operations
      
			
        Standardization of sourcing governance processes
      
			
        Reduction in costs by increasing efficiency and enabling 
        apples-to-apples comparisons
      
			
        Generation of metrics/tracking that inform development of new sourcing 
        strategies and continuously improve existing ones

			LinguaNext Makes Any Microsoft Dynamics SL Deployment Multilingual
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LinguaPack for Dynamics SL Translates ERP Application&#8217;s Outputs into 
      Seven Different Languages without Any Modifications to Existing Software
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			LinguaNext&#8482;, the 
      market leader in enterprise application language management, today 
      announced LinguaPack&#8482; for 
      Microsoft Dynamics SL, which automatically translates this popular 
      enterprise resource planning (ERP) software product into several 
      different languages without any changes to the application, source code 
      or database. LinguaPack for Dynamics SL intercepts screens, files, print 
      outs and reports, and then automatically presents them to the user in 
      their choice of language including Arabic, Chinese, French, German, 
      Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to industry sources, Microsoft Dynamics SL is the leading ERP 
      platform for the small and midsize business (SMB) sector. It is also 
      preferred by subsidiaries and divisions of larger organizations, 
      especially outside North America. However, Microsoft only offers 
      Dynamics in English and very few other languages, which prevents many 
      businesses from using the software in their employees&#8217; native language. 
      LinguaPack for Dynamics SL eliminates this barrier with an affordable, 
      transparent and easy to deploy solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the significant global adoption of Microsoft Dynamics SL in 
      non-English speaking countries, it is a major handicap for companies 
      that the software is only available in a few languages,&#8221; said Jagdish 
      Sahasrabudhe, CEO of LinguaNext. &#8220;LinguaPack for Dynamics SL makes it 
      possible for existing, and new deployments of this leading ERP platform 
      to natively operate in several different languages. Since LinguaPack 
      technology creates a &#8220;skin&#8221; on top of Dynamics SL, companies don&#8217;t have 
      to make any changes to the program or learn a new interface.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			LinguaPack for Microsoft Dynamics SLLinguaNext&#8217;s 
      transparent approach enables Microsoft Dynamics SL to operate in several 
      different languages with one simple drop down menu and mouse click. It 
      does not require any changes to the Dynamics application code or 
      database. Using the company&#8217;s patent pending Applntercept&#8482; technology, 
      LinguaPack for Microsoft SL transforms outputs before they can be seen 
      on a display and report printouts. LinguaPack maintains the full 
      functionality for all Microsoft SL versions and:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Can run Microsoft Dynamics SL in one language (i.e. Arabic, Chinese, 
        etc.) on some terminals and in English on different terminals at the 
        same time
      
			
        Does not require separate master tables for each language
      
			
        Makes no changes to the Microsoft Dynamics SL source code
      
			
        Supports all add-ons for Microsoft Dynamics SL
      
			
        Imposes zero changes to the database

      for Microsoft Dynamics SL is available for immediate download at www.LinguaPack.net

			Chevron Phillips Chemical One Step Closer to Building USGC 
      Petrochemicals Project
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Company receives project permits from EPA and TCEQ
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP (Chevron Phillips Chemical) 
      announced it received air permits from the Texas Commission on 
      Environmental Quality (TCEQ) for its planned ethane cracker and 
      polyethylene units. Additionally, Chevron Phillips Chemical received a 
      greenhouse gas permit from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for 
      the cracker earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pending final board approval to be sought later this year, the 1.5 
      million metric tons/year (3.3 billion pounds/year) ethane cracker would 
      be built at the Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s Cedar Bayou facility in 
      Baytown, Texas, while the two new polyethylene facilities, each with an 
      annual capacity of 500,000 metric tons (1.1 billion pounds), would be 
      built on a site near the Chevron Phillips Chemical Sweeny facility in 
      Old Ocean, Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We now have the requisite permits in hand to initiate construction of 
      the cracker and polyethylene units and remain in the first mover 
      position leading the way as the U.S. petrochemical industry announces 
      significant expansions of capacity as a result of shale resource 
      development,&#8221; said Ron Corn, vice president of corporate planning and 
      development. &#8220;We are proud of the project&#8217;s progress since we first 
      announced our feasibility study to construct a world-scale ethane 
      cracker and derivatives facilities on the Texas Gulf Coast in March 
      2011.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ethane cracker and two polyethylene units, part of the company&#8217;s US 
      Gulf Coast (USGC) Petrochemicals Project, are expected to create 
      approximately 400 long-term direct jobs and 10,000 engineering and 
      construction jobs. The estimated completion date for the USGC 
      Petrochemicals Project is 2017.

			Annual Visa Global Travel Study: Americans Plan to Spend 40 Percent 
      More on Next International Trip
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Tweet This: American travelers open wallets with plan to spend 40% 
      more on next international trip #VisaKnowsTravel
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the Global Travel Intentions Study 2013 by Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), 
      U.S. travelers crave culture, are tech savvy and plan to significantly 
      increase their travel budget on their next international trip. Findings 
      revealed that travelers plan to spend 40 percent more on their next 
      international trip compared to their last trip, opposed to travelers 
      outside the U.S. who plan to increase travel spend by just 4.6 percent. 
      More than half of U.S. travelers surveyed plan and book their trips 
      using online review and booking sites and 38 percent choose destinations 
      rich in cultural experiences.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Americans have a zest for travel and exploration and these survey 
      results hint at a growing appetite to increase travel budgets,&#8221; said 
      Nick Talwar, head of North American Credit at Visa Inc. &#8220;With increased 
      spending budgets and the desire to manage expenses, traveling with an 
      electronic form of payment is becoming just as important as a passport.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Leaving Cash at Home
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. travelers are more likely than their global counterparts to use 
      credit cards while traveling internationally (81 percent versus 74 
      percent) and, citing cash as cumbersome to carry around, most bring 
      minimal cash during trips. According to the study, having control over 
      their expenditures and security are the top two reasons why U.S. 
      travelers use cards (70 percent).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Results show that Americans enjoy treating themselves while on vacation, 
      with dining (29 percent) and retail (24 percent) accounting for the 
      majority of travel spend.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Internet = Travel Agent
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In an increasingly always-on society, U.S. travelers rely heavily on the 
      Web for planning their travel (79 percent versus 71 percent of 
      international respondents). The differences increase during the booking 
      phase, when Americans are about 20 percent more likely to use online 
      sources than their global counterparts. Americans cited travel review 
      websites and service provider websites and other online sources as their 
      most trusted online resources, with the ability to compare prices as the 
      most important factor in selecting what site to book through.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Picking a Destination
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      When choosing a travel destination, Americans place priority on the 
      area&#8217;s rich culture (38 percent) and good weather (32 percent). Based on 
      these decisions, it&#8217;s no surprise that U.S. travelers have their sights 
      set on trusted regional destinations, like Mexico, for their next trip. 
      While good weather is also top of mind for non-U.S. travelers when 
      seeking out their next travel adventure (34 percent), the demands of 
      their budget ranks second on the priority list (31 percent).

			LexisNexis Integrates Microsoft Outlook in Juris 2.6
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Juris Add-In Automatically Brings In Related Client and Matter 
      Information to Microsoft Outlook; Simplifies Timekeeping; Works How 
      Attorneys Work
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			LexisNexis&#174; 
      Legal  Professional, a leading provider of content and technology 
      solutions, announced today the release of version 2.6 of its Juris&#174; 
      accounting and financial management software for mid-sized law firms. 
      The central feature of the new version is an email plugin integrating 
      Microsoft&#174; Outlook&#174; with Juris for easy access to client and matter 
      information and streamlined time entry within Outlook. The announcement 
      comes on the heels of a similar 
      add-in for Microsoft Outlook and Time Matters&#174; practice management 
      software announced in December.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Most law firm attorneys and timekeepers literally live in email; from 
      discussing matters with clients &#8211; to scheduling important deadlines and 
      keeping track of tasks,&#8221; said Loretta Ruppert, senior director for Law 
      Firm Practice Management at LexisNexis. &#8220;This integration with Microsoft 
      Outlook puts the attorney or legal professional in control by giving 
      them access to the information they need without having to leave the 
      very place where they get their work done.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research supports the notion that legal professionals and timekeepers 
      are significantly reliant on Microsoft Outlook for managing day-to-day 
      activities. According to the ABA&#8217;s 
      2013 Law Technology Survey Report, 82 percent of all law firms use 
      Microsoft Outlook for email and 79.8 percent said they also use it for 
      calendaring. In addition, nearly 100 percent of survey respondents in 
      firms ranging from 10 to 100 attorneys use email to manage legal tasks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Juris&#174; for Microsoft&#174; Outlook&#174; is an add-in that sits 
      unobtrusively on the side of an Outlook window. The add-in automatically 
      brings related client and matter data, and time entry capabilities, into 
      the place where legal professionals work the most. Juris for 
      Microsoft Outlook removes the hassle of toggling between applications 
      saving time and providing relevant matter information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The update also aims to make it easier to capture billable hours since 
      it serves as a visual reminder to timekeepers as they are communicating 
      with clients. In turn, this helps the timekeeper maintain compliance 
      with the firm&#8217;s time submission guidelines. More importantly, it allows 
      timekeepers to more completely capture their time and bill accurately 
      for the legal work performed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Juris for Microsoft Outlook provides the ability to:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Automatically view details on a relevant client or matter record 
        without leaving Outlook.
      
			
        Search for specific client or matter information from within Outlook.
      
			
        Enter billable time associated with a client or matter directly into 
        Juris Suite.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The add-in works with both 2007 and 2010 editions of Microsoft Office 
      and requires Juris 2.6 with the Juris Time and Expense module. Juris 2.6 
      software is available to existing customers with a valid support and 
      maintenance agreement or software subscription at no additional charge.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The federal judge assigned to hear a lawsuit to block the latest U.S. airline mega-merger began her career as a prosecutor, oversaw the resolution of the Microsoft Corp antitrust case and for years presided over a secret surveillance court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly was described by lawyers on Wednesday as a thorough, experienced jurist likely to weigh equally the views of the Justice Department and the two companies that want to create the world's biggest airline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the department's Antitrust Division, six states and the District of Columbia sued to block the proposed $11 billion merger of AMR Corp's American Airlines (AAMRQ.PK) and US Airways Group Inc LCC.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governments alleged the deal would reduce competition and lead to higher fares and fees for consumers, while the airlines countered they would be more competitive as one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kollar-Kotelly, born in 1943, was appointed to the federal bench by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longtime Washington-area judge and lawyer, she went to college and law school at Catholic University in the U.S. capital. A news story upon her appointment as a federal judge noted she had a valuable art collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court clerk's office assigns cases to judges at random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPEED SOUGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is already under pressure to act quickly on the airline case. Lawyers for the airlines said on a conference call with reporters on Wednesday that they want to go to trial as soon as possible, perhaps even by year's end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may suit Kollar-Kotelly fine. A veteran of high-profile cases, she has been urging speedy work in another matter before her. She is overseeing a criminal case against Stephen Kim, a former State Department contract analyst indicted for leaking sensitive information about North Korea to a Fox News reporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is complicated because some of the documents that prosecutors plan to submit as evidence are classified. "I'd like to move and pick up speed in this case," Kollar-Kotelly told lawyers at a hearing in June, expressing frustration with the classification reviews. Last month, she set an April 2014 trial date for Kim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By one measure of judicial speed - the number of motions pending before her longer than six months - Kollar-Kotelly is not especially fast, however. There were 10 such motions as of September 30, 2012, according to a report compiled annually by the federal judiciary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 17 Washington federal judges included in the report, four had more than her and 12 had fewer. Judge Richard Roberts had the most by far, at 86, while two judges had zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speed is especially important in merger cases because of the possibility that one or both companies will lose interest in a deal, antitrust lawyers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An assistant in Kollar-Kotelly's chambers said on Wednesday the judge would not speak with a reporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MANAGING MICROSOFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest antitrust matter Kollar-Kotelly has handled was not a merger, but the lawsuit filed by the Justice Department and 18 states accusing Microsoft of abusing its monopoly in computer operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she took control of the case in 2001, another judge had already ruled Microsoft acted illegally. Her job was to devise a remedy. Her role was further limited because the newly elected administration of Republican President George W. Bush showed less interest than Clinton's in the case, said lawyers who were part of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She appointed a mediator and soon after, Microsoft, the Justice Department and half the states had a deal. The other states later reached a separate deal. Kollar-Kotelly monitored Microsoft's compliance until 2011, when the case finally entered the history books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was a bit unfamiliar with the antitrust laws when she began the case, but she's much more familiar now," said Stephen Houck, a lawyer who represented the nine hold-out states, including California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one of Microsoft's lawyers, Rick Rule, will see Kollar-Kotelly again in the airline case. He represents US Airways. He declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOSPITAL TO INTELLIGENCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some of her colleagues on the federal bench, Kollar-Kotelly has neither long experience as a prosecutor nor years at a large, corporate law firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three years in the Justice Department's Criminal Division to begin her career, she worked for more than a decade as a lawyer for Washington's St. Elizabeths Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She became a judge in the city's local trial court in 1984 - hearing murder cases and other criminal matters - and stayed in the position until the appointment by Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Chief Justice William Rehnquist in 2002 chose her to lead the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the secret panel of federal judges that considers government applications for surveillance and searches in intelligence matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court was a target of worldwide criticism in June when an order leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden showed the court had authorized a massive database of daily telephone data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kollar-Kotelly took the unusual step of releasing a statement to The Washington Post defending the court's independence and her tenure on it from 2002 to 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I participated in a process of adjudication, not 'coordination' with the executive branch," she said, responding to an allegation that the judges were too willing to approve applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another antitrust matter, she oversaw a suit by the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces U.S. antitrust law alongside the Justice Department, alleging illegal collusion between drugmakers Warner Chilcott PLC and Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors brought criminal charges on Wednesday against two former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co employees in the trading scandal that cost the bank $6.2 billion last year, but the trader nicknamed "the London Whale" because of the size of losses was not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trader Bruno Iksil, who is cooperating with federal prosecutors, pushed back against the efforts of his former colleagues Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout to hide the mounting losses, according to court filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manhattan federal prosecutors charged Martin-Artajo and Grout, who each worked for JPMorgan's chief investment office in London, with wire fraud and conspiracy to falsify books and records related to the trading losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charges, the first to arise from a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into the Whale scandal, say the two deliberately tried to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in losses on trades in a portfolio of synthetic credit derivatives tied to corporate debt. Such derivatives are financial instruments designed to bet on the probability of corporate default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the incident shows how much damage a small group of traders can do to a major bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losses from the trades, which were made in the London division of JPMorgan's chief investment office, first became public in April 2012 in a media report about the squeeze put on Iksil's group by competitors in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was not a tempest in a teapot, but rather a perfect storm of individual misconduct and inadequate internal controls," said Bharara at a press conference announcing the charges. He was referring to a comment made by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who initially dismissed the losses as a "tempest in a teapot," a comment that would come back to haunt the man who runs the nation's largest bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear when Martin-Artajo and Grout will come to the United States to be formally arraigned. Grout, who is French and is married to an American, is living with his parents in France and Martin-Artajo, who is Spanish, lives in London with his wife and children. If the men do not agree to appear voluntarily, U.S. authorities will seek to extradite them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope they'll do the right thing and face the charges," Bharara said, adding the United States would pursue extradition if it was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraditing Martin-Artajo from either Britain or Spain should prove easier than getting Grout sent from France, which does not extradite its citizens. But if Grout decided to avoid facing charges, he would have to remain in France or risk arrest upon leaving the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Grout and Martin-Artajo have said that their clients did nothing wrong. Neither Grout's lawyer, Edward J. M. Little, nor Martin-Artajo's lawyers, Richard Smith and Lista Cannon, could be reached for comment after the charges were filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil earned the nickname "the London Whale" for the size of the derivatives trades he made in late 2011 and early 2012. Though initially blamed for the bad decisions leading to the losses, the charges against his former colleagues are now casting him in a more heroic light, at least according to federal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil emerges in the criminal complaints as a pivotal voice during the escalating scandal, a dissenter who wanted to quickly exit the unwieldy trading positions and who at times tried to argue against hiding the group's mounting losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOWN-PLAYING LOSSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal complaints include references to several conversations and email exchanges in which Iksil tells Grout he takes issue with Martin-Artajo's instructions to minimize reported losses. In a conversation on March 16, 2012, authorities quote Iksil as telling Grout: "I don't know where he (Martin-Artajo) wants to stop, but it's getting idiotic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 30, according to the charging documents, Martin-Artajo asked Grout to report losses of only $200 million, even though Grout had estimated the day's losses as being $250 million. They eventually whittled the losses down even further, to $150 million and then to $138 million, before Grout eventually filed the price report late that evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks later, in a conversation with Iksil, Grout ruminated on how to report more losses on the portfolio without igniting a firestorm among the bank's upper managers. He appeared to want to downplay the loss amounts while keeping them realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't want to show something that is too false," Grout said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grout, 35, was Iksil's deputy and was in charge of marking the values of the trades in the group's books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, 49, was Iksil's direct boss in the chief investment office. Prosecutors accuse him of pressuring Iksil and Grout to report prices at more favorable levels, according to the court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had to scramble to unwind Iksil's derivatives positions after they came to light. The loss tainted the reputation of the bank and of Dimon, and led to calls for greater oversight.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Emily Flitter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 14 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors brought
criminal charges on Wednesday against two former JPMorgan Chase
&amp; Co employees in the trading scandal that cost the bank
$6.2 billion last year, but the trader nicknamed "the London
Whale" because of the size of losses was not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trader Bruno Iksil, who is cooperating with federal
prosecutors, pushed back against the efforts of his former
colleagues Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout to hide the
mounting losses, according to court filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manhattan federal prosecutors charged Martin-Artajo and
Grout, who each worked for JPMorgan's chief investment office in
London, with wire fraud and conspiracy to falsify books and
records related to the trading losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charges, the first to arise from a Federal Bureau of
Investigation probe into the Whale scandal, say the two
deliberately tried to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in
losses on trades in a portfolio of synthetic credit derivatives
tied to corporate debt. Such derivatives are financial
instruments designed to bet on the probability of corporate
default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the incident
shows how much damage a small group of traders can do to a major
bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losses from the trades, which were made in the London
division of JPMorgan's chief investment office, first became
public in April 2012 in a media report about the squeeze put on
Iksil's group by competitors in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was not a tempest in a teapot, but rather a perfect
storm of individual misconduct and inadequate internal
controls," said Bharara at a press conference announcing the
charges. He was referring to a comment made by JPMorgan CEO
Jamie Dimon, who initially dismissed the losses as a "tempest in
a teapot," a comment that would come back to haunt the man who
run's the nation's largest bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear when Martin-Artajo and Grout will come to the
United States to be formally arraigned. Grout, who is French and
is married to an American, is living with his parents in France
and Martin-Artajo, who is Spanish, lives in London with his wife
and children. If the men do not agree to appear voluntarily,
U.S. authorities will seek to extradite them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope they'll do the right thing and face the charges,"
Bharara said, adding the United States would pursue extradition
if it was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraditing Martin-Artajo from either Britain or Spain
should prove easier than getting Grout sent from France, which
does not extradite its citizens. But if Grout decided to avoid
facing charges, he would have to remain in France or risk arrest
upon leaving the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Grout and Martin-Artajo have said that their
clients did nothing wrong. Neither Grout's lawyer, Edward J. M.
Little, nor Martin-Artajo's lawyers, Richard Smith and Lista
Cannon, could be reached for comment after the charges were
filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil earned the nickname "the London Whale" for the size of
the derivatives trades he made in late 2011 and early 2012.
Though initially blamed for the bad decisions leading to the
losses, the charges against his former colleagues are now
casting him in a more heroic light, at least according to
federal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil emerges in the criminal complaints as a pivotal voice
during the escalating scandal, a dissenter who wanted to quickly
exit the unwieldy trading positions and who at times tried to
argue against hiding the group's mounting losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOWN-PLAYING LOSSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criminal complaints include references to several
conversations and email exchanges in which Iksil tells Grout he
takes issue with Martin-Artajo's instructions to minimize
reported losses. In a conversation on March 16, 2012,
authorities quote Iksil as telling Grout: "I don't know where he
(Martin-Artajo) wants to stop, but it's getting idiotic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 30, according to the charging documents,
Martin-Artajo asked Grout to report losses of only $200 million,
even though Grout had estimated the day's losses as being $250
million. They eventually whittled the losses down even further,
to $150 million and then to $138 million, before Grout
eventually filed the price report late that evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks later, in a conversation with Iksil, Grout
ruminated on how to report more losses on the portfolio without
igniting a firestorm among the bank's upper managers. He
appeared to want to downplay the loss amounts while keeping them
realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't want to show something that is too false," Grout
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grout, 35, was Iksil's deputy and was in charge of marking
the values of the trades in the group's books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, 49, was Iksil's direct boss in the chief
investment office. Prosecutors accuse him of pressuring Iksil
and Grout to report prices at more favorable levels, according
to the court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had to scramble to unwind Iksil's derivatives
positions after they came to light. The loss tainted the
reputation of the bank and of Dimon, and led to calls for
greater oversight. It also highlighted the scale of the bank's
risk-taking activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics said JPMorgan should not have been able to engage in
such risky behavior while it engaged in commercial banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint against Martin-Artajo said he also manipulated
the single person who is not named in the complaint, whose role
it was to independently review the prices of trading positions
marked in the chief investment office's books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The defendant and his co-conspirators took full advantage
of the freedom" offered by the unnamed person's flimsily
structured office, called the "valuation control group," the
complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint said Martin-Artajo and his team did this by
talking to the valuation control group employee and sharing with
him only selected price quotes they had received "with the
result that the CIO VCG ultimately did not perform a meaningful
check on the trader valuations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two men each face charges of conspiracy, falsifying
books and records, wire fraud, and causing false statements to
be made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They may
face up to 25 years each in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maximum fines for their charges are $250,000 each, or
twice the gross gain or loss from the offenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a related
civil complaint against Martin-Artajo and Grout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil will not face criminal charges, according to the
cooperation agreement, which was signed on June 20. His
testimony helped build the cases against his former colleagues;
he appears in both sets of charges as "cw-1," an unnamed
cooperating witness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil was fired along with Martin-Artajo last year, as the
scandal surrounding the bank's losses escalated.&lt;/p&gt;

      approve the payment by entering their PIN. SEQR works just as well for 
      physical transactions as for e-commerce, and is both faster and more 
      secure than card payments. The technology behind the solution means that 
      there is no investment cost for retailers. All that is required is a QR 
      code or NFC sticker at the POS terminal. In addition, the low 
      transaction charges allow the retailer to save money.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Aug 16 (Reuters) - China's Ministry of Public
Security and a cabinet-level research centre are preparing to
probe IBM Corp, Oracle Corp and EMC Corp
 over security issues, the official Shanghai Securities
News said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report follows revelations by former U.S. spy agency
contractor Edward Snowden of widespread surveillance by the
National Security Agency and his assertion that the agency
hacked into critical network infrastructure at universities in
China and in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documents leaked by Snowden revealed that the NSA has had
access to vast amounts of Internet data such as emails, chat
rooms and video from large companies, including Facebook and
Google, under a government programme known as Prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At present, thanks to their technological superiority, many
of our core information technology systems are basically
dominated by foreign hardware and software firms, but the Prism
scandal implies security problems," the newspaper quoted an
anonymous source as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, Oracle and EMC were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China, repeatedly accused by the United States of hacking,
was given considerable ammunition by Snowden's allegations,
which Beijing has used to point the finger at Washington for
hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese regulators and the police have begun a series of
investigations in recent weeks into how foreign and domestic
companies do business in the world's second-biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades 7 Classes of JPMCC 2005-LDP5
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded seven classes and affirmed 15 classes of 
      J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Series Corp. commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates series 2005-LDP5. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades are a result of further cash flow deterioration to the 
      underlying collateral of the pool. The affirmations are due to 
      sufficient credit enhancement relative to modeled losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 8.5% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 7%, including $22.9 million (0.5% of the 
      original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 
      30 loans (21%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes nine specially 
      serviced assets (10.4%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the July 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 21.6% to $3.39 billion from $4.33 billion at 
      issuance. Per the servicer reporting, four loans (1.1% of the pool) are 
      defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes K through 
      NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is the specially-serviced 
      real estate owned (REO) property (2.5% of the pool), which is secured by 
      a 706,005 square foot (sf) mall located in Hanover, MA. The loan 
      transferred to special servicing in November 2009 due to imminent 
      default and foreclosure of the property occurred in February 2010. The 
      special servicer reported occupancy of in-line space was 86.9%, of which 
      76% were permanent tenants, as of April 31, 2013. The property has not 
      yet been listed for sale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is a specially-serviced 
      loan (2.9%), which is secured by a 526,245 sf office complex located in 
      Irving, TX. The loan transferred to the special servicer in March 2012 
      due to a covenant default after failing to fund reserves. The property 
      is 100% leased to NEC America, Inc., however they subleased 
      approximately 50% of their space to several other small tenants. The 
      special servicer reports the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 1.51 
      times (x) as of year-end 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is the Atlantic 
      Development Portfolio loan (2.5%), which is secured by five office 
      complexes and two industrial properties located in Somerset and Warren, 
      NJ. The properties have suffered from poor performance over the last 
      several years with rents below market. The servicer reported occupancy 
      and DSCR was 73.8% and 0.81x as of year-end 2012. One of the buildings 
      remains vacant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlooks on classes A-2 through A-M remain Stable due to 
      increasing credit enhancement and continued paydown. Classes B through F 
      also remain Stable due to stronger credit enhancement relative to their 
      ratings. The Rating Outlooks on classes A-J and G are Negative, as 
      future downgrades may be possible should realized losses be greater than 
      expected, particularly associated with the first and third largest 
      contributors to losses. Loss expectations may increase on the REO 
      property in Hanover, MA, if additional tenants leave at their lease 
      expirations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades the following classes and assigns Recovery Estimates 
      (REs) as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$26.2 million class B to 'Asf' from 'AAsf', Outlook Stable;

      The class A-1 and A-2FL certificates have paid in full. Fitch does not 
      rate the class NR, HG-1, HG-2, HG-3, HG-4 and HG-5 certificates. Fitch 
      previously withdrew the ratings on the interest-only class X-1 and X-2 
      certificates.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Energy majors Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) are among the suitors advancing to the next round of bidding for Newfield Exploration Co's (NFX.N) Malaysian and Chinese oil and gas fields valued at about $1.2 billion, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newfield and Hess Corp (HES.N) are among a number of U.S. energy companies unloading ageing and less productive oil and gas fields to invest in more strategic and profitable projects, particularly in and close to their home markets. The moves are driven in part by activist shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly a dozen suitors were attracted to Newfield's auction that kicked off about two months ago. Newfield's advisor, Goldman Sachs (GS.N), has whittled down to the list to at least four, inviting Canada's Talisman Energy Inc (TLM.TO) and KUFPEC, a unit of Kuwait Petroleum Corp, to submit second-round bids in mid-September along with Exxon and Shell, the people added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The management is of one mind and that is to sell the assets and refocus on North America," one person familiar with the matter told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newfield, the fourth-largest oil producer in Malaysia, has an interest in about 3.3 million net acres offshore Malaysia and about 290,000 net acres offshore China. The Malaysian fields accounted for 39 percent of Newfield's revenues in 2012, while the Chinese fields accounted for 3.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) PETR.UL, Malaysia's state oil firm, will be the key to the domestic sale, since it is the operator of some of the blocks in the Malay Basin in which Newfield holds an interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Almost all the companies that got through for the Malaysian assets have a good working relationship with Petronas, which awards the production-sharing contracts. So it would be an easy fit then," one person familiar with the process said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newfield, which has a market value of $3.2 billion, warned of a 25-30 percent decline in its international production due to natural declines in its Malaysian fields among other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodlands, Texas-based Newfield, Exxon and Shell declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co executives who supervised the traders at the center of the "London Whale" scandal are unlikely to face any charges over a trading debacle that cost the largest U.S. bank more than $6.2 billion, people familiar with the probe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors on Wednesday brought criminal charges against two former JPMorgan traders - Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout - accusing the pair of deliberately understating losses on the trades on JPMorgan's books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaints make only passing reference to their former bosses. Neither Ina Drew, the bank's former chief investment officer, nor Achilles Macris, a former top Chief Investment Office executive, are mentioned by name in the complaints filed in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filings refer to Drew and Macris only by their titles and said they put pressure on their subordinates at one point to deal with the high degree of risk being taken on in the portfolio of derivatives trades that led to the losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no allegation in the complaints that either Drew or Macris did anything wrong or encouraged Martin-Artajo and Grout to conceal the losses, which first began to be publicly disclosed in May 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the trader most identified with the losses, is cooperating with federal prosecutors in an agreement which means he will not face charges. Iksil was known as "the London Whale" because of the size of derivatives trades he made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, when asked by reporters on Wednesday about the prospect of additional actions against higher executives, said: "These are the charges we have brought." He said that the investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the two senior executives may emerge from the year-long investigation unscathed is a sign that the scandal may not do much additional damage to the bank's image or the reputation of its chief executive, Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While almost never commenting publicly on Macris, Dimon and his team have cast Drew as a hard-working, loyal veteran of the bank who was betrayed by a small group of rogue employees in her division of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Richards, the lawyer for Drew, did not return calls seeking comment. Edward O'Callaghan, a lawyer for Macris, declined comment. Neither Drew nor Macris could be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macris, who ran the London division of the CIO and was Martin-Atajo's supervisor, is not cooperating with investigators and long ago returned to his native Greece, according to a person familiar with his situation. He received relatively little attention in a report on the debacle earlier this year from an investigative committee of the U.S. Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drew, who resigned when the losses became public, was once a member of Dimon's elite operating committee of executives. She was criticized in the company's internal investigation for failing to understand the risks the London traders had been taking as they made $2 billion in profits over several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also said she did not ensure that the mechanisms to monitor the risk being taken on by her traders were working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUPERVISION QUESTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement lawyers said they believed there may be grounds for pursuing a civil failure-to-supervise claim against Drew and possibly Macris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, the lawyers say, regulators would have to believe there is sufficient evidence that the pair did not heed warning signs about the attempts to hide the losses early last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no indication that the SEC is planning to bring such a case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC, for now, is only looking to force JPMorgan to pay a fine and admit wrongdoing as part of a regulatory settlement, said people familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior SEC official did not return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts pointed to the recent administrative failure-to-supervise claim the SEC filed against hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen as precedent for holding bosses accountable for the wrongful acts of their employees. The SEC charged Cohen will overlooking signs of unlawful insider trading at his $14 billion SAC Capital Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Gorman, a partner at Dorsey &amp; Whitney in Washington and a former senior SEC enforcement lawyer, said a failure-to- supervise claim is still possible.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Aug. 16, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz Grossman Hufford Dahlstrom  Gross LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Walter Investment Management Corp. ("Walter Investment" or the "Company") (NYSE:WAC) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, and docketed under 13 cv 1916 T27TBM, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of Walter Investment between May 9, 2012 and June 6, 2013 both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"). This class action seeks to recover damages against the Company and certain of its officers and directors as a result of alleged violations of the federal securities laws pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you are a shareholder who purchased Walter Investment securities during the Class Period, you have until September 23, 2013 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll free, x237. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and number of shares purchased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Walter Investment is a loan servicer and business solutions provider focused on generating recurring, fee-based revenues from an "asset-light" platform. The Company specializes in offering creative, structured solutions to owners of less-than-prime, non-conforming and other credit-challenged mortgage assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company lacked adequate internal controls over financial accounting; (2) the Company's internal controls were not effective; (3) the Company's financial statements contained false and misleading statements; (4) the Company had failed to disclose material weaknesses in the internal controls of its recent acquisition Reverse Mortgage Solutions, Inc. ("RMS"); (5) the Company had overstated the value of RMS; and (6) as a result of the foregoing, the Company's statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On March 18, 2013, the Company shocked investors by disclosing that, based on an evaluation by the Company's Board of Directors and management, "our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of this material weakness, management has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective." On this news the Company's shares fell $8.61 per share or over 20% percent to close at $32.98 per share on March 19, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On June 6, 2013, the Company reported that, [s] "Subsequent to the completion of the RMS Acquisition, the Company discovered a failure to record certain estimated liabilities to investors relating to servicing errors by RMS." The Company concluded after preliminary review that RMS historical financial statements, and the related reports of RMS historical independent registered public accounting firm, "should no longer be relied upon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Florida, and San Diego, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 70 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Robert S. Willoughby

It also comes as Beijing probes Western drugmakers over allegations of bribery and over-pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documents leaked by Snowden revealed that the NSA has had access to vast amounts of Internet data such as emails, chat rooms and video from companies including Facebook Inc and Google Inc, under a government program known as Prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At present, thanks to their technological superiority, many of our core information technology systems are basically dominated by foreign hardware and software firms, but the Prism scandal implies security problems," the newspaper quoted an anonymous source as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with EMC, IBM and Oracle declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's Ministry of Public Security also declined to comment. The State Council's Development Research Centre, one of the groups reportedly involved, told Reuters they were not carrying out such an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has been a focal point for the Snowden case since he stopped in Hong Kong en route to Moscow. He also claimed that the NSA hacked into critical network infrastructure at universities in China and in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Castro, a senior analyst with the Information Technology &amp; Information Foundation, said he was concerned that a Chinese government probe could result in demands for U.S. companies to provide authorities with the blueprints to their technology so that Beijing can screen them for potential security threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China, repeatedly accused by the United States of hacking, was given considerable ammunition by Snowden's allegations, which Beijing has used to point the finger at Washington for hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese regulators and the police have begun a series of investigations in recent weeks into how foreign and domestic companies do business in the world's second-biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Prism scandal certainly provides ample material for real concern," said Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based market intelligence firm Marbridge Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What the scandal has done is make it increasingly difficult to ascertain what is being done out of legitimate concern and what may be being done for any sort of political reasons," said Natkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts have warned that Snowden's leaks could hurt the sales of U.S. technology companies in Asia and Europe, as reports of their complicity with NSA spying programs may lead foreign businesses and governments to purchase equipment and services from non-U.S. suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation, a think tank, last week projected that U.S. cloud computing firms could lose $21.5 billion in sales over the next three years, eventually ceding 10 percent of the foreign market to European and Asian competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), which oversees China's IT industry, said it could not confirm anything because of the matter's sensitivity. Another MIIT official told Reuters they were unaware of the reported probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Pete Sweeney in Shanghai and Paul Carsten in Beijing.

companies do business in the world's second-biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Prism scandal certainly provides ample material for
real concern," said Mark Natkin, managing director of
Beijing-based market intelligence firm Marbridge Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What the scandal has done is make it increasingly difficult
to ascertain what is being done out of legitimate concern and
what may be being done for any sort of political reasons," said
Natkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts have warned that Snowden's leaks could hurt the
sales of U.S. technology companies in Asia and Europe, as
reports of their complicity with NSA spying programs may lead
foreign businesses and governments to purchase equipment and
services from non-U.S. suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation, a think tank, last week projected that U.S.
cloud computing firms could lose $21.5 billion in sales over the
next three years, eventually ceding 10 percent of the foreign
market to European and Asian competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology (MIIT), which oversees China's IT industry, said it
could not confirm anything because of the matter's sensitivity.
Another MIIT official told Reuters they were unaware of the
reported probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 16 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has
reached a settlement with the liquidators for two Bear Stearns
mortgage-laden hedge funds whose collapse in 2007 sent waves
through the subprime securities market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court filing docketed Friday showed the liquidators had
agreed to voluntarily drop the long-running lawsuit, which
sought to recover at least $1.1 billion in losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terms of a settlement with Bear Stearns Cos, which JPMorgan
acquired in 2008, were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was brought by the liquidators for Bear Stearns
High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies (Overseas) Ltd and Bear
Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced
Leverage (Overseas) Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in 2008,
accused Bear Stearns Co and the fund's former managers of
failing to properly structure the hedge funds and provide
adequate oversight for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit also accused them of engaging in a "pattern of
misrepresentations and deceptive conduct."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit said the actions of Bear and the ex-managers led
to the collapse of the hedge funds in 2007, an event the
complaint said was considered a precipitating factor in the
global financial crisis that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit named not just Bear Stearns but also Ralph
Cioffi and Matthew Tanni, two former senior managing directors
at Bear who managed the subprime mortgage-crammed funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cioffi and Tannin were indicted on fraud charges in June
2008 in connection with the hedge funds' collapse, which the
Justice Department at the time said caused more than $1 billion
in investor losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal jury in Brooklyn acquitted the two men in 2009 in

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aug 16 (Reuters) - InterOil Corp and ExxonMobil Corp
 remain in talks to jointly develop InterOil's Elk and
Antelope natural gas fields in Papua New Guinea, InterOil said
on Friday after a website reported negotiations had ended
without an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InterOil's shares fell as much as 12 percent following the
report in PNG Industry News. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news service, citing an unidentified source, said the
talks were "dead" and that ExxonMobil's exclusive period for
negotiations had ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InterOil, responding to a query from the New York Stock
Exchange, said its policy was to not comment on market
speculation or negotiations. But it added: "Negotiations with
ExxonMobil Papua New Guinea Ltd regarding an agreement to
monetize the Elk and Antelope fields are ongoing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil spokesman Patrick McGinn declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil needs gas for its $19 billion Papua New Guinea
liquefied natural gas (PNG LNG) project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InterOil, which has its headquarters in Cairns, Australia,
was awarded the license to develop the fields in November 2010.
The license covers nine blocks surrounding the Elk and Antelope
fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks also included funding of InterOil and its partner
Pacific LNG to drill additional delineation wells in the fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InterOil shares were down 5 percent at $70.38 in early
afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
LONDON, August 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed
Turkey-based Coca-Cola 
Icecek A.S.'s (CCI) Long-term foreign and local currency Issuer
Default Ratings 
(IDR) and senior unsecured rating at 'BBB'. The Outlooks on the
IDRs are Stable.
The ratings reflect CCI's strong presence in high-growth
markets, the 
expectation of moderate leverage and cash flow generation, as
well as the 
continued operational support and oversight provided by The
Coca-Cola Company 
(TCCC, 'A+'/Stable). The ratings also incorporate implied
support from TCCC as 
it holds 20.1% interest in CCI. At the same time, due to its
debt mostly being 
denominated in USD and euros, CCI's balance sheet remains
vulnerable to any 
devaluation of the Turkish lira.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
Strong Coca-Cola Bottler 
CCI is the sixth largest independent bottler in the Coca-Cola
system and a key 
vehicle for TCCC's expansion into the Middle East and Central
Asia. Since 2007, 
CCI has been investing heavily in terms of capex and M to grow
TCCC's 
franchise in these regions. Thanks to strong and growing cash
flow from 
operations, these investments have had limited adverse effects
on CCI's credit 
metrics. The ratings reflect the resilience of CCI's results to
economic cycles 
and the company's leverage policy to maintain a net debt/EBITDA
ratio of around 
1.5x - 2.0x. 
Volumes, Mix Drive Growth 
CCI's performance should continue to benefit from consistent
volume and price 
growth, driven by a young population, relatively low soft drinks
penetration in 
its countries of operations and the ability to push sales
growth, particularly 
in Turkey, on the more profitable "immediate consumption"
channel. Although 
volume growth has been easing in Turkey since 2011, EBITDA has
maintained growth 
rates of at least high single digit. Moreover, rapid expansion
of its 
international business has enabled an improvement in profit
margins driven by 
greater scale and operating efficiencies achieved. We expect
CCI's international 
presence to remain a key underpinning factor for the group's
profitability in 
2013.
Robust Performance 
In 2012 consolidated net revenue per case (+7.3% in Turkey and
+2% in the 
international segment) increased by 8.6% mainly due to higher
prices and better 
packaging and category mix. Better quality of sales together
with lower costs 
from 2011's highs, contributed to an improved EBITDA margin in
2012 of 16.2%, 
the highest level since 2009 and more in line with the
profitability shown by 
other Coca-Cola bottlers. 
Sufficient Liquidity
CCI has access to multiple sources of funding including their
recent USD300m US 
private placement used to refinance part of its USD800m debt
maturities due in 
2014. Liquidity is supported by cash of TRY358.3m at end-Q113,
approximately 
USD873m and TRY500m in undrawn foreign exchange and uncommitted
bank lines 
respectively as well as strong relationships with both local and
international 
banks.
Forex Exposure 
Against a majority of CCI's debt denominated in dollars and
euros at end-June 
2013, cash flow remains generated mainly in Turkish lira.
However, this will 
depend on the EBITDA contribution of the international segment
which is growing. 
The company will consequently remain vulnerable to unexpected
and/or sharp 
depreciation of the lira. CCI has proven ability to recover its
targeted credit 
metrics after periods of sharp TRY depreciation as in 2011. 
Ratings Incorporate Implied TCCC Support 
The ratings include embedded support from TCCC due to its
influence over major 
decisions, moderate operational and strategic ties (CCI
represents an entry 
point to fast-growing markets) and demonstrated operational
support and 
oversight.
RATING SENSITIVITIES 
Negative: Future developments that may, individually or
collectively, lead to a 
negative rating action include:
- A material permanent deterioration in free cash flow (FCF)
generation or large 
acquisition leading to lease-adjusted net debt/EBITDAR above
2.5x and funds from 
operations (FFO) adjusted net debt above 2.8x-3.0x for an
extended period along 
with FFO interest coverage below 6x. 
In addition, CCI's rating could be downgraded should Fitch
perceive that CCI has 
become strategically or operationally less significant to TCCC. 
In the event of a sharp devaluation of the Turkish lira, Fitch
will look at the 
group's willingness and timing to undertake any necessary cash
preservation 
measures such as dividend and capex reduction (as observed in
2009). 
Positive: Future developments that may, individually or
collectively, lead to a 
positive rating action include:
As the highest rated corporate in Turkey, an upgrade of the IDRs
is unlikely due 
to CCI's limited scale, diversification and forex exposure.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley have held talks with China's Huarong Asset Management Corp to invest in its $1.5 billion stake sale ahead of the company's expected initial public offering next year, the Financial Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interest of foreign banks in Huarong comes amid looming concerns of a surge in bad loans across China. A spike in non-performing loans would increase the demand for the services of China's asset management companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huarong, established in 1999, is the biggest of the four funds that China's government set up to remove an estimated 1.4 trillion yuan ($230 billion) worth of bad loans from the country's top four state lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up these asset management companies allowed China's top four banks to shed their bad loans book and to list shares publicly, beginning roughly eight years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) declined to comment. Huarong could not be reached immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huarong plans to raise up to $2 billion by selling a stake of 15-20 percent, Reuters reported in June. The fund raising would set the table for an IPO, in a move similar to what Cinda Asset Management Corp, another bad loan vehicle created by China, is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FT, citing people close to the Huarong process, said in its report on Friday that the company would pursue a Hong Kong listing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huarong manages over 300 billion yuan of assets, and its net profit jumped 66 percent in 2012 to 6.96 billion yuan, according to its annual report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinda raised $1.6 billion last year from investors including China's National Social Security Fund, Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and UBS (UBSN.VX). It has also started working on its IPO process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Denny Thomas; Editing by Michael Flaherty and Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 17 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities have opened an
investigation into whether JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co hired the
children of powerful Chinese officials to help it win business
in China,  the New York Times said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report posted in the Times' online edition cited a
confidential U.S. government document as its source for the
story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times said the bank hired Tang Xiaoning, the son of Tang
Shuangning, a former Chinese banking regulator who is now the
chairman of the China Everbright Group, a state-controlled
financial conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the son joined JPMorgan, the bank secured several
important assignments from the Chinese conglomerate, including
advising a subsidiary of the company on a stock offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong office of JPMorgan also hired Zhang Xixi, the
daughter of a now-disgraced Chinese railway official, and went
on to help advise his company, which builds railways for the
Chinese government, on its plans to become a public company, the
Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has had numerous recent issues with federal
agencies, referred in its quarterly filing this month to the
inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's
anti-bribery unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for the bank and for the SEC could not be reached
immediately by Reuters for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in its filing that it had received "a request
from the SEC Division of Enforcement seeking information and
documents relating to, among other matters, the firm's
employment of certain former employees in Hong Kong and its
business relationships with certain clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang and Tang both have left JPMorgan, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report stressed that the government document did not
definitively link JPMorgan's hiring practices to its ability to
win business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said there had been no suggestion that the employees
hired by the bank were unqualified and said JPMorgan, although
under investigation, had not been accused of any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. authorities have opened an investigation into whether JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) hired the children of powerful Chinese officials to help it win business in China, according to the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks have a long history of employing the children of China's politically connected. While close ties to top government officials is a boon to any banking franchise across the world, it's especially beneficial in China, where relationships and personal connections play a critical role in business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approval process for a stock offering in China, for example, is one area that has come under criticism inside and outside the country for being opaque and prone to cronyism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JPMorgan, the China hiring probe comes while the bank is under intense scrutiny following the $6 billion trading loss it suffered in the "London whale" derivatives scandal. Federal prosecutors on Wednesday brought criminal charges against two former JPMorgan traders - Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout - accusing the pair of deliberately understating losses on the trades on the bank's books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report posted in the Times' online Saturday edition cited a confidential U.S. government document as its source for the story on the China hiring probe. The Times said the probe is a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission's anti-bribery unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times said JPMorgan hired Tang Xiaoning, the son of Tang Shuangning, a former Chinese banking regulator. Tang Xiaoning is now the chairman of the China Everbright Group, a state-controlled financial conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the son joined JPMorgan, the bank secured several important assignments from the Chinese conglomerate, including advising a subsidiary of the company on a stock offering, the Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong office of JPMorgan also hired Zhang Xixi, the daughter of a now-disgraced Chinese railway official, and went on to help advise his company, which builds railways for the Chinese government, on its plans to become a public company, the Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesmen for the SEC could not be reached immediately by Reuters for comment. Zhang and Tang both have left JPMorgan, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan made reference in its 10-Q quarterly filing this month to the inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We publicly disclosed this matter in our 10-Q filing last week and are fully cooperating with regulators," Marie Cheung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank, said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice of hiring politically-connected bankers in China was widespread in the early to mid 2000's, when Wall Street firms engaged in so-called 'elephant hunting', a term used to describe the chasing of mandates to manage the multi-billion dollar stock offerings of the country's big state-owned enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more well known China bankers from that era is Margaret Ren, the daughter-in-law of former Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, who has worked at several banks. Most major investment banks have employed a politically connected Chinese banker, whether a high level professional such as Ren or a college age associate, at some stage in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many senior investment bankers in China now feel that the heyday for such underwriting contracts has passed, with far fewer jumbo state-owned company listings happening.

Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We publicly disclosed this matter in our 10-Q filing last
week and are fully cooperating with regulators," Marie Cheung, a
Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank, said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice of hiring politically-connected bankers in
China was widespread in the early to mid 2000's, when Wall
Street firms engaged in so-called 'elephant hunting', a term
used to describe the chasing of mandates to manage the
multi-billion dollar stock offerings of the country's big
state-owned enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more well known China bankers from that era is
Margaret Ren, the daughter-in-law of former Chinese Premier Zhao
Ziyang, who has worked at several banks. Most major investment

been an employee of Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street Journal
reported in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in its filing that it had received "a request
from the SEC Division of Enforcement seeking information and
documents relating to, among other matters, the firm's
employment of certain former employees in Hong Kong and its
business relationships with certain clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper report stressed that the government document
did not definitively link JPMorgan's hiring practices to its
ability to win business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said there had been no suggestion that the employees
hired by the bank were unqualified and said JPMorgan, although
under investigation, had not been accused of any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit accusing AOL Inc and some of its executives of fraud for repurchasing 14.8 million shares in 2011 without disclosing that the company would sell a $1 billion portfolio of patents to Microsoft Corp months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs in the case said they suffered significant losses when they sold their shares ahead of the patent deal, after which AOL's stock surged 43 percent in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing the deal with Microsoft was imminent allowed AOL, its CEO Tim Armstrong and former CFO Arthur Minson to effectively buy their company's stock at a discount price, plaintiffs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "the complaint's conspiracy theory is mere speculation," U.S. District Judge Denise Cote said in an 18-page opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit failed to provide an adequate example in which AOL executives made a material misstatement or omission prior to the announcement of the patent sale on April 9, 2012, Cote said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was well known in the market that AOL's patent portfolio might be extremely valuable, Cote wrote.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal bribery investigation into whether JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) hired the children of key Chinese officials to help it win business is just the latest in a series of legal and regulatory headaches for Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon piloted the bank through the financial crisis, but it is now facing at least a dozen investigations from federal agencies and state and foreign governments, including over the "London Whale" trading scandal that cost it more than $6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest probe, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking at whether the bank's Hong Kong office hired the children of powerful heads of state-owned companies in China with the express purpose of winning underwriting business and other contracts, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is questioning JPMorgan's relationships with at least two families in China that may have legitimate explanations, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. law does not stop companies from hiring politically well-connected executives. But hiring people in order to win business from relatives can be bribery, and the SEC is investigating JPMorgan's actions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC spokeswoman Florence Harmon declined to comment on the investigation. A Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment beyond what was in the bank's regulatory filings and said the bank was cooperating with probes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATORY HEADACHES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the outcome of the latest investigation, Dimon's time is increasingly being consumed by legal and regulatory matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice is investigating whether the bank manipulated U.S. energy markets, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. Last month, the bank agreed to pay a $285 million penalty and give back $125 million of trading profits in a settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged power market manipulation. JPMorgan neither admitted nor denied violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors last week brought criminal charges against two former JPMorgan traders, accusing the pair of deliberately understating losses in the "Whale" scandal.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 19 (Reuters) - A federal bribery investigation
into whether JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. hired the children of
key Chinese officials to help it win business is just the latest
in a series of legal and regulatory headaches for Chief
Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon piloted the bank through the financial crisis, but it
is now facing at least a dozen investigations from federal
agencies and state and foreign governments, including over the
"London Whale" trading scandal that cost it more than $6.2
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest probe, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) is looking at whether the bank's Hong Kong office hired
the children of powerful heads of state-owned companies in China
with the express purpose of winning underwriting business and
other contracts, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is questioning JPMorgan's relationships with at
least two families in China that may have legitimate
explanations, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. law does not stop companies from hiring politically
well-connected executives. But hiring people in order to win
business from relatives can be bribery, and the SEC is
investigating JPMorgan's actions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC spokeswoman Florence Harmon declined to comment on the
investigation. A Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank
declined to comment beyond what was in the bank's regulatory
filings and said the bank was cooperating with probes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATORY HEADACHES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the outcome of the latest investigation, Dimon's
time is increasingly being consumed by legal and regulatory
matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice is investigating whether the bank
manipulated U.S. energy markets, the Wall Street Journal
reported on Monday. Last month, the bank agreed
to pay a $285 million penalty and give back $125 million of
trading profits in a settlement with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission for alleged power market manipulation.
JPMorgan neither admitted nor denied violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors last week brought criminal charges
against two former JPMorgan traders, accusing the pair of
deliberately understating losses in the "Whale" scandal. The SEC
is seeking an admission of wrongdoing from the bank in a
parallel civil action, a rare step for the government agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the bank revealed that it was facing
parallel criminal and civil probes by the U.S. Department of
Justice in California into mortgage bonds that it sold before
the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2011, the bank has been writing in its quarterly
filings with regulators that it "is currently experiencing an
unprecedented increase in regulation and supervision, and such
changes could have a significant impact on how the firm conducts
business." In its last quarter, JPMorgan estimated that it could
have legal losses that are $6.8 billion beyond an undisclosed
sum that it has already set aside to cover those charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts may be understating the extent of the
bank's future litigation expenses, said independent analyst
Charlie Peabody of Portales Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's annual litigation costs have been around $4.9
billion for each of the last two years, and Peabody expects the
cost will be $1.5 billion to $2 billion over each of the next
two quarters. On average Wall Street expects roughly $300
million to $500 million per quarter, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While major U.S. banks have faced a litany of probes since
the financial crisis, Dimon has repeatedly griped in public
about how regulations designed to prevent the next financial
crisis are stifling banking and its ability to help the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report from a U.S. Senate subcommittee described an
episode where Dimon shouted at his then-chief financial officer
for giving information to a regulator. The bank's board of
directors has made it clear to the chairman and chief executive
that he must improve his relationship with regulators, a source
familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with heavy litigation costs, JPMorgan posted $21.28
billion of net income last year, its highest level ever even
after it suffered from $6.2 billion of trading losses from the
bad derivatives bets made by Bruno Iksil, the trader nicknamed
the "London Whale".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ELEPHANT HUNTING"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the China case, the New York Times said that JPMorgan at
one point hired Tang Xiaoning, the son of Tang Shuangning,
chairman of the China Everbright Group, a state-controlled
financial conglomerate. He also had been a Chinese banking
regulator, the Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the younger Tang joined JPMorgan, the bank secured
several important assignments from the Chinese conglomerate,
including advising a subsidiary on a stock offering, according
to the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another matter the SEC is investigating is JPMorgan's hiring
of Zhang Xixi, the daughter of a now-disgraced Chinese railway
official. The bank went on to help advise the official's
company, which builds railways for the Chinese government, on
its plans to go public, the Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has not been accused of wrongdoing, the New York
Times said, citing a government document. There is no
documentary evidence that Zhang Xixi or Tang Xiaoning were
unqualified, but the SEC is checking whether the bank's Hong
Kong office routinely won business from companies connected to
its employees, the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie Cheung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank,
said on Sunday that the bank had publicly disclosed the
investigation in its quarterly regulatory filing earlier this
month and was cooperating with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quarterly filing said that the SEC's enforcement
division had requested "information and documents relating to,
among other matters, the firm's employment of certain former
employees in Hong Kong and its business relationships with
certain clients".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice of hiring politically connected bankers in
China was widespread in the early to mid-2000s, when Wall Street
firms engaged in so-called 'elephant hunting', a term used to
describe the chasing of mandates to manage the multi-billion
dollar stock offerings of the country's big state-owned
enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more well-known China bankers from that era is
Margaret Ren, the daughter-in-law of former Chinese Premier Zhao
Ziyang, who has worked at several banks. Most major investment
banks have employed a politically connected Chinese banker,
whether a high level professional such as Ren or a college age
associate, at some stage in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many senior investment bankers in China now feel that the
heyday for such underwriting contracts has passed, with far
fewer jumbo state-owned company listings happening. But banks
and private equity firms alike still prize connections to top
decision makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Last week's criminal complaints against former JPMorgan Chase derivatives traders Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout - who allegedly mismarked positions in the bank's infamous synthetic credit derivatives portfolio to hide hundreds of millions of dollars of trading losses in early 2012 by the JPMorgan Chief Investment Office - does not directly impact the shareholder class action under way in federal court in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can be sure that the plaintiffs firms leading the class action were gratified that the Manhattan U.S. Attorney has decided the so-called "London Whale" losses merit criminal charges. When U.S. District Judge George Daniels hears arguments next month on the bank's motion to dismiss the class action, shareholder lawyers will absolutely remind him that prosecutors believe a criminal cover-up took place. JPMorgan's lawyers at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell moved in June to dismiss the entire shareholder class action, but as I've said before, I don't think there's much chance Judge Daniels will toss claims based on bank officials' statements about the London Whale losses. The government's new criminal charges make that prospect even more remote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about shareholder allegations that JPMorgan lied to them and the Securities and Exchange Commission back in 2010 and 2011, when the bank touted its superior internal controls and risk management procedures? Those allegations would dramatically extend the time frame for class membership, opening the case up to claims by shareholders who traded JPMorgan shares beginning in February 2010, not just those who traded the stock in the first half of 2012, before the bank issued a restatement of its earnings to reflect London Whale losses in July 2012. The government hasn't alleged misconduct in those 2010 and 2011 statements, though according to Dealbook, the bank and the SEC may be negotiating a deal based on internal control failures. If the SEC does, in fact, secure an admission from the bank that its internal controls were deficient, shareholders' burden would be narrowed to establishing that JPMorgan officials knowingly misrepresented the bank's ability to manage risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CARNEY'S PATTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's arguments for why shareholders can't meet that burden should be required reading for every investor operating under the apparently mistaken belief that you can rely on what you read in SEC filings and what you hear from corporate officials. JPMorgan was supposed to be different than financial institutions that teetered or fell in the financial crisis, and as shareholders wrote last week in their opposition to the bank's dismissal motion, investors paid a premium for its supposed commitment to discipline and risk management. Yet now JPMorgan says that even if its representations about internal controls were false - which, of course, it insists they were not - those statements are not actionable because no investor actually relied upon such immaterial puffery. As JPMorgan depicts things, you should no more believe an SEC filing than the patter of a carney trying to convince you to knock over the pyramid of milk bottles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, there's plenty of case law to back JPMorgan's argument that touting the bank's culture and practices doesn't expose it to class action liability. General statements about integrity and sound business practices are considered too vague for investors reasonably to rely upon. Forward-looking descriptions about what companies hope or intend their practices to accomplish aren't actionable in shareholder class actions. And even a specific statement that the bank has robust risk management processes would probably be deemed immaterial because, as one federal judge in New York wrote, "almost every investment bank makes these statements." (Yes, the same argument you'd hear from a kid whining about being grounded.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholder lawyers from Bernstein Litowitz Berger &amp; Grossmann, Grant &amp; Eisenhofer and Kessler Topaz Meltzer &amp; Check said last week in their response to JPMorgan's motion that the bank's statements about risk management were much more than vague puffery. Even before 2010, they contend, JPMorgan officials positioned their institution as an exception to the financial industry's excesses. (In one quotation cited by shareholders, CEO Jamie Dimon talked about the bank's "steadfast focus on risk management and prudent lending, and our disciplined approach to capital and liquidity management.") Investors swallowed JPMorgan's line, according to the plaintiffs lawyers. They contend that shareholders were willing to pay extra for JPMorgan equity because Dimon and other bank officials convinced the market that they were, in fact, effective risk managers who took particular pride in the internal controls they'd adopted. Investors were duped, according to the class, and by 2010 Dimon and the other JPMorgan defendants knew or should have known that their assurances weren't true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will get one more chance to answer the class's allegations before Judge Daniels holds a hearing on the bank's motion to dismiss in late September. It will be very interesting to see if the bank reaches a settlement with the SEC in advance of that hearing date. It's one thing to argue in a motion to dismiss a private suit that if you exaggerated in an SEC filing it really doesn't matter because everyone else was doing the same thing. It's another to tell one of your regulators that it shouldn't necessarily rely on your assurances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left a message for JPMorgan's counsel, Daryl Libow of S, but didn't hear back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Alison Frankel is a Reuters columnist.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      b Notional amount and interest only.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of July 
      26, 2013. Fitch does not rate the $41,620,829 class NR or the 
      $77,499,829 class X-C.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 45 loans secured by 89 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.148 billion as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association and Barclays Bank PLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 71.5% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 87.8%, and asset summary reviews on 87.8% of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.28x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 99.8%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 9.33%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 5.72% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pool Concentration: The pool is more concentrated by loan size and 
      sponsor than average transactions from 2013, as evidenced by a loan 
      concentration index (LCI) of 484 and sponsor concentration index (SCI) 
      of 486. Also, the top 10 loans represent 61.4% of the pool, which is 
      higher than for 2013 transactions (at 54.3%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High Retail Concentration: Retail properties represent the largest 
      concentration at 43.3% of the pool. This is higher than the 2012 and 
      2013 average retail concentration of 35.9% and 31.6%, respectively. The 
      next largest property type concentrations are for hotel (14.7%), mixed 
      use (14.1%), office (12.0%) and industrial (11.1%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Leverage: The transaction trust leverage is in line with the 
      average across 2013 conduit transactions, with a Fitch DSCR of 1.28x and 
      Fitch LTV of 99.8%. The average DSCR and LTV for 2013 transactions are 
      1.36x and 99.8%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Single-Tenant Properties/Increased Refinance Risk: Properties with 
      single or multiple but related tenants comprise 16.9% of the pool, 
      including two of the top 11 loans. Tenants occupying the two larger 
      loans have leases expiring during the term, creating increased refinance 
      risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch performed two model-based break-even analyses to determine the 
      level of cash flow and value deterioration the pool could withstand 
      prior to $1 of loss being experienced by the 'BBB-sf' and 'AAAsf' rated 
      classes. Fitch found that the JPMCC 2013-C14 pool could withstand a 
      47.95% decline in value (based on appraised values at issuance) and an 
      approximately 34.06% decrease to the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing $1 of loss to the 'BBB-sf' rated class. Additionally, 
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 51.49% decline in value and 
      an approximately 38.55% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last weeks criminal complaints against former JPMorgan Chase derivatives traders Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout  who allegedly mismarked positions in the banks infamous synthetic credit derivatives portfolio to hide hundreds of millions of dollars of trading losses in early 2012 by the JPMorgan Chief Investment Office  does not directly impact the shareholder class action under way in federal court in Manhattan. But you can be sure that the plaintiffs firms leading the class action were gratified that the Manhattan U.S. Attorney has decided the so-called London Whale losses merit criminal charges. When U.S. District Judge George Daniels hears arguments next month on the banks motion to dismiss the class action, shareholder lawyers will absolutely remind him that prosecutors believe a criminal cover-up took place. JPMorgans lawyers at Sullivan  Cromwell moved in June to dismiss the entire shareholder class action, but as Ive said before, I dont think theres much chance Judge Daniels will toss claims based on bank officials statements about the London Whale losses. The governments new criminal charges make that prospect even more remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about shareholder allegations that JPMorgan lied to them and the Securities and Exchange Commission back in 2010 and 2011, when the bank touted its superior internal controls and risk management procedures? Those allegations would dramatically extend the time frame for class membership, opening the case up to claims by shareholders who traded JPMorgan shares beginning in February 2010, not just those who traded the stock in the first half of 2012, before the bank issued a restatement of its earnings to reflect London Whale losses in July 2012. The government hasnt alleged misconduct in those 2010 and 2011 statements, though according to Dealbook, the bank and the SEC may be negotiating a deal based on internal control failures. If the SEC does, in fact, secure an admission from the bank that its internal controls were deficient, shareholders burden would be narrowed to establishing that JPMorgan officials knowingly misrepresented the banks ability to manage risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgans arguments for why shareholders cant meet that burden should be required reading for every investor operating under the apparently mistaken belief that you can rely on what you read in SEC filings and what you hear from corporate officials. JPMorgan was supposed to be different than financial institutions that teetered or fell in the financial crisis, and as shareholders wrote last week in their opposition to the banks dismissal motion, investors paid a premium for its supposed commitment to discipline and risk management. Yet now JPMorgan says that even if its representations about internal controls were false  which, of course, it insists they were not  those statements are not actionable because no investor actually relied upon such immaterial puffery. As JPMorgan depicts things, you should no more believe an SEC filing than the patter of a carney trying to convince you to knock over the pyramid of milk bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, theres plenty of case law to back JPMorgans argument that touting the banks culture and practices doesnt expose it to class action liability. General statements about integrity and sound business practices are considered too vague for investors reasonably to rely upon. Forward-looking descriptions about what companies hope or intend their practices to accomplish arent actionable in shareholder class actions. And even a specific statement that the bank has robust risk management processes would probably be deemed immaterial because, as one federal judge in New York wrote, almost every investment bank makes these statements. (Yes, the same argument youd hear from a kid whining about being grounded.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholder lawyers from Bernstein Litowitz Berger  Grossmann, Grant  Eisenhofer and Kessler Topaz Meltzer  Check said last week in their response to JPMorgans motion that the banks statements about risk management were much more than vague puffery. Even before 2010, they contend, JPMorgan officials positioned their institution as an exception to the financial industrys excesses. (In one quotation cited by shareholders, CEO Jamie Dimon talked about the banks steadfast focus on risk management and prudent lending, and our disciplined approach to capital and liquidity management.) Investors swallowed JPMorgans line, according to the plaintiffs lawyers. They contend that shareholders were willing to pay extra for JPMorgan equity because Dimon and other bank officials convinced the market that they were, in fact, effective risk managers who took particular pride in the internal controls theyd adopted. Investors were duped, according to the class, and by 2010 Dimon and the other JPMorgan defendants knew or should have known that their assurances werent true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will get one more chance to answer the classs allegations before Judge Daniels holds a hearing on the banks motion to dismiss in late September. It will be very interesting to see if the bank reaches a settlement with the SEC in advance of that hearing date. Its one thing to argue in a motion to dismiss a private suit that if you exaggerated in an SEC filing it really doesnt matter because everyone else was doing the same thing. Its another to tell one of your regulators that it shouldnt necessarily rely on your assurances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left a message for JPMorgans counsel, Daryl Libow of SC, but didnt hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

			Iron Mountain Appoints Walter Rakowich to its Board of Directors
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walter Rakowich, 55, was appointed Friday to the board of directors of Iron 
      Mountain&#174; Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), becoming the 12th 
      director for the storage and information management firm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rakowich is a former CEO of Prologis (NYSE: PLD), the leading owner, 
      operator and developer of industrial real estate, where he worked 18 
      years before retiring in December 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We feel very fortunate to add Walt to our board,&#8221; said Iron Mountain 
      Chairman Al Verrecchia. &#8220;Walt brings invaluable insight as someone who 
      has led a publicly traded, global real estate company. I look forward to 
      working with him.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Iron Mountain President and CEO William Meaney added: &#8220;Walt is a 
      successful executive, who has deep experience in finance, real estate 
      and international markets. We will rely on this experience as we seek to 
      advance our international growth strategy and maximize the value of our 
      large real estate portfolio. We&#8217;re honored to have him on our board.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While at Prologis, Rakowich held a number of senior management 
      positions, including chief operating officer and chief financial 
      officer, before becoming CEO in 2008. He served as the company&#8217;s CEO 
      until it merged with AMB Property Corporation in 2011, when he assumed 
      the role of co-CEO and executive director to manage the integration of 
      the two companies. He joined Prologis in 1994 as part of its external 
      management company, focused on MA and development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Previously, Rakowich spent nine years as a partner and principal with 
      real estate developer Trammell Crow Company. He began his career as an 
      auditor and tax consultant with Price Waterhouse.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today Rakowich serves on the board of Host Hotels  Resorts and is a 
      member of its audit committee. Additionally, he sits on the boards of 
      numerous philanthropic and educational organizations in his home state 
      of Colorado. He is the chairman of the board of Colorado Uplift and a 
      member of the executive committee of the Alliance for School Choice in 
      Education (ACE), two nonprofits focused on inner-city education. He also 
      was formerly on the executive committee and board of governors for the 
      National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, the primary 
      industry group for REITs in the United States.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Aug 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. banking regulator's
probe into JPMorgan's hiring practices in China will
have rival banks scrambling to review their own records, lawyers
say, in a market where ties to political and business leaders
can be key to winning big deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks around the world commonly hire people with government
connections, but this is especially prevalent in China due to
the role the ruling Communist Party plays in the country's
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering a job to one of China's so-called princelings - the
offspring of China's political elite - is now a potential
liability, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) investigating whether JPMorgan's Hong Kong office hired
the children of China's state-owned company executives with the
express purpose of winning underwriting business and other
contracts, said a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. law does not stop companies from hiring politically
connected executives. But hiring people in order to win business
from relatives can be bribery, and the SEC is investigating
JPMorgan's actions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA), the person added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I were a competitor of JPMorgan, I would definitely
start to do some internal investigations looking into the
relationships with princelings," said a China-based lawyer who
works with financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse
, Goldman Sachs and Macquarie are just
a few of the banks to have employed relatives of top Chinese
officials in the past five years. The banks declined to comment
or did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie Cheung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the matter beyond what was in the bank's
regulatory filings, noting the bank was cooperating with probes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between hiring a relative of a foreign
official who may be well connected, and offering employment to
such a person in the express hope of winning specific business
is key to proving FCPA violations, according to a report on the
FCPA published last October by law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"DOJ and the SEC will examine the circumstances of the
engagement to determine whether the purpose of the relative's
hiring is to improperly influence the foreign official," the
report noted, adding that in such cases FCPA violations may
occur even if the employee is otherwise qualified for the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GREY AREA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If JPMorgan put the person down in their books as a
legitimate hire, and then it turns out that the person is there
just to get certain connections, then anything you pay can be
considered a bribe," said the China-based lawyer, who was not
authorised to speak publicly about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC probe coincides with a broader focus by the U.S.
government on China-related corruption and the impact on U.S.
businesses and individuals. Violating the FCPA can result in
criminal liabilities, the lawyer said, though in this case a
likely outcome, if the U.S. government prevails, would be a
civil fine and the admission of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the New York Times, JPMorgan hired Tang
Xiaoning, the son of Tang Shuangning, chairman of China
Everbright Group, a state-controlled financial
conglomerate, and a former Chinese banking regulator. After the
younger Tang joined JPMorgan, the bank secured several important
assignments from the Chinese conglomerate, including advising a
subsidiary on a stock offering, according to the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is also probing JPMorgan's hiring of Zhang Xixi, the
daughter of a now-disgraced Chinese railway official. The bank
went on to help advise the official's company, which builds
railways for the Chinese government, on its plans to go public,
the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has not been accused of wrongdoing, the New York
Times said, citing a government document. There is no
documentary evidence that Zhang Xixi or Tang Xiaoning were
unqualified, but the SEC is checking whether the bank's Hong
Kong office routinely won business from companies connected to
its employees, the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRINCELING BANKERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's sometimes overstated how influential such hires can be,
bankers and headhunters say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When UBS Securities won a mandate to handle a more than $6
billion stock offering by PetroChina in 2007,
attention focused on the bank's earlier hiring of the daughter
of a top executive at the government-run oil and gas company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, UBS's investment banking division
had no idea that the PetroChina CFO's daughter had been hired as
a graduate trainee in the fixed-income division when they
pitched for the deal, IFR magazine reported at the time. UBS was
then the leading Asian equities franchise and a natural choice
for the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to distinguish between well-connected junior
hires who may work at a bank for a short time, and similarly
connected professionals who go on to carve out a career for
themselves in the financial  industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The industry is still a meritocracy and over the course of
a few years, it pretty readily separates the wheat from the
chaff - so even if a 'connected' person is hired, unless they
perform, they too are shown the door," wrote Russell Kopp,
managing director at Correlate Search, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of prominent princeling bankers in China includes
Bank of America's Margaret Ren, the daughter-in-law of former
Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, who has also worked at Bear
Stearns, Citigroup and BNP Paribas. When Ren was at
Merrill Lynch, she shared the role of China investment banking
chairman with Wilson Feng, whose father in-law is Wu Bangguo,
former chairman of the National People's Congress. Feng left
banking in 2009 to run an investment fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other high profile names include Credit Suisse's China
investment banking chairman Janice Hu, the granddaughter of
former party chairman Hu Yaobang and a veteran banker in her own
right. Wen Ruchun, the daughter of former premier Wen Jiabao,
worked at Credit Suisse's Beijing branch for a year, according
to a document obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many children of the Chinese elite who are hired by Wall
Street banks, it's their business school credentials as much as
their family connections that get them a foot in the door,
according to a Hong Kong-based managing director at a U.S. bank
who is involved in hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These kids tend to be well educated. If Harvard Business
School or Stanford let these influential people in, and those
schools are on the list of places we tend to hire from, it's a
natural process," said the banker.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Formulated To Meet The Critical Demands Of Non-Geared Gas And Steam 
      Turbines
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, maker of

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal bribery investigation into whether JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. hired the children of key Chinese officials to help it win business is just the latest in a series of legal and regulatory headaches for Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon piloted the bank through the financial crisis, but it is now facing at least a dozen investigations from federal agencies and state and foreign governments, including over the "London Whale" trading scandal that cost it more than $6.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest probe, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking at whether the bank's Hong Kong office hired the children of powerful heads of state-owned companies in China with the express purpose of winning underwriting business and other contracts, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is questioning JPMorgan's relationships with at least two families in China that may have legitimate explanations, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. law does not stop companies from hiring politically well-connected executives. But hiring people in order to win business from relatives can be bribery, and the SEC is investigating JPMorgan's actions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC spokeswoman Florence Harmon declined to comment on the investigation. A Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment beyond what was in the bank's regulatory filings and said the bank was cooperating with probes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATORY HEADACHES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the outcome of the latest investigation, Dimon's time is increasingly being consumed by regulatory matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors on Wednesday brought criminal charges against two former JPMorgan traders, accusing the pair of deliberately understating losses in the "Whale" scandal. The SEC is seeking an admission of wrongdoing from the bank in a parallel civil action, a rare step for the government agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the bank revealed that it was facing parallel criminal and civil probes by the U.S. Department of Justice in California into mortgage bonds that it sold before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And last month, the bank agreed to pay a $285 million penalty and give back $125 million of trading profits in a settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged power market manipulation. JPMorgan neither admitted nor denied violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2011, the bank has been writing in its quarterly filings with regulators that it "is currently experiencing an unprecedented increase in regulation and supervision, and such changes could have a significant impact on how the firm conducts business". In its last quarter, JPMorgan estimated that it could have legal losses that are $6.8 billion beyond an undisclosed sum that it has already set aside to cover those charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts may be understating the extent of the bank's future litigation expenses, said independent analyst Charlie Peabody of Portales Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's annual litigation costs have been around $4.9 billion for each of the last two years, and Peabody expects the cost will be $1.5 billion to $2 billion over each of the next two quarters. On average Wall Street expects roughly $300 million to $500 million per quarter, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While major U.S. banks have faced a litany of probes since the financial crisis, Dimon has repeatedly griped in public about how regulations designed to prevent the next financial crisis are stifling banking and its ability to help the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report from a U.S. Senate subcommittee described an episode where Dimon shouted at his then-chief financial officer for giving information to a regulator. The bank's board of directors has made it clear to the chairman and chief executive that he must improve his relationship with regulators, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with heavy litigation costs, JPMorgan posted $21.28 billion of net income last year, its highest level ever even after it suffered from $6.2 billion of trading losses from the bad derivatives bets made by Bruno Iksil, the trader nicknamed the "London Whale".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ELEPHANT HUNTING"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the China case, the New York Times said that JPMorgan at one point hired Tang Xiaoning, the son of Tang Shuangning, chairman of the China Everbright Group, a state-controlled financial conglomerate. He also had been a Chinese banking regulator, the Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the younger Tang joined JPMorgan, the bank secured several important assignments from the Chinese conglomerate, including advising a subsidiary on a stock offering, according to the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another matter the SEC is probing is JPMorgan's hiring Zhang Xixi, the daughter of a now-disgraced Chinese railway official. The bank went on to help advise the official's company, which builds railways for the Chinese government, on its plans to go public, the Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has not been accused of wrongdoing, the New York Times said, citing a government document. There is no documentary evidence that Zhang Xixi or Tang Xiaoning were unqualified, but the SEC is checking whether the bank's Hong Kong office routinely won business from companies connected to its employees, the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie Cheung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank, said on Sunday that the bank had publicly disclosed the investigation in its quarterly regulatory filing earlier this month, and was cooperating with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quarterly filing said that the SEC's enforcement division had requested "information and documents relating to, among other matters, the firm's employment of certain former employees in Hong Kong and its business relationships with certain clients".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice of hiring politically-connected bankers in China was widespread in the early to mid-2000s, when Wall Street firms engaged in so-called 'elephant hunting', a term used to describe the chasing of mandates to manage the multi-billion dollar stock offerings of the country's big state-owned enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more well-known China bankers from that era is Margaret Ren, the daughter-in-law of former Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, who has worked at several banks. Most major investment banks have employed a politically connected Chinese banker, whether a high level professional such as Ren or a college age associate, at some stage in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many senior investment bankers in China now feel that the heyday for such underwriting contracts has passed, with far fewer jumbo state-owned company listings happening. But banks and private equity firms alike still prize connections to top decision makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michael Flaherty and Lawrence White in Asia, Tom Brown and Ian Simpson in the United States; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Peter Henderson and Alex Richardson)&lt;/p&gt;

billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest probe, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) is looking at whether the bank's Hong Kong office hired
the children of powerful heads of state-owned companies in China
with the express purpose of winning underwriting business and
other contracts, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is questioning JPMorgan's relationships with at
least two families in China that may have legitimate
explanations, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. law does not stop companies from hiring politically
well-connected executives. But hiring people in order to win
business from relatives can be bribery, and the SEC is
investigating JPMorgan's actions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC spokeswoman Florence Harmon declined to comment on the
investigation. A Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank
declined to comment beyond what was in the bank's regulatory
filings and said the bank was cooperating with probes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATORY HEADACHES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the outcome of the latest investigation, Dimon's
time is increasingly being consumed by regulatory matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors on Wednesday brought criminal charges
against two former JPMorgan traders, accusing the pair of
deliberately understating losses in the "Whale" scandal. The SEC
is seeking an admission of wrongdoing from the bank in a
parallel civil action, a rare step for the government agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the bank revealed that it was facing
parallel criminal and civil probes by the U.S. Department of
Justice in California into mortgage bonds that it sold before
the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And last month, the bank agreed to pay a $285 million
penalty and give back $125 million of trading profits in a
settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for
alleged power market manipulation. JPMorgan neither admitted nor
denied violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2011, the bank has been writing in its quarterly
filings with regulators that it "is currently experiencing an
unprecedented increase in regulation and supervision, and such
changes could have a significant impact on how the firm conducts
business". In its last quarter, JPMorgan estimated that it could
have legal losses that are $6.8 billion beyond an undisclosed
sum that it has already set aside to cover those charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts may be understating the extent of the
bank's future litigation expenses, said independent analyst
Charlie Peabody of Portales Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's annual litigation costs have been around $4.9
billion for each of the last two years, and Peabody expects the
cost will be $1.5 billion to $2 billion over each of the next
two quarters. On average Wall Street expects roughly $300
million to $500 million per quarter, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While major U.S. banks have faced a litany of probes since
the financial crisis, Dimon has repeatedly griped in public
about how regulations designed to prevent the next financial
crisis are stifling banking and its ability to help the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report from a U.S. Senate subcommittee described an
episode where Dimon shouted at his then-chief financial officer
for giving information to a regulator. The bank's board of
directors has made it clear to the chairman and chief executive
that he must improve his relationship with regulators, a source
familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with heavy litigation costs, JPMorgan posted $21.28
billion of net income last year, its highest level ever even
after it suffered from $6.2 billion of trading losses from the
bad derivatives bets made by Bruno Iksil, the trader nicknamed
the "London Whale".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ELEPHANT HUNTING"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the China case, the New York Times said that JPMorgan at
one point hired Tang Xiaoning, the son of Tang Shuangning,
chairman of the China Everbright Group, a state-controlled
financial conglomerate. He also had been a Chinese banking
regulator, the Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the younger Tang joined JPMorgan, the bank secured
several important assignments from the Chinese conglomerate,
including advising a subsidiary on a stock offering, according
to the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another matter the SEC is probing is JPMorgan's hiring Zhang
Xixi, the daughter of a now-disgraced Chinese railway official.
The bank went on to help advise the official's company, which
builds railways for the Chinese government, on its plans to go
public, the Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has not been accused of wrongdoing, the New York
Times said, citing a government document. There is no
documentary evidence that Zhang Xixi or Tang Xiaoning were
unqualified, but the SEC is checking whether the bank's Hong
Kong office routinely won business from companies connected to
its employees, the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie Cheung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank,
said on Sunday that the bank had publicly disclosed the
investigation in its quarterly regulatory filing earlier this
month, and was cooperating with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quarterly filing said that the SEC's enforcement
division had requested "information and documents relating to,
among other matters, the firm's employment of certain former
employees in Hong Kong and its business relationships with
certain clients".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice of hiring politically-connected bankers in
China was widespread in the early to mid-2000s, when Wall Street
firms engaged in so-called 'elephant hunting', a term used to
describe the chasing of mandates to manage the multi-billion
dollar stock offerings of the country's big state-owned
enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more well-known China bankers from that era is
Margaret Ren, the daughter-in-law of former Chinese Premier Zhao
Ziyang, who has worked at several banks. Most major investment
banks have employed a politically connected Chinese banker,
whether a high level professional such as Ren or a college age
associate, at some stage in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many senior investment bankers in China now feel that the
heyday for such underwriting contracts has passed, with far
fewer jumbo state-owned company listings happening. But banks
and private equity firms alike still prize connections to top
decision makers.&lt;/p&gt;

      chosen by Microsoft as a licensee of the software giant&#8217;s mobile barcode 
      technology, Microsoft Tag.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft also announced that it will shut down the Microsoft Tag 
      Service in two years, on Aug. 19, 2015. For current Microsoft Tag 
      customers, for the next two years the Microsoft Tag Service will 
      continue running as it has been. All Microsoft Tags in the market will

      available as usual through the Microsoft Tag Service until Aug. 19, 
      2015. Scanbuy 
      plans to support Microsoft Tag Technology on the ScanLife platform 
      beginning no later than Sept. 18, 2013, and to offer transition and 
      migration services to Microsoft Tag customers who choose to migrate to 
      the ScanLife platform. This transition path will help current Microsoft 
      Tag customers to continue running campaigns using Microsoft Tags on the 
      ScanLife platform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Current Microsoft Tag customers or new companies interested in services

      &#8220;With the most popular mobile engagement platform in the industry,

			SCE Crews Restore Power to Most Customers in Tulare and Visalia 
      Affected by Extreme Weather Conditions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Southern California Edison (SCE) crews have restored 
      power in the Tulare and Visalia areas to most of the customers 
      affected by extreme weather conditions. About 1,200 customers remain 
      without power due to the widespread damage caused by lightning, rain and 
      wind in the San Joaquin area. Initially, more than 120,000 customers 
      were impacted by the storm damage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SCE recommends that those customers still without power prepare to be 
      without service tonight and into tomorrow while repairs continue. The 
      company recognizes this is an inconvenience for customers and 
      appreciates their patience as crews continue working to restore service 
      as quickly and safely as possible after this severe damage to the system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Outage Center map and list of outages for the San Joaquin area, 
      available on SCE.com, 
      will be updated when restoration times are available.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      More than 40 crews and more than 200 SCE personnel are in the area to 
      help restore service, many of them coming from other regions. Crews will 
      remain until service 
      is restored to all customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SCE reminds customers to keep these safety tips in mind:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Never approach or touch a downed power line. Do not touch anything 
        that is in contact with downed lines. Those lines may still be 
        energized and pose a danger. Stay away and call 911 immediately.
      
			
        Watch for traffic signals that may be out. Approach those 
        intersections as four-way stops
      
			
        To prevent loss of data and/or damage to your sensitive electronic 
        equipment, consider surge suppressors or shut off or disconnect all 
        such equipment until power has been restored to protect against 
        electrical events that can accompany outages or that can occur during 
        service restoration.
      
			
        Leave the doors of your refrigerator and freezer closed to keep your 
        food as fresh as possible. Place blocks of ice inside to help keep 
        food cold. Check food carefully for signs of spoilage.
      
			
        Check on your neighbors to make sure everyone is safe.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - A flood of erroneous trades hit U.S. equity options markets on Tuesday as they opened for business when Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) sent orders accidentally because of a technical error, the latest trading problem to hit the options market this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major options exchanges including platforms run by CBOE Holdings (CBOE.O), Nasdaq OMX Group Inc (NDAQ.O) and NYSE Euronext NYX.N said they were reviewing the trades, sent in roughly the first quarter hour of trading and affecting options on shares with listing symbols beginning with the letters H through L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchanges have the option to adjust prices or nullify, or "bust," the trades if they are determined to have been made in error. NYSE Euronext's NYSE Amex Options market said it anticipates most of the trades will be canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a statement the firm does not face material loss or risk from the issue. The firm declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with the problem, who declined to be identified, said the cause was a computer glitch in which indications of interest in equity options were sent as actual orders to the exchanges. Some of the orders were filled, while others were not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Options market participants said the activity struck promptly as the market opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the orders on some of the options for those stocks were 1,000-contract blocks traded for $1 per contract, WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks whose options saw some of the order flow included Johnson and Johnson (JNJ.N), JPMorgan Chase and Co (JPM.N) and Kellogg Co.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Caroline Valetkevitch and Doris Frankel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/CHICAGO Aug 20 (Reuters) - A flood of erroneous
trades hit U.S. equity options markets on Tuesday as they opened
for business when Goldman Sachs Group sent orders
accidentally because of a technical error, the latest trading
problem to hit the options market this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major options exchanges including platforms run by CBOE
Holdings, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc and NYSE
Euronext said they were reviewing the trades, sent in
roughly the first quarter hour of trading and affecting options
on shares with listing symbols beginning with the letters H
through L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchanges have the option to adjust prices or nullify, or
"bust," the trades if they are determined to have been made in
error. NYSE Euronext's NYSE Amex Options market said it
anticipates most of the trades will be canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a statement the firm does not face
material loss or risk from the issue. The firm declined to
comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with the problem, who declined to be
identified, said the cause was a computer glitch in which
indications of interest in equity options were sent as actual
orders to the exchanges. Some of the orders were filled, while
others were not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Options market participants said the activity struck
promptly as the market opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the orders on some of the options for those stocks
were 1,000-contract blocks traded for $1 per contract,
WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stocks whose options saw some of the order flow included
Johnson and Johnson, JPMorgan Chase and Co and
Kellogg Co., Ruffy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Options on some exchange-traded funds, such as the iShares
S Small Cap Fund, were also affected, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential losses could range in the millions of dollars, the
source said, but it was unclear just how many transactions were
involved and what any final cost would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no real obvious way to tell how much this cost
traders," said Ophir Gottlieb, managing director of options
analytics firm Livevol based in San Francisco. "But the ones
that are hurt the most are likely the market makers who provide
liquidity and are the counter parties."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is another in a series of problems affecting exchanges.
In April, a half-day outage at the Chicago Board Options
Exchange exposed software problems that came about as it
prepared to extend trading hours for futures contracts on the
CBOE Volatility Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CME Group Executive Chairman Terry Duffy said in an
interview on CNBC that busting trades is difficult because of
different rules at different exchanges. The futures exchange
operator was not affected by Tuesday's incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq and CBOE "have to coordinate with the NYSE and the
other institutions to make sure they all do the same thing
because if trades stand at one institution and not at another it
can be a big fallout for the participants and who gets those
trades," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, a software mishap at Knight Capital Group
 led to millions of unintended orders flooding into the
market over a 45-minute period.&lt;/p&gt;

      The affirmations are the result of the affirmations of the ratings or 
      shadow ratings of the underlying bonds. This transaction is a 
      resecuritization of the ownership interest in two commercial 
      mortgage-backed certificates: Credit Suisse Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      series 2007-C4 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 
      2007-C4, class A-3, which is not rated by Fitch and the J.P. Morgan

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The revision of the Rating Outlook on class A-4 in JPMCC 2008-C2 was the 
      result of the erosion in credit enhancement after the sale of The Shops 
      at Dos Lagos and continued risk of both principal and interest losses as 
      the pool becomes more concentrated. For details, see Fitch's release, 
      'Fitch Downgrades 13 Distressed Classes of JPMCC 2008-C2 on Dos Lagos

&lt;p&gt;* Chevron deal would be second shale agreement in Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Nationalists say deal would damage environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ukraine sees shale as alternative to costly Russian gas
imports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIEV, Aug 20 (Reuters) - A shale gas deal in Ukraine hit a
setback on Tuesday when a local council rejected the
government's draft production-sharing agreement with U.S. energy
company Chevron amid warnings by nationalists regarding
likely damage to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials told Reuters that deputies in Ivano-Frankivsk
region, in western Ukraine, had sent the draft back to the
government, pressing for guarantees which would address their
concerns over the exploration plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron wants to tie up a deal to explore the Olesska shale
field in western Ukraine. Royal Dutch Shell has already
signed a $10 billion deal for shale exploration and extraction
at the Yuzivska field in the east of the ex-Soviet republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the council's website, deputies expressed
concerns over the ecological consequences of shale exploration
in the mountainous forest region which is known for inland
tourist resorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "fracking" process, in which water and chemicals are
used to break up rock, sandstone and shale deposits to release
gas, has sparked opposition from environmentalists elsewhere in
Europe who fear it can pollute underground water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Kiev government sees shale gas development as
important for easing its dependence on costly gas imports from
Russia which weigh heavily on its economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuel Minister Eduard Stavytsky was quoted by UNIAN news
agency as saying that Chevron has proposed investing $350
million in initial tests to ascertain the commercial viability
of gas deposits at the Olesska field, with a $3 billion
investment envisaged for the first stage of extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stavytsky told Reuters by telephone: "We will consider the
proposals (from the council) and in mid-September there will be
another vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is nothing dramatic in what has happened. This is the
normal working process," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron looks forward to understanding how the Ukrainian
government plans to address the concerns raised by the
Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Council which will enable us to move
forward expeditiously to implement this strategic project," a
Chevron spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the council debate, Iryna Sekh, a national deputy from
the Svoboda far-right nationalist opposition, said: "This
agreement opens the way to lawful destruction of Ukrainian land
during gas extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are clauses in the agreement which allow Chevron to
turn hundreds of kilometres of Ukraine into swamp and desert.
Chevron would have the right to use sand, stone, underground
water supplies and other water sources on the basis of
agreements in and beyond the (agreed) area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I doubt that there is a country in the world which would
allow such rights and privileges to a foreign investor," she
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the Ivan-Frankivsk council eventually supports the
deal, it would still require the approval of a second council in
the Lviv region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			ROAM&#8217;s Chip  Sign Mobile Card Reader Among the First to Earn Visa 
      Ready Certification
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ROAM&#8217;s RP350x supports both legacy magnetic stripe cards as well as 
      EMV chip-based cards

			ROAM 
      (www.roamdata.com), 
      an Ingenico company and the leading mobile commerce platform provider, 
      announced today that its RP350x Chip  Sign Mobile Card Reader is among 
      the first to be certified as Visa Ready. The RP350x can accommodate 
      legacy magnetic stripe credit and debit cards as well as newer EMV 
      chip-based cards. Now merchants can leverage EMV as part of its mobile 
      point of sale solution and benefit from lower processing fees and better 
      security. By adopting the Visa ready RP350x from ROAM, merchants can 
      process payments in both ways and be ready for the October 2015 
      liability shift from card issuers to merchants&#8217; acquirers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ROAM sells the RP350x reader via its global network of acquirers, 
      financial institutions, independent sales organizations (ISOs) and 
      payment service providers (PSPs). Due to that extensive network, ROAM 
      believes it will soon have more mobile readers out in the hands of 
      merchants than any other vendor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Visa Ready Program paves the way for mobile device manufacturers, 
      technology partners, mobile network operators, and others to easily 
      navigate the complexities of the payments ecosystem, and to gain access 
      to Visa IP, licenses and best practices. &#8220;The ability to label our 
      readers &#8216;Visa Ready&#8217; gives our channel partners and their merchant 
      customers added confidence that the card reader they have chosen is 
      safe, secure and compliant,&#8221; said Ken Paull, CEO of ROAM. &#8220;We&#8217;re proud 
      to be among the first vendors to have earned this certification and ship 
      one of the first Visa ready chip and sign mobile card readers.&#8221;

      provides its customers with everything required for a complete 
      end-to-end mPOS solution, including the card readers, mobile 
      applications, management and development tools, as well as professional

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - While the role of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) in global metals markets has fallen under a harsh regulatory spotlight this summer, the bank has also quietly enjoyed a privileged front-row seat to one of the most dynamic trading trends to emerge from the U.S. shale oil boom: shipping crude by rail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a previously unreported minority investment in a small, privately held Texas-based firm called U.S. Development Group (USD) in 2007, Goldman Sachs has played a leading role in financing the expansion of nearly a dozen specialized terminals that can quickly load and unload massive, mile-long trains carrying crude oil and ethanol across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Borgen, president and chief executive of USD, said the firm he helped found two decades ago has benefited from a regular exchange of ideas with Goldman, as well as from its financial clout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's great for someone who tends to be creative and entrepreneurial to bounce ideas off smart folks who understand the strategic nature of the business," Borgen said in an interview. "We lean on them for advice and they are some smart people. It's one of the reasons we accepted their investment years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there are important distinctions between Goldman's involvement with USD and with Metro International Trade Services, the warehousing group that is now the subject of a U.S. regulatory inquiry and lawsuits alleging it used anticompetitive practices that helped drive up the cost of aluminum. Goldman has denied the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Metro, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Goldman's J. Aron trading operation, USD was a minority-stake investment by a different part of the bank, a Goldman spokesman said in response to queries. There is no indication that Goldman played any role in USD's operations or ever benefited beyond its financial stake in USD. Both are balance sheet investments made with the bank's own capital rather than investor funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the USD stake, which has fallen from 49 percent in 2007 to less than half that now, shows that Goldman's interests in the commodity industry run deeper than widely known, and extend beyond the Metro warehouses and its ownership of a Colombian coal mine, its two most public holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In principle, its ownership stake in privately held USD could provide the bank with valuable insight as the shipping crude by rail moved from a niche play to a mainstay of the U.S. market, as booming U.S. oil production outstripped pipeline capacity in many regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW PHYSICAL TO GET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While private sector investments have long been a common part of merchant banking, the stakes may attract additional scrutiny at a time of unprecedented public and political pressure on Wall Street investments in commodities markets, particularly ownership of infrastructure such as metals warehouses and trading of physical commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers have questioned whether commercial banks, guaranteed by the Federal Reserve, should own oil tankers or run power plants - activities that may expose them to massive financial risk in the event of a spill or meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the bank isn't obliged to reveal every investment it makes with its own money, lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee have complained it is almost impossible to know how deeply involved banks are in the industry, due to the lack of disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve must make a decision by September that will determine whether former investment banks like Goldman will be allowed to continue owning and operating physical commodity assets. More broadly, it is also reviewing a landmark 2003 decision that first allowed commercial banks to trade physical commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), are opting to withdraw from physical trading, because of the regulatory pressure and several years of diminished margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman unit with an interest in USD, GSFS Investments I Corp, has also cut its holding in USD, although the reduction pre-dates the current debate over how deeply Fed-backed banks should be allowed into commerce. As a "merchant" investment held at arm's length from the bank, the stake must divested by Goldman by 2017, according to Federal Reserve rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSFS cut its roughly 49 percent shareholding to about 33 percent in 2011, according to Texas Franchise Tax Public Information reports. Its share has fallen further since then, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Goldman nor USD's Borgen would comment on the exact size of the current stake, nor why the bank was reducing it. USD is an employee-owned business, Borgen said. He declined to talk about the ownership structure in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BENEFITS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Development Group has been in business for two decades, but it has only gained a high profile recently as it shifted from building up ethanol-related rail terminals to tapping into the shale crude oil boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borgen said the initial deal with Goldman came about after USD had turned down other would-be investors. The company had already made its mark in the industry with a series of projects including small-scale rail projects, large-scale "storage in transit" for the petrochemicals industry and some wholesale oil-by-rail diesel fuel arbitrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because we're not public we're able to get out there early and put our stake in the ground before others identify the market opportunities that are there," said Borgen. "We start things and hopefully they become industry solutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of Goldman's investment in 2007, well before the surge in North Dakota crude production had begun, USD was in the midst of building ethanol terminals across the United States, including one in the New York Harbor trading hub, where prices for benchmark U.S. gasoline and heating oil are set. It sold three of those terminals to Kinder Morgan (KMP.N) in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It later shifted to crude oil facilities, building up five such oil-by-rail terminals - which it sold to Plains All American Pipeline (PAA.N) for $500 million in late 2012, leaving the company cash-rich and asset light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the trading flows through such lynchpin oil facilities can provide valuable insight for oil traders, who scour the market for information that may help them predict how much oil is being shipped to different parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large price discounts for oil in locations poorly served by pipelines have offered traders attractive opportunities if they can figure out how to get the crude to higher-priced markets. Data on crude-by-rail shipments is particularly opaque, with government figures only available months after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear what - if any - information about the USD investment found its way to Goldman's J. Aron arm. A person familiar with the business said J. Aron traders had never chartered oil through the USD terminals, nor did they have direct access to information from the company. Borgen declined to comment on USD's customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borgen said he did not know if Goldman had benefited from the conversations with USD in the same way that USD had learned from Goldman's bankers: "You'd have to ask them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bank spokesman declined to comment beyond saying that Goldman viewed USD as purely a financial investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike rivals at Morgan Stanley (MS.N), J. Aron traders have not been big players in the U.S. physical oil market for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has an agreement with refiner Alon Energy USA (ALJ.N) to supply crude and sell products for several small plants in California, plus one in Texas and one in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borgen said the investment by Goldman had been good for his company, allowing it to expand and draw on their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their investment has allowed us to grow at a more rapid pace than we otherwise would have," Borgen said of Goldman. "We have similar cultures, and they're some of the smartest in the business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Sheppard in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KIEV Aug 20 (Reuters) - Prospects of a new shale gas deal
being concluded in Ukraine hit a setback on Tuesday when a local
council voted against an initial draft production-sharing
agreement with U.S. energy major Chevron, an official
said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official, who did not wish to be named, told Reuters
that deputies in Ivano-Frankivsk region, in the west of the
country, had sent the draft back to the government pressing for
guarantees which would address their concerns over the
exploration plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron wants to tie up a deal to explore the Olesska shale
field in western Ukraine. Royal Dutch Shell has already
signed up a similar deal for the Yuzivska field in the east of
the ex-Soviet republic.&lt;/p&gt;

      I.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On 30 July 2013, Vodafone Vierte Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH (whose 
      change of legal form into a German stock corporation under the company 
      name Vodafone Vierte Verwaltungs AG has been resolved upon), D&#252;sseldorf, 
      Germany (the "Bidder"), published the offer document for its 
      voluntary public takeover offer (the "Takeover
			Offer") 
      to the shareholders of Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, Unterf&#246;hring, 
      Deutschland (the "Target Company"), to acquire all non-par 
      value bearer shares (ISIN DE000KD88880) in the Target Company 
      (collectively the &#8220;KDH Shares&#8220; and individually "KDH Share"). 
      The acceptance period for the Takeover Offer expires on 11&#160;September 
      2013, 24:00 hrs (local time at Frankfurt am Main), unless extended 
      pursuant to the statutory provisions of the Wp&#220;G.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On 19 August 2013, 5:30 pm (local time at Frankfurt am Main) (the &#8220;Reference 
      Date&#8220;), the Vodafone Group Plc, Newbury, England (&#8220;Vodafone&#8221;), 
      a person acting jointly with the Bidder within the meaning of section 2 
      para. 5 Wp&#220;G, held 3,772,869 KDH Shares; this corresponds to 
      approximately 4.26% of the share capital and voting rights of the Target 
      Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Until the Reference Date, the Takeover Offer has been accepted for a 
      total of 512,228 KDH Shares. This corresponds to approximately 0.58% of 
      the share capital and voting rights of the Target Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vodafone has purchased further 4,733 KDH Shares, corresponding to 
      approximately 0.005% of the share capital and the voting rights of the 
      Target Company, after the publication of the offer document outside the 
      Takeover Offer via the stock exchange against payment of a cash 
      consideration, whose transfer of title is still outstanding. Transfer of 
      title to 331 of these KDH Shares to Vodafone will presumably take place 
      on 20 August&#160;2013 and transfer of title to the remaining 4,402 of these 
      KDH Shares to Vodafone will presumably take place on 21 August 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Furthermore, neither the Bidder, nor any person acting jointly with it 
      within the meaning of section 2 para. 5 Wp&#220;G, nor any of their 
      subsidiaries, held any additional KDH Shares or financial instruments or 
      other instruments within the meaning of sections 25, 25a WpHG on the 
      Reference Date. Moreover, no further voting rights from KDH Shares were 
      attributed to them as of the Reference Date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the Reference Date, the aggregate number of KDH Shares held by the 
      Bidder and persons acting jointly with the Bidder plus the number of 
      KDH&#160;Shares for which the Takeover Offer has been accepted until the 
      Reference Date plus the number of KDH Shares purchased whose transfer of 
      title is still outstanding, amounts to 4,289,830 KDH Shares. This 
      corresponds to approximately 4.85% of the share capital and voting 
      rights of the Target Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      II.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      On 19 August&#160;2013 Vodafone has purchased 4,402 KDH Shares outside the 
      Takeover Offer via the stock exchange against payment of a cash 
      consideration. The average purchase price per KDH Share amounted to 
      EUR&#160;84.50. The highest purchase price per KDH Share was EUR 84.50. These 
      KDH Shares correspond to approximately 0.005% of the share capital and 
      the voting rights of the Target Company. Title to these KDH Shares will 
      presumably be transferred to Vodafone on 21 August&#160;2013.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is assessing the financial damage caused by a trading glitch that led to a flood of erroneous options trades, as U.S. regulators began looking into what caused the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday morning, an upgrade of an internal Goldman system affected options on stocks and some exchange-traded funds with listing symbols beginning with the letters H through L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system, called a "trading axis," monitors the Wall Street bank's inventory to determine whether it should be a more aggressive buyer or seller in the market. But a technical error misinterpreted non-binding indications of interest, or IOIs, as firm bids and offers, leading to some trades that were vastly out of line with where market prices were, a source familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman quickly identified the problem and contained it, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But by then the damage had been done: Depending on how many of the trades exchanges nullified - or "busted" - the bank may be on the hook for anywhere from a few million to hundreds of millions of dollars, according to estimates from traders and analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enforcement attorneys from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are trying to determine whether any rules were violated related to the glitch, the source said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency has gotten more aggressive about probing technical issues at brokers and exchanges in recent years, as a flurry of high-profile glitches ranging from the "flash crash" in 2010 to errors related to the Facebook Inc IPO and Knight Capital's disastrous trading blowup last year have undermined market confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment. Goldman has said that the firm is in discussions with regulators about the options trading error and that the trading losses would not be material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchanges declined to provide specifics about how many trades were canceled or the financial implications of their reviews for Goldman and other brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either Goldman or its trading partners could have contested the veracity of options trades and appealed decisions made by the exchanges.

&lt;p&gt;It all started with Lady Gaga.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Backplane has spent the past two years quietly building a place for the world&#8217;s biggest brands to engage with their fans.&#160;The company originated as part of Lady Gaga&#8217;s tech team. Gaga has a massive social media following. She has 58.7 million Facebook likes and 39.8 million Twitter followers. In July 2012 she launched her own social network just for Lady Gaga fans, who are known as Little Monsters. Backplane was the force behind Littlemonsters.com and is now opening up its platform to other brands and celebrities, starting with one of the world&#8217;s most iconic brands &#8212; Coca Cola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve used the Little Monster community to hone our skills and perfect our product, to learn about user behavior, the psychology and sociology of community, and how to manage super fans,&#8221; CEO Matt Michelsen said in an interview with VentureBeat. &#8220;Every brand, celebrity, politician and organization I&#8217;ve talked to faces the challenge of creating online community that they own. No-one has built this platform yet.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelsen said that while Facebook and Twitter are powerful platforms, they don&#8217;t engender the level of engagement that brands want. He described Backplane as a &#8220;walled garden&#8221; where fans come come together over common interests to communicate, share, and organize.&#160; In the case of Lady Gaga, Littlemonsters.com is a place where strangers can express their passion for the star without fear of ridicule, or share experiences of bullying &#8212; one of Gaga&#8217;s flagship causes. The brand itself can use the network to deliver information about events or news, and solicit feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backplane&#8217;s front-end is a straightforward social network. Michelsen said the goal was to make it like a &#8220;Ford Taurus,&#8221; or an intuitive product that people easily understand how to use. The real distinguishing factor, he said, rests in Backplane&#8217;s ability to help brands connect in a meaningful way with their fans and measure that participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backplane is being very selective about the brands it works with. The company is looking for top brands with very high engagement. In addition to Coca-Cola, Backplane also revealed a partnership with Cirque du Soleil. Both Coca Cola and Cirque du Soleil made strategic investments in Backplane, which is in the process of closing a $12 million round of funding. The strategic investors join a high-profile group of venture capital firms, including SV Angel, Google Ventures, Founders Fund, Tomorrow Ventures, Lerer Ventures, and Menlo Ventures. Backplane&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of startups take the shotgun approach, and want to get the product out there as fast as possible. &#8221; Michelsen said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve taken the thoughtful, methodical approach. We looked at the current social ecosystem and at group behavior and have a big infrastructure in place that can support hundreds of thousands of participants on site at a time. Coca Cola is a 125 year old brand and we have to protect that.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaking down the barriers between celebrities, musicians, designers, politicians etc&#8230; and their audience is a hot topic of discussion in both the tech and brand worlds. Whether its through social media marketing and analytics, Google hangouts, or media campaigns, influencers and fans alike want more open channels of communication. Backplane will soon begin extend its platform to dozens more client by the end of the year and then plans to scale quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelsen previously started two hedge funds and then went on to found trading technology firm UNX. He left UNX in 2010 to work for Lady Gaga&#8217;s manager Troy Carter and use his expertise to organize the Little Monsters into a cohesive online community. Cofounder Alex Moore was the first employee at Palantir and Joey Priminani built Cortex, a sharing extension for Google chrome. Now they along with a team of 34, they are building out a new model for social networks and brand engagement. Backplane is based in Palo Alto.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, Social&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. government's bribery investigation into JPMorgan's employment of at least two Chinese bankers has prompted banks and other corporations across the globe to take a close look at their hiring practices.&lt;/p&gt;

"Finance is about doing favors for people. It's what makes the world go round."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Client hires don't necessarily by-pass the usual battery of rigorous tests and interviews that other applicants must take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, according to headhunters and bankers interviewed by Reuters, when it comes down to two otherwise similarly qualified candidates, the one with influential connections will win out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between hiring a relative of a foreign official who may be well connected, and offering employment to such a person in the express hope of winning specific business, is key to proving violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Frankly, we've got a list of all our Chinese nationals and are going through it right now checking all the connections just to be safe," said a source at a U.S. bank in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"POLITICALLY EXPOSED PERSONS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice is more prevalent in China, bankers say, because the culture in business of "guanxi", based around connections and the exchange of favors, encourages clients to push CVs on bankers, while having an "in" with state-owned firms is seen as more effective in winning deals than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks have become more rigorous in vetting potential China hires in recent years as the result of increased regulatory scrutiny, sources at those firms say.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Aug 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. government's bribery
investigation into JPMorgan's employment of at least two
Chinese bankers has prompted banks and other corporations across
the globe to take a close look at their hiring practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strategy that is certain to come under scrutiny is the
"client hire".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enlisting the relative of a top customer for a summer
internship or an entry-level job is common to businesses
worldwide, but it's especially rife in banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry has held strong to a well-worn mechanism where
clients will "pass on" CVs or resumes of their relatives or
friends to coverage bankers, whose role is to visit top
executives of companies in a particular industry or sector and
sell them the bank's services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bankers, in turn, make sure those CVs reach the staff in
charge of that year's intern list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It happens all the time where a coverage guy will toss over
some client kid's CV," said a Hong Kong based investment banker.
"Finance is about doing favours for people. It's what makes the
world go round."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Client hires don't necessarily by-pass the usual battery of
rigorous tests and interviews that other applicants must take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, according to headhunters and bankers interviewed by
Reuters, when it comes down to two otherwise similarly qualified
candidates, the one with influential connections will win out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between hiring a relative of a foreign
official who may be well connected, and offering employment to
such a person in the express hope of winning specific business,
is key to proving violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Frankly, we've got a list of all our Chinese nationals and
are going through it right now checking all the connections just
to be safe," said a source at a U.S. bank in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"POLITICALLY EXPOSED PERSONS"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice is more prevalent in China, bankers say,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled that three major companies cannot be held liable in the United States for crimes South Africa's former apartheid government committed, saying a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision "plainly bars" such lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs brought their suits under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), a law passed in 1789 that allowed non-U.S. citizens to bring cases in U.S. federal courts for violations of international law, such as piracy.

Royal Dutch Petroleum Co, was seen as a major victory for multinational corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court ruling on Wednesday could mark the end for plaintiffs in the long-running case, who accused Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Ford Motor Company (F.N) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) of facilitating decades of race-based crimes such as torture and extrajudicial killings because their South African subsidiaries sold products to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The automakers knew their vehicles were being used by South African forces to violently suppress protesters, while IBM knew its computers were being used to help strip black citizens of their rights, plaintiffs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defendant companies can now request that the case be dismissed in district court, the ruling said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for the plaintiffs and representatives of the defendant companies were not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apartheid ended in 1994 when South Africa held its first all-race elections, bringing Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress to power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 50 major corporations were initially sued in 2002, but the complaints were later amended to target fewer companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the lawsuits included South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bernard Vaughan; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's ABC television unit on Wednesday will begin laying off about 175 people, or 2 percent of its workforce, to adjust to changes in technology and viewing habits, a person familiar with the decision said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move was prompted by a company-wide review to explore cutbacks in jobs Disney no longer needs, either because of improvements in technology or redundancies following a string of major acquisitions in the past few years.

Most of the cuts will come in technical operations, such as broadcast engineering, and at eight ABC-owned stations across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ABC statement did not confirm the numbers of job cuts but said the unit, which employs about 7,600 people, had reviewed its businesses and decided to restructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As technological advances continue to alter the competitive landscape and viewer habits, it's incumbent upon us to stay ahead of the curve," an ABC spokesman said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other jobs may become available as Disney focuses on new technologies such as its Watch ABC app, which offers live streaming of the network's programming on mobile devices, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company employed a similar restructuring strategy in 2010 at ABC News that strengthened that unit, the source said. The news division cut 400 jobs at the time, allowing it to shift focus and hire new people with different skills in growth areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Disney in April cut 150 jobs at its movie studio, 150 at its newly acquired Lucasfilm unit, and an undisclosed number in its consumer products division, sources told Reuters. Its ESPN sports network began eliminating 300 to 400 jobs in May, but a source said at the time that those cutbacks were unrelated to the broader review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney reported $1.85 billion in net income for the quarter that ended in June, a 1 percent gain from a year earlier. Operating income at media networks, the company's largest unit which includes cable channels and ABC, rose 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cable channels accounted for a 12 percent gain in quarterly operating income. At the ABC broadcast unit, operating income declined 21 percent due to higher prime time programming costs, lower program sales and decreased advertising revenue, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC's primetime ratings for the season that ended in May ranked fourth among the broadcast networks for 18- to 49-year-olds, the key group for advertisers, and second in total viewers, according to Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares have climbed 23 percent this year as the company has posted strong overall results overall lifted by media networks and theme parks.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The classes above reflect the final ratings and deal structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial interests in a trust that 
      holds a $250 million mortgage loan secured by 79 assisted living and 
      congregate care properties located in 15 states across the U.S. The loan 
      is sponsored by TPG Capital, L.P., a global private investment firm with 
      $56.7 billion of assets under management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Low Leverage Metrics: The $250 million loan has a Fitch Ratings' LTV of 
      56.7% and a debt per key of $67,531, which is lower than similar 
      transactions rated by Fitch. No additional debt is allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      New Sponsor Equity Contribution: The sponsor of the transaction is TPG 
      Capital, L.P. (TPG), and the loan is financing the assets in conjunction 
      with an affiliate of TPG's acquisition of Assisted Living Concepts, LLC 
      (ALC). Total acquisition costs were approximately $538.2 million with 
      TPG Capital contributing approximately $281.5 million of cash equity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Experienced Corporate Management: Upon completion of the acquisition the 
      sponsor, TPG, replaced the existing management with a new CEO and COO 
      with significant experience in the senior living industry, including 
      leading the turnaround of another underperforming assisted living 
      facility operator.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Diverse and Granular Portfolio: The portfolio exhibits geographic 
      diversity across secondary markets in 15 states. The largest state 
      exposure is Indiana with 15 facilities representing 19% by number of

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 72.4% decline in value and 
      an approximately 68.2% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings of class A (rated 'AAAsf' 
      by Fitch) and found that a 26.9% decline in Fitch NCF would result in a 
      one category downgrade, while a 44% decline would result in a downgrade 
      to below investment grade. The Rating Sensitivity section in the presale 
      report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and 
      sensitivities.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Aug 21 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's ABC
television unit on Wednesday will begin laying off about 175
people, or 2 percent of its workforce, to adjust to changes in
technology and viewing habits, a person familiar with the
decision said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move was prompted by a companywide review to explore
cutbacks in jobs Disney no longer needs, either because of
improvements in technology or redundancies following a string of
major acquisitions in the past few years. Reuters first reported
on the internal review in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new layoffs will occur across the Disney/ABC Television
Group, which includes the ABC broadcast network as well as the
Disney and ABC Family cable channels, the source said. Most of
the cuts will come in technical operations, such as broadcast
engineering, and at eight ABC-owned stations across the United
States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ABC statement did not confirm the numbers of job cuts but
said the unit, which employs about 7,600 people, had reviewed
its businesses and decided to restructure to improve operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As technological advances continue to alter the competitive
landscape and viewer habits, it's incumbent upon us to stay
ahead of the curve," an ABC spokesman said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other jobs may become available as Disney focuses on new
technologies such as its Watch ABC app, which offers live
streaming of the network's programming on mobile devices, the
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Disney cut 150 jobs at its movie studio, 150 at
its newly acquired Lucasfilm unit, and an undisclosed number in
its consumer products division, sources told Reuters. Its ESPN
sports network began eliminating 300 to 400 jobs in May, but a
source said at the time that those cutbacks were unrelated to
the broader review.&lt;/p&gt;

			Generali US Branch Successfully Deploys Instec&#8217;s Quicksolver Cloud in 
      Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Azure
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Generali US Branch&#174; (&#8220;Generali&#8221;), the US operations of Assicurazioni 
      Generali S.p.A., a global insurance provider, and Instec&#174;, 
      a provider of PC insurance platforms, announced today that Generali has 
      successfully migrated its Commercial Auto and Liability lines of 
      business to Instec&#8217;s Quicksolver 
      Cloud&#8482; policy administration platform running on Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 
      Azure cloud platform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Generali is investing heavily in cloud technology for core systems as 
      part of its overall strategy to modernize its operational systems. In 
      addition to modernization, the Generali cloud strategy was also 
      developed to avoid the significant outages and system downtime the 
      company experienced with both 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. By moving its 
      core policy administration platform to Windows Azure, Generali now has a 
      more dependable operating environment with improved system uptime as 
      well as immediate access to data backups.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Generali has been working with Instec for nearly a decade beginning 
      with our selection of Quicksolver. We initially chose Quicksolver in 
      large part due to its extensive bureau content capabilities, as well as 
      the low total cost of ownership,&#8221; said Mauricio Caneda, CIO for 
      Generali. &#8220;Migrating to Instec&#8217;s cloud technology platform, and Windows 
      Azure specifically, is a core tenet of our strategic growth plan.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The insurance industry is beginning to deploy core systems such as 
      policy administration, claims, and billing in the cloud. Generali&#8217;s 
      successful implementation is evidence that insurers are finding a great 
      deal of value in this approach, which we believe will increase 
      dramatically in use over the next few years,&#8221; said Kevin Mason, Vice 
      President of Product Development and Maintenance with Instec. &#8220;The 
      combination of Quicksolver and the Windows Azure cloud platform has 
      enabled us to deliver an offering that provides Generali a highly 
      reliable environment that emphasizes our core value propositions of 
      faster time to market, lower total cost of ownership, and reduced risk 
      of implementation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;By deploying Quicksolver Cloud in Windows Azure, carriers such as 
      Generali can now take advantage of the cloud&#8217;s economics, scalability, 
      and reliability. The cost savings and efficiencies insurers are 
      realizing in the cloud are an incredible competitive edge&#8212;it&#8217;s a game 
      changer,&#8221; said Tony Jacob, Managing Director for Worldwide Insurance, 
      Microsoft. &#8220;We also see many other insurance carriers now looking at the 
      cloud to provide a path to modernization in core systems, risk and 
      analytics, agent desktops, etc., where traditional approaches may have 
      been ruled out based on costs, timelines, and risk.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Azure is a highly scalable cloud platform that is 
      open and flexible, allowing companies to develop, implement, and 
      distribute applications. As a development platform, Windows Azure gives 
      Instec the power to utilize platform as a service for its flagship 
      Quicksolver technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Instec&#8217;s Quicksolver is a complete PC insurance rating and policy 
      administration system that supports multi-state, multi-location, bureau 
      and client-specific policy processing for all 50 states and all major 
      commercial lines of business. Instec&#8217;s software delivers scalability, 
      cost control, and speed of delivery to carriers and MGAs in the 
      commercial market.

			Microsoft Windows Azure Powers Blackbaud Mobile App
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Nonprofits can now quickly and easily gain remote access to 
      mission-critical data
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Blackbaud (BLKB) today announced the use of Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 
      Azure cloud services to connect The 
      Raiser&#8217;s Edge mobile app to on-premises instances of the company&#8217;s 
      flagship Raiser&#8217;s Edge donor 
      management software. One of the first companies to adopt the 
      Windows Azure Service Bus, Blackbaud now makes it easy for 
      nonprofit professionals that want easy access to data from their mobile 
      devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "I'm very excited about the doors the mobile application opens in terms 
      of mobility with our constituent data," said Chris Kennedy, 
      International Mission Board development officer. "The impetus for 
      development officers&#8217; success is their ability to be in front of 
      constituents, not a computer. As mobile access to constituent data 
      increases, so go excuses for neglecting face-to-face contact. This tool 
      could not have come soon enough."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nonprofits use information from The Raiser&#8217;s Edge for a variety of 
      tasks, including fundraising appeals and supporter engagement. The 
      ability to access this information via a mobile device is helping 
      nonprofits become more efficient and focused on achieving their missions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Mobile device users need access to on-premises data and assets. By 
      taking advantage of Windows Azure Service Bus, Blackbaud enables large 
      and small organizations to cost effectively access The Raiser&#8217;s Edge 
      through the cloud,&#8221; said Karri Alexion-Tiernan Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Azure 
      director of marketing. &#8220;We&#8217;re pleased that Blackbaud is using Windows 
      Azure to serve their customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With 15,000 users, The Raiser&#8217;s Edge mobile application is quickly 
      emerging as an important tool for nonprofit professionals to manage 
      critical information while on the go. To easily, safely and 
      securely connect the mobile app to The Raiser&#8217;s Edge, Blackbaud uses the 
      Windows Azure Service Bus, reducing the cost and complexity of 
      traditional connectivity solutions that require additional hardware, 
      software and IT expertise. The end result is a simple experience 
      for the user when accessing vital information through a mobile device in 
      a matter of seconds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delivering seamless integration between disparate systems &#8211; 
      some in the cloud and some not. Even five years ago, this would have 
      been too costly and complicated for many of our clients,&#8221; said Mary Beth 
      Westmoreland, Blackbaud&#8217;s vice president of engineering. &#8220;Cloud services 
      like Windows Azure help support nonprofits in spending less time 
      managing technology and more time on their missions.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The long-running rivalry between Microsoft Corp and Google Inc is turning into a schoolyard brawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Wednesday opened a new front against the world's No 1 search provider by piloting an ad-free offering for educational users of Bing, its search engine that for years has trailed Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the free program called "Bing for Schools," students in participating school districts will no longer see ads or adult content when they do Internet searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has signed up the Los Angeles Unified School District and Atlanta Public Schools among other school districts, has pitched Bing as an alternative at a time of rising public concern over how Internet companies are tracking their users' every move to target the ads they display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the program, Microsoft will also offer free Surface tablets and course materials for teaching youngsters about Internet use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stefan Weitz, Microsoft's director of search, said the program would help expose young users to Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope that we demonstrate the quality of Bing to teachers and students and also their parents, and once they see how good it is, we hope to see increased usage outside of schools too," Weitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing, with 18 percent of the search market share, has long trailed Google, at 67 percent, according to data from ComScore, despite an aggressive effort to close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATTACK CAMPAIGN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move is the latest sign that technology companies are targeting the education market as a way to reach children who will become the next generation of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Bing campaign, framed in the context of privacy concerns, is part of a broad, anti-Google marketing campaign directed by a team of political consultants including Mark Penn, long-time adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months Microsoft has ramped up allegations posted to its "Scroogled" website, including claims that Google violates its users' trust by scanning emails to target ads. Microsoft has also backed promotion of a "Do Not Track" protocol that would discourage online ad targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People just don't think it's appropriate to show ads to children in a learning environment," Weitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Google spokesman declined to immediately comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft relies heavily on software sales, more than 95 percent of Google's revenue come from ads, and a significant portion of that comes from its dominant search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOSTLING IN CLASSROOMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft have also been vying to get schools to adopt their productivity software. Google has been offering a discount for its Google Apps suite, which it hopes can replace programs such as Microsoft Word on school computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech companies, led by Apple Inc, have also competed fiercely to get hardware into the classroom, even while academic studies are divided over the effectiveness of gadgets in improving student performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Apple, Google in December announced a program to give its Chromebook computers to schools for $99 each. Six months later, Microsoft began offering its Surface RT tablet to educational institutions for $199, a discount of more than 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the Bing campaign, school districts whose students use the Microsoft search engine win points, which they can redeem for Surface tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleigha Henderson-Rosser, the director of instructional technology at Atlanta Public Schools, said she had no qualms about receiving aid from tech companies. Atlanta schools will not be paid money to participate in the Bing program, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henderson-Rosser said she will try to rally parents to use Bing to help win Surface tablets for schools that cannot afford the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm seeing it as a community effort to fill in the gaps," she said.

      proof that our strategy serves a key market need. This funding surpasses 
      all the investments we have received to date, and we will use this

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry and Nadia Damouni&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 21 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is
close to naming two new directors with finance and risk
management expertise to its board, a source close to the matter
said, as the largest U.S. bank faces a new wave of regulatory
scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has identified the candidates but the board has not
yet voted on them, the source said on Tuesday, adding that a
decision is likely to come in September. The names of the
candidates could not be learned, although sources have said that
Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has extensive say in
who is named to the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new directors, who replace long-time board members David
Cote and Ellen Futter, will join at a tense time for the bank.
JPMorgan has become the target of several new investigations,
the most recent of which, according to a source familiar with
the probe, is a preliminary inquiry by the U.S. Department of
Justice into whether the bank had manipulated energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's board has been pressuring Dimon to improve the
bank's relationship with regulators, after a U.S. Senate
subcommittee report in March detailed how the executive demanded
the bank withhold trading data from one of its regulators, and
later yelled at a subordinate who provided the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The onslaught on the bank is a distraction for JPMorgan
executives but is unlikely to let up until regulatory focus
turned to another bank, the source said. Dimon, the source said,
was "stoic" as he navigates the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another person who knows Dimon said the CEO dislikes having
to spend so much time at management and board meetings
discussing probes and settlements instead of regular business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW Investment
Group, which had campaigned this year against the re-election of
Cote and Futter, said he hopes that new board members have
experience in bank regulation so that they can help repair the
company's standing with the government and better guard against
trading losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so-called London Whale trades cost the bank more than $6
billion and have led to criminal charges against two of its
former traders. Cote and Futter, who came under investor fire
for failing to prevent the losses, resigned in
July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company got off on the wrong foot with
regulators earlier this year, so someone who understands this
would be helpful," said Waizenegger, whose group is a JPMorgan
shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All told, JPMorgan is subject to more than a dozen probes in
multiple countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Justice Department probe, investors
recently learned that the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating whether the bank ran afoul of laws
that forbid bribery overseas. The bank has also said that a
federal investigation in California had preliminarily concluded
that the bank violated securities law when it sold mortgage
bonds from 2005 through 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heightened scrutiny could weigh on profits at the bank,
which said in its most recent quarterly filing with regulators
that additional losses from litigation, beyond what it has
already set aside, could be up to $6.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Peabody, a banking analyst at Portales Partners,
said litigation costs for JPMorgan and other firms could rise in
coming quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Aug 21 (Reuters) - The long-running rivalry
between Microsoft Corp and Google Inc is
turning into a schoolyard brawl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Wednesday opened a new front against the
world's No 1 search provider by piloting an ad-free offering for
educational users of Bing, its search engine that for years has
trailed Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the free program called "Bing for Schools," students
in participating school districts will no longer see ads or
adult content when they do Internet searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has signed up the Los Angeles Unified
School District and Atlanta Public Schools among other school
districts, has pitched Bing as an alternative at a time of
rising public concern over how Internet companies are tracking
their users' every move to target the ads they display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the program, Microsoft will also offer free
Surface tablets and course materials for teaching youngsters
about Internet use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stefan Weitz, Microsoft's director of search, said the
program would help expose young users to Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope that we demonstrate the quality of Bing to teachers
and students and also their parents, and once they see how good
it is, we hope to see increased usage outside of schools too,"
Weitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing, with 18 percent of the search market share, has long
trailed Google, at 67 percent, according to data from ComScore,
despite an aggressive effort to close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATTACK CAMPAIGN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move is the latest sign that technology
companies are targeting the education market as a way to reach
children who will become the next generation of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Bing campaign, framed in the context of privacy
concerns, is part of a broad, anti-Google marketing campaign
directed by a team of political consultants including Mark Penn,
long-time adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months Microsoft has ramped up allegations posted
to its "Scroogled" website, including claims that Google
violates its users' trust by scanning emails to target ads.
Microsoft has also backed promotion of a "Do Not Track" protocol
that would discourage online ad targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People just don't think it's appropriate to show ads to
children in a learning environment," Weitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Google spokesman declined to immediately comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft relies heavily on software sales, more than
95 percent of Google's revenue come from ads, and a significant
portion of that comes from its dominant search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOSTLING IN CLASSROOMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft have also been vying to get schools to
adopt their productivity software. Google has been offering a
discount for its Google Apps suite, which it hopes can replace
programs such as Microsoft Word on school computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech companies, led by Apple Inc, have also
competed fiercely to get hardware into the classroom, even while
academic studies are divided over the effectiveness of gadgets
in improving student performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Apple, Google in December announced a program to
give its Chromebook computers to schools for $99 each. Six
months later, Microsoft began offering its Surface RT tablet to
educational institutions for $199, a discount of more than 50
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the Bing campaign, school districts whose
students use the Microsoft search engine win points, which they
can redeem for Surface tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleigha Henderson-Rosser, the director of instructional
technology at Atlanta Public Schools, said she had no qualms
about receiving aid from tech companies. Atlanta schools will
not be paid money to participate in the Bing program, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henderson-Rosser said she will try to rally parents to use
Bing to help win Surface tablets for schools that cannot afford
the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm seeing it as a community effort to fill in the gaps,"
she said. "What school is going to turn down tablets for our
students?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) is close to naming two new directors with finance and risk management expertise to its board, a source close to the matter said, as the largest U.S. bank faces a new wave of regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Aug 21 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is
close to naming two new directors with finance and risk
management expertise to its board, a source close to the matter
said, as the largest U.S. bank faces a new wave of regulatory
scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has identified the candidates but the board has not
yet voted on them, the source said on Tuesday, adding that a
decision is likely to come in September. The names of the
candidates could not be learned, although sources have said that
Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has extensive say in
who is named to the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new directors, who replace long-time board members David
Cote and Ellen Futter, will join at a tense time for the bank.
JPMorgan has become the target of several new investigations,
the most recent of which, according to a source familiar with
the probe, is a preliminary inquiry by the U.S. Department of
Justice into whether the bank had manipulated energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's board has been pressuring Dimon to improve the
bank's relationship with regulators, after a U.S. Senate
subcommittee report in March detailed how the executive demanded
the bank withhold trading data from one of its regulators, and
later yelled at a subordinate who provided the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The onslaught on the bank is a distraction for JPMorgan
executives but is unlikely to let up until regulatory focus
turned to another bank, the source said. Dimon, the source said,

to spend so much time at management and board meetings
discussing probes and settlements instead of regular business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW Investment
Group, which had campaigned this year against the re-election of
Cote and Futter, said he hopes that new board members have
experience in bank regulation so that they can help repair the
company's standing with the government and better guard against
trading losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so-called London Whale trades cost the bank more than $6
billion and have led to criminal charges against two of its
former traders. Cote and Futter, who came under investor fire
for failing to prevent the losses, resigned in
July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company got off on the wrong foot with
regulators earlier this year, so someone who understands this
would be helpful," said Waizenegger, whose group is a JPMorgan
shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All told, JPMorgan is subject to more than a dozen probes in

that additional losses from litigation, beyond what it has
already set aside, could be up to $6.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Peabody, a banking analyst at Portales Partners,

coming quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

			Digital Right to Repair Coalition (DRTR) Proclaims IBM Has Damaged 
      Owners&#8217; Rights by Restricting Access to Defect Support
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Buyers of IBM hardware were treated to a new pop-up on IBM Fix Central 
      website in the US and the EU starting August 11, 2013. The screen 
      announces that it is now necessary to input a serial number to validate 
      the IBM maintenance contract status for any machine requiring a patch or 
      fix. Serial numbers for machines that are not on a current IBM-only 
      maintenance contract will not access the database. &#8220;The patches and 
      fixes being blocked behind the new entitlement database are the same 
      patches and fixes to errors of design or manufacturing that IBM 
      traditionally supported as part of their quality control,&#8221; explains Gay 
      Gordon-Byrne Executive Director of the Digital Right to Repair 
      Coalition. &#8220;Blocking access to defect support appears to us as nothing 
      more than a plan to remove competition for repair in order to generate 
      higher profit margins by monopolizing service.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Owners of IBM platforms are new to such demands. &#8220;Until recently, IBM 
      had been the industry leader in retaining investment value of their 
      equipment because they did not interfere in the rights of the buyer to 
      control how their purchases would be supported in the long term. This 
      included offering a return to service option for used equipment, time 
      and materials options, and ready access to Fix Central for hardware 
      problem resolution. Users are now learning that IBM has embraced the 
      distasteful policies of Oracle following their purchase of Sun 
      Microsystems in 2010,&#8221; continues Gordon-Byrne. &#8220;Users will discover that 
      they cannot buy or sell equipment without buying additional contracts 
      from IBM at non-competitive rates. As we saw with Sun equipment, these 
      same policies will crush the used market and diminish the value of 
      investments already made in IBM equipment. Independent repair and used 
      equipment value are two sides of the same coin. No one invests in 
      equipment that cannot be economically repaired.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM does not appear to be applying the policy consistently, reports 
      Gordon-Byrne. &#8220;We have been told of numerous instances where customers 
      have successfully pointed out that they intend to follow the policies in 
      place at the time of their initial purchase. IBM has already announced 
      that the X series platform is not included in the policy due to customer 
      complaints. We suspect users have more influence than they are using.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Digital Right to Repair Coalition is committed to supporting the 
      rights of all digital equipment owners to repair and resell their 
      hardware purchases. For more information www.digitalrighttorepair.org.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Steven Sinofsky, the hard-charging former Microsoft Corp executive, has joined the prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a part-time "board partner," representing the firm on certain boards of companies it invests in.&lt;/p&gt;

			Walter Investment Management SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Levi  Korsinsky, LLP 
      Announces Class Action Against Walter Investment Management Corp. and 
      Its Board of Directors and Lead Plaintiff Deadline of September 23, 2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Levi  Korsinsky announces that a class action lawsuit has been 
      commenced in the United States District Court for the Middle District of 
      Florida on behalf of investors who purchased Walter Investment 
      Management Corp. (&#8220;Walter&#8221; or the "Company") (NYSE: WAC) commons stock 
      during the period between May 9, 2012 and June 6, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      or call: 877-363-5972. There is no cost or obligation to you.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complaint alleges that the Company misrepresented and/or failed to 
      disclose that: a) the Company lacked adequate internal controls over 
      financial accounting; b) the Company&#8217;s financial statements contained 
      false and misleading statements; c) the Company failed to disclose 
      material weaknesses in the internal controls of its recent acquisition, 
      Reverse Mortgage Solutions, Inc. (&#8220;RMS&#8221;); d) the Company had overstated 
      the value of RMS; and e) as a result of the foregoing, all statements at 
      relevant times were materially false and misleading.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On March 18, 2013, the Company disclosed that it had identified a 
      material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. On 
      this news, the Company&#8217;s shares fell 20% to close at $32.98 on March 19, 
      2013. On June 6, 2013, the Company reported that it had discovered a 
      failure to record certain estimated liabilities to investors relating to 
      servicing error by RMS and, therefore, RMS&#8217; financial statements should 
      no longer be relied upon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shareholders of Walter have until September 23, 2013

      appointment as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Florida Community Services Corp. of Walton County, FL's 
      Water  Sewer Revs at 'AA'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings affirms the 'AA' rating for the following Florida 
      Community Services Corporation of Walton County, FL (FCSC or the 
      corporation) revenue bonds:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Approximately $14.1 million water and sewer system improvement and 
      refunding revenue bonds, series 2006.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SECURITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bonds are secured by a pledge of the trust estate, which includes 
      the net revenues and impact fees derived from the operation of the water 
      and sewer system (the system). The bonds are also secured by segregated 
      cash funded debt service reserve funds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CONTINUED STRONG FINANCIAL METRICS: The system maintains very positive 
      financial performance, with strong fiscal 2013 debt service coverage 
      both including and excluding connection fees. Fiscal 2013 liquidity was 
      also excellent with over 1,700 days' cash on hand, but may decline as 
      the utility continues to cash-fund its capital plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MODEST AND DECLINING DEBT BURDEN: The debt burden is low and capital 
      needs are manageable. No additional bonds are expected over the next 
      several years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      STRONG RATE SETTING FLEXIBILITY: Rates remain affordable, as annual 
      increases have reflected only the rate of inflation since the 1990's and 
      will continue to do so in the future. Increases have been sufficient to 
      maintain a strong financial profile over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SOMEWHAT LIMITED LOCAL ECONOMY: Located east of Pensacola on the Florida 
      panhandle, much of the service area is centered along the coast and 
      economic activity is dominated by tourism and retirement services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT: The corporation has successfully maintained a 
      strong financial and operational profile amid both rapid growth and 
      subsequent economic decline of the service territory in the past decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CONTINUED STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: The utility's ability to sustain 
      strong debt service coverage and liquidity, while internally funding 
      capital needs and reducing its debt burden, could lead to positive 
      future rating action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CREDIT PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The corporation is a non-profit, single-purpose entity created to own 
      and operate a regional water and sewer utility system. A component unit 
      of Walton County, FCSC is the sole provider of water and sewer services 
      to the southern portion of the county, serving an estimated 57,000 
      residents during peak tourist season. The primary service area consists 
      of coastal communities along the Gulf of Mexico (about 40,000 acres, 
      roughly half of which is state-owned lands) which attract seasonal 
      tourism and retirees. The economy is relatively stable despite ties to 
      economically sensitive employment in tourism and services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      STRONG FINANCIAL PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Financial performance is strong, as evidenced by above average debt 
      service coverage and liquidity. Net revenues available for debt service 
      yielded 3.9x coverage on an all-in basis in fiscal 2013, and coverage 
      was still strong when excluding impact fees at 2.9x. Out year financial 
      projections, updated annually by management, show strong margins 
      persisting throughout the five year forecast. The utility has 
      historically exceeded budgetary expectations by applying conservative 
      assumptions to revenues and expenses, and the most conservative 
      assumptions show fiscal 2014 coverage still solid at 3.2x including 
      impact fees, and 2.2x without.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fiscal 2013 liquidity, as measured by days' cash on hand, was very high 
      at 1,733. Including unrestricted cash that is earmarked for capital 
      construction, this number is even higher, approaching 2,000 days. Cash 
      is expected to decline as the corporation cash funds its capital plan, 
      yet is expected to remain strong relative to the medians for 
      similarly-rated entities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MODERATE DEBT LEVELS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The debt burden and capital plan are manageable. With roughly $34 
      million in outstanding bonds, debt to net fixed assets was low in fiscal 
      2013 at 23%. Debt per customer is similarly below average at $864, which 
      is roughly 50% of the Fitch median for systems rated in the 'AA' 
      category. The system's capital improvement plan (CIP) totals 
      approximately $57 million over the next five years and will primarily 
      fund storage and lift station upgrades, the renewal and replacement of 
      water and sewer transmission pipes and force mains, and improvements to 
      the system's three wastewater treatment plants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The system completes nearly 95% of construction needs in-house, 
      contracting out only for tank work. As a result, the CIP also contains 
      significant funding for the purchase and repair of construction vehicles 
      and equipment. Management expects to fund the CIP on a pay-go basis for 
      existing infrastructure, using impact fee revenues for expansion-related 
      work associated with new development. Apart from the general CIP, the 
      system maintains funds restricted for future maintenance projects, as 
      well as disaster relief and emergency preparedness contingency funds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AFFORDABLE AND FLEXIBLE USER CHARGES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The corporation has consistently adjusted rates on an annual basis since 
      the 1990's. Customers can expect their bill to increase by roughly 2% 
      each year, reflecting the Florida Public Services Commission consumer 
      price index (CPI) inflator. These annual adjustments occur 
      automatically, and the corporation is only required to seek approval 
      from the Walton County Commission should an increase exceed the rate of 
      CPI. To date, rates have only been increased at this incremental pace.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Combined water and sewer bills have historically comprised only about 
      1.6% of median household income, which compares favorably to Fitch's 2% 
      threshold for affordability. This trend of affordability is expected to 
      persist into the five year forecast, as annual rates are expected to 
      only increase by CPI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CONCENTRATED ECONOMY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The corporation's service territory is primarily a tourist and retiree 
      destination, with some industry linked to the Eglin Air Force Base in 
      northern Walton County. Due to the vulnerability of these sectors, the 
      local economy declined slightly during the economic recession of the 
      late 2000's, yet the system was still able to maintain very strong 
      coverage levels and liquidity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      County and metropolitan area unemployment were low at 4.2% and 5.1%, 
      respectively in June 2013, indicating a resilience and rebound of the 
      tourism sector. These rates were better than those of the state and 
      nation, which were both at 7.1% for the month. The Walton County median 
      household income, which reflects the service industry concentration in 
      the area, is lower than both the state and national averages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RELIABLE SERVICE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      System capacity and water supply are solid. The system provides water 
      and wastewater service to 16,300 water and 22,416 sewer equivalent 
      residential customer accounts. Included in these accounts are several 
      large resort and hotel connections, one of which is only a wastewater 
      customer. Customer concentration is not an issue, however, as the ten 
      largest customers comprise less than 10% of total system revenues. Local 
      population increases by over 30% during peak tourism season, and 
      management notes that this season is becoming longer each year, 
      extending the demand on utility services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The service territory has historically experienced rapid development 
      growth, briefly challenging the system's ability to keep pace with the 
      demand of new connections. Though growth slowed during the recession, 
      the system has taken active measures to invest significant funds towards 
      infrastructure upkeep, lending management significant flexibility to 
      maintain system redundancy during both high and low demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Development is once again increasing, and given that the service 
      territory is only about 70% built out, more tourism-related demand is 
      likely going forward. Management is basing capital needs on a 
      conservative annual growth rate of 5% based on historic trends, and is 
      optimistic that its dedicated renewal and replacement program will pay 
      off through system redundancy and ample capacity.

&lt;p&gt;It all started with Lady Gaga.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Backplane has spent the past two years quietly building a place for the world&#8217;s biggest brands to engage with their fans.&#160;The company originated as part of Lady Gaga&#8217;s tech team. Gaga has a massive social media following. She has 58.7 million Facebook likes and 39.8 million Twitter followers. In July 2012 she launched her own social network just for Lady Gaga fans, who are known as Little Monsters, and Backplane was the force behind that site. Now the company is opening up its platform to other brands and celebrities, starting with one of the world&#8217;s most iconic brands &#8212; Coca-Cola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve used the Little Monster community to hone our skills and perfect our product, to learn about user behavior, the psychology and sociology of community, and how to manage super fans,&#8221; CEO Matt Michelsen said in an interview with VentureBeat. &#8220;Every brand, celebrity, politician, and organization I&#8217;ve talked to faces the challenge of creating an online community that they own. No one has built this platform yet.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelsen said that while Facebook and Twitter are powerful platforms, they don&#8217;t engender the level of engagement that brands want. He described Backplane as a &#8220;walled garden&#8221; where fans can come together over common interests to communicate, share, and organize. In the case of Lady Gaga, Littlemonsters.com is a place where strangers can express their passion for the star without fear of ridicule, or share experiences of bullying &#8212; one of Gaga&#8217;s flagship causes. The brand itself can use the network to deliver information about events or news and to solicit feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backplane&#8217;s front-end is a straightforward social network. Michelsen said the goal was to make it like a &#8220;Ford Taurus,&#8221; or an intuitive product that people easily understand how to use. The real distinguishing factor, he said, rests in Backplane&#8217;s ability to help brands connect in a meaningful way with their fans and measure that participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backplane is being very selective about the brands it works with. The company is looking for top brands with very high engagement. In addition to Coca-Cola, Backplane also revealed a partnership with Cirque du Soleil. Both Coca-Cola and Cirque du Soleil made strategic investments in Backplane, which is in the process of closing a $12 million round of funding. The strategic investors join a high-profile group of venture capital firms, including SV Angel, Google Ventures, Founders Fund, Tomorrow Ventures, Lerer Ventures, and Menlo Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of startups take the shotgun approach and want to get the product out there as fast as possible. &#8221; Michelsen said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve taken the thoughtful, methodical approach. We looked at the current social ecosystem and at group behavior and have a big infrastructure in place that can support hundreds of thousands of participants on site at a time. Coca-Cola is a 125-year-old brand and we have to protect that.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaking down the barriers between celebrities, musicians, designers, politicians, etc. and their audiences is a hot topic of discussion in both the tech and brand worlds. Whether it&#8217;s through social media marketing and analytics, Google hangouts, or media campaigns, influencers and fans alike want more open channels of communication. Backplane will soon begin extending its platform to dozens more clients by the end of the year and then plans to scale quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelsen previously started two hedge funds and then went on to found trading technology firm UNX. He left UNX in 2010 to work for Lady Gaga&#8217;s manager, Troy Carter, and use his expertise to organize the Little Monsters into a cohesive online community. Cofounder Alex Moore was the first employee at Palantir. Now, along with a team of 34, they are building out a new model for social networks and brand engagement. Backplane is based in Palo Alto, Calif.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, Social&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MADRID Aug 22 (Reuters) - Airport retailer World Duty Free
Group (WDFG) on Thursday named former Goldman Sachs and Merrill
Lynch banker David Jimenez-Blanco as chief financial officer
ahead of its split from Italy's Autogrill planned for
October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WDFG has grown through acquisitions and the absorption of
Spanish travel retailer Aldeasa and has over 550 stores in
airports and other locations in 20 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autogrill, whose catering business has been badly hit by
reduced motorway traffic during the recession, hopes the
flotation in Milan will pave the way for possible tie-ups by
both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jimenez-Blanco has previously been responsible for U.S.
investment bank Merrill Lynch's business in Spain and Portugal
and was also head of investment banking for Goldman Sachs in the
two countries, WDFG said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A specialist in mergers and acquisitions, the Spaniard has
been a partner at emerging market--focused investment management
firm BK Partners since 2010.

&lt;p&gt;* PetroChina could take 25 percent stake in West Qurna
-sources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Pertamina could buy 10 percent share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Exxon would remain operator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Charlie Zhu and Peg Mackey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG/LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - China and Indonesia are
set to join Exxon Mobil's $50 billion project to develop Iraq's
West Qurna-1 oilfield, company and industry sources said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various scenarios for farming out Exxon's 60 percent stake
in the giant oilfield are still under discussion, but at this
stage China's biggest energy firm PetroChina is
expected to take 25 percent and Indonesia's state-owned
Pertamina 10 percent, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon would remain operator of the southern field, core to
Iraq' oil expansion plans, though its share could be cut to 25
percent. Royal Dutch Shell would retain its existing 15
percent share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is already the top foreign player in Iraq's oilfields
and such a big stake in West Qurna-1, around 50 km northwest of
the southern oil hub of Basra, would make PetroChina the single
biggest foreign investor in Iraqi oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PetroChina confirmed it was in talks for a stake in West
Qurna-1 at its interim results briefing on Thursday, though its
president, Wang Dongjin, did not disclose the size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The negotiation is still under way," he told reporters. "We
are likely to conclude the talks within this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pertamina, the deal could be its largest foreign
acquisition and mark its first move into Iraqi oil and gas 
since U.S.-led forces toppled leader Saddam Hussein in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi oil would help Indonesia meet soaring fuel demand as
South East Asia's largest economy grows. Former OPEC-member
Indonesia was once itself a big oil exporter, but it is
struggling to arrest declining oil and gas output from its
ageing fields. The country already imports a million barrels a
month of Iraqi oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia's Chief Economic Minister Hatta Rajasa said in
March that Pertamina was interested in buying into the project
and was negotiating a 10 to 20 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon Mobil spokesman declined to comment. A Pertamina
spokesman said he was unaware of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Exxon offered to sell its entire 60 percent stake
in West Qurna-1 after a dispute with Baghdad over contracts it
signed with the autonomous Kurdistan in the north, deals which
the central government rejects as illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. oil company later committed to further investment
at the field - now pumping just under 500,000 barrels a day -
and stepped back from making a full exit, talking to potential
buyers about smaller stake sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq's oilfields are the largest in the Middle East open to
foreign investment. The reserves are an alluring prospect for
energy firms seeking to secure future oil supply, despite tough
contract terms imposed by Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PERTAMINA IN IRAQ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq and Pertamina signed an oil exploration agreement in
block 3 in Iraq's western desert in 2002, but Pertamina never
started exploration due to the Iraq war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian energy company has tried to revive that deal,
and has also expressed interest in another field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pertamina also bid unsuccessfully when Iraq auctioned the
rights to develop its massive oilfields in 2009. Rival Malaysian
state oil firm Petronas was successful and won stakes in four
big Iraqi projects. The bids were part of an aggressive
expansion on to the global stage by Petronas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pertamina's overseas ambitions have been more modest. The
firm has investments in Libya, Sudan, Qatar, Vietnam, Australia
and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad signed a series of service contracts in 2009 that
committed international oil companies to raising Iraq's oil
output by 2017 beyond 12 million bpd - which is more than Saudi
Arabia produces now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure and security problems have since forced the
government to cut the target to 9 million bpd by 2020. The
issues are so acute Iraq could report a year-on-year output fall
for 2013, its first after two years of robust gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 22 (Reuters) - Indonesia's state oil firm
Pertamina is set to buy a stake in Iraq's giant West
Qurna oilfield from Exxon Mobil, joining PetroChina in
the $50 billion project, industry and Iraqi oil sources said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal could be Pertamina's largest foreign acquisition
and mark its first move into Iraqi oil and gas production since
U.S.-led forces toppled leader Saddam Hussein in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As things now stand, Pertamina is likely to take a 10
percent stake in the project at the southern oilfield, now
pumping nearly 500,000 barrels per day, the sources said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose in light trading on Friday, led by a jump in Microsoft shares, as trading took place without interruption a day after the Nasdaq stock exchange suffered an unprecedented, three-hour trading halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft (MSFT.O) shares posted their largest daily percentage gain in more than four years after the head of the world's largest software company, Steve Ballmer, announced he will retire within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock closed up 7.3 percent at $34.77 and was the largest contributor to the advance on the three major indexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big news today is the succession at Microsoft, but beyond that it's pretty quiet," said Dan Veru, chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management in Fort Lee, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 46.77 points or 0.31 percent, to 15,010.51, the S 500 .SPX gained 6.54 points or 0.39 percent, to 1,663.5 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 19.085 points or 0.52 percent, to 3,657.792.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume was among the lowest of the year with about 4.9 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, far below the daily average so far this year of about 6.3 billion shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading volume was only slightly higher than Thursday's 4.4 billion, affected by a technological problem that shut down trading in Nasdaq securities for three hours in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Robert Greifeld, chief executive officer of Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ.O) said the exchange resolved the technical problems that led to the halt but could not guarantee there would never be future glitches. Nasdaq shares gained 1.2 percent to close at $30.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's gains helped the S 500 and Nasdaq Composite end a two-week losing streak, but the Dow posted its third consecutive weekly decline. For the week the Dow fell 0.5 percent, the S gained 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq added 1.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic data showed sales of new single-family homes fell by 13.4 percent in July to an annual rate of 394,000 units, well below expectations of 490,000 units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data weighed on homebuilder stocks, with PulteGroup (PHM.N) down 1.6 percent to $16.06 and Toll Brothers (TOL.N) off 3.9 percent to $31.19. The PHLX housing sector index .HGX lost 1.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandora Media Inc (P.N) slumped 12.9 percent to $18.91 after the Internet radio service said late Thursday that rising expenditures to acquire music and expand its sales force would push fiscal 2014 earnings below analyst expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aeropostale Inc (ARO.N) tumbled 20.2 percent to $8.76 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a steep third-quarter loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Autodesk (ADSK.O) rallied 7.7 percent to $38.91 after earlier hitting $41.72, its highest level since April 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly two issues rose for every one that fell on the NYSE and on Nasdaq 13 rose for every 11 decliners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Rodrigo Campos, additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Kenneth Barry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Steve Ballmer, a passionate salesman who has been a central figure at Microsoft Corp for more than three decades, unexpectedly announced his retirement as chief executive on Friday, ending a controversial 13-year reign in which the world's largest software company lost its position as the dominant force in computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surprise move sent the company's share price up 7 percent, reflecting a widespread view that Ballmer is not the man to reverse the fortunes of a company that remains highly profitable but has failed to navigate the transition to the mobile computing era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer's planned exit comes just weeks after the company announced a major reorganization and delivered an earnings report that showed across-the-board weakness in the business, including dismal sales of the company's new Surface tablet and a lukewarm reaction to the crucial Windows 8 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it had engaged the executive search firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles and would consider both internal and external candidates to succeed Ballmer - underscoring the lack of a succession plan at a company where many talented executives have been squeezed out over the years.

    By Bill Rigby
    SEATTLE/NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Steve Ballmer, a
passionate salesman who has been a central figure at Microsoft
Corp for more than three decades, unexpectedly
announced his retirement as chief executive on Friday, ending a
controversial 13-year reign in which the world's largest
software company lost its position as the dominant force in
computing.
    The surprise move sent the company's share price up 7
percent, reflecting a widespread view that Ballmer is not the
man to reverse the fortunes of a company that remains highly
profitable but has failed to navigate the transition to the
mobile computing era.
    Ballmer's planned exit comes just weeks after the company
announced a major reorganization and delivered an earnings
report that showed across-the-board weakness in the business,
including dismal sales of the company's new Surface tablet and a
lukewarm reaction to the crucial Windows 8 operating system.
 
    Microsoft said it had engaged the executive search firm
Heidrick &amp; Struggles and would consider both internal and
external candidates to succeed Ballmer - underscoring the lack
of a succession plan at a company where many talented executives
have been squeezed out over the years. Ballmer will stay on for
up to a year until a new CEO is found.
    A close friend and confidant of co-founder Bill Gates since
the company's earliest days, the 57-year-old Ballmer formally
notified the company two days ago of his intention to retire,
according to a regulatory filing. In an interview with the trade
publication ZD Net, director John Thompson said the search for a
successor had in fact been underway for some time.
    "We are well down the path in the search," said Thomson, who
is leading a search committee that also includes Gates.
    Still, the timing of the announcement and the lack of a
succession plan suggest the recent setbacks may have spurred the
company's board to act. Gates remains chairman of the board,
which has historically followed his lead.  
    Ballmer himself acknowledged his decision was abrupt.
    "There is never a perfect time for this type of transition,
but now is the right time," he wrote in a memo to employees.
"This is an emotional and difficult thing for me to do. I take
this step in the best interests of the company I love."
    Ballmer has faced criticism from investors for years as
rivals led by Apple Inc and Google Inc came to
dominate huge new markets in smartphones, tablets, Internet
search and cloud computing even as Microsoft remained reliant on
the traditional personal computer.
    Activist investing fund ValueAct Capital Management LP said
in April that it had taken a stake in the company and shortly
after began agitating for a change in strategy and a clear CEO
succession plan. 
    Microsoft, like Apple, has been under pressure from
shareholders to hand back more of its cash hoard, which now
totals $77 billion. 
    "This might accelerate more shareholder-friendly capital
returns of that cash treasure trove, which would help in the
revaluation of the stock to more appropriate levels," said Todd
Lowenstein at fund firm HighMark Capital Management, which holds
Microsoft shares.
    There are no obvious candidates to succeed Ballmer at a
company that has only had two CEOs in its 38-year history. 
Ballmer had once indicated that he intended to stay at least
until 2017. 
    
 
    
    Ballmer can claim some important successes: revenue tripled
during his tenure, profits doubled, and the company scored a big
success with the Xbox videogame business. The Windows and Office
franchises remain highly profitable, and Microsoft is
well-entrenched as a vendor of corporate computing products and
services.
    At the same time, though, repeated forays into mobile
phones, tablets and music players have come to grief. The
Surface tablet, aimed at the hugely successful iPad, alienated
longtime hardware partners even as it failed to generate
significant sales, and a phone partnership with Nokia 
has thus far yielded little for either company.
    At the same time, the company has lost billions trying to
compete with Google in the Internet search business. Some of
Microsoft's corporate computing businesses are also under threat
from the industry-wide transition to cloud-based services.
     The recent reorganization was aimed at reshaping Microsoft
- once primarily a purveyor of packaged software - into a
company focused on devices and services, essentially mimicking
Apple. 
    Yet most industry watchers felt it was too little, too late,
with some calling on the company to back away from the consumer
products sector and focus on serving businesses.
    In the ZD Net interview, Ballmer rejected that approach.
"Nobody has ever managed to figure out how to build a device for
a user that was just enterprise or just consumer," he said.
"These core experiences do span 'consumer and enterprise.'" 
    
    PASSION AT THE TOP 
    Ballmer, a forceful, often emotional leader, was regarded a
great salesman rather than a brilliant technologist.
    A physically imposing presence with a booming voice, his
motivational efforts were the stuff of legend: a clip of a
semi-hysterical Ballmer screeching and dancing around the stage
to rally Microsoft employees has been viewed nearly five million
times on YouTube.
    Yet the antics sometimes acquired an air of desperation as
Apple and other rivals produced industry-changing innovations
that Microsoft couldn't match.
    "That is the most expensive phone in the world and it
doesn't appeal to business customers," Ballmer laughed in a TV
interview after the launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007. Five years
later, iPhone sales alone were greater than Microsoft's overall
revenue. 
    A Michigan native, Ballmer studied applied mathematics and
economics at Harvard, where he met Gates. Several years later
Gates persuaded him to drop out of Stanford Business School to
become Microsoft's first commercial manager and the company's
30th employee. 
    To induce him, Gates offered Ballmer part ownership of the
company, and when Microsoft incorporated a year later, Ballmer
had almost an 8 percent stake. That formed the foundation of his
wealth which is now valued at $15 billion by Forbes magazine.
    Ballmer remains one of the largest holders of Microsoft
stock, with about four percent of the company. His net worth,
ironically, soared by nearly a billion dollars on Friday as the
stock market celebrated his departure.
    Microsoft shares closed up 7.3 percent at $34.75 on Nasdaq
on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Few CEOs wielded more power than Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet the company's first and foremost salesman never gained the respect he deserved for his role in transforming Bill Gates' tiny startup in the woods outside Seattle into the world's largest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who announced his retirement from the head of Microsoft Corp on Friday, had the misfortune to follow megastar Gates at the helm just as the company hit the end of its explosive growth period and faced a resurgent Apple Inc under an inspired Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Detroit native, who met Gates at Harvard, was doubly unfortunate that his ascent to the CEO office in January 2000 came just weeks before the bursting of the dot.com stock bubble, from which Microsoft's share price never recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Ballmer did treble revenues at Microsoft during his time in charge, and managed to steer the company away from obscurity or crisis that befell other tech firms, he consistently attracted criticism for management miscues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under his watch, Apple and Google Inc roared past Microsoft in the emerging arena of Internet search, smartphones and tablets, which made the software company look stodgy and behind-the-times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He tried hard.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Aug 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp CEO Steve
Ballmer unexpectedly announced on Friday that he would retire in

charge of day-to-day operations. Prior to that, he led numerous
divisions, including sales and support and operating-systems
development.

2000 - Ballmer succeeds Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as CEO
in January. The two met as students at Harvard University, where
Gates lived down the hall from Ballmer. In 1975, 19-year-old
Gates dropped out of Harvard and went on to found Microsoft
along with Paul Allen.

North American release of its Xbox gaming console, competing

.

2005 - Microsoft launches the next-generation Xbox 360 video
game console in November, strengthening its foothold in the
video game hardware market.

November. It is the first Microsoft-designed device to compete
in a market dominated by Apple Inc's  iPod. The music
player does not gain enough of a market, and Microsoft
discontinues selling it by mid-2012.

becomes the company's least popular operating system.

$31-per-share, cash-and-stock takeover offer to Yahoo Inc's
 board. Yahoo rejects the bid as too low.

2009 - Microsoft revamps its search engine to counter Google

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Aug 23 (Reuters) - Few CEOs wielded more power than
Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet the company's first and foremost salesman never
gained the respect he deserved for his role in transforming Bill
Gates' tiny startup in the woods outside Seattle into the
world's largest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who announced his retirement from the head of
Microsoft Corp on Friday, had the misfortune to follow
megastar Gates at the helm just as the company hit the end of
its explosive growth period and faced a resurgent Apple Inc
 under an inspired Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Detroit native, who met Gates at Harvard, was doubly
unfortunate that his ascent to the CEO office in January 2000
came just weeks before the bursting of the dot.com stock bubble,
from which Microsoft's share price never recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Ballmer did treble revenues at Microsoft during his
time in charge, and managed to steer the company away from
obscurity or crisis that befell other tech firms, he
consistently attracted criticism for management miscues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under his watch, Apple and Google Inc roared past
Microsoft in the emerging arena of Internet search, smartphones
and tablets, which made the software company look stodgy and
behind-the-times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He tried hard. Nobody can doubt his commitment to
Microsoft," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams
Wright Ragen. "The missing element was execution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His attempt to catch up was a failed $47 billion bid for
fading internet giant Yahoo Inc in 2008, a company
which is now worth much less. Yahoo's inexplicable decision to
reject the deal probably saved Ballmer's job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only last month, Ballmer launched a massive reorganization
of Microsoft in an attempt to transform it into a 'devices and
services' company, but it left most shareholders unimpressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer never lacked passion and energy for the company he
helped to build, but he was always more of a salesman and
cheerleader than a technology visionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is the most expensive phone in the world and it
doesn't appeal to business customers," Ballmer laughed in a TV
interview after the launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007. Five years
later, iPhone sales alone were greater than Microsoft's overall
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clip of a semi-hysterical Ballmer screeching and dancing
around the stage to rally Microsoft employees has been viewed
nearly five million times on YouTube, gaining him the nickname
'Monkey Boy'. And his hypnotic and slightly unhinged mantra of
'developers, developers, developers', captured at another
company conference, made him the butt of jokes for years after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GATES WOOS BALLMER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A natural math whiz from Michigan, Ballmer met Gates at
Harvard before Gates dropped out to co-found Microsoft in 1975.
Five years later, Gates persuaded Ballmer to drop out of
Stanford Business School to become Microsoft's first commercial
manager, and only the company's 30th employee, giving him an 8
percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft's first salesman, rather than a techie, he was
viewed with some distrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first time we met face-to-face, I thought this guy
looks like an operative for the NKVD (Soviet police)," recalled
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in his memoir. "He had piercing
blue eyes and a genuine toughness. Though as I got to know him
better, I found a gentler side as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen said that the young Ballmer - a zealous basketball
player and jogger - would wake him up at 7 a.m. doing push-ups
in their shared hotel room on early business trips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft engineered the personal computer revolution
through the 80s and 90s, the sales side of the organization grew
in size and importance, led by the charismatic Ballmer -
unmistakable on campus and at industry meetings with his shiny
bald dome, strapping physique and booming voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft-speak, employees were either a 'Bill guy',
meaning a technology person, or a 'Steve guy', meaning a sales
and marketing person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ballmer, known internally as SteveB, took over from
Gates as Microsoft CEO in 2000, some saw it as the triumph of
sales over technology and innovation, which ultimately ruined
the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have my own theory about why decline happens at companies
like IBM or Microsoft," former Apple CEO Jobs is quoted as
saying in his biography. "The quality of the product becomes
less important. The company starts valuing the great salesmen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRACK RECORD BETTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jobs was partially correct. Under Ballmer's watch, Microsoft
missed the shift to smartphones and tablets, and its share price

Einhorn said in 2011, as he campaigned publicly for Ballmer's
ouster. Microsoft shares rose 7 percent on the news of Ballmer's
retirement on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ballmer's record as a CEO was not as bad as many think.
People close to him say his loud public persona belied a quietly
shrewd business mind, and he managed Microsoft as well as anyone
could as the company reached a mature stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He boosted Microsoft's revenues and more than doubled its
already large profits. He outlasted erstwhile rivals such as
Novell and Sun Microsystems, which have now all-but disappeared,
and avoided the boardroom fiascos of Hewlett-Packard or
dramatic decline of AOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see anybody else on the management team at
Microsoft that I think would be much better than Ballmer," said
Eric Jackson at hedge fund Ironfire Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company has no anointed successor, and has had only two CEOs in its 38-year history - Ballmer and co-founder Bill Gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of tech executives that Microsoft might consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bates - Came to Microsoft two years ago as CEO of the acquired Skype and was recently elevated to lead Microsoft's business development and overall strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terry Myerson - The executive in charge of operating systems, which is still the heart of Microsoft, ranging across PCs, tablets, phones and the Xbox game console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella - Heads Microsoft's cloud and enterprise group, which is coming to the fore as the company struggles to catch up in online and mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Turner - As Chief Operating Officer for the last eight years, the former Wal-Mart Stores Inc executive leads Microsoft's enormous sales organization, but is generally considered to lack the technology credibility to be CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Sinofsky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former head of the Windows unit was widely tipped as a potential Microsoft CEO until his abrupt departure in November. His reputation has taken a hit since then with the dismal sales of the Surface tablet he launched and the lukewarm reception of Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vic Gundotra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-flying Google Inc engineer, key to that company's mobile phone and social initiatives, is a former Microsoft executive who could be tempted to return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reed Hastings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO of Netflix Inc is a rising Silicon Valley star and has intimate knowledge of Microsoft's business after several years on its board, until his departure last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Maritz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key powers in the early days of Windows, Maritz left in 2000 and eventually ran virtualization firm VMware Inc until last year. Talk occasionally surfaces that he could return to Microsoft, but he has never indicated any interest publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The co-founder of Microsoft is still Chairman, but has focused his day-to-day efforts on philanthropy since 2008 when he vacated his office on campus. People close to him say he is not considering a return to the CEO position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Robert Cyran
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next boss of Microsoft needs a &#8220;less is more&#8221; mindset. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer is finally on the way out. A $20 billion bump in the company&#8217;s value following the news shows just how badly investors wanted a new approach. The wasteful &#8220;try everything&#8221; strategy should go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer inherited a near-monopoly in the Windows operating system and Office productivity software, and he has done well fattening up that cash cow. Microsoft earned $22 billion last year, more than twice as much as in 2000, when he became CEO. But his empire-building ambitions are evident in sales, which have increased more than three-fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About three-quarters of profit still comes from Windows, Office and the like, with the company&#8217;s server  tools division making up most of the rest. The online services division, which contains search engine Bing, has been bleeding cash, losing $12 billion in the past three years alone. The entertainment and devices division is in the black, but hasn&#8217;t yet come close to recouping its cost of capital. Its missteps include the awful Zune music player and Kin phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company says it still wants to sell more devices and has only just started its push in that direction. The firm also says it might take up to a year to find a new CEO. Insiders like Terry Myerson, in charge of operating systems, could be in the running, as could exiled former rivals to Ballmer like Paul Maritz and dark-horse outsiders like Facebook&#8217;s Sheryl Sandberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever lands the job can score quick points by narrowing the focus on business software, at least to begin with. Selling the Xbox gaming unit could bring in some extra capital. Shutting down or spinning off search and Microsoft&#8217;s efforts in mobile devices would reduce losses such as the $900 million writedown it took on its Surface tablets in July. It would also allow the company to concentrate on things like making Office work well on gadgets such as Apple&#8217;s iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concentrating on business software would also make Microsoft simpler to understand and manage, tasks that became more complicated-looking in Ballmer&#8217;s last reorganization. Shareholders would surely be happy with the prospect of higher cash returns, too. Even the outgoing CEO might find solace. The promise of his departure boosted the value of his 4 percent stake by approaching $1 billion, and real change would deliver more.&lt;/p&gt;

      In a recently filed federal class action complaint, Walter and certain 
      of its officers and directors were charged with violating certain 
      provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, the 
      complaint alleges that among other things, defendants misrepresented 
      and/or failed to disclose that: (a) Walter lacked adequate internal 
      controls over financial accounting; (b) Walter&#8217;s internal controls were 
      not effective; (c) Walter&#8217;s financial statements contained false and 
      misleading statements; (d) Walter had failed to disclose material 
      weaknesses in the internal controls of RMS; and (e) Walter had 
      overstated the value of its recent acquisition, RMS. According to the 
      complaint, when the news was released, the Company&#8217;s stock declined.

&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft climbs after announcing CEO Ballmer's retirement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Indexes up: Dow 0.03 pct, S off 0.12 pct, Nasdaq up 0.27
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks inched higher on
Friday as trading resumed without interruption a day after the
Nasdaq stock exchange suffered an unprecedented, three-hour
trading halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 5.9 percent, giving the Nasdaq
composite index its biggest lift, after Microsoft Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer announced he will retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a technological problem shut down trading in Nasdaq
 securities on Thursday, Chief Executive Officer Robert
Greifeld said the Nasdaq resolved the technical issues that led
to Thursday's trading halt but cannot guarantee there would be
no future problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer will retire within the next 12 months, once
Microsoft chooses a successor. The stock traded at $34.31 a
share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the Nasdaq outage on Thursday, the S 500 managed
to register its biggest percentage gain since Aug. 1, but was
unable to close above its 50-day moving average for a fifth
straight session. The mark, now at 1,659.34, has become a
technical hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've got the 50-day (average) right there. We are all kind
of still catching our breath after yesterday's flash freeze,"
said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's
Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Microsoft news got everybody a little excited and
caused some volume in tech, but that is only the main headline
news today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark index is on pace for a slight gain for the
week after two consecutive declines, as investors exercise
caution amid uncertainty over how soon the Fed will begin to
wind down its $85 billion a month stimulus program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next Fed monetary policy meeting is scheduled for Sept.
17-18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic data showed sales of new single-family homes in
America fell by 13.4 percent in July to an annual rate of
394,000 units, well below expectations of 490,000 units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data weighed on homebuilder stocks, with PulteGroup
 down 1.8 percent to $16.02 and Toll Brothers off
2.6 percent to $31.61. The PHLX housing sector index lost
1.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.42 points or
0.03 percent, to 14,968.16, the S 500 gained 1.95
points or 0.12 percent, to 1,658.91 and the Nasdaq Composite
 added 9.867 points or 0.27 percent, to 3,648.575.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandora Media Inc slumped 12.3 percent to $19.04 after
the Internet radio service said late Thursday that rising
expenditures to acquire music and expand its sales force would
push fiscal 2014 earnings below analyst expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aeropostale Inc tumbled 20.4 percent to $8.74 after
the teen apparel retailer forecast a deep third quarter loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta Aug 23 (Reuters) - As Wall Street giant
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co begins the search for buyers of its
physical commodities business, a collection of long-term leases
on more than a quarter of the oil storage tanks in Canada's
primary trading hub may emerge as one of its most valuable but
lesser-known assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite growing signs of a downturn in global rates for
leasing oil storage capacity, the opportunity to take up over 6
million barrels in Hardisty, Alberta, may be a powerful
attraction, say crude traders in Canada's oil capital Calgary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For any company serious about staking a claim to the
fast-expanding physical oil sands market, the tanks - owned by
pipeline company Enbridge Inc, according to market
sources - offer immediate and powerful entree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For JPMorgan, the storage tanks may be one of its most
lucrative offerings. Other assets include the Henry Bath &amp; Sons
metals warehouses, which are the subject of intensifying
regulatory scrutiny and several class action lawsuits over
alleged hoarding of aluminum, and a handful of power plant
contracts, many of which have already been sold off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For JP it's a tangible asset they will market when they
come to sell their commodity business," said one veteran
Canadian crude trader in Calgary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Storage allows you some flexibility and in this market it's
important to have that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six million barrels are more than half Enbridge's total
capacity of around 11 million barrels at Hardisty, the tiny town
in east-central Alberta that is Canada's equivalent to Cushing,
the main U.S. crude storage hub in Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also about 25 percent of the estimated total capacity
in Hardisty, starting point for both TransCanada Corp's 
proposed 890,000 barrel per day (bpd) Keystone XL and 1.1
million bpd Energy East pipelines. The nearby city of Edmonton,
another Alberta trading hub, has around 11 million barrels of
storage, according to industry estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of JPMorgan's leases are re-let to other companies
operating in Alberta's oil patch, according to market sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, JPMorgan is also a player in the physical market.
In December 2010, it agreed to provide crude oil to Northern
Tier Energy's 82,000 bpd refinery in St. Paul,
Minnesota. It now supplies more than 90 percent of the plant's
crude, according to SEC filings. That includes about 10,000 bpd
imported from Canada last year, EIA data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OWNERSHIP TRANSFER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storage capacity gives oil companies leeway to wait out the
worst of the price discounts, and enables banks and trading
houses more room to speculate and profit on rising prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising production and pipeline bottlenecks saw volatile
Canadian crude prices plunge as low as $40 per barrel below the
West Texas Intermediate benchmark earlier this year, eating into
producers' profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan built up its hefty storage position after acquiring
Swiss bank UBS's Canadian commodities business in 2009, which
included two million barrels of long-term storage, and RBS
Sempra's global oil and metals business for $1.7 billion in July
2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the bank sells its commodities business, JP Morgan would
be required to notify Enbridge of the change and the contracts
would likely be assigned to the new owners, Enbridge spokesman
Graham White said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Assuming the new owner will have a similar or better credit
rating as JPMorgan there would be no issue from our end with the
transfer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storage rates in Western Canada are a closely guarded
secret, and operators declined to comment on contract terms.
Market sources say rates can vary from 55 Canadian cents to C$1
per barrel per month, depending on the length of the lease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mid-stream companies including NuStar Energy LP have
warned recently that lease storage rates are coming under
pressure in some areas as contracts come up for renewal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential buyers for the assets may come from other big
banks or producers, with traditional big trading houses such as
Trafigura or Glencore potentially less eager due to the
limited flexibility at Hardisty, according to one senior Wall
Street executive. The source did not want to be named because
the executive was not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Cushing, which has dozens of potential routes in and
out of the facility, Hardisty is largely a stopover on a one-way
route from oil sands to U.S. refiners - at least until new rail
terminals and a big eastern pipeline are built - limiting the
arbitrage opportunities that traders typically thrive on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitol Tank Terminal Int (VTTI), a venture of top oil trader
Vitol, is likely to look at some of the U.S. oil terminal assets
now being put up for sale by banks including JP Morgan and
Morgan Stanley, although it faces stiff competition from
a growing cadre of Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) that can
take advantage of tax benefits from infrastructure investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the one hand, we would be extremely interested to look
at that and we have been investigating potential structures to
do so," Rob Nijst, CEO of VTTI, said in an interview, when asked
about the possibility of bidding for bank assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But at the same time, being realistic, it is difficult for
us to compete with existing MLP structures."&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Ciber Implements Microsoft Dynamics AX at Peterson, a Netherlands-based Multinational Company &lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p&gt;Greenwood Village, Colo. - Aug. 23, 2013 - Ciber was chosen to deploy Microsoft Dynamics AX for Peterson, a multinational logistics services company. The project is being completed using the agile implementation method.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In the first phase, Ciber will deploy the financial core and, in the near future, further modules, such as projects, purchasing, CRM and competence management will be implemented. During this process, a number of existing environments also will be phased out. The goal of the new ERP system is to increase operational visibility, attain greater insight into company processes and enhance efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Peterson provides integrated logistic services for diverse oil supply companies and also carries out sector-specific technical inspections. The company is active worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;To facilitate a correct implementation and a smooth transition for end-users, Ciber will leverage substantial experience with Dynamics AX and use a combination of Prince2, Microsoft Sure Step and Agile development methodologies. Ciber also offers considerable experience within the shipping sector, as well as knowledge of the systems used and processes in place. Peterson chose Ciber due to the consulting company's Dynamics AX expertise, the approach suggested for the project and proven experience within the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"We are looking forward to performing this implementation for Peterson," commented Ruud Burgel, Ciber sales manager of Microsoft technologies. "It is a substantial project in which we can deploy our Microsoft expertise to support improved efficiency of the processes and international success of Peterson."&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 13 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-C8, commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2012-C8 (JPMCC 2012-C8). A detailed list of rating

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are due to stable pool performance since issuance. 
      There have been no delinquent or specially serviced loans since 
      issuance. As of the July 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 0.9% to $1.13 billion from $1.14 
      billion at issuance. One loan was on the servicer watchlist as of the 
      July distribution date, but has since been removed. No loans have 
      defeased since issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All classes maintain Stable Outlooks. Due to the recent issuance of the 
      transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not foresee ratings 
      migration until a material economic or asset level event changes the 
      transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics. Additional information on 
      rating sensitivity is available in the report 'JPMCC 2012-C8' (Nov. 28,

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Friday that Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer would retire within the next 12 months, once it has selected a successor, sending its shares up in early trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from analysts to the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRIP CHOWDHRY, ANALYST AT GLOBAL EQUITIES RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be successful in a technology company, first and foremost, you need to earn the respect of software developers and engineers. And Ballmer failed to do that in the past 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ballmer should have left Microsoft at least 8 years back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Never buy the argument 'we have 100,000 people in the company there is a huge depth of management talent.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There more 100,000 in Dell, HP, Apple, and has there been any executive close to the likes of Gates or Jobs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A good CEO would be Vic Gundotra at Google. He left Microsoft for Google. He has the most respect of the engineers and developers both at Microsoft and Google. Vic is probably the only executive, who can bring the much-needed fresh perspective to Microsoft, while still having a deep understanding of Microsoft Culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is a perfect blend of being a Microsoft Insider and bringing a fresh perspective from Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZEUS KERRAVALA, ANALYST AT ZK RESEACRH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A change is definitely needed. Since he took over in 2000, it is fair to say he missed a number of transitions: mobile, tablets, cloud. And Microsoft was very slow with virtualization, it has no place in the software defined data center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft continues to live off traditional PC computing. Ballmer's strength is traditional PC computing. He was a great guy for his era but times have changed and a new leadership is needed. It's hard to say his tenure has been a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd like to see them get a more forward thinking person who grasps hold of the current trends, thinks mobile first and cloud first. It's hard to be a company that deals in corporate and consumer technology. Rarely has that ever worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly the way it's structured is not been working."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COLIN GILLIS, BGC PARTNERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given that's what happening with the company, change is positive. The stock is up but the pop is fading. If you're buying this for the CEO change, you could have a long hard 12 months in front of you. They are going to do a massive reorg. You tend to do these things if things are not getting better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the end of the fiscal year for them. You had two of the worst declines in the PC in the PC marketplace There are significant cracks in the entire ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's changes happening at every level, happening at every level underneath him. It's very reasonable for the board and CEO to sit down and have a discussion about what we are doing here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the numbers sway the board. The PC market peaked in the absolute sense in September 2011. The No. 1 PC maker sold more smartphones than PCs last quarter - Lenovo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SID PARAKH, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN ANALYST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was a surprise, especially considering how close it is to the recently announced strategic overhaul towards devices and services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM CAUGHEY FORREST, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm surprised. My first gut reaction is that it came out of the activist investor effort Value Act. The timing seems very odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the stock rise on the news: "That's a real buzz fill for him. It's not ego boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As much as people would like to blame Steve Ballmer for the fortunes of the company, I think it's the silos. I thought they had great products, but they should have worked better together and leveraged common foundations. Maybe that is his problem that they did it that way. But Ray Ozzie had been brought in to span across the products and that kind of flopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding succession: "Looking across the next level of executives, there's a lot of candidates. I would be super surprised if they picked an outside talent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANDREW BARTELS, FORRESTER RESEARCH ANALYST ON MICROSOFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are two aspects to this, the stock price and how the company has actually done. The stock price has been more or less flat since Ballmer's tenure. The board's going to look at that and say we need someone to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where Ballmer has been correctly faulted for is the performance of Windows. Like Dell, HP and other PC makers they with Microsoft have been caught flatfooted by the shift to tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One can argue that Ballmer as CEO was in part responsible for that failure. Then again it is a broad, systematic one. Though Microsoft has been doing better than others (in dealing with the PC decline), where Ballmer does not get sufficient credit for is the other divisions. Servers, xBox, Bing products in general have shown some success. The problem for Microsoft is its revenue primarily comes from sales to business. It should be viewed more like IBM, but is viewed as consumer like Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"According to our estimates about 2/3 of revenue come from sales to business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding succession: "You obviously want someone who knows the business well and understands both divisions of business and consumer. You also want someone who would be bold enough to split the company, split off windows, run that as one business and keep the other part as a separate business. That's one way a bold CEO could come in and say we are being penalized by being compared to Apple. That's going to be a tough sale especially with Bill Gates as overhead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nicola Leske, Liana Baker and Bill Rigby; editing by Edward Tobin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft climbs after announcing CEO Ballmer's retirement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Indexes: Dow off 0.2 pct, S off 0.12 pct, Nasdaq up 0.14
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed
on Friday, a day after the Nasdaq stock exchange suffered a
historic trading halt of roughly three hours as a result of
technical problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading in thousands of U.S. stocks ground to a halt for
much of Thursday after an unexplained technological problem shut
down trading in Nasdaq securities, the latest prominent
disruption to the operations of U.S. markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Robert Greifeld said on CNBC
television the Nasdaq resolved the technical issues that led to
Thursday's trading halt, but cannot guarantee there would be no
future problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp was the biggest boost to the three
major indexes, up 7.3 percent to $34.74 after the company said
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer will retire within the next 12
months, once it completes the process of choosing his successor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the Nasdaq outage on Thursday, the S 500 managed
to register its biggest percentage gain since Aug. 1, but was
unable to close above its 50-day moving average for a fifth
straight session. The mark, now at 1,659.26, has become a
technical hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark index is on pace for a third straight weekly
decline, as investors exercise caution amid uncertainty over how
soon the Fed will begin to wind down its $85 billion a month
stimulus program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has been a very unique market situation with the Fed
stimulus being such an important component to the market rally.
This is uncharted waters for us," said Gordon Charlop, managing
director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So regardless of what the move is, the fact you are
someplace you haven't been before is cause for uncertainty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next Fed monetary policy meeting is scheduled for Sept.
17-18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic data showed sales of new single-family homes in
America fell by 13.4 percent in July to an annual rate of
394,000 units, well below expectations of 490,000 units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data weighed on homebuilder stocks, with PulteGroup
 down 3.9 percent to $15.69 and Toll Brothers off
3.8 percent to $31.25. The PHLX housing sector index lost
2.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average fell 29.95 points or
0.2 percent, to 14,933.79, the S 500 lost 2.07 points
or 0.12 percent, to 1,654.89 and the Nasdaq Composite 
added 5.238 points or 0.14 percent, to 3,643.945.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandora Media Inc slumped 12.4 percent to $19.01 after
the Internet radio service said late Thursday that rising
expenditures to acquire music and expand its sales force would
push fiscal 2014 earnings below analyst expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aeropostale Inc tumbled 18.5 percent to $8.95 after
the teen apparel retailer forecast a deep third quarter loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said in a statement he would have timed his

&lt;p&gt;* Exxon selling 25 pct to PetroChina, 10 pct to Pertamina -
Iraqi oil minister&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Deal maybe done after two to three weeks - minister&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI Aug 23 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is selling
over half of its 60 percent holding in Iraq's West Qurna-1
oilfield project to China's biggest energy firm PetroChina
 and Indonesia's Pertamina, Iraq's oil
minister confirmed on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"25 percent (stake) to PetroChina and 10 percent to
Pertamina," Abdul Kareem Luaibi told Reuters on the sidelines of
a ministerial meeting here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company and industry sources said on Thursday that China and
Indonesia were set to join Exxon Mobil's $50 billion project to
develop the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil is the operator of the giant
oilfield and last year had offered to sell its entire stake
after a dispute with Baghdad over contracts it signed with
autonomous Kurdistan, deals which the central government rejects
as illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It later committed to further investment at the field - now
pumping just under 500,000 barrels a day - and stepped back from
making a full exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luaibi added that the deal would be done "maybe after two to
three weeks".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PetroChina could not immediately be reached for comment. The
company had confirmed it was in talks for a stake in West
Qurna-1 at its interim results briefing this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia's chief economic minister Hatta Rajasa said in
March that Pertamina was negotiating a 10 to 20 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry sources say for Exxon, a final agreement is
contingent on getting better terms for its technical service
contract at West Qurna-1. Baghdad has offered to sweeten the
deal, the sources say, though there are no details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tough terms and slim margins on Iraq's service fee contracts
are drawbacks to investment in southern Iraq and hopes are that
the terms can be moulded closer to the Kurdish
production-sharing contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jury trial, starting Monday in federal court in Seattle, is set to resolve whether Motorola breached its contract with Microsoft to license on reasonable terms its so-called standard essential patents, covering wireless and video technology used in the Xbox game console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proceeding comes days after Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer unexpectedly announced his retirement. It also follows a complex trial last November that decided what the appropriate fee for Microsoft's use of Motorola-patented technology should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five months of deliberation, U.S. District Judge James Robart came down heavily in Microsoft's favor, saying it owed only a fraction of the royalties Motorola had claimed, suggesting the appropriate rate was about $1.8 million, above Microsoft's estimate of $1 million, but well below Motorola's demand for as much as $4 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola cannot appeal Robart's April ruling until after the jury decides the second phase of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a court filing, Microsoft said it had offered to pay Motorola $6.8 million in past royalties, based on its application of Robart's order. However, Motorola rejected the money, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the forthcoming trial, starting with jury selection on Monday, Microsoft will argue that Motorola's initial demand was exorbitant and a clear breach of its agreement to charge reasonable and non-discriminatory terms - commonly referred to as 'RAND' - for technology that is an industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Google declined comment on the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the result of the first trial, Motorola may have an uphill task in persuading a jury that it did not breach its contract. But Microsoft might not be able to recover huge damages, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the interesting question is, assuming the court finds that Motorola breached its obligation to offer a RAND license, what is the remedy?" said Mark Lemley, a Stanford Law School professor who has been following the litigation. "No court has addressed that issue before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its quest for damages, Microsoft will introduce evidence about how much it had to spend to relocate a facility in Germany as a result of an injunction that Motorola won in Europe, according to court filings. Robart later ordered Motorola not to enforce that injunction, and Microsoft claims it should be reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also seek legal fees resulting from the injunction fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The argument between Microsoft and Motorola - and by extension Google, which now owns it - is just one facet of a wide-ranging global patent war surrounding smartphone and Internet technology that has drawn in Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co, Nokia and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At heart, the companies are arguing over who owns the technology and design features behind smartphones, which are now essentially small computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More particularly, Microsoft has been locked in a battle with Google to ensure that handset makers using Google's free Android phone operating system pay Microsoft a license fee. Most large handset makers, such as Samsung, LG and HTC, have agreed to pay Microsoft a royalty on Android handsets that Microsoft believes may infringe on its patents.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Aug 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp takes on
Google's Motorola Mobility unit this week in the second
of two landmark trials between the companies that delve into hot
disputes over the patents behind smartphone and Internet
technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury trial, starting Monday in federal court in Seattle,
is set to resolve whether Motorola breached its contract with
Microsoft to license on reasonable terms its so-called standard
essential patents, covering wireless and video technology used
in the Xbox game console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proceeding comes days after Microsoft Chief Executive
Steve Ballmer unexpectedly announced his retirement.
 It also follows a complex trial last November
that decided what the appropriate fee for Microsoft's use of
Motorola-patented technology should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five months of deliberation, U.S. District Judge James
Robart came down heavily in Microsoft's favor, saying it owed
only a fraction of the royalties Motorola had claimed,
suggesting the appropriate rate was about $1.8 million, above
Microsoft's estimate of $1 million, but well below Motorola's
demand for as much as $4 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola cannot appeal Robart's April ruling until after the
jury decides the second phase of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a court filing, Microsoft said it had offered to pay
Motorola $6.8 million in past royalties, based on its
application of Robart's order. However, Motorola rejected the
money, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the forthcoming trial, starting with jury selection on
Monday, Microsoft will argue that Motorola's initial demand was
exorbitant and a clear breach of its agreement to charge
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms - commonly referred to
as 'RAND' - for technology that is an industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Google declined comment on the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the result of the first trial, Motorola may have an
uphill task in persuading a jury that it did not breach its
contract. But Microsoft might not be able to recover huge
damages, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the interesting question is, assuming the court

license, what is the remedy?" said Mark Lemley, a Stanford Law

as a result of an injunction that Motorola won in Europe,
according to court filings. Robart later ordered Motorola not to
enforce that injunction, and Microsoft claims it should be
reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also seek legal fees resulting from the
injunction fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The argument between Microsoft and Motorola - and by
extension Google, which now owns it - is just one facet of a
wide-ranging global patent war surrounding smartphone and
Internet technology that has drawn in Apple Inc,
Samsung Electronics Co, Nokia and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At heart, the companies are arguing over who owns the
technology and design features behind smartphones, which are now
essentially small computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More particularly, Microsoft has been locked in a battle

Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state judge found JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) liable to Russian-American billionaire Leonard Blavatnik for breach of contract for stuffing an investment account he held with risky subprime mortgage securities, and ordered the bank to pay more than $50 million of damages including interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a decision made public on Monday, New York State Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer ordered the largest U.S. bank to pay $42.5 million on the breach of contract claim, plus 5 percent annual interest starting in May 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan judge also found JPMorgan was not liable for negligence. His decision was dated August 21, and came about seven months after a three-week, non-jury trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik had sued JPMorgan in 2009 to recover more than $100 million that he said the New York-based bank lost on a roughly $1 billion investment by CMMF LLC, a fund created by his firm, Access Industries Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision comes as JPMorgan faces a swirl of other litigation and investigations, including into its handling of mortgage-related businesses during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Blavatnik, JPMorgan Investment Management (JPMIM) promised that it would invest Access' money conservatively after opening the account in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the bank allegedly breached a 20 percent limit set for mortgage-backed securities by misclassifying securities backed by a pool of subprime loans, known as ABS-home equity loans, as asset-backed rather than mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access also accused JPMorgan of continuing to hold the troubled securities despite knowing they were inappropriate for the portfolio. CMMF closed the account in May 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In finding JPMorgan liable for exceeding the 20 percent cap, Schweitzer rejected the bank's argument that "industry practice" was to classify the home equity loans separately from mortgage securities because they carried different risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not only was the ostensible 'industry practice' to which JPMIM repeatedly refers unknown to CMMF, JPMIM itself frequently defined securities backed by subprime mortgages as 'mortgage securities' and not as asset-backed securities - and did so in some of its most important documents used with regulators, ... clients, ... shareholders ... and internally," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"RIGHT THING TO DO"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ruling for JPMorgan on the negligence claim, Schweitzer said the mortgage securities were considered "relatively safe and desirable" when they were bought, and that JPMorgan acted reasonably in light of current conditions when it advised CMMF to "wait out the storm" rather than sell at depressed prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Doug Morris said: "We are pleased that the court rejected CMMF's negligence claims, and found that our investment professionals lived up to their responsibilities. We respectfully disagree with the court's interpretation of our agreement with CMMF, and we are considering our options regarding that finding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Elsberg, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan representing Blavatnik, said in an interview: "Hopefully it signals that banks need to live up to their obligations to clients, and as the court makes clear, not hide behind what they often try to refer to as 'industry practice.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik also welcomed the decision. "There are a lot of people out there who, I understand, feel they have been wronged by JPMorgan but cannot afford to take on a huge bank. They shouldn't have to," he said in a statement. "JPMorgan should do the right thing because it is the right thing to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik is worth about $16 billion, making him the world's 44th richest person, Forbes magazine said in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is CMMF LLC v.

was to classify the home equity loans separately from mortgage
securities because they carried different risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not only was the ostensible 'industry practice' to which

        collaborated to enable Arista EOS switches to seamlessly integrate 
        with VMware NSX&#8482;, the platform for network virtualization, to provide 
        hardware-based gateway services for non-virtualized servers and 
        existing VLANs. Arista is also integrating with OpenStack and other 
        orchestration platforms to provide automated provisioning, stateful 
        workload portability and total workload visibility.

      &#8220;Businesses are increasingly deploying network virtualization to 
      simplify IT and improve the speed of business,&#8221; said Milin Desai, 
      director, product management, VMware. &#8220;VMware and Arista are partnering 
      to integrate Arista EOS-based and VMware NSX&#8482; to enable the same 
      operational model to be used for both virtual and physical workloads, 
      resulting in increased efficiency and agility for the data center 
      operator.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With Microsoft&#8217;s standards-based approach to datacenter management, 
      customers benefit from a plug-and-play experience when they use Arista&#8217;s 
      OMI-enables switches,&#8221; said Vijay Tewari, Principal Group Program 
      Manager, Windows Server and System Center, at Microsoft. &#8220;These switches 
      have met the requirements to carry the Windows Logo, so they just work 
      with Windows Server and System Center 2012 R2 without the need for 
      additional software.&#8221;

			Software Defined Cloud Networking
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Arista Software 
      Defined Cloud Networking (SDCN) combines the principles that have 
      made cloud computing the unstoppable force that it is: automation, self 
      service provisioning, and linear scaling of both performance and 
      economics, coupled with the recent trend in SDN that delivers network 
      virtualization, custom programmability, simplified architectures, and 
      more realistic price points. This combination creates a best-in-class 
      software foundation for maximizing the value of the network to both the 
      enterprise and service provider data center: a new architecture for the 
      most mission-critical location within the IT infrastructure that 
      simplifies management and provisioning, speeds up service delivery, 
      lowers costs and creates opportunities for competitive differentiation, 
      while putting control and visibility back in the hands of the network 
      and systems administrators.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Arista&#8217;s EOS continues to outpace the industry with Software Defined 
      Networking (SDN) innovations, exposing innovative network applications 
      and&#160;delivering a set of advanced SDN capabilities that support 
      programmatic control, enhanced monitoring, and self-healing resilience,&#8221; 
      stated Anshul Sadana, Senior Vice President, Customer Engineering at 
      Arista Networks. &#8220;The architecture of Arista EOS, coupled with 
      best-in-class hardware and partnerships with the other best-of-breed 
      companies in each category creates network capabilities unachievable by 
      monolithic providers. The integration and demonstration of VMware NSX 
      with EOS at VMworld is a clear example of this best in class 
      partnership.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Arista EOS - Designed for SDCN
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Arista&#8217;s EOS is the foundation needed for using open controller APIs to 
      communicate between the network and the SDN controller to implement 
      cloud-scale Layer 2/3 networking. The virtual and physical network must 
      co-exist and are not mutually exclusive. Arista platforms have the 
      ability to apply a variety of forwarding actions, enabling flow-granular 
      control over network traffic at full line rate on all ports 
      simultaneously. Arista&#8217;s new platforms have support for tunnel 
      encapsulation, with advanced schemes that scale beyond the MAC table 
      limitations of individual devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Arista&#8217;s EOS software can host the client portion of any 
      controller-based system, communicating with the central controller and 
      programming the switch&#8217;s forwarding plane accordingly through the EOS 
      System Database. With support for flow monitoring, auto-initialization 
      of zero-touch deployment of large numbers of switches (ZTP/ZTR), early 
      notification of application caused network congestion (LANZ) and 
      advanced event triggers (AEM), Arista switches running EOS are an ideal 
      choice for SDN controlled cloud networks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Universal Cloud Network
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A single leaf-spine architecture with a single consistent software image 
      has been universally accepted as the way to build cost effective 
      scalable multi-purpose networks. Using Layer-3 load-balancing to provide 
      scalable performance. With the Arista 7500E as the spine and Arista 
      7150/7050 as the leaf, these network topologies can support cloud data 
      centers with more than 100,000 servers that deliver consistent 
      performance for dynamically scaling workloads in public or private 
      clouds, including Hadoop, Big Data, storage, Web 2.0, VM farms, and 
      network virtualization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby and Dan Levine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Aug 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp takes on
Google's Motorola Mobility unit this week in the second
of two landmark trials between the companies that delve into hot
disputes over the patents behind smartphone and Internet
technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury trial, starting Monday in federal court in Seattle,
is set to resolve whether Motorola breached its contract with
Microsoft to license on reasonable terms its so-called standard
essential patents, covering wireless and video technology used
in the Xbox game console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proceeding comes days after Microsoft Chief Executive
Steve Ballmer unexpectedly announced his retirement.
 It also follows a complex trial last November
that decided what the appropriate fee for Microsoft's use of
Motorola-patented technology should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five months of deliberation, U.S. District Judge James
Robart came down heavily in Microsoft's favor, saying it owed
only a fraction of the royalties Motorola had claimed,
suggesting the appropriate rate was about $1.8 million, above
Microsoft's estimate of $1 million, but well below Motorola's
demand for as much as $4 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorola cannot appeal Robart's April ruling until after the
jury decides the second phase of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a court filing, Microsoft said it had offered to pay
Motorola $6.8 million in past royalties, based on its
application of Robart's order. However, Motorola rejected the
money, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the forthcoming trial, starting with jury selection on
Monday, Microsoft will argue that Motorola's initial demand was
exorbitant and a clear breach of its agreement to charge
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms - commonly referred to
as 'RAND' - for technology that is an industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Google declined comment on the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the result of the first trial, Motorola may have an
uphill task in persuading a jury that it did not breach its
contract. But Microsoft might not be able to recover huge
damages, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the interesting question is, assuming the court
finds that Motorola breached its obligation to offer a RAND
license, what is the remedy?" said Mark Lemley, a Stanford Law
School professor who has been following the litigation. "No
court has addressed that issue before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its quest for damages, Microsoft will introduce evidence
about how much it had to spend to relocate a facility in Germany
as a result of an injunction that Motorola won in Europe,
according to court filings. Robart later ordered Motorola not to
enforce that injunction, and Microsoft claims it should be
reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also seek legal fees resulting from the
injunction fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The argument between Microsoft and Motorola - and by
extension Google, which now owns it - is just one facet of a
wide-ranging global patent war surrounding smartphone and
Internet technology that has drawn in Apple Inc,
Samsung Electronics Co, Nokia and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At heart, the companies are arguing over who owns the
technology and design features behind smartphones, which are now
essentially small computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More particularly, Microsoft has been locked in a battle
with Google to ensure that handset makers using Google's free
Android phone operating system pay Microsoft a license fee. Most
large handset makers, such as Samsung, LG and HTC
, have agreed to pay Microsoft a royalty on Android
handsets that Microsoft believes may infringe on its patents.
Motorola, which was bought by Google last year for $12.5
billion, is the last big holdout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robart gave each side 16 hours of trial time to present
their case to a jury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in U.S. District Court, Western District of
Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - The next CEO of Microsoft Corp has one big decision to make: press on with retiring chief executive Steve Ballmer's ambitious plan to transform the software giant into a broad-based devices and services company, or jettison that idea and rally resources around its proven strength in business software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer's grand design - unveiled just six weeks before Friday's surprise announcement that he would retire within a year - calls for 'One Microsoft' to pull together and forge a future based on hardware and cloud-based services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But poor sales of the new Surface tablet, on top of Microsoft's years-long failure to make money out of online search or smartphones, have cast doubt on that approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, investors have called on Microsoft to redirect cash spent on money-losing or peripheral projects to shareholders, while limiting its focus to the vastly profitable Windows, Office and server franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist investor ValueAct Capital Management LP, whose recent lobbying of the company may have played a role in Ballmer's decision to retire earlier than he planned, is thought to favor such an approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last two years alone, Microsoft has lost almost $3 billion on its Bing search engine and other Internet projects, not counting a $6 billion write-off for its failed purchase of online advertising agency aQuantive. It took a $900 million charge for its poor-selling Surface tablet last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now at least, Microsoft seems intent on pursuing Ballmer's vision. John Thompson, Microsoft's lead independent director who is also heading the committee to appoint a new CEO, said on Friday the board is "committed" to Ballmer's transformation plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eventual choice of that committee - which has given itself a year to do its work - should provide a clue to how committed the board really is, and how open to outside advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Taking an internal candidate like Satya Nadella - the guy nurturing servers - or some of the other people on the Windows team, that makes sense to keep a steady hand through this reorganization and strategic shift," said Norman Young, an analyst at Morningstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But a strong case could be made that the company needs a breath of fresh air, someone who can execute on the strategy but also bring an outsider perspective," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could mean selling the Xbox and abandoning Bing, or cutting short efforts to make tablets or other computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHAREHOLDERS CLAMOUR FOR MONEY, BALLMER'S HEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the last decade, as Microsoft's share price has remained flat, shareholders have called for bigger dividends and share buybacks to beef up their returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft obliged with a one-time $3 a share special dividend in 2004 and has trebled its quarterly dividend to 23 cents since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shareholders still want a bigger slice of Microsoft's $77 billion cash hoard, $70 billion of which is held overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura, believes that if the retirement of Ballmer means the company is listening to ValueAct and its supporters, then action on the dividend and share buyback could perhaps happen as early as September 19, when Microsoft hosts its annual get-together with analysts and is expected announce its latest dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The momentum of shareholder activism is well underway and likely to benefit shareholders even though the process of how this unfolds is not certain," said Sherlund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lackluster performance of Microsoft's stock has long been the stick that shareholders beat Ballmer with, and it has looked all the worse compared with the staggering gains made by Apple Inc under Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Ballmer - who owns just under 4 percent of the company - never showed any doubts about his intention to stay in the job. His old friend and ally Bill Gates, who still owns 4.8 percent of the company, never wavered in his public support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first public signs of dissent on Microsoft's board came in 2010, when Ballmer's bonus was trimmed explicitly for the flop of the infamous Kin 'social' phone and a failure to match Apple's iPad, according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was around that time, though not necessarily connected, that the board started considering how it would manage a succession, according to a source familiar with the matter. Ballmer and the board began talking to both internal and external candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 18 months to two years ago, Ballmer started thinking seriously about a succession plan, the internal source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time since was not marked with glory for Ballmer, with a tepid launch of Windows 8, the disappointment of the Surface tablet, and a $731 million fine by European regulators for forgetting to offer a choice of browsers to Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two to three months ago, Ballmer started thinking seriously about his retirement and concluded it was the "right time to start the process," the source said. That was shortly after ValueAct took a $2 billion stake in Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July's gloomy earnings, which offered no immediate hope of quick improvement, may have sealed the decision. Ballmer said Friday he made the choice in the few days prior, and informed the board on Wednesday. Whether the board urged Ballmer to leave is not known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impending exit of Ballmer leaves a difficult and perhaps impossible choice to his successor - pushing a large and insular behemoth through a highly risky transformation to the mobile world, or clinging to an island of profitable but PC-centric businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure there is someone who can do Steve's (Ballmer's) job 'better'. It's an incredibly difficult job, perhaps intractable," said Brad Silverberg, a former senior Windows executive and co-founder of Seattle venture capital firm Ignition Partners. "Perhaps the way the job is defined needs to change, and this is the harbinger of bigger changes to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Liana Baker in NEW YORK; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Miral Fahmy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Spain's Martin-Artajo released after arrest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Will remain under court supervision until faces charges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Signals not willing to be extradited -source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sarah White and Carlos Ruano&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aug 27 (Reuters) - Spanish police arrested former JP Morgan
Chase trader Javier Martin-Artajo on Tuesday as he prepares to
fight possible extradition to the United States over a $6.2
billion financial scandal at America's largest bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrest came after the United States charged Spaniard
Martin-Artajo and a junior colleague, Frenchman Julien Grout,
with wire fraud and conspiracy to falsify books and records
related to the trading losses, which were executed by Bruno
Iksil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil, who was nicknamed the "London Whale" for his large
bets on derivatives markets, is cooperating with U.S.
prosecutors and has not been charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo was released on condition that he stay in
Spain and check in regularly with a court. A judicial source
said on Tuesday that Martin-Artajo had told a Spanish court he
is unwilling to be sent to the United States to face the
charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, who turned himself in at a Madrid police
station after being contacted by police, is accused of trying to
inflate the value of trading positions held on his group's
books. The mismarking allegedly took place as the traders tried
to hide mounting losses in an illiquid derivatives market, where
they had made outsized bets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo was Iksil's supervisor at JP Morgan's Chief
Investment Office in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is battling to salvage its corporate image amid a
swirl of litigation and investigations in the wake of the
financial crisis, including a federal bribery investigation into
whether it hired the children of key Chinese officials to help
it win business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's boss Jamie Dimon attempted to dismiss the London
Whale losses as a "tempest in a teapot", but this remark has
come back to haunt him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's penalties over this "London Whale" probe are
expected to be $500 million to $600 million, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo previously said through lawyers that he
expects to be cleared of any wrongdoing and that he had
cooperated with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyer in London could not immediately be reached for
further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXTRADITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain's High Court has taken on his case, meanwhile, and
will decide whether he should be extradited, although Spain's
cabinet has its say too. The United States has 40 days after his
arrest to present its full extradition request to Spanish
courts, according to the usual procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraditions from Spain to the United States are rare and
Madrid has tended to shun requests to send its citizens to be
tried there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Spain does not extradite its citizens," a police source
said, explaining that it was one of the reasons Martin-Artajo
was not directly arrested but asked to present himself to
police, after he was found, identified and deemed not to be a
flight risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one extradition lawyer who declined to be named said
Martin-Artajo's alleged offence would in principle be considered
extraditable, as it is punishable in both countries. Either way,
administrative and judicial procedures can take many months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo handed himself in to police after they found
him and got in touch with him, the authorities said, without
detailing where they had tracked him down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan colleague Julien Grout, now living in his
native France, has not been arrested, his lawyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, they have not arrested Julien, nor would they because
France does not extradite their own citizens," said Grout's U.S.
lawyer Edward Little at Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed. "We are in
discussions with the U.S. prosecutors about how we will proceed,
but no decision has been made yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grout, who reported to Iksil and is the lowest-ranked person
so far targeted in the investigation, is in his mid-thirties and
is married to an American. His lawyer previously said he had
moved to France several months ago and was not fleeing anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source with knowledge of the matter has said Grout would
offer to face the charges in the United States on condition he
is granted bail. Earlier this month, Grout declined to answer
questions from a Reuters reporter at his parent's holiday home
in southern France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has a stable of senior executives who could be contenders to succeed Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, even though outsiders have sparked the most discussion so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Ballmer's surprise announcement on Friday that he would retire within a year, the board's lead independent director John Thompson, who heads the search for the new CEO, said the planned transformation of the software giant into a fast-moving 'devices and services' company is still on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does seem like if they are going to continue down the path of this devices and services strategy that they probably get somebody who was part of formulating this strategy or who can stand fully behind it. I don't know if most outside candidates would be willing to do that," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expects Microsoft to favor an internal candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But insiders would face skepticism from those who want a clean break from Ballmer's personal legacy, as well as other obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The issue with internal candidates is that Microsoft has cultivated a holding-company style culture so very few execs are broadly exposed to all areas of the business," said Al Hilwa, an analyst at tech research firm IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of potential internal candidates, with pros and cons, based on conversations with analysts and insiders. All except Raikes and Thompson are executive vice presidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella, cloud and enterprise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRO: A 21-year Microsoft veteran, he knows the inner workings of the company, especially the hot areas of servers, data centers and online services. Recently promoted to run the newly created 'cloud and enterprise' unit, he controls the infrastructure behind the 'services' side of Microsoft's new vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CON: Although he was once a vice president in the Office unit, he might struggle to impose authority over the all-powerful Windows and Office factions, the wellsprings of the company's profits which are famously antagonistic to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bates, corporate strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRO: Came to Microsoft two years ago as CEO of the acquired online chat company Skype, which represents the new wave of internet-centric, consumer-focused technology that Microsoft has had difficulty replicating. He so impressed his new boss that Ballmer put him in charge of corporate strategy and relations with developers and PC makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CON: May not have been at Microsoft long enough to know how to wrench it into a new shape, and his narrow specialty in the telecommunications and router field may not be broad enough to run such a large software-based company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terry Myerson, operating systems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRO: A young entrepreneur whose web software company was bought by Microsoft in the late 1990s, he might bring a start-up mentality to the top job. Recently selected by Ballmer to run the full range of operating systems - which are still the heart of Microsoft - ranging across Windows PCs, tablets, phones and the Xbox game console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CON: His last assignment was running the Windows Phone unit, which won praise for its clean, stylish software but has not come close to making Microsoft a big player in the smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi Lu, search and Internet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRO: The former Yahoo Inc executive is a heavyweight in the online search and advertising area, with 20 U.S. patents. He now runs the 'applications and services' group, which is in charge of putting Microsoft's established software businesses, like its Office suite, onto the Web. It is a crucial part of Ballmer's reorganization plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CON: Under his stewardship, the Bing search engine has cost Microsoft billions of dollars without threatening Google Inc's dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Larson-Green, Xbox gaming console and Surface tablet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRO: a 20-year veteran of Microsoft and acolyte of recently departed Windows chief Steven Sinofsky, she has intimate knowledge of both the Office and Windows units, having led the redesign of both products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CON: Is now in charge of the 'devices and studios' unit, leading Microsoft's foray into making its own computers and other hardware. The Surface tablet has had poor sales, despite initial enthusiasm. She may be marked down for her close involvement with the tepidly received Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Rudder, research and technology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRO: A fixture in the background at Microsoft for two decades, this deeply tech-savvy exec now runs Microsoft's long-term research unit and sets overall technical strategy. He is the nearest the company has to a big thinker in the mold of Bill Gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CON: Never having been a business unit leader, he may not have the experience to deal with the sharp-elbowed internal politics of Microsoft to survive as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Turner, COO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRO: Microsoft's Chief Operating Officer for the last eight years, the former Wal-Mart Stores Inc exec is the power behind the company's fearsome sales operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CON: A professional salesman and motivator, he does not come from an engineering background, which could be a liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Raikes, philanthropy, ex-Office chief&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRO: Bill Gates, who is on the committee to choose the next Microsoft CEO, picked this former leader of the Office unit to be the chief executive of his philanthropic foundation. As Microsoft approaches a critical transition, his long experience, understanding of Gates' thinking and steady hand might be an effective combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CON: Immersed in the world of philanthropy for the past five years, he may be out of touch with the latest technology trends. The same generation as Ballmer, his appointment might be seen as a continuation of the old guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Thompson, search committee leader&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRO: It is not beyond the realms of possibility that the man leading the committee to find a new CEO may end up being considered by it. The former IBM executive went on to be CEO of computer security firm Symantec Corp, giving him experience both of a large company reinventing itself and an understanding of the enterprise software market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CON: He only joined Microsoft's board last year and has no direct experience of managing the company. His current day job is CEO of the little-known, privately held cloud-computing firm Virtual Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Peter Henderson and Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. government housing finance authorities are pressing JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co for at least $6 billion to settle lawsuits over bonds backed by subprime mortgages, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is arguing that it should pay less to settle the claims by the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, according to the source, who was not authorized to speak for attribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA litigation is among a raft of legal issues JPMorgan is trying to work through in addition to investigations over its $6.2 billion "London Whale" derivatives loss of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An FHFA spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, sued JPMorgan over some $33 billion of securities two years ago and also sued at least 16 other financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits alleged that the banks misrepresented how well they had checked the underlying mortgages and charged that they did not meet investors' criteria. As borrowers fell behind in payments, the value of the securities fell, causing losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The securities at issue in the talks with JPMorgan include bonds that were sold by Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns, two troubled institutions that JPMorgan took over with government encouragement during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks have already settled mortgage litigation with government officials who are trying to make the banks bear more of the cost of the housing crisis. Switzerland-based UBS settled with the FHFA for $885 million in July. [ID:nL1N0FV2AR] Citigroup Inc and General Electric Co have also reached settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, entities sponsored by the U.S. government, were seized by the government in 2008 and received $187.5 billion to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported the amount being sought from JPMorgan over the mortgage securities on its website earlier on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has spent about $5 billion for legal costs in each of the past two years. The company raised its estimate of possible losses in excess of its reserves to $6.8 billion at the end of June from $6 billion three months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York and Margaret Chadbourn in Washington; editing by Gary Hill and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms Goldman Sachs Mortgage Securities Corp. II, Series 2010-C2
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of Goldman Sachs Mortgage 
      Securities Corp. II commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, 
      series 2010-C2. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's affirmations are based on generally stable performance of the 
      underlying collateral pool since issuance. There are currently no 
      delinquent or specially serviced loans. Fitch reviewed servicer-provided 
      year-end (YE) 2012 financial performance for the collateral pool in 
      addition to updated rent rolls for the top 15 loans, which represent 
      65.3% of the transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlooks for all of the classes are Stable. No rating actions 
      are expected in the near future as the majority of the pool has 
      maintained performance consistent with that at issuance. As of the 
      August 2013 distribution date, the pool's certificate balance has paid 
      down 2.6% to $853.5 million from $876.5 million at issuance. There are 
      currently 43 loans collateralized by 108 properties. One loan (2.2%) has 
      defeased.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has identified two loans (2.5%) as Fitch Loans of Concern. Both 
      loans remain current on debt service payments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first Fitch Loan of Concern (1.6% of the pool balance) is secured by 
      a 136,423 square foot (SF) retail property in Warrington Township, PA. 
      The occupancy dropped significantly after a former major tenant, Bed, 
      Bath and Beyond, which occupied 18% of the net rentable area, vacated 
      when its lease expired at the end of January 2012. The borrower is still 
      working to find a permanent replacement tenant. As of March 2013, the 
      property was 81.7% occupied, compared to 100% at issuance. The servicer 
      report YE 2012 net cash flow (NCF) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      was 1.82x, compared to 1.95x at issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second Fitch Loan of Concern (0.9%) is secured by a 112,862 SF 
      retail property in Columbus, OH. Occupancy decreased significantly after 
      Borders Books, the former largest tenant that occupied 26% of the 
      property, rejected their lease in association with their bankruptcy 
      filing. As of March 2013, the property was 70% occupied, compared to 89% 
      at issuance. The servicer reported YE 2012 NCF DSCR was 1.50x, compared 
      to 2.02x at issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest loan in the pool (10.3%) is secured by a 399,935 SF class B 
      office property in the Financial District of Manhattan, NY. The property 
      is 100% occupied by the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) under a long 
      term lease which expires in August 2034. UFT also holds a 9.9% ownership 
      interest in the building. The loan is structured with a letter of credit 
      (LOC) which can be drawn upon to cover debt service shortfalls. The loan 
      is structured with a four year interest only term followed by a 30-year 
      amortization schedule. The servicer reported YE 2012 NCF DSCR was 2.24x, 
      compared to 1.71x at issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest loan in the pool (7.4%) is secured by two class B 
      office properties totaling 1.15 million SF in Cleveland, OH. As of 1Q13, 
      the combined occupancy of the two properties was 76.7%, compared to 76% 
      at YE2012 and 78.8% at issuance. The servicer reported YE 2012 NCF DSCR 
      was 1.41x, compared to 1.49x at issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest loan in the pool (7.0%) is secured by a 669,682 SF 
      mixed-use office retail property in Pittsburgh, PA. The property is 
      considered an area landmark and tourist destination. It consists of five 
      buildings that house office space, retail shops, restaurants, commuter 
      parking, and night clubs, in addition to river docks, marina slips, and 
      an outdoor amphitheater. As of YE 2012, the property was 85.3% occupied, 
      compared to 84.6% at issuance. The servicer reported YE 2012 NCF DSCR 
      was 1.41x, compared to 1.49x at issuance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms and maintains the Stable Outlook for the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$324.1 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$376.1 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Interest-Only class X-A at 'AAAsf';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$26.3 million class B at 'AAsf';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$29.6 million class C at 'Asf';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$47.1 million class D at 'BBB-sf';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$12 million class E at 'BBsf';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$9.9 million class F at 'Bsf'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not rate the IO class X-B and the $28.5 million class G.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Aug 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has a
stable of senior executives who could be contenders to succeed
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, even though outsiders have
sparked the most discussion so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Ballmer's surprise announcement on Friday that he
would retire within a year, the board's lead independent
director John Thompson, who heads the search for the new CEO,
said the planned transformation of the software giant into a
fast-moving 'devices and services' company is still on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does seem like if they are going to continue down the
path of this devices and services strategy that they probably
get somebody who was part of formulating this strategy or who
can stand fully behind it," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund
firm McAdams Wright Ragen, who expects Microsoft to favor an
internal candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But insiders would face skepticism from those who want a
clean break from Ballmer's personal legacy, as well as other
obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The issue with internal candidates is that Microsoft has
cultivated a holding-company style culture so very few execs are
broadly exposed to all areas of the business," said Al Hilwa, an
analyst at tech research firm IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of potential internal candidates,

insiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella, cloud and enterprise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRO: A 21-year Microsoft veteran, he knows the inner

vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CON: Although he was once a vice president in the Office

all-powerful Windows and Office factions, the wellsprings of the
company's profits which are famously antagonistic to one
another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Bates, corporate strategy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRO: Came to Microsoft two years ago as CEO of the acquired

&lt;p&gt;Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. government housing finance
authorities are pressing JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co for at
least $6 billion to settle lawsuits over bonds backed by
subprime mortgages, according to a person familiar with the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is arguing that it should pay less to settle the
claims by the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, according to
the source, who was not authorized to speak for attribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA sued JPMorgan over some $33 billion of securities
two years ago and also sued 16 other financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported the amount being sought over
the mortgage securities on its website earlier on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA litigation is among a raft of legal issues JPMorgan
is trying to work through in addition to investigations over its
"London Whale" derivatives loss last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Citigroup (C.N) and J.P.Morgan Securities (JPM.N) placed winning bids on Tuesday for a $764 million mix of tax-exempt new money and refunding general obligation debt issued by California in a competitive sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup won the bid on $249.2 million of California's new-money general purpose GO bonds, according to market sources. They said $50 million of the GO debt maturing in 2022 - rated 'A' by Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Ratings and 'A1' by Moody's Investors Service - carries a yield of 3.18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top-rated 'AAA' municipal bonds maturing in 2022 offered a yield of 2.78 percent on Monday, according to Thomson Reuters' Municipal Market Data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 40 basis point spread underscores the strong demand for California GO bonds, which are popular with muni bond investors, and expectations the state may be upgraded as it gets its fiscal affairs in order. In the secondary market, the nine-year credit yield spread between California GO bonds and triple-A bonds has been at 44 basis points since August 8, according to MMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a decade of deficits, California has a surplus thanks voter-approved tax increases last year, a strengthening economy and agreement between Governor Jerry Brown and the state legislature to keep most spending restrained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It (the sale) proved itself," said Kelly Wine, executive vice president of municipal bond broker-dealer RH Investment Corp in Los Angeles. "It proved the state right in going competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's quite a bit of interest in Cal GOs and they'll continue to trade well in the secondary," Wine added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yields on the remaining $199.2 million of the bonds bought by Citigroup ranged from 1.19 percent on their 2017 maturity to 3.41 percent on their 2023 maturity, compared with yields of 1.09 percent and 2.96 percent on AAA-rated muni bonds of similar respective maturities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credit spread on the 10-year maturity stood at 53 basis points on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P.Morgan picked up $155 million of California's various purpose GO bonds and $359.9 million of its GO refunding bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yields on the new-money bonds ranged from 3.64 percent on the 2024 maturity to 4.42 percent on the 2029 maturity, compared with 3.14 percent and 3.89 percent for AAA-rated muni bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yields on the refunding bonds ranged from 3.64 percent on their 2024 maturity to 4.80 percent on their 2033 maturity. Top-rated muni bonds maturing in 2033 offered a 4.21 percent as of Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Christie; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish police arrested former JP Morgan Chase trader Javier Martin-Artajo on Tuesday as he prepares to fight possible extradition to the United States over a $6.2 billion financial scandal at the United States' largest bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrest came after the United States charged Spaniard Martin-Artajo and a junior colleague, Frenchman Julien Grout, with wire fraud and conspiracy to falsify books and records related to the trading losses, which were executed by Bruno Iksil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil, who was nicknamed the "London Whale" for his large bets on derivatives markets, is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors and has not been charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo was released on condition he stays in Spain and checks in regularly with a court. A judicial source said on Tuesday he had told a Spanish court he is unwilling to be sent to the United States to face the charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, who handed himself in at a Madrid police station after being contacted by police, is accused of trying to inflate the value of trading positions held on his group's books. The mismarking allegedly took place as the traders tried to hide mounting losses in an illiquid derivatives market, where they had made outsized bets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo was Iksil's supervisor at JP Morgan's Chief Investment Office in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is battling to salvage its corporate image amid a swirl of litigation and investigations in the wake of the financial crisis, including a federal bribery investigation into whether it hired the children of key Chinese officials to help it win business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's boss Jamie Dimon attempted to dismiss the London Whale losses as a "tempest in a teapot" but this remark has come back to haunt him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo previously said through lawyers that he expects to be cleared of any wrongdoing and that he had cooperated with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyer in London could not immediately be reached for further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXTRADITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Spain's High Court has taken on his case and will decide whether he should be extradited, although Spain's cabinet has its say too. The United States has 40 days after his arrest to present its full extradition request to Spanish courts, according to the usual procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraditions from Spain to the United States are rare and Madrid has tended to shun requests to send its citizens to be tried there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Spain does not extradite its citizens," a police source said, explaining that it was one of the reasons Martin-Artajo was not directly arrested but asked to present himself to police, after he was found, identified and deemed not to be a flight risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one extradition lawyer who declined to be named said Martin-Artajo's alleged offence would in principle be considered extraditable, as it is punishable in both countries. Either way, administrative and judicial procedures can take many months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo handed himself in to police after they found him and got in touch with him, the authorities said, without detailing where they had tracked him down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan colleague Julien Grout, now living in his native France, has not yet been arrested, his lawyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, they have not arrested Julien, nor would they because France does not extradite their own citizens," said Grout's U.S. lawyer Edward Little at Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed. "We are in discussions with the U.S. prosecutors about how we will proceed, but no decision has been made yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grout, who reported to Iksil and is the lowest-ranked person so far targeted in the investigation, is in his mid-thirties and is married to an American. His lawyer previously said he had moved to France several months ago and was not fleeing anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source with knowledge of the matter has said Grout would offer to face the charges in the United States on condition he is granted bail. Grout himself declined to answer questions from a Reuters reporter at his parent's holiday home in southern France earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Clare Hutchison in London, Catherine Bremer in Paris and Blanca Rodriguez in Madrid; Editing by Louise Heavens and David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Aug 27 (Reuters) - As Steve Ballmer bows out of
Microsoft Corp, the guessing game over who will replace
him has started with a British bookmaker putting Nokia's Stephen
Elop as the favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, 57, unexpectedly announced his retirement last
Friday after more than three decades at the world's largest
software company, including 13 years as chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no heir apparent, Ladbrokes opened up betting
on successors for Ballmer who will depart within the next year,
with Elop, 49, topping a list of 26 candidates with odds of 5/1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British and Irish bookmakers offer a wide range of bets as a
niche sideline to more lucrative wagers on sports. Online
gambling is far more restrictive in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elop, a Canadian, led Microsoft's business division before
becoming chief executive of the Finnish firm Nokia in 2010 with
a brief to revive the once-undisputed leader in mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Nokia employees say he has forced them to make faster
decisions. But Nokia's ability to compete in the global
smartphone market is increasingly questioned; its market share
stands at around three percent, far behind Samsung 
and Apple which control around 50 percent between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal Microsoft candidate Kevin Turner, chief operating
officer, is second favourite with odds of 6/1 to replace
Ballmer, according to Ladbrokes. In third is former Microsoft
executive Steve Sinofsky, who left the company last November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top female candidate in the stakes is internal head of
devices and studios, Julie Larson-Green, in fourth place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is ranked as a 50/1 shot to
return to fill the void but he is considered more likely than
rank 100/1 outsider Tim Cook, CEO at Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ladbrokes' spokesman Alex Donohue said the market was a
"who's who of high fliers" in the technology world. "With a year
to go we anticipate that this market will smash all previous
records for technology betting," Donohue said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

        Improves long-term reliability of sand control and reduces workovers
      
			
        Developed and licensed by ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company has awarded Weatherford 
      International Ltd. a limited international license for the company&#8217;s 
      Alternate Path&#174; technology patent portfolio for gravel 
      packing cased and openhole completion wells.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Alternate Path is a patented technology developed by ExxonMobil to 
      improve the reliability of wells completed in sand-prone reservoirs. 
      Alternate Path provides alternate flow paths called shunt tubes in the 
      downhole tool used for packing gravel in the producing sections of a 
      well. The shunt tubes enable the Alternate Path packing operation to 
      continue when sand prematurely blocks the well annulus, which would stop 
      a conventional packing operation. The shunt tubes divert the gravel 
      slurry around sand blockages and through distributed portholes to fill 
      voids in the annulus until a complete pack is in place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Alternate Path technology is one of several sand control completion 
      technologies developed by ExxonMobil to increase reliability and 
      production uptime and improve economics of high-cost production wells,&#8221; 
      said Sara N. Ortwein, president of ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company. 
      &#8220;ExxonMobil is pleased to work with Weatherford to deploy this key 
      technology in our operations.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Alternate Path license allows Weatherford to produce and deploy 
      Alternate Path technology for ExxonMobil affiliates around the world and 
      for ventures in which ExxonMobil participates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Alternate Path technology is a reliable technique to ensure a complete 
      gravel pack is in place for sand control,&#8221; said Mark Hopmann, vice 
      president, well completion technologies for Weatherford. &#8220;Alternate Path 
      is field proven for long-interval and horizontal wells.&#8221;

Monday)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MADRID Aug 27 (Reuters) - Former JPMorgan employee
Javier Martin-Artajo, who was arrested by Spanish police earlier
on Tuesday in connection to a trading scandal at the bank, has
been released from custody, according to a Spanish court source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, who will not be allowed to leave Spain under
the terms of his release and who will have to appear in court
every 15 days, has told a Spanish court he is not willing to be
extradited to the United States, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors brought criminal charges against him last
month in relation to a trading scandal that cost JPMorgan $6.2
billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain's High Court, which normally decides on extradition

			Procter  Gamble Provides Educational Grant to Support World Dental 
      Posters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Site Allows for Important Scientific Information to be Shared 
      Publicly
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Procter  Gamble (PG), the makers of Crest and Oral-B, along with 
      Stephen Hancocks Limited announced today that the open-access, 
      scientific site, World Dental Posters (www.worlddentalposters.com), 
      will now be sponsored through an educational grant from PG.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      World Dental Posters is an open access site launched in March 2013 that 
      provides scientific researchers the opportunity to upload their 
      peer-reviewed posters at no cost for as long as they wish. Typically, 
      peer-reviewed posters are presented at industry congresses, conferences 
      and meetings or through subscription-based journals &#8211; this site gives 
      the authors another channel to present their findings. The site also 
      provides citable references that informed the research, without losing 
      copyright protection for the individual authors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Philip Giorgi, Managing Director and co-owner of Stephen Hancocks 
      Limited, conceived the idea for World Dental Posters after seeing a pile 
      of posters discarded at numerous international dental conferences and 
      congresses. He realized there was an opportunity to identify a way to 
      keep this research available for others to see around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delighted that PG shares our vision for this free, open access 
      site created as a way to disseminate research through posters beyond 
      current possibilities,&#8221; said Philip Giorgi. &#8220;Providing researchers with 
      the opportunity to connect and share their ideas and findings is a 
      fundamental cornerstone of scientific advancement.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As a company, we are passionate about research in the development of 
      our products and technologies,&#8221; said Dr. Leslie Winston of PG Global 
      Oral Care Professional  Scientific Relations. &#8220;We are, therefore, 
      pleased to support World Dental Posters with a grant as a way to allow, 
      in particular, young and innovative researchers in the field of oral 
      health to disseminate their findings and discover others working in 
      similar areas.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Posters uploaded on to the World Dental Posters site are indexed by 
      title, author name(s) and key words and can remain on the site for free 
      for as long as the author(s) wish. Future developments will include 
      forum and discussion areas for connecting researchers with similar 
      interests and ideas from different geographic locations who might 
      otherwise be unaware of each other&#8217;s work.

      a person acting jointly with the Bidder within the meaning of section 2

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria's sovereign wealth fund on Wednesday appointed Goldman Sachs (GS.N), UBS (UBSN.VX) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) as asset managers for the 20 percent portion of its $1 billion fund that is meant to cushion against oil price shocks, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sovereign wealth fund (SWF) seeks to help Nigeria better manage its oft squandered oil windfall, with a threefold aim of putting money aside for infrastructure investment, providing a savings pot for future generations and lastly protecting against commodity price shocks - the so-called stabilization fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa's top oil producer pumps around 2 million barrels of oil a day, but much of that money is wasted on corruption and a bloated, inefficient bureaucracy, economists say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May the Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) said it would allocate 32.5 percent of the fund to infrastructure, the same amount to the savings pot and 20 percent to the stabilization fund, with the remaining 15 percent unallocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fund's assets will be invested conservatively, with capital preservation in nominal terms being of primary importance," NSIA special advisor Obinna Ihedioha said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added in a statement that UBS would manage the U.S. Treasury bond portfolio and Goldman and Credit Suisse would manage U.S. corporate grade bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund started with only $1 billion owing to opposition from Nigeria's powerful state governors, who want oil savings to be distributed for spending, arguing that it is unconstitutional for the federal government to hoard money that belongs to all three tiers of government - federal, state and local.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Excess Crude Account, which the SWF was originally supposed to replace, is easily raided for spending.

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS Aug 28 (Reuters) - Nigeria's sovereign wealth fund on
Wednesday appointed Goldman Sachs, UBS and
Credit Suisse as asset managers for the 20 percent
portion of its $1 billion fund that is meant to cushion against
oil price shocks, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sovereign wealth fund (SWF) seeks to help Nigeria better
manage its oft squandered oil windfall, with a threefold aim of
putting money aside for infrastructure investment, providing a
savings pot for future generations and lastly protecting against
commodity price shocks - the so-called stabilisation fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa's top oil producer pumps around 2 million barrels of
oil a day, but much of that money is wasted on corruption and a
bloated, inefficient bureaucracy, economists say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May the Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) said it
would allocate 32.5 percent of the fund to infrastructure, the
same amount to the savings pot and 20 percent to the
stabilisation fund, with the remaining 15 percent unallocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fund's assets will be invested conservatively, with
capital preservation in nominal terms being of primary
importance," NSIA special advisor Obinna Ihedioha said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added in a statement that UBS would manage the U.S.
Treasury bond portfolio and Goldman and Credit Suisse would
manage U.S. corporate grade bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund started with only $1 billion owing to opposition
from Nigeria's powerful state governors, who want oil savings to
be distributed for spending, arguing that it is unconstitutional
for the federal government to hoard money that belongs to all
three tiers of government - federal, state and local.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Excess Crude Account, which the SWF was originally
supposed to replace, is easily raided for spending. It had $9
billion in it in December last year, but distribution to
governors and spending had shrunk it to closer to $5 billion by
last month, according to state data.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Back-to-school is always an exciting time for students across the 
      country. As part of this significant moment, The Coca-Cola Company and 
      the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF) are coming together with key 
      retailers to announce the launch of Share Possibilities. This 
      annual Hispanic Heritage Month scholarship program will award $200,000 
      in scholarships to help close the college attainment gap among Latino 
      students.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s an honor to have the opportunity to support the community and 
      provide Hispanic families the means to achieve their educational dreams 
      and aspirations,&#8221; said Lauventria Robinson, Vice President of 
      Multicultural Marketing, Coca-Cola North America Group. &#8220;This program 
      allows us to bring the community together and share moments of happiness 
      with families across the country.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With a long-standing relationship of more than 30 years, The Coca-Cola 
      Company&#8217;s Share Possibilities program is designed to further 
      support HSF in its goal of providing scholarships to our country&#8217;s best 
      and brightest Latino students and supporting them on their path to 
      obtaining a college degree.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With 69% of Latino high school graduates now going directly to college, 
      it is more important than ever for HSF to provide scholarship support to 
      students and information about college and financial aid to parents,&#8221; 
      said Fidel A. Vargas, President and CEO of HSF. &#8220;Our long-standing 
      partnership with Coca-Cola continues to flourish and has played a key 
      role in our ability to positively impact students and their families 
      throughout America.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Share Possibilities program grants a total of $200,000 in 
      scholarships to college-bound Hispanic students. Nationally, the grand 
      prize winner will receive $20,000; four students will be awarded $10,000 
      and sixteen will receive $2,500. The remaining $100,000 will be awarded 
      by the company&#8217;s retail partners, within their respective communities, 
      across the nation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      From Sept. 1 through Dec. 15, eligible high school seniors may apply for 
      the opportunity to win a scholarship at www.Coke-HSF.com. 
      Applicants who meet the minimum eligibility requirements will be 
      featured in an online gallery with social media sharing capabilities. 
      Students are encouraged to share their profiles and gain community 
      votes. Each eligible participating voter is automatically entered for a 
      chance to win a $500 gift card and can vote up to five times a day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HSF will select the scholarship recipients based on the Fund&#8217;s standard 
      selection criteria for awarding scholarships, factoring in community 
      votes gathered online. Final winners will be announced by May 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company&#8217;s retail partners also play a vital role in the program by 
      funding and awarding the remaining $100,000 in their local communities. 
      Joining in the celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, these 
      partners are helping to increase awareness about the importance of 
      education as a means of strengthening communities and providing the 
      brain power needed for a sustainable national economy.

&lt;p&gt;MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - By getting arrested in his native Spain rather than his former London workplace, ex-JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) trader Javier Martin-Artajo has gained time in his struggle to avoid being extradited to New York over a $6.2 billion trading scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he may just be postponing the inevitable, extradition lawyers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, detained in Madrid on Tuesday and later granted a conditional release, has said he will resist being sent to the United States, where prosecutors accuse him of hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spaniard was the London supervisor of Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the "London Whale" for the big derivatives bets that led to last year's losses at JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scandal dented the reputation of the bank, the largest in the United States, which had weathered the global financial crisis better than most competitors. Its problems have since grown, and it is also embroiled in a federal bribery investigation and is facing multi-billion dollar lawsuits over subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors and has not been charged, while Frenchman Julien Grout, a junior colleague, has been charged but not arrested. Martin-Artajo is the most senior figure arrested so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers expect the case to drag out, though in principle he is eligible for extradition because the alleged offences are also punishable in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whilst the extradition process is known to be slow and tortuous .... it is difficult to see at this stage how extradition can realistically be avoided," said James Carlton, a partner at London-based law firm Fox Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But lawyers say being arrested in Spain was Martin-Artajo's best option, short of fleeing to a country like Cuba with no diplomatic ties with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain, according to its extradition treaty with the United States, is not obliged to hand him over. And any decision by Spanish authorities is normally preceded by a detailed review of whether there is a case to be answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would not have been so in Britain, where authorities first received a warrant for Martin-Artajo's arrest but were unable to find him, according to a Spanish police source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having family ties in Spain has also helped his treatment by the law so far, according to a Spanish lawyer who asked not to be named. The lawyer added that the High Court might otherwise have deemed him a flight risk and jailed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We made it clear there were some advantages to being detained in Madrid, ... he has family here, roots," said an inspector at the Spanish police unit that contacted Martin-Artajo's family to persuade him to hand himself in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COURT FILINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Spaniards have been successfully extradited to the United States, court filings show, including in drug-related cases. Other requests have been denied on medical grounds or in cases eligible for the death penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Spanish government officials and the cabinet have the final say. They, rather than the High Court, will consider reciprocity, the balance of whether the United States responds to Spanish requests in equal measure, the Spanish lawyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This looks like it could end up being more of a government decision," she added. A source at Spain's justice ministry said the cabinet had not gone against court decisions in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If tried in Spain, Martin-Artajo could face lesser penalties than the term of up to 25 years he risks in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York prosecutors, however, have been buoyed by successes in other European extraditions, and have been using one recent case involving a former British trader at Credit Suisse as a template for the "London Whale" one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There the British citizen, one of three charged with fraud for mismarking prices in their portfolio of credit-default swaps, was extradited to New York and pleaded guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Martin-Artajo worked at JPMorgan in London, prosecutors have been poring over communications between the London team and U.S. regulators or bank employees, which they believe give them jurisdiction in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fact U.S., rather than British, authorities are bringing the charges could be one weakness in the extradition case, some lawyers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's foreseeable that the defense team will dispute...the competence of the United States over this case," said another Spanish lawyer, on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States now has just under 40 days to provide the Spanish High Court with evidence to back up its request. Martin-Artajo, who is not allowed to leave Spain, will also have to formally declare his position on extradition before a judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A London lawyer for Martin-Artajo could not be reached for comment. Earlier this month Martin-Artajo had said through lawyers that he was away on a long-planned vacation and that he expected to be cleared of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grout, the other employee charged, cannot be extradited if he remains in France, although a source with knowledge of the matter has said Grout would offer to face the charges in the United States on condition he is granted bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Paul Day in Madrid; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. government housing finance authorities are pressing JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co for at least $6 billion to settle lawsuits over bonds backed by subprime mortgages, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is arguing that it should pay less to settle the claims by the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, according to the source, who was not authorized to speak for attribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA litigation is among a raft of legal issues JPMorgan is trying to work through in addition to investigations over its $6.2 billion "London Whale" derivatives loss of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An FHFA spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FHFA, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, sued JPMorgan over some $33 billion of securities two years ago and also sued at least 16 other financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits alleged that the banks misrepresented how well they had checked the underlying mortgages and charged that they did not meet investors' criteria. As borrowers fell behind in payments, the value of the securities fell, causing losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The securities at issue in the talks with JPMorgan include bonds that were sold by Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns, two troubled institutions that JPMorgan took over with government encouragement during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks have already settled mortgage litigation with government officials who are trying to make the banks bear more of the cost of the housing crisis. Switzerland-based UBS settled with the FHFA for $885 million in July. Citigroup Inc and General Electric Co have also reached settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, entities sponsored by the U.S. government, were seized by the government in 2008 and received $187.5 billion to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported the amount being sought from JPMorgan over the mortgage securities on its website earlier on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has spent about $5 billion for legal costs in each of the past two years. The company raised its estimate of possible losses in excess of its reserves to $6.8 billion at the end of June from $6 billion three months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York and Margaret Chadbourn in Washington; editing by Gary Hill and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

			Court Amends Award to Blavatnik in JPMorgan Case
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Interest Rate Increased to 9%; Award Expected to Increase to At Least 
      $63 Million
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The judge who last week ordered JPMorgan to pay Len Blavatnik $53 
      million has increased the award to an amount that Mr. Blavatnik&#8217;s 
      lawyers expect will be at least $63 million. The judge raised the amount 
      by increasing the interest rate on the damages award to 9% from 5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The higher interest rate in New York Supreme Court Justice Melvin L. 
      Schweitzer&#8217;s August 27 amendment of his earlier order is the correct one 
      required under New York law for a breach-of-contract claim.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On August 21, the court awarded Mr. Blavatnik $42.5 million before 
      pre-judgment interest, or $53 million with pre-judgment interest, 
      stating that JPMorgan had breached its contract with him.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In his lawsuit, Mr. Blavatnik alleged that JPMorgan allocated a large 
      portion of Mr. Blavatnik&#8217;s funds to risky subprime mortgage securities, 
      violating a set of detailed investment guidelines that the bank agreed 
      to.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The guidelines were clear,&#8221; Mr. Blavatnik said. &#8220;The account had to be 
      liquid and it had to be low-risk. The targeted returns were similar to a 
      typical money market fund.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In spring 2006, once the guidelines were agreed to and documents were 
      signed, Mr. Blavatnik&#8217;s company transferred about $1 billion into 
      JPMorgan, with clear instructions that the funds had to be invested 
      consistent with the agreed-upon guidelines. However, JPMorgan allocated 
      a large portion of the funds to risky subprime mortgage securities&#8212;far 
      exceeding the limit on mortgage securities set by the guidelines. This 
      directly resulted in losses that would have been avoided if JPMorgan had 
      abided by the contract.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Blavatnik stated, &#8220;I hope that this decision sends a clear message 
      to JPMorgan that they have to honor their obligations to their clients. 
      There are a lot of people out there who, I understand, feel they have 
      been wronged by JPMorgan but cannot afford to take on a huge bank. They 
      shouldn&#8217;t have to. JPMorgan should do the right thing because it is the 
      right thing to do.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      He continued, &#8220;I am gratified that the Court recognized that JPMorgan 
      blatantly violated our agreement by loading up the account with risky 
      subprime mortgage securities, and that the bank&#8217;s violation of its 
      crystal clear obligations caused huge losses. To add insult to injury, 
      JPMorgan refused to acknowledge its wrongdoing. On top of that, once we 
      sued JPMorgan, the bank and its lawyers violated the rules requiring 
      them to produce information that would allow us to prove their 
      wrongdoing, for which they were sanctioned.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rick Werder, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan and lead 
      attorney on the case, said, &#8220;We were very fortunate here to have a 
      client who had the courage of his convictions and the staying power to 
      pursue this case to a conclusion that decisively holds JPMorgan liable 
      for breaching the clear terms of his contract.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4385 Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, series 4385 'AAA/F1', Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --DRIVERs, series 4385 'AAA', Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AAA', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4385 
      PUTTERs and DRIVERs are based on the rating that Fitch has assigned to 
      State of Georgia general obligation bonds 2012A (rated 'AAA', Stable 
      Outlook) that have been deposited in the series 4385 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4385 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 
      A+/F1', Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating PUTTERs will expire on July 1, 
      2014, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, unless such date is 
      extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Goldman Sachs Group Inc managing director has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of raping a 20-year-old woman during a party last week at a house he rented in the up-market Hamptons area of Long Island, according to court filings.&lt;/p&gt;

      the Company; (ii)&#160;in connection with the acquisition of The Warnaco 
      Group, Inc., the Company borrowed significant amounts, may be considered 
      to be highly leveraged, and uses and will have to continue to use a

      result of which the Company might not have sufficient funds to operate 
      its businesses in the manner it intends or has operated in the past; 
      (iii)&#160;the levels of sales of the Company&#8217;s apparel, footwear and related 
      products, both to its wholesale customers and in its retail stores, the

      of safeguard controls (which, among other things, could limit the

      could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw 
      materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected

      limit or cease shopping in order to avoid exposure or become ill;

      transactions, including without limitation, the ability to integrate an

      operations, employee relationships, vendor relationships, customer 
      relationships or financial performance; (viii)&#160;the failure of the 
      Company&#8217;s licensees to market successfully licensed products or to 
      preserve the value of the Company&#8217;s brands, or their misuse of the 
      Company&#8217;s brands and (ix)&#160;other risks and uncertainties indicated from

      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today the completion of pneumonia case 
      accrual in the Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults 
      (CAPiTA) 65 years of age and older. CAPiTA, the largest trial of its 
      kind, was designed to evaluate whether Prevenar 13* (Pneumococcal 
      polysaccharide conjugate vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]) is effective in 
      preventing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by the 13 
      pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine.1 It is an 
      event-driven clinical study, meaning that a pre-specified number of 
      community-acquired, vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia cases have to 
      occur among study participants before the results can be determined.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As specified in the study protocol, all remaining suspected cases 
      currently in review will be fully processed to allow the database to be 
      locked. This case processing will take several months to complete and 
      will be performed by Julius Clinical, a spin-off of the Julius Center

			About CAPiTA
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The approval of Prevnar 13 for use in adult 50 years and older, under 
      the United States Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s accelerated approval 
      program, was based on the surrogate endpoint of immunogenicity. To 
      fulfill regulatory commitments under this program, Pfizer initiated the 
      CAPiTA study, which is intended to determine the effectiveness in the 
      prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia. CAPiTA is the largest 
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy trial in the 
      prevention of CAP. It involves approximately 85,000 subjects aged 65 
      years and older1&#160;and&#160;is the first ever conducted with a 
      conjugated vaccine to evaluate at this scale. The trial was conducted by 
      the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands. Fifty-eight 
      sentinel hospitals are utilized for surveillance of community-acquired 
      pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The primary outcome 
      measure for CAPiTA is related to the efficacy of Prevenar 13 and its 
      ability to prevent a first episode of vaccine-type CAP caused by the 13 
      pneumococcal serotypes contained in the vaccine.1 Secondary 
      endpoints evaluate the ability of Prevenar 13 to prevent a first episode 
      of vaccine-type IPD and prevent a first episode of 
      non-bacteremic/non-invasive vaccine-type CAP.1 Despite 
      current vaccination efforts, there are believed to be approximately 
      440,000 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia annually in the U.S. alone,2 
      which results in 25,000 pneumococcal disease-related deaths annually.3
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Prevenar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 was first introduced for use in infants and young children 
      in December 2009 in Europe and is now approved for such use in more than 
      120 countries worldwide, including the U.S. and Japan. It is the most 
      widely used pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in the world, and more 
      than 575 million doses of Prevenar/Prevenar 13 have been distributed 
      worldwide. In addition, Prevenar 13 is approved for use in adults 50 
      years of age and older in more than 90 countries, and is also approved 
      in the U.S. and European Union (EU) for use in older children and 
      adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Recently, Prevenar 13 was also approved 
      in the EU for use in adults 18 to 49 years of age, making it the only 
      pneumococcal vaccine in the EU approved to help protect against IPD from 
      infancy through adulthood.

			About CAP and PD
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CAP is the most common type of pneumonia,4 and affects people 
      outside the health care setting. In older adults, the most common 
      bacterial cause of CAP is Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae),1 
      and
			pneumococcal CAP is one of the leading causes of death and 
      hospitalization worldwide.5
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease (PD)is a group of illnesses caused by the bacterium S. 
      pneumoniae, also known as pneumococcus.6 It includes 
      invasive manifestations such as bacteremia (bacteria in the blood) and 
      meningitis (infection of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal 
      cord), as well as non-invasive infections such as pneumonia.7 
      PD can affect people of all ages, but infants and young children, older 
      adults and individuals with immunocompromising or certain chronic 
      medical conditions (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease) are at heightened risk of infection.8,9

		&lt;p&gt;
			U.S. Indication for Prevnar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13 is a vaccine approved for children 6 weeks through 17 years 
        of age for the prevention of invasive disease caused by 13 S. 
        pneumoniae strains (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 
        and 23F), and for children 6 weeks through 5 years for the prevention 
        of otitis media caused by 7 of the 13 strains (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 
        19F, and 23F)10
			
			
        Based upon immune responses to the vaccine, Prevnar 13 is also 
        approved for adults 50 years of age and older for the prevention of 
        pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive disease caused by the 13 vaccine 
        strains8
			
			
        Prevnar 13 is not 100% effective and will only help protect against 
        the 13 strains included in the vaccine
      
			
        Effectiveness when given less than 5 years after a pneumococcal 
        polysaccharide vaccine is not known
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13 should not be given to anyone with a history of severe 
        allergic reaction to any component of Prevnar 13 or any diphtheria 
        toxoid&#8211;containing vaccine
      
			
        Children and adults with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV infection, 
        leukemia) may have a reduced immune response
      
			
        A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been observed 
        in some infants born prematurely
      
			
        The most commonly reported serious adverse events in infants and 
        toddlers were bronchiolitis (an infection of the lungs) (0.9%), 
        gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and small intestine) 
        (0.9%), and pneumonia (0.9%)
      
			
        In children 6 weeks through 17 years, the most common side effects 
        were tenderness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, 
        irritability, decreased appetite, decreased or increased sleep, and 
        fever. Most commonly reported side effects in children 5 years through 
        17 years also included hives
      
			
        In adults, immune responses to Prevnar 13 were reduced when given with 
        injected seasonal flu vaccine
      
			
        In adults, the common side effects were pain, redness, or swelling at 
        the injection site, limitation of arm movement, fatigue, headache, 
        muscle pain, joint pain, decreased appetite, chills, or rash
      
			
        Ask your health care provider about the risks and benefits of Prevnar 
        13. Only a health care provider can decide if Prevnar 13 is right for 
        you or your child

			Chevron&#8217;s 2013 Fuel Your School Program Expands to Help Fund 
      Classroom Projects in 14 U.S. Communities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Collaboration with DonorsChoose.org will help generate up to nearly 
      $7.1 million for U.S. public school teachers and students
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (NYSE: CVX) announced the expansion of its Fuel Your 
      School program to 14 U.S. communities this fall from nine communities in 
      2012. Designed to support education for local public schools based on 
      the specific requests of each classroom, Fuel Your School will help meet 
      the critical need for classroom funding in various communities where 
      Chevron operates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Last year, Chevron funded $4.49 million worth of classroom projects in 
      nine U.S. markets. This year, from Oct. 1 through Oct. 31, 2013, Chevron 
      will contribute $1 to help fund eligible classroom projects when 
      consumers purchase eight or more gallons of fuel at participating 
      Chevron and Texaco stations in the participating U.S. communities, up to 
      a total contribution of nearly $7.1 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Effective education in the STEM subjects&#8212;science, technology, 
      engineering and math&#8212;can help prepare bright young students to be the 
      engineers, geologists and doctors of the future, driving innovation and 
      economic growth,&#8221; said Dale Walsh, president of Chevron Americas 
      Products. &#8220;Fuel Your School provides teachers with essential tools and 
      resources, including hands-on project materials that often do not 
      receive funding from traditional sources. These resources are critical 
      to spurring students&#8217; interest in and understanding of the STEM 
      subjects.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the U.S., Fuel Your School is an innovative collaboration between 
      Chevron and DonorsChoose.org, an online organization dedicated to 
      helping students in need. The program was driven by the lack of adequate 
      school funding, which has left some teachers without basic supplies to 
      help students complete their classroom assignments. Since its inception 
      in 2010, Fuel Your School has helped fund 8,915 classroom projects at 
      1,924 schools. The program has grown each year to support students in 
      various communities where Chevron has business operations and has 
      reached 899,180 students.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Last year, the average public school teacher spent approximately $485 
      of their own money on school supplies, instructional materials and other 
      classroom materials needed for student learning,&#8221; said Charles Best, CEO 
      of DonorsChoose.org. &#8220;By using our website, combined with Chevron&#8217;s 
      community relationships and retail network, we can expand the Fuel Your 
      School program to support more schools, empower more teachers and 
      improve more students&#8217; education.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All year, public school teachers across the U.S. post classroom project 
      requests on DonorsChoose.org. Their needs range from pencils to 
      microscope slides and even live tarantulas for use with biology lessons. 
      One of those requests came from Paula Baucom, a teacher at Will Rogers 
      Middle School in Fair Oaks, a suburb in Sacramento County, Calif., who 
      lacked the resources to provide students with fun, hands-on scientific 
      activities. With the help of the Fuel Your School program, she and her 
      students received owl pellets, along with a curriculum guide that 
      included bone sorting charts and other resources. These materials 
      allowed her students to take on the role of actual scientists as they 
      probed, classified, sorted, and analyzed the bones inside the owl 
      pellets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the state of the California budget, funding for essential hands-on 
      science experiences has been extremely limited,&#8221; Baucom said. &#8220;With the 
      generosity that Chevron extended through the Fuel Your School program, 
      my students had the opportunity to make connections about food chains 
      and ecosystems that wouldn't have been possible otherwise, and developed 
      an increased interest and passion in science.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This program is one of many in which Chevron works with local 
      communities, governments and nonprofit organizations to increase 
      learning opportunities for students and support the social and economic 
      vitality of communities. Chevron has invested more than $100 million in 
      STEM education programs over the past three years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2013 Fuel Your School program will help fund eligible classroom 
      projects developed by public school teachers and posted to 
      DonorsChoose.org in the following communities:
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Whale's supervisor gains time to fight handover to U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Eventual extradition seen as likely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Spanish government will weigh 'reciprocity' with U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sarah White and Clare Hutchison&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MADRID/LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - By getting arrested in his
native Spain rather than his former London workplace,
ex-JPMorgan Chase trader Javier Martin-Artajo has gained
time in his struggle to avoid being extradited to New York over
a $6.2 billion trading scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he may just be postponing the inevitable, extradition
lawyers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, detained in Madrid on Tuesday and later
granted a conditional release, has said he will resist being
sent to the United States, where prosecutors accuse him of
hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spaniard was the London supervisor of Bruno Iksil, 
nicknamed the "London Whale" for the big derivatives bets that
led to last year's losses at JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scandal dented the reputation of the bank, the largest
in the United States, which had weathered the global financial
crisis better than most competitors. Its problems have since
grown, and it is also embroiled in a federal bribery
investigation and is facing multi-billion dollar lawsuits over
subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iksil is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors and has not been
charged, while Frenchman Julien Grout, a junior colleague, has
been charged but not arrested. Martin-Artajo is the most senior
figure arrested so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers expect the case to drag out, though in principle he
is eligible for extradition because the alleged offences are
also punishable in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whilst the extradition process is known to be slow and
tortuous .... it is difficult to see at this stage how
extradition can realistically be avoided," said James Carlton, a
partner at London-based law firm Fox Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But lawyers say being arrested in Spain was Martin-Artajo's
best option, short of fleeing to a country like Cuba with no
diplomatic ties with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain, according to its extradition treaty with the United
States, is not obliged to hand him over. And any decision by
Spanish authorities is normally preceded by a detailed review of
whether there is a case to be answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would not have been so in Britain, where  authorities
first received a warrant for Martin-Artajo's arrest but were
unable to find him, according to a Spanish police source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having family ties in Spain has also helped his treatment by
the law so far, according to a Spanish lawyer who asked not to
be named. The lawyer added that the High Court might otherwise
have deemed him a flight risk and jailed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We made it clear there were some advantages to being
detained in Madrid, ... he has family here, roots," said an
inspector at the Spanish police unit that contacted
Martin-Artajo's family to persuade him to hand himself in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COURT FILINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Spaniards have been successfully extradited to the
United States, court filings show, including in drug-related
cases. Other requests have been denied on medical grounds or in
cases eligible for the death penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Spanish government officials and the cabinet
have the final say. They, rather than the High Court, will
consider reciprocity, the balance of whether the United States
responds to Spanish requests in equal measure, the Spanish
lawyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This looks like it could end up being more of a government
decision," she added. A source at Spain's justice ministry said
the cabinet had not gone against court decisions in recent
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If tried in Spain, Martin-Artajo could face lesser penalties
than the term of up to 25 years he risks in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York prosecutors, however, have been buoyed by successes
in other European extraditions, and have been using one recent
case involving a former British trader at Credit Suisse as a
template for the "London Whale" one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There the British citizen, one of three charged with fraud
for mismarking prices in their portfolio of credit-default
swaps, was extradited to New York and pleaded guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Martin-Artajo worked at JPMorgan in London,
prosecutors have been poring over communications between the
London team and U.S. regulators or bank employees, which they
believe give them jurisdiction in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fact U.S., rather than British, authorities are
bringing the charges could be one weakness in the extradition
case, some lawyers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's foreseeable that the defence team will dispute...the
competence of the United States over this case," said another
Spanish lawyer, on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States now has just under 40 days to provide the
Spanish High Court with evidence to back up its request.
Martin-Artajo, who is not allowed to leave Spain, will also have
to formally declare his position on extradition before a judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A London lawyer for Martin-Artajo could not be reached for
comment. Earlier this month Martin-Artajo had said through
lawyers that he was away on a long-planned vacation and that he
expected to be cleared of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grout, the other employee charged, cannot be extradited if
he remains in France, although a source with knowledge of the
matter has said Grout would offer to face the charges in the
United States on condition he is granted bail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Aug. 30, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz Grossman Hufford Dahlstrom  Gross LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Walter Investment Management Corp. ("Walter Investment" or the "Company") (NYSE:WAC) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, and docketed under 13 cv 1916 T27TBM, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of Walter Investment between May 9, 2012 and June 6, 2013 both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"). This class action seeks to recover damages against the Company and certain of its officers and directors as a result of alleged violations of the federal securities laws pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you are a shareholder who purchased Walter Investment securities during the Class Period, you have until September 23, 2013 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll free, x237. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and number of shares purchased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Walter Investment is a loan servicer and business solutions provider focused on generating recurring, fee-based revenues from an "asset-light" platform. The Company specializes in offering creative, structured solutions to owners of less-than-prime, non-conforming and other credit-challenged mortgage assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company lacked adequate internal controls over financial accounting; (2) the Company's internal controls were not effective; (3) the Company's financial statements contained false and misleading statements; (4) the Company had failed to disclose material weaknesses in the internal controls of its recent acquisition Reverse Mortgage Solutions, Inc. ("RMS"); (5) the Company had overstated the value of RMS; and (6) as a result of the foregoing, the Company's statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On March 18, 2013, the Company shocked investors by disclosing that, based on an evaluation by the Company's Board of Directors and management, "our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of this material weakness, management has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective." On this news the Company's shares fell $8.61 per share or over 20% percent to close at $32.98 per share on March 19, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On June 6, 2013, the Company reported that, [s] "Subsequent to the completion of the RMS Acquisition, the Company discovered a failure to record certain estimated liabilities to investors relating to servicing errors by RMS." The Company concluded after preliminary review that RMS historical financial statements, and the related reports of RMS historical independent registered public accounting firm, "should no longer be relied upon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Florida, and San Diego, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 70 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Robert S. Willoughby

motions filed in the wake of Snowden's leaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filings in the court are classified, and the department's
response was not published on the court's website late on
Friday. A department spokesperson declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are deeply disappointed that despite months of
negotiations and the efforts of many companies, the government
has not yet permitted our industry to release more detailed and
granular information about those requests," the general counsel
for Facebook Inc, Colin Stretch, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tech companies and privacy advocates tepidly welcomed
Clapper's pledge for annual reports on numbers of data requests
to Internet and phone companies, but expressed disappointment at
stopping short of more detailed breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The new data that the government plans to publish is not
nearly enough to justify the government's continued attempts to
gag companies like Google and Microsoft and prevent them from
engaging in meaningful transparency reporting of their own,"
said Kevin Bankston, director of free expression at privacy
group Center for Democracy and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Google spokesperson called Clapper's announcement "a step
in the right direction," while adding, "There is still too much
secrecy around these requests and that more openness is needed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
