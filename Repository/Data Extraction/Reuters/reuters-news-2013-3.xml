NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded two classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC), commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates, series 2001-CIBC2 and revised Outlooks on the two 'AAAsf' rated
classes to Negative from Stable . A detailed list of rating actions follows at
the end of this release. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

The downgrades reflect an increase in Fitch modeled losses. The performance of
several loans, including the two largest in the transaction, has deteriorated
since Fitch's previous rating action. In addition, the value of the specially
serviced asset has also deteriorated. 

RATING SENSITIVITY 

The Negative Outlooks reflect Fitch's concern over the quality of the remaining
pool given the concentration with only 11 loans remaining. If additional loans
default, interest shortfalls may be incurred by all remaining classes. If
interest shortfalls impact classes C and D, currently rated 'AAAsf', downgrades
to 'Asf' are possible. According to Fitch's criteria, ratings at 'AAAsf' and
'AAsf' should not incur interest shortfalls. 

Fitch modeled losses of 35.5% of the remaining pool; expected losses of the
original pool are at 9.5%, including losses already incurred to date (5.7%).
Fitch has designated five loans (83%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes
one specially serviced asset (9%). 

As of the February 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal
balance has been reduced by 89.4% to $101.9 million from $961.7 billion at
issuance. The transaction has become highly concentrated with only 11 loans
remaining in the pool. Interest shortfalls are affecting the non-rated class NR
through class G, with cumulative unpaid interest totaling $2.6 million. Two
loans in the remaining (2.8% of the pool) are defeased. 

The largest contributor to modeled losses, which is also the largest remaining
loan in the pool, consists of the non-anchor spaces (332,055 SF) of a 1.1
million square foot regional mall in Plano, TX (60.8% of the pool). The shadow
anchors are Macy's, JC Penney's, Dillard's and Sears. Except Dillard's, all
other three shadow anchors are under long-term leases. The property performance
has deteriorated since year-end 2009 primarily due to decrease in rents and
increase in operating expenses. The servicer-reported YE 2011 and third quarter
(3Q) 2012 DSCR was 0.97x and 0.84x, respectively, compared to 1.1x at YE 2010,
1.64x at YE2009 and 1.75x at issuance. The property has experienced strong
market competition from newer retail centers nearby. Occupancy as of Sept. 30,
2012 was 93%, compared to 98% at issuance. The loan remains current on debt
service. 

The second largest contributor to modeled losses is a REO 162,568 SF office
property in Riverside, OH (9%). The loan transferred to the special servicer in
January 2010 due to imminent default. A foreclosure sale took place in August
2011. The most recent property valuation indicates losses upon the liquidation
of the property. 

The third largest contributor to modeled losses consists of two office
properties in Baltimore, MD totaling 137,990 SF (9.6%). At YE2011, the portfolio
experienced significant occupancy decline primarily due to a large tenant (18%
NRA) vacating upon lease expiration. The combined occupancy rate dropped to 71%
at YE2011 from 90% at YE2010. The portfolio was 99.2% occupied at issuance. The
servicer-reported 3Q12 DSCR was 1.05x, compared to 1.42x at YE2011. The
occupancy is expected to improve by the end of 2013 as a new lease (7,648sf or
6%) was signed which will become effective in mid-December 2013. 

Fitch has downgraded the following classes: 

--$28.9 million class E to 'Bsf' from 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Negative; 

--$12 million class F to 'CCCsf' from 'BBsf'; RE40%. 

Fitch has affirmed the following classes and revised Outlooks as indicated: 

--$21.5 million class C at 'AAAsf'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$14.4 million class D at 'AAAsf'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$24.9 million class G to at 'Dsf'; RE0%. 

Classes A-1 through B have paid in full. Classes H, J, K, L and M have been
depleted due to losses and remains at 'Dsf/RE0%'. Fitch does not rate NR class
certificates. Fitch has previously withdrawn the ratings on the Interest-only
class X-1 and X-2. 

Additional information on Fitch's criteria for analyzing U.S. CMBS transactions
is available in the Dec. 18, 2012 report, 'U.S. Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS
Surveillance and Re-REMIC Criteria', which is available at

&lt;p&gt;* Reiterates $9,000/T six-month price forecast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Sees market moving from oversupply to balance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Says recent selloff was overdone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman
Sachs recommended buying September copper futures on the
London Metal Exchange, in a note released on Friday, on
expectations of a pickup in Chinese demand over the next three
to six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influential U.S. bank prefers copper for 2013 among the
base metals and has a six-month price forecast as high as
$9,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME)
 was untraded at the close on Friday but last bid at
$7,700 per tonne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fundamentally, we see the copper market in small surplus,
moving towards balance," Goldman Sachs analyst Max Layton said
in the research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect Chinese refined copper imports to pick up over
the next three-six months and Chinese bonded stocks to draw, as
Chinese demand picks up both seasonally and following continued
growth in construction completions, property sales, and power
infrastructure related demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a rally in the last part of 2012 and the beginning of
2013, copper has fallen sharply in the last couple of weeks,
together with other commodity and equity markets, in a broader
risk-off environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank, however, thinks the selloff was overdone and
now offers a good opportunity to establish a September copper
long position at around $7,700, with a 17 percent potential
upside to the bank's $9,000-per-tonne six-month forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For metals, fears over Chinese property tightening,
concerns over broader economic tightening, and a
weaker-than-anticipated PMI (purchasing managers' index) all
contributed to the liquidation," Layton added in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beyond the February Chinese economic data, we expect the
Chinese economic and metal-specific data to show year-on-year
growth," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded one class and affirmed 18 classes of J.P. Morgan
Chase Commercial Mortgage Series Corp., (JPMCC) commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates series 2005-LDP4. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the
end of this press release. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

The downgrade reflects an increase in Fitch expected losses due to further
deterioration in performance, most notably on loans currently in special
servicing. 

Fitch modeled losses of 14.7% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the
original pool balance total 11.5%, including losses already incurred. The pool
has experienced $68.8 million (2.6% of the original pool balance) in realized
losses to date. Fitch has designated 39 loans (31%) as Fitch Loans of Concern,
which includes seven specially serviced assets (12.2%). 

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

The Negative Outlook on class AJ reflects the uncertainty related to the
expected losses on the specially serviced loans, particularly losses associated
with the largest loan in the pool, Silver City Galleria (7.4% of the pool). The
investment grade classes are expected to remain stable, but increased modeled
losses due to prolonged workouts or significant value declines, may have adverse
rating actions over the longer term. The distressed classes (those rated below
B) are expected to be subject to further downgrades as losses are realized. 

As of the January 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance
has been reduced by 39.4% to $1.62 billion from $2.68 billion at issuance. Per
the servicer reporting, five loans (7.2% of the pool) have defeased since
issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes D through NR. 

The largest contributor to Fitch-expected losses is the specially-serviced
Silver City Galleria loan (7.4% of the pool), the largest loan in the pool. The
loan is secured by a 714,898 square foot (sf) regional mall located in Taunton,
MA. The property transferred to special servicing in October 2009 after
experiencing cash flow issues due to occupancy declines. The lender foreclosed
on the property and the asset became real estate owned (REO) in December 2011.
The servicer has hired a management company to assist with leasing efforts and
is also attempting to sell the property through a national sales marketing
effort. According to the servicer the property's value continues to be
negatively impacted due to declining tenant sales and tenant vacancy's, as well
as lower rental income and shorter term renewals on existing tenants. The
servicer reports that these factors continue to impact the value, sales pricing,
and volume of bidding activity. 

The next largest contributor to Fitch-expected losses is the One World Trade
Center loan (5.4%), the second largest loan in the pool. The loan is secured by
a 573,000sf, 27 story class 'A' office building located in Long Beach, CA. The
property has experienced cash flow issues due to occupancy declines. Occupancy
has remained flat since 2010 with the February 2013 rent roll reporting at 70%,
a significant decline from issuance at 87%. Leases for 38% of the net rentable
area (NRA) are scheduled to expire within the next two years which includes the
buildings largest tenant, United States of America (20.3%), whose government
lease expires in September 2013. Debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) reported at
0.93 times (x) for year to date (YTD) June 2012, compared to 0.90x in 2011 and
1.32x in 2010. The partial interest only loan has been amortizing since the
September 2010 payment. The loan remains current as of the February 2013 payment
date. 

The third largest contributor to Fitch-expected losses is secured by a 129,020
sf retail property in Lincoln, CA (2.3%). The loan transferred to special
servicing in January 2010 due to imminent default. The lender foreclosed on the
property and the asset became REO in June 2012. The December 2012 rent roll
reports occupancy at 87%. The servicer is working to stabilize the property and
market for sale. 

Fitch downgrades the following class and assigns Recovery Estimates (RE) as
indicated: 

--$50.2 million class B to 'CCCsf' from 'Bsf', RE 70%. 

Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated: 

--$201 million class A-1A at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable; 

--$53.3 million class A-3A2 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable; 

--$580.3 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable; 

--$53.5 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable; 

--$267.7 million class A-M at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable; 

--$204.1 million class A-J at 'BBsf', Outlook Negative; 

--$23.4 million class C at 'CCCsf', RE 0%; 

--$46.8 million class D at 'CCsf', RE 0%. 

--$23.4 million class E at 'Csf', RE 0%; 

--$40.2 million class F at 'Csf', RE 0%; 

--$26.8 million class G at 'Csf', RE 0%; 

--$30.1 million class H at 'Csf', RE 0%; 

--$10 million class J at 'Csf', RE 0%; 

--$11.9 million class K at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--Class L at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--Class M at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--Class N at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--Class P at 'Dsf', RE 0%. 

The balances for classes L, M, N, P, and the unrated class NR have been reduced
to zero due to realized losses. The class A-1, A-2, A-2FL and A-3A1 certificates
have paid in full.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC has selected JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) to lead an initial public offering of eye care company Bausch &amp; Lomb, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Soyoung Kim and Jessica Toonkel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Warburg
Pincus LLC has selected JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup to lead an
initial public offering of eye care company Bausch &amp; Lomb, two
people familiar with the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed IPO could raise as much as $1.5 billion and is
expected to value Bausch and Lomb at about $9 billion to $10
billion, according to one of the people, who declined to be
identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warburg Pincus continues to explore a private sale of the
eye care company it acquired more than five years ago, and is
working with Goldman Sachs to find a buyer, the person
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction attracted interest from several healthcare
companies including Sanofi SA, but none of the
interested parties met Warburg Pincus' price expectations so
far, prompting the buyout firm to lean toward an IPO, people
familiar with the matter have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1853, Rochester, New York-based Bausch &amp; Lomb
makes contact lenses, eye drugs and surgical equipment and sells
its products in more than 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company was taken private by Warburg Pincus in 2007 for
about $4.5 billion, including $830 million of debt, after it
fell out of Wall Street's favor because of product recalls, big
charges and restatements of earnings. Warburg Pincus committed
over $1 billion of equity toward the buyout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then it has undergone a transformation under Chief
Executive Brent Saunders, who joined in March 2010 and has built
up the business through acquisitions, most recently taking over
Germany's Technolas Perfect Vision GmbH, an eye laser firm, in
November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bausch &amp; Lomb's main competitors are healthcare heavyweights
 Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novartis and Abbott
Laboratories, for whom eye care is only a minor focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Warburg Pincus, JPMorgan, Bank of
America and Citigroup declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported the hiring of JPMorgan as one of the

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
    March 1 - Fitch Ratings has downgraded one class and affirmed 18 classes of
J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Series Corp., (JPMCC) commercial mortgage
pass-through certificates series 2005-LDP4. A detailed list of rating actions
follows at the end of this press release.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The downgrade reflects an increase in Fitch expected losses due to further 
deterioration in performance, most notably on loans currently in special 
servicing.  

Fitch modeled losses of 14.7% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the 
original pool balance total 11.5%, including losses already incurred. The pool 
has experienced $68.8 million (2.6% of the original pool balance) in realized 
losses to date. Fitch has designated 39 loans (31%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, 
which includes seven specially serviced assets (12.2%).  

RATING SENSITIVITIES

The Negative Outlook on class AJ reflects the uncertainty related to the 
expected losses on the specially serviced loans, particularly losses associated 
with the largest loan in the pool, Silver City Galleria (7.4% of the pool). The 
investment grade classes are expected to remain stable, but increased modeled 
losses due to prolonged workouts or significant value declines, may have adverse
rating actions over the longer term.  The distressed classes (those rated below 
B) are expected to be subject to further downgrades as losses are realized.   

As of the January 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance
has been reduced by 39.4% to $1.62 billion from $2.68 billion at issuance. Per 
the servicer reporting, five loans (7.2% of the pool) have defeased since 
issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes D through NR.

The largest contributor to Fitch-expected losses is the specially-serviced 
Silver City Galleria loan (7.4% of the pool), the largest loan in the pool.  The
loan is secured by a 714,898 square foot (sf) regional mall located in Taunton, 
MA. The property transferred to special servicing in October 2009 after 
experiencing cash flow issues due to occupancy declines. The lender foreclosed 
on the property and the asset became real estate owned (REO) in December 2011.  
The servicer has hired a management company to assist with leasing efforts and 
is also attempting to sell the property through a national sales marketing 
effort.  According to the servicer the property's value continues to be 
negatively impacted due to declining tenant sales and tenant vacancy's, as well 
as lower rental income and shorter term renewals on existing tenants.  The 
servicer reports that these factors continue to impact the value, sales pricing,
and volume of bidding activity.  

The next largest contributor to Fitch-expected losses is the One World Trade 
Center loan (5.4%), the second largest loan in the pool.  The loan is secured by
a 573,000sf, 27 story class 'A' office building located in Long Beach, CA.  The 
property has experienced cash flow issues due to occupancy declines.  Occupancy 
has remained flat since 2010 with the February 2013 rent roll reporting at 70%, 
a significant decline from issuance at 87%.  Leases for 38% of the net rentable 
area (NRA) are scheduled to expire within the next two years which includes the 
buildings largest tenant, United States of America (20.3%), whose government 
lease expires in September 2013.  Debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) reported at
0.93 times (x) for year to date (YTD) June 2012, compared to 0.90x in 2011 and 
1.32x in 2010.  The partial interest only loan has been amortizing since the 
September 2010 payment.  The loan remains current as of the February 2013 
payment date.

The third largest contributor to Fitch-expected losses is secured by a 129,020 
sf retail property in Lincoln, CA (2.3%).  The loan transferred to special 
servicing in January 2010 due to imminent default.  The lender foreclosed on the
property and the asset became REO in June 2012.  The December 2012 rent roll 
reports occupancy at 87%.  The servicer is working to stabilize the property and
market for sale.

Fitch downgrades the following class and assigns Recovery Estimates (RE) as 
indicated:

--$50.2 million class B to 'CCCsf' from 'Bsf', RE 70%.

Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
--$201 million class A-1A at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$53.3 million class A-3A2 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$580.3 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$53.5 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$267.7 million class A-M at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$204.1 million class A-J at 'BBsf', Outlook Negative;
--$23.4 million class C at 'CCCsf', RE 0%;
--$46.8 million class D at 'CCsf', RE 0%.
--$23.4 million class E at 'Csf', RE 0%;
--$40.2 million class F at 'Csf', RE 0%;
--$26.8 million class G at 'Csf', RE 0%;
--$30.1 million class H at 'Csf', RE 0%;
--$10 million class J at 'Csf', RE 0%;
--$11.9 million class K at 'Dsf', RE 0%;

--Class L at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
--Class M at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
--Cass N at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
--Class P at 'Dsf', RE 0%.
 

The balances for classes L, M, N, P, and the unrated class NR have been reduced 
to zero due to realized losses.  The class A-1, A-2, A-2FL and A-3A1 
certificates have paid in full.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) reduced its risk-taking for a third straight year, with potential losses from trading positions dropping to the lowest level in seven years, reflecting a more cautious stance towards markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank's average daily value at risk last year was $86 million, down 24 percent from the preceding year, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure shows how much money Goldman estimates it could lose on an average day, with 95 percent confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was not alone in reporting lower risk-taking. On average, its four biggest Wall Street rivals - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and the trading businesses of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) - reported an average decline of 21 percent in comparable average daily value-at-risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower risk-taking shows that these firms are taking to heart at least some of the lessons from the financial crisis and its aftermath. But it is unclear how much of the reduction in risk-taking comes from market conditions and exposure, and how much of it comes from changes in models to calculate risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators, for example, approved a new model for Morgan Stanley last year that increased emphasis on short-term volatility. As a result, losses that occurred in 2007 and 2008 had less of an impact on value-at-risk. Its figures are also now more comparable to competitors, Morgan Stanley said in a filing this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's risk-taking in 2012 was at the lowest level since 2005, when it reported an average daily value-at-risk of $70 million. It was less than half the $218 million of average daily value-at-risk Goldman reported at its 2009 peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declines in risk-taking were broad across Goldman's positions in interest rates, equities, currencies and commodities. Goldman attributed the changes to lower volatility and reduced market exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said its value-at-risk model is "regularly reviewed and enhanced in order to incorporate changes in the composition of inventory positions, as well as variations in market conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Goldman, less risk-taking also meant fewer days with big losses or gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman lost money on 16 trading days in 2012, compared with 54 days in 2011. It did not lose more than $75 million on a single day, whereas the previous year it lost at least $100 million on four days. Likewise, the bank earned at least $100 million on 41 days in 2012, compared with 54 days in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Goldman's trading and investing businesses were more profitable last year than in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman reported $5.6 billion in pretax earnings from its client trading business and $3.2 billion in pretax earnings from its investing and lending division, which puts Goldman's own money to work. In 2011, those businesses reported earnings of $4.4 billion and a loss of $531 million, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate filing, Citigroup reported a new 2011 value-at-risk of $176 million in a regulatory filing on Friday. The figure is 17 percent less than the original $213 million figure it reported a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup said the change was partly due to the fact that its three-year volatility time frame no longer includes market swings from 2008 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bernadette Baum and Jim Marshall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Mar 01 (Marketwire) -- 
Prolifics, an end-to-end systems integrator and renowned for their
identity management solutions, today announces that its Service ID
Governor (SIG) solution, which will be featured at the 2013 Pulse
Conference, has received the Ready for IBM Security Intelligence mark. 

    Prolifics' Service ID Governor solves a critical security compliance
requirement to manage IT Administrators and their unregulated access to
security systems. The solution centers on Privileged Identity Management
which has become a focus area based on several recent widely-publicized
incidents. 

    Privileged Identities come in two varieties -- human identities and
non-human identities, or "Service Identities." Privileged Identity
Manager (PIM) was recently introduced as a solution to the assignment and
control of human administrative identities. Service Identities are
privileged identities assigned to middleware, databases and servers.
These identities never change and typically have no human oversight, so
they are especially vulnerable. Most security audits today recognize the
threat that Service Accounts represent, and compel businesses to address
the exposure. Prolifics' Service Identity Governor (SIG) furthers PIM's
solution by providing management of non-human identities. 

    Prolifics' solution enables an organization to assign responsibility to
non-personal accounts, track custodians and administrators of the
accounts and provide appropriate reporting, end-to-end auditing and
policy enforcement. By delivering centralized management of Service IDs
on target systems, Service ID Governor simplifies the process of request,
approval and certification and improves security across the enterprise.

    Achieving Ready for IBM Security Intelligence shows our customers that
Prolifics' solution has been validated against specifications for
integration with IBM Security products. Privileged Identity Manager,
together with Prolifics' Service Identity Governor, is a powerful
combination addressing security vulnerabilities surrounding Privileged
Identities.

    About Prolifics
 Prolifics is an end-to-end systems integrator
specializing in IBM technologies providing expert services including
architectural advisement, design, development, deployment, and testing of
end-to-end SOA, BPM, Security, Content and Collaboration solutions.

Ensures Uptime, Performance and Security for Cloud, Virtual &amp; Physical
Infrastructures
NEWTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
If you`re attending IBM`s annual Pulse Conference next week in Las Vegas, be
sure to see how Intigua`s cloud management platform virtualizes existing Tivoli
solutions, bringing new levels of agility and flexibility to your enterprise
management infrastructure. 

The Intigua platform is now "Ready for Tivoli" certified by IBM, which means
that integration and compatibility between IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) and the
Intigua platform have been validated by IBM. The Intigua platform is also now
part of the IBM Integrated Service Management (ISM) Library. 

Intigua transforms existing management solutions into dynamic, policy-based
services that are much easier to provision, upgrade, control and troubleshoot,
including widely-used IBM solutions such as:

* IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) 
* Tivoli End-Point Manager (TEM) 
* Tivoli Provisioning Manager (TPM) 
* Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) 
* IBM Platform Symphony for Big Data and Grid Computing

By converting standard Tivoli agents into virtual, "zero-install" agents with
all of the same functionality as physical agents, Intigua de-couples management
software from the underlying server infrastructure. This eliminates the
complexity, operational overhead and implementation delays commonly associated
with traditional agents that require physical installation on all servers. 

To enhance application performance and uptime, virtual agents are "sandboxed" in
virtual containers (similar to VMDKs) that insulate critical servers from
misbehaving or overactive agents. Security and compliance are also enhanced with
automated policies by ensuring all servers have the proper security agents, and
by accelerating the rollout of new security controls to protect against advanced
threats. 

"Monitoring and service management are critical for maximizing availability,
performance and security in dynamic cloud and virtual environments," said Shimon
Hason, Intigua CEO and co-founder. "With Intigua, IBM customers can continue
using their favorite management solutions such as ITM with
dramatically-increased flexibility, enabling them to deploy or upgrade
management software in hours rather than months." 

Intigua will be demonstrating its certified "Ready for Tivoli" solution at the
IBM Pulse Conference, March 3-6, in Pedestal #T124 of the turnkey area. 

About Intigua

Intigua virtualizes the management layer - just as servers, storage and networks
have been virtualized - bringing cloud-grade agility and speed to infrastructure
monitoring and management. Winner of the "Best of VMworld 2012 Gold Award" for
New Technology and the "Innovator" Award for Cloud and Virtualization Security
from SC Magazine, Intigua enables enterprises to ensure the performance, uptime
and security of critical applications running on physical, virtual and hybrid
cloud infrastructures. Intigua is backed by Bessemer Venture Partners (BVP) and
Cedar Fund. Visit www.intigua.com to learn more.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A bright blue hot-air balloon whisked James Franco to the premiere of his new Walt Disney Co movie, "Oz the Great and Powerful," delivering the star to Hollywood Boulevard where he walked an emerald green carpet with a yellow-brick road into the El Capitan Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-flying, and headline-grabbing, entrance last month was the signature event of a Disney marketing blitz on major TV broadcasts, social media and at Disney parks to stoke interest in "Oz," a $200 million production that is its first release of an expensive 2013 film slate. It debuts in theaters March 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3D "Oz" also debuts the first full year of Disney CEO Bob Iger's strategy of investing in films with hefty budgets that the media giant can turn into "brands" that bring in box office receipts, spawn movie sequels, drive toy sales and inspire theme-park rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After "Oz" lands in theaters, the Burbank-based company scheduled three movies with budgets of more than $185 million for release through July 3, which is when it expects to unveil the $225 million film "The Lone Ranger," starring Johnny Depp as the masked man's sidekick Tonto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If anyone else tried it, it would be a very risky strategy," said Peter Sealey, former head of marketing at Columbia Pictures and founder of The Sausalito Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're the only ones who could do it, based on the breadth of their company, the movies they have and their ability to squeeze money out of any film they make," Sealey added. "I wouldn't be surprised if they don't have an Oz ride opening next week in Orlando."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following "Oz," Disney is scheduled to release on May 3 the third installment of its Marvel unit's giant hit "Iron Man" movies starring Robert Downey Jr. On June 21, it debuts "Monsters University," a "prequel" to Pixar's 2001 blockbuster "Monsters, Inc." that generated $562 million in worldwide tickets sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disney version of "Oz" is a prequel to the 1939 classic "The Wizard of Oz" and tells the story a small-time magician played by Franco who is mistaken for a wizard and becomes the leader of the land of munchkins and witches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oz" looks like a hit, said Phil Contrino, chief analyst for Boxoffice.com. He projects U.S. and Canadian ticket sales of $65 million over the first three days, placing it among the industry's biggest March openings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia surrounding the original film will help bring families to theaters, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Look at success of 'Wicked' on Broadway," he said. "People are open to the idea of the 'Wizard of Oz' being played around with and new approaches taken."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is taking no chances, and is spending up to $100 million on marketing to supplement nostalgia. The company launched a New Year's campaign with a social media sweepstakes urging fans to tweet resolutions with the #DisneyOz hashtag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "Oz" hot-air balloon, emblazoned with #DisneyOZ, made stops at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California, and the Daytona 500, where Franco was grand marshal. It is heading to Central Park next week and an appearance on "Good Morning America" on Disney-owned ABC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Television promotions for the film have been hard to miss. Disney ran a pricey commercial during the CBS telecast of the Super Bowl. It also enlisted Mariah Carey to sing a song from the film on Fox singing contest "American Idol," according to producer Joe Roth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On ABC's "The Bachelor," host Chris Harrison interrupted the dating competition to introduce a brief appearance by Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz, the actresses who play the film's three witches. A pair of Dorothy's red slippers from the original "Wizard of Oz" made an appearance at ABC's Academy Awards broadcast in a glass case, which was covered until red carpet host Kristin Chenoweth unveiled it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney experienced the expensive downside of its big-budget film strategy last year, when the $250 million film "John Carter" became one of Hollywood's costliest flops, saddling Disney's studio with an operating loss of $84 million for the fiscal second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a couple months later, Disney saw the other side of releasing a big-budget movie when Marvel superhero mashup "The Avengers" recorded the biggest domestic debut of all time and earned more than $1.5 billion around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After "John Carter" bombed, Disney named a new studio head, Alan Horn, a former Warner Bros. executive with a record of success managing "Harry Potter," "The Dark Knight" and other major film franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also geared up its vaunted marketing machine, partnering with the HSN shopping network on an Oz-inspired fashion line and setting up a "Land of Oz" garden at Epcot, on top of the millions it spent elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to hand it to Disney," said Jeff Bock, box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. "They do go all out. They're going to spend $200 or $250 million on these productions and make a real spectacle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 5 (Reuters) - A U.S. senate committee, which began an
inquiry into JPMorgan's multi-billion dollar trading
loss last year, is expected to fault certain executives in its
report for allowing the bank to build bets without fully warning
regulators and investors, the New York Times reported, citing
people briefed on the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations could
ask Douglas Braunstein, who was chief financial officer at the
time of the losses, and other senior executives to testify at a
hearing this month, the people told the paper. The Senate
committee's report is due to be released on March 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has been cooperating with the investigation
and discussed the findings with the subcommittee, declined to
comment to the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein and other bank executives have not been accused
of any wrongdoing, and he is not the focus of a separate law
enforcement investigation into the trading loss, according to
the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan lost $6 billion in trading bets that
came from a group called the Chief Investment Office (CIO),
which managed risk for the bank and invested deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CIO group in London took large bets on derivatives, with
one trader taking big enough positions to be called "the London
Whale."&lt;/p&gt;

LONG BEACH, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Please replace the release with the following corrected version due to multiple
revisions. 

The corrected release reads: 

ACOM ANNOUNCES AN INDUSTRY BREAKTHROUGH WITH ONE SINGLE ENTERPRISE CONTENT
MANAGEMENT PLATFORM SUPPORTING MULTIPLE COMPANIES AND MULTIPLE ERP SYSTEMS FOR
MICROSOFT DYNAMICS GP AND SAGE ERP

ACOM Solutions, Inc., an industry leader in document and process automation
software solutions, announced a new EZContentManager (EZCM) software release
that offers Microsoft Dynamics GP and Sage ERP customers an Enterprise Content
Management (ECM) solution in a single platform that supports organizations with
multiple companies and multiple ERP Systems, centralizing visibility and control
of documents and related business information. 

"This is an extraordinary development for mid-market organizations who commonly
struggle to manage the business information, processes and ERP output of the
varied business environments that result from mergers, acquisitions and
consolidations," said Joseph Torano, ACOM`s Channel Division Vice President. 

"Our EZCM Multi-Company release now gives company headquarters one single ECM
platform for control and visibility of all of their information electronically,
regardless of dissimilar business environments, processing needs or even
different ERP systems. ACOM`s EZCM Multi-Company release now brings what was
previously only available in Tier I organizations to the Tier II market&#8230;
affordably, easily implemented and without leaving their Microsoft Dynamics GP
or Sage ERP screens," Mr. Torano added. 

One central system with no compromise to individual company identity. ACOM`s
EZCM now allows an organization`s divisions, separate companies or subsidiaries
to be easily configured as their own unique domains, with separate vendors,
customers, GL accounting, and multiple automated processing rules. No more need
for multiple installations of software and costly customization. 

Users may then access multiple company domains regardless of their ERP system,
with individual security settings for each domain. 

"This is an outstanding development for ACOM, our clients, partners and future
customers. Our mission has been to bring the best document management and
processing solutions to the markets we serve. Solutions that clearly provide the
value organizations require with significant returns in increased productivity,
efficiency and real bottom-line cost savings. This EZCM Multi-Company release
provides a powerful platform for Microsoft Dynamics GP and Sage ERP mid-market
companies to take real control of their information assets enterprise-wide&#8230; from
financial management through any department without compromise to the individual
business environments they serve," says Patrick McMahon, ACOM`s President and
CEO.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is trying to find ways to keep investing in the profitable, albeit risky, business of buying and selling companies without crossing a rule that will restrict private equity investing, three sources familiar with the new business said over the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule - named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law - is expected to limit bank investments in private equity funds, but not necessarily private equity-style investments outside of a formal fund structure. The rule's main goal is to prevent federally insured banks from gambling in the markets or taking on too much risk with hedge funds and private-equity funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a bid to pool money for deals without raising a private equity fund, the Wall Street bank has been lining up clients who are willing to put money into accounts set up to invest in private equity-style deals, the sources said. Goldman would also set aside some of its own money and partner capital into separate accounts for the same purpose, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new plan, Goldman would then make investments in a syndicate fashion, contributing investor money, along with its own capital and partner dollars, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would be different from a traditional private equity fund, where money from various investors has already been pooled together in a formal fund structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is the same pitch as before, 'We are putting a lot of our own money in this,'" said a person familiar with Goldman's marketing of the new business. "They are saying, 'We are still in this business.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details of the new structure, including whether Goldman would still get fees for managing client money and how profits would be taxed, could not be learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokeswoman Andrea Raphael said on Monday that the firm is merely taking a strategy used in other investment businesses and applying it to private equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe these investments will continue to be important to our clients and the economy, more broadly," Raphael said. "We will, of course, comply with all aspects of the Volcker rule as it is finalized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a conference last year, Goldman President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn said the bank has been managing its existing private-equity investments to comply with Volcker, and "will continue to source and pursue attractive investments on behalf of our clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VOLCKER RULE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule aims to limit banks' exposure to these kinds of investments. The rule, which has not been implemented yet, will allow firms to place up to 3 percent of their Tier 1 capital into private equity funds. It will also prevent them from contributing more than 3 percent of any new private equity funds they raise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A draft version of the rule appears to allow banks to continue making private equity investments, as long as the investments do not reside in a fund structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not a model of statute writing," said Dwight Smith, an attorney at Morrison &amp; Foerster who focuses on bank regulation. "In terms of merchant banking and direct investments in portfolio companies as opposed to investing in funds, those are fine and not subject to Volcker at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some major banks such as Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc have been pulling back from private equity investments ahead of the rule. But others, including Goldman and Wells Fargo &amp; Co, are betting that workarounds will help them retain at least some lines of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returns from private equity investments can be high. But they are also risky. The largest leveraged buyout, the $45 billion takeover of Texas utility TXU in 2007, has turned into one of the most spectacular failures of the last decade's buyout boom. Goldman was part of the private equity consortium that took TXU private. The company is now known as Energy Future Holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the financial reform law passed in 2010, Goldman has shut down its proprietary trading desks and outlined plans to gradually wind down its stakes in hedge funds each quarter to prepare for Volcker rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it also gathered a team of lawyers, lobbyists and strategists to devise arguments that would protect as much of its proprietary investing business as possible, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central argument that emerged from their effort was that activities like merchant banking and debt investing through credit funds should be exempt from the rule - or parts of it - because they are akin to making loans, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARTNER MONEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has a long history of successfully raising private equity funds that mix its own capital with money from employees and clients. GS Capital Partners VI, the largest such fund Goldman raised, closed in 2007 with $20.3 billion in assets, 45 percent of which came from the firm and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's private equity assets represented 19 percent of its Tier 1 capital at year-end, though it is not clear how much of those assets are tied up in funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman partner capital is also invested in other types of investment vehicles, such as credit funds, and the firm has been trying to make sure they are exempt from Volcker restrictions as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a February 2012 meeting with the Federal Reserve, for example, Goldman executives argued that credit funds should not be subject to Volcker restrictions because investors typically require a 5 percent "skin in the game" from sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's private equity and merchant banking businesses are large and lucrative, and hold a sizable portion of the personal wealth of senior Goldman executives, including Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is betting that its investments not tied up in funds will be protected from Volcker rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of Goldman's regulatory reform group - overseen by Harvey Schwartz, who is now chief financial officer, and John Rogers, who is chief of staff - have given presentations to regulators about potential pitfalls of Volcker, and tried to educate the Fed and other regulators on the best way to write the rule, sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One source who attended meetings with regulators said that officials seemed receptive to Goldman's arguments, but cautioned that they worried about banks becoming overexposed to risks in private equity investing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW PRIVATE EQUITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear when the final Volcker rule, which had been scheduled for July 2012, will be unveiled. It may not be fully implemented for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, a group of Goldman bankers, in the merchant banking division headed by Richard Friedman, have been pitching clients on the new way of co-investing in private equity deals with the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanya Barnes, a newly minted managing director, is one person working on the project, sources said.

&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s one&#160;expensive Danish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft owes the Danish treasury 5.8 billion kroner, or about $1 billion U.S., in unpaid taxes relating to its purchase of&#160;financial software vendor Navision in 2002, says the Denmark treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most tech companies avoid taxes by leaving foreign income overseas&#160;or by routing it through Irish or other low-taxation districts, and that&#8217;s happening in this case as well. But this case is not primarily, or at least initially about earnings. Rather, this is about Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition and transfer of the fundamental assets of Navision to low-corporate-tax regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat is seeking a comment from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#160;bought the company in 2002 for $1.5 billion.&#160;So far, all well and good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tricky part, according to Denmark, is that Microsoft then transferred its rights in what used to be Navision&#160;&#160;&#8211; the money-making assets &#8212; to an Irish subsidiary. And Denmark says that was done at a vastly unfair market value, which is illegal according to taxation rules, says local press agency Nyheder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, revenues from the software that former Navision and current Microsoft Business Solutions sells is on the order of a billion dollars a year. (It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft&#8217;s business software unit consists of more than just a renamed Navision.) That revenue has been routed through Ireland via a Microsoft subsidiary which is in turned owned by companies in Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands, according to Nyheder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three of those countries are well-known low-corporate income tax regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments in Europe and the U.S. are increasingly aware of the complex and obscure ways that international corporations, often U.S.-based, are using to avoid paying tax. This is just one of the first cases in which a European government is attempting to claim and obtain that lost tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;photo credit: su-lin via photopin cc&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, Enterprise, VentureBeat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) presented today the results from a Phase 3 study
demonstrating the immunogenicity, tolerability and safety of Prevnar 13&#174;
(Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein])in adults
infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The results were presented at
the 20th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in
Atlanta, Ga. 

These data support planned regulatory submissions seeking to include data on
HIV-infected immunocompromised adults in the Prevnar 13 label in the United
States, the European Union, and other countries around the world. 

In this study, HIV-infected individuals aged 18 years and older who had been
previously vaccinated with at least one dose of the conventional pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) received three doses of Prevnar 13 given six
months apart. An immune response to the serotypes in the vaccine was observed
after the first dose of Prevnar 13, and each of the two subsequent doses. The
clinical relevance of the level of response is not known. The most common local
reaction at the injection site was pain and the most common adverse event after
vaccination was headache. Adverse events were generally consistent with those
expected in this study population. 

"Modern advances in medicine have significantly improved HIV case management,
but the threat of infectious diseases to those with weakened immune systems is
still prevalent," said Dr. Raul Isturiz, Pfizer Medicine Development Group and
Scientific Affairs, Vaccines. "In fact, people living with HIV are more
susceptible to the potentially devastating effects of pneumococcal diseases." 

For adults with HIV, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease is
significantly higher and the potential of recurrent disease, most of which
represents re-infection, is more likely to occur in these individuals. 

"These data add to the compelling body of research for Prevnar 13," said Dr.
William Gruber, senior vice president, Pfizer Vaccine Clinical Research and
Development. "Pfizer is committed to providing information about this important
vaccine across all age groups, especially those with conditions that put them at
higher risk of pneumococcal infections, such as those with HIV infection." 

About the Study

Vaccine safety, tolerability and immunogenicity were evaluated in the Phase 3,
open-label, single-arm trial of 331 adults with HIV aged 18 years or older. All
participants had CD4 cell counts of 200 cells/mm3 or higher and had previously
received one or more doses of PPSV. Subjects were stratified equally into two
groups, those previously vaccinated with one dose of PPSV and those previously
vaccinated with two or more doses of PPSV. Participants received three doses of
Prevnar 13 at six months intervals. Local and systemic reactions and adverse
events were collected. 

Pneumococcal Disease

Pneumococcal disease (PD) is a group of illnesses caused by the bacterium
Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), also known as pneumococcus. It can
affect people of all ages, although older adults, young children and individuals
with certain chronic medical conditions are at heightened risk. PD is associated
with significant morbidity and mortality. Invasive manifestations of the disease
include bacteremia (bacteria in the blood) and meningitis (infection of the
tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord). 

U.S. Indication for Prevnar 13

* Prevnar 13 is a vaccine approved for the prevention of invasive disease caused
by 13 S. pneumoniae strains (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and
23F) in children 6 weeks through 17 years of age, and in children 6 weeks
through 5 years for the prevention of otitis media caused by 7 of the 13 strains
(4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) 
* Based upon immune responses to the vaccine, Prevnar 13 is also approved for
adults 50 years of age and older for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia
and invasive disease caused by the 13 vaccine strains 
* Prevnar 13 is not 100% effective and will only help protect against the 13
strains included in the vaccine 
* Effectiveness when given less than 5 years after a pneumococcal polysaccharide
vaccine is not known

Important Safety Information

* Prevnar 13 should not be given to anyone with a history of severe allergic
reaction to any component of Prevnar 13 or any diphtheria toxoid-containing
vaccine 
* Children and adults with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV infection,
leukemia) may have a reduced immune response 
* A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been observed in some
infants born prematurely 
* The most commonly reported serious adverse events in children were
bronchiolitis (an infection of the lungs) (0.9%), gastroenteritis (inflammation
of the stomach and small intestine) (0.9%), and pneumonia (0.9%) 
* In infants and toddlers, the most common side effects were tenderness, redness
or swelling at the injection site, irritability, decreased appetite, decreased
or increased sleep, and fever 
* In adults, immune responses to Prevnar 13 were reduced when given with
injected seasonal flu vaccine 
* In adults, the common side effects were pain, redness, or swelling at the
injection site, limitation of arm movement, fatigue, headache, muscle pain,
joint pain, decreased appetite, chills, or rash 
* Ask your health care provider about the risks and benefits of Prevnar 13. Only
a health care provider can decide if Prevnar 13 is right for your child

CALGARY, Alberta--(Business Wire)--
Walton Westphalia Development Corporation (the "Corporation") is pleased to
announce that it has participated, along with other companies in the Walton
Group of Companies (the "Walton Group"), in submitting a response (the
"Response") to a Request for Information ("RFI") from the United States General
Services Administration ("GSA") in relation to a new headquarters facility for
the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"). 

The Corporation owns an 85.6% undivided interest in a 310-acre parcel of land
(the "WWDC Property") located in Prince George`s County, Maryland. The WWDC
Property is part of a larger 479-acre assembly for mixed use development known
as the Westphalia Town Center. The remaining 169 acres of the Westphalia Town
Centre (the "Second Property") is held by a company that is managed by a member
of the Walton Group and is an affiliate of the Corporation. In its Response, the
Walton Group has indicated its interest in utilizing an approximately 51-acre
parcel of the Westphalia Town Center for the purposes of the proposed new
headquarters and campus for the FBI. Approximately 34 acres of the 51-acre
parcel lies within the WWDC Property, with the remaining 17 acres lying within
the Second Property. The Westphalia Town Center is approximately 21.7 kilometres
from the U.S. Capital Hill in Washington, D.C., which is the site of the White
House, the National Mall and the U.S. Capital Building. 

Under the RFI, the GSA is requesting that interested parties respond to indicate
their interest in providing land for, and developing, the proposed new FBI
headquarters and campus. As indicated above, the Response was filed on behalf of
the Corporation, the other holders of the Westphalia Town Center and the Walton
Group on March 4, 2013. Upon review of the responses, the GSA will issue a
formal Request for Proposal. It is anticipated that this Request for Proposal
will be issued prior to the end of 2013; however, there can be no guarantee that
this will not be extended into 2014. It is the current intention of the
Corporation to be involved in a response to that Request for Proposal with
respect to the portion of the WWDC Property referred to above. 

It is intended that the Corporation's participation in any transaction set out
in the Response would be solely the sale for cash of the relevant parcel from
the WWDC Property, with the development of the FBI facility being carried out by
another entity in the Walton Group either alone or with other third parties. The
independent members of the board of directors of the Corporation would be
involved in any determination of the purchase price to be paid to the
Corporation for such parcel. 

The Corporation sees this as a very good opportunity for the future development
of the WWDC Property, with significant benefits for Prince George`s County,
Maryland, the FBI and the GSA. However, it is anticipated that a significant
number of other interested parties will be filing responses to RFI and to the
eventual Request for Proposal referred to above. There can be no assurances that
any proposal submitted by the Corporation will be the proposal chosen by the GSA
or that a decision on a proposal by the GSA will not take several years to
complete. 

The Corporation will provide further information with respect to this process as
it develops and as the Corporation determines appropriate. 

The Corporation has been incorporated to provide investors with the unique
opportunity to participate in the returns available on the residential and
commercial development of the WWDC Property. The Corporation`s investment
objectives are to (a) preserve the capital investment of the purchasers in the
Units; (b) make annual cash distributions on the Units (comprised of payments of
interest and/or principal on the Offering Debentures and/or dividends or other
distributions on the Shares) beginning in June 2013 until the final distribution
of funds from the Project, which is anticipated to be in March 2019; and (c)
achieve a net internal rate of return of 15.0% on the $10.00 purchase price of
the Units from the cash distributions referred to in (b) above. 

The Corporation is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P., and development of
the WWDC Property is managed by Walton Development &amp; Management (USA), Inc.,
both of which are part of the Walton Group. 

Walton is a multinational group of real estate investment and development
companies headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. As one of North America`s
leading land-based real estate investment and development firms, our expertise
is in the research, acquisition, management and development of strategically
located land in major growth corridors throughout Canada and the U.S. Walton

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - BP (BP.L), which lost its first deal to drill for oil in Russia's Arctic to ExxonMobil (XOM.N), tried to negotiate a new deal with Russian state oil company Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and was again beaten to the punch by its U.S. rival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil won access to the Arctic Laptev Sea fields, where Rosneft's prospective reserves amount to 36 billion barrels of oil equivalent, under a deal last month, but three industry sources said BP had also been in talks with Rosneft to explore several blocks there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setbacks have become the norm for BP's activities in Russia, where it formed a joint venture, TNK-BP TNBP.MM, in 2003, by pooling its assets with those of four Soviet-born billionaires. It is currently selling out of that troubled venture to Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TNK-BP became a battle of wills between the British firm and the tycoons, who blocked BP's first attempt to form an Arctic exploration deal with Rosneft, a deal that BP executives had compared to the opening of a new North Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having negotiated that venture, which the tycoons said was in breach of the TNK-BP agreement, BP had to step aside and watch ExxonMobil take the spoils in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Rosneft has preferred ExxonMobil for the Laptev fields, even though BP will become a significant shareholder of Rosneft in April and name two directors to its board as part of the takeover of TNK-BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has even offered Dudley a seat on the board at state controlled Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, an influential ally of President Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP and Rosneft were unable to respond immediately to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP has been left a bystander as a rush for Arctic drilling deals got under way. Italy's Eni (ENI.MI) and Norway's Statoil (STL.OL) have also struck partnerships with Rosneft, trading technology and capital for access to tens of billions of barrels of prospective offshore Arctic reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $55 billion cash-and-share deal to sell TNK-BP to Rosneft, freeing BP from its fractious partnership and making it a 20 percent shareholder in Rosneft, appeared to promise a second shot at an exploration deal with Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sechin has said Rosneft would remain interested in upstream projects with the British major after the takeover, "which we will develop with BP as a partner, not as a shareholder".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, out of nearly 30 Arctic licence areas held by Rosneft, all but five have been parcelled out in upstream joint ventures with other companies, leaving slim pickings for BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of the Laptev blocks to ExxonMobil, coupled with concerns about BP's role in the integration of TNK-BP, prompted Dudley to fly to Moscow in the middle of February, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dudley came to Moscow to try to salvage the situation," one said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source said Dudley met Sechin, the architect of Rosneft's foreign upstream partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of the Laptev Sea acreage is an indication of the difficult path still ahead for Dudley, who as CEO of TNK-BP was driven out of Russia in a struggle for control of that venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INFLUENTIAL EXXON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sechin himself, at pains to indicate that the conflict-ridden days of TNK-BP would end with the takeover, has sought to show Rosneft can work with Dudley, who was nominated to its board by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a sign of the differing roles for BP and ExxonMobil at Rosneft, Vedomosti daily reported on Monday that as a state appointee, Dudley would have to vote by government directive on major issues, such as large deals and key appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, ExxonMobil's top financial official, Donald Humphreys, has been nominated as an independent and as such can decide for himself how to vote, Vedomosti said. The report could not be immediately confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, it is unclear what rights, if any, BP will have in managing an expanded Rosneft, while a senior ExxonMobil executive, Zeljko Runje, was plucked from the Moscow office and made a vice president at Rosneft at Sechin's behest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a few senior managers with ties to BP remain at TNK-BP after a purge of Western executives in a 2008 conflict between BP and its local partners, Sechin is unlikely to move them to Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He doesn't know any of them," one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARCTIC ACCESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft's sudden decision to expand its Arctic drilling venture with ExxonMobil may have been intended to protect its own access to Arctic reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It followed a media report citing a Ministry of Natural Resources presentation which suggested state companies' exploration plans were not aggressive enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry, responsible for licensing access to mineral reserves, was lobbying to expand access to Russia's offshore fields to private companies over protests from Rosneft and state gas company Gazprom (GAZP.MM), which had held exclusive rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources close to BP argue it will have an indirect share of Rosneft's upstream ventures with rivals through its 20 percent holding in Rosneft once the buyout of BP and its partners is finalised at the beginning of April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Will Waterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, March 4 (Reuters) - BP, which lost its first
deal to drill for oil in Russia's Arctic to ExxonMobil,
tried to negotiate a new deal with Russian state oil company
Rosneft and was again beaten to the punch by its U.S.
rival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil won access to the Arctic Laptev Sea fields, where
Rosneft's prospective reserves amount to 36 billion barrels of
oil equivalent, under a deal last month, but
three industry sources said BP had also been in talks with
Rosneft to explore several blocks there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setbacks have become the norm for BP's activities in Russia,
where it formed a joint venture, TNK-BP, in 2003, by
pooling its assets with those of four Soviet-born billionaires.
It is currently selling out of that troubled venture to Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TNK-BP became a battle of wills between the British firm and
the tycoons, who blocked BP's first attempt to form an Arctic
exploration deal with Rosneft, a deal that BP executives had
compared to the opening of a new North Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having negotiated that venture, which the tycoons said was
in breach of the TNK-BP agreement, BP had to step aside and
watch ExxonMobil take the spoils in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Rosneft has preferred ExxonMobil for the Laptev fields,
even though BP will become a significant shareholder of Rosneft
in April and name two directors to its board as part of the
takeover of TNK-BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has even offered Dudley a seat on the board
at state controlled Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, an
influential ally of President Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP and Rosneft were unable to respond immediately to a
request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP has been left a bystander as a rush for Arctic drilling
deals got under way. Italy's Eni and Norway's Statoil
 have also struck partnerships with Rosneft, trading
technology and capital for access to tens of billions of barrels
of prospective offshore Arctic reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $55 billion cash-and-share deal to sell TNK-BP to
Rosneft, freeing BP from its fractious partnership and making it
a 20 percent shareholder in Rosneft, appeared to promise a
second shot at an exploration deal with Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sechin has said Rosneft would remain interested in upstream
projects with the British major after the takeover, "which we
will develop with BP as a partner, not as a shareholder".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, out of nearly 30 Arctic licence areas held by Rosneft,
all but five have been parcelled out in upstream joint ventures
with other companies, leaving slim pickings for BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of the Laptev blocks to ExxonMobil, coupled with
concerns about BP's role in the integration of TNK-BP, prompted
Dudley to fly to Moscow in the middle of February, the sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dudley came to Moscow to try to salvage the situation," one
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source said Dudley met Sechin, the architect of
Rosneft's foreign upstream partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of the Laptev Sea acreage is an indication of the
difficult path still ahead for Dudley, who as CEO of TNK-BP was
driven out of Russia in a struggle for control of that venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INFLUENTIAL EXXON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sechin himself, at pains to indicate that the
conflict-ridden days of TNK-BP would end with the takeover, has
sought to show Rosneft can work with Dudley, who was nominated
to its board by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a sign of the differing roles for BP and ExxonMobil
at Rosneft, Vedomosti daily reported on Monday that as a state
appointee, Dudley would have to vote by government directive on
major issues, such as large deals and key appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, ExxonMobil's top financial official, Donald
Humphreys, has been nominated as an independent and as such can
decide for himself how to vote, Vedomosti said. The report could
not be immediately confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, it is unclear what rights, if any, BP will
have in managing an expanded Rosneft, while a senior ExxonMobil
executive, Zeljko Runje, was plucked from the Moscow office and
made a vice president at Rosneft at Sechin's behest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a few senior managers with ties to BP remain at
TNK-BP after a purge of Western executives in a 2008 conflict
between BP and its local partners, Sechin is unlikely to move
them to Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He doesn't know any of them," one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARCTIC ACCESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft's sudden decision to expand its Arctic drilling
venture with ExxonMobil may have been intended to protect its
own access to Arctic reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It followed a media report citing a Ministry of Natural
Resources presentation which suggested state companies'
exploration plans were not aggressive enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry, responsible for licensing access to mineral
reserves, was lobbying to expand access to Russia's offshore
fields to private companies over protests from Rosneft and state
gas company Gazprom, which had held exclusive rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources close to BP argue it will have an indirect share of
Rosneft's upstream ventures with rivals through its 20 percent
holding in Rosneft once the buyout of BP and its partners is
finalised at the beginning of April.&lt;/p&gt;

Members Fuel Their College Savings With Rewards from ExxonMobil
NEWARK, Del.--(Business Wire)--
Members of Sallie Mae`s Upromise program have earned $35 million in college
savings through cash back rewards from fuel purchases at Exxon and Mobil
stations since the program`s inception in 2001. 

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average U.S.
household spent nearly $3,000 on gasoline in 2012. Each time Upromise members
add gas to their tanks, they can add to their college savings or help pay Sallie
Mae student loans. 

Gene H. of Exeter, N.H., an active member in the Upromise program* who has saved
$8,400 for his son`s college tuition through Upromise, said, "I often stop for
gas at ExxonMobil to contribute to my savings. As expensive as gas is, it makes
me feel better every time, knowing that it`s going towards my son`s education.
The savings really add up. We are now paying for my son to attend college." 

Upromise members earn 1 cent per gallon** cash back at participating Exxon or
Mobil gas stations. To plan where to stop and save, members can download the
Upromise app to easily locate the station nearest them. Members who have the
Upromise MasterCard can save even more, up to 3 percent of their gas purchase as
well as 1 cent per gallon. 

Throughout the year, when families travel they can save for college through
Upromise, in addition to earning cash back for gas purchases. Through the
Upromise travel page, members can book their flight, hotel, rental car and more,
all through Upromise partners. Members can also earn cash back for college at
participating Upromise Dining restaurants locally during their travels. 

Upromise by Sallie Mae is free to join and members have earned more than $700
million in cash for college since 2001. Money earned from qualifying purchases
is accumulated in a Upromise account and can be invested in a tax-deferred 529
college savings plan, deposited into a Sallie Mae High-Yield Savings Account,
used to help pay down an eligible Sallie Mae student loan, or sent to the member
in the form of a check. 

*This is an active Upromise member. Individual savings depend on level of
spending. 

**Requires a total purchase of 20 gallons or more per calendar month, excludes
diesel and fleet purchases

offers a fully integrated imaging solution which allows participants to simply
fax or upload a receipt that is automatically linked to the transaction in the

by their configurability of the order of reimbursement, plan level rules, and
plan level settlement capabilities with employers.

of excellence in the worldwide prepaid and emerging payments industry. The
awards are presented annually by Paybefore, whose publications are the leading

Custom Software Development Firm Creates Safe Connection for Health Information
Databases
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
DataArt, a custom software development company that builds advanced solutions
for select industries, today announced the completion of its project with Next
of Kin Registry (NOKR), a free tool for daily emergencies and national
disasters, and Microsoft HealthVault, a web-based platform from Microsoft that
stores and maintains health and fitness information. The final product will
seamlessly and automatically connect national emergency contact updates between
the two databases. The integration creates a new industry standard of
connectivity and safety assurance for individuals and families, as their
information is accurately and automatically synced with emergency responders and
organizations nationally. 

Next of Kin Registry features over 200 million registered profiles and thousands
of emergency responders, ensuring that during emergencies, victims will be
accurately identified. The comprehensive NOKR database includes options for
individuals and families to register their personal contact information and for
emergency responders to access and search the database for contact information.
Microsoft HealthVault is well known for its ability to help people better manage
their health information, including their pharmacy subscription deadlines and
emergency contact information. Together, Microsoft HealthVault and NOKR sought
to create an even higher level of emergency readiness for families and
individuals by uniting their databases to seamlessly update when profiles are
changed from either portal. 

"We are extremely pleased in DataArt`s work to create a unified entry method of
national emergency contact information with our database and Microsoft
HealthVault," said Mark Cerney, NOKR president and founder. "Helping people
better prepare and connect in the event of an emergency is our mission at Next
of Kin Registry, and with the three of us working together, we`re helping not
only individuals, but also emergency responders to instill more confidence and
safety." 

Microsoft HealthVault put out a challenge call to the coder community in late
2012, asking for help connecting the two databases. DataArt was selected to
fulfil its connectivity mission with NOKR based on the custom software
development firm`s experience developing innovative solutions for the healthcare
industry, as well as its expertise in integrating solutions with existing
infrastructure and 3rd-party healthcare information vendors. 

"In stepping up to help the Next of Kin Registry connect their systems with
HealthVault, DataArt not only did something positive for the world, but they
demonstrated remarkable technical skill and commitment," said Sean Nolan,
Distinguished Engineer, Microsoft HealthVault. "DataArt quickly learned all the
nuances of HealthVault, and were able to deliver a high-quality solution in a
very reasonable timeframe. I would be happy to recommend their work to others
looking to connect with HealthVault and hope they`ll continue to bring their
talents to benefit the healthcare industry." 

DataArt also provides the organizations a level of industry security to perform
the connection, as it is compliant to HIPAA security and privacy regulations,
CCHIT certification and ONC standards, including health interoperability
standards. 

"Working with Microsoft HealthVault and Next of Kin Registry was truly a
privilege for DataArt," said Eugene Goland, President of DataArt. "We saw an
opportunity to elevate the connectivity of the two databases, and help the
community feel confident that their information is consistent and uniformly
updated in an event of an emergency."

WARSAW, Ind., March 4, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Symmetry Medical Inc. (NYSE:SMA), a leading global
source of innovative medical device solutions, including surgical instruments, orthopedic
implants, and sterilization cases and trays, announced today that its subsidiary, Symmetry
Surgical, is unveiling the newest component in its industry-leading Bookwalter portfolio, the
Bookwalter Self-Retaining Rotilt Ratchet, at the 60th Congress of the Association of periOperative
Registered Nurses (AORN) in San Diego.

The Bookwalter Self-Retaining Rotilt Ratchet combines the best features of past generations into a
single ratchet that provides multiple configurations and reliable retraction in any position.
Built through collaboration with surgeons and operating room professionals, the new low-profile
ratchet features locking tilt and locking rotation and is compatible with all legacy Bookwalter
Retractor System components.

Dr. John Bookwalter, surgeon inventor of the Bookwalter Retractor System, said, "By combining
rotation, tilt and self-retraction into a single ratchet, we've created a device that more closely
mimics the natural toe-in motion of handheld retractors while retaining the benefits of
table-mounted ring retractors. The Self-Retaining Rotilt Ratchet is the product of three decades

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, Mar 04 (Marketwire) -- 
La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company (www.ljpc.com) (OTCQB: LJPC) ("La Jolla"
and "Company"), a leader in the development of therapeutics targeting
galectin proteins (www.ljpc.com/technology-galectins.html), announced
today that the FDA Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products agreed
that the Company has sufficient data to support an investigational new
drug application ("IND") for LJPC-501 in patients with hepatorenal
syndrome ("HRS"), a life-threatening form of progressive renal failure in
patients with liver cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. 

    "We are pleased that the FDA has accepted our proposal for an IND to
pursue LJPC-501 in patients with HRS," said George Tidmarsh, M.D. Ph.D.,
President and Chief Executive Officer of La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company.
"HRS affects a large patient population with no approved therapies. We
look forward to initiating our Phase 1 study in the third quarter and
hope that LJPC-501 may someday help those suffering."

    LJPC-501 is a peptide agonist of the renin-angiotensin system that acts
to help the kidneys balance body fluids and electrolytes. Studies have
shown that LJPC-501 may improve renal function in patients with HRS. 

    HRS is a life-threatening form of progressive renal failure in patients
with liver cirrhosis. In these patients, the diseased liver secretes
vasodilator substances (e.g., nitric oxide and prostaglandins) into the
bloodstream that cause under-filling of blood vessels. This low blood
pressure state causes a reduction in blood flow to the kidneys. As a
means to restore systemic blood pressure, the kidneys induce both sodium
and water retention, which contribute to ascites, a major complication
associated with HRS.

    HRS is categorized into two types based on the rapidity of the
progression of renal failure as measured by serum creatinine. Type 1 HRS
is the more rapidly progressing type and is characterized by a 100%
increase in serum creatinine to &gt; 2.5 mg/dL within two weeks. Less than
10% survive hospitalization, and the median survival is only a few weeks.
Type 2 HRS is slower progressing, with serum creatinine rising gradually;
however, these patients can develop sudden renal failure and become
diagnosed with Type 1 HRS. Although ascites occurs in both Type 1 and
Type 2 HRS, recurrent ascites is a major clinical characteristic of Type
2 HRS patients, and median survival is only four to six months.

    Initiation of a Phase 1 trial is dependent on the Company first filing an
IND application with the FDA. A clinical study cannot begin before that
filing is accepted. La Jolla plans to file the IND during the first half
of this year.

to the development of medical treatments that significantly improve
outcomes in patients with life-threatening diseases. GCS-100, the
Company's lead product candidate, is a first-in-class inhibitor of

&lt;p&gt;European equities remain good value despite near-term risks, such as Italy's
political deadlock and sluggish economic growth, Goldman Sachs' equity
strategists write in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman team adds that investors looking for the best growth
opportunities should focus on the technology, household goods, healthcare and
automobile sectors, and avoid the telecoms and energy sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also backs insurance stocks over banking stocks in the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman upgrades the healthcare and technology sectors to "overweight" from
"neutral", highlighting healthcare stocks such as Novo Nordisk, Roche
 and Shire among its top picks, and singles out Aveva,
CapGemini, Ericsson and SAP as its top technology
stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also raises its stance on the personal care and household goods
sector to "overweight" from "neutral", favouring stocks such as British American
Tobacco, L'Oreal and Richemont while maintaining an
"overweight" rating on the insurance sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman takes "underweight" positions on the European telecoms, oil and gas
and retail sectors, highlighting UK retailer Sainsbury as a "sell".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to avoid domestic European consumer exposure given high
unemployment, weakness in wage growth, declining real disposal income and fiscal
austerity in most of Europe," writes Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman says that, although there is good value in European stock markets,
investors should expect short-term volatility, arguing that the main impact of a
pledge last year by European Central Bank head Mario Draghi to protect the euro
currency has already been factored in by investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect a modest recovery in global growth this year accelerating into
2014. European equities in our view remain good value, especially versus bonds,"
writes Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But we are also cognisant that while a fall in the risk premium is likely
to be a longer term trend, there might be short-term volatility. First, the risk
premium has already fallen substantially post Draghi's comments in the summer in
support of peripheral sovereign debt. This limits room for further falls in the
near term," it adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Second, growth remains weak in Europe and it remains unbalanced with the
peripheral euro area still in deep recession and likely to continue to suffer
from political risk because of this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters messaging rm://sudip.kargupta.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Anti-trust chief to announce fine for software giant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Fine relates to failure to provide browser choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Hefty penalty expected after multiple EU run-ins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, March 6 (Reuters) - European Union anti-trust
regulators are set to hit Microsoft with a hefty fine
on Wednesday for breaking a promise to offer consumers using its
Windows system a choice of rival Internet browsers, people
familiar with the case said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU anti-trust chief Joaquin Almunia is expected to use the
fine - which could run into hundreds of millions of euros - to
set an example after the U.S. software giant became the first
company to break a promise made to end an anti-trust probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almunia will announce his decision at 1130 GMT, the sources
said. Reuters reported last week that EU regulators would fine
Microsoft before the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU rules mean the company could be penalised $7.4 billion or
10 percent of its fiscal 2012 revenues although regulators are
not expected to levy such a high fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fines relate to an anti-trust battle in Europe more than
a decade ago. In order to avoid a penalty then, Microsoft
promised to offer European consumers a choice of rival browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU anti-trust regulators said this did not happen for a
period during February 2011 and July 2012, a lapse Microsoft
blamed on a technical error. It has said it since tightened
internal procedures to avoid a repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has already fined Microsoft 1.6
billion euros ($2.1 billion) to date for not providing data at
fair prices to rivals and for tying its media player to its
operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest lapse did not escape the notice of Microsoft's
board, which cut the bonus of chief executive Steve Ballmer last
year, partly because of the Windows division's failure to
provide a browser choice screen as required by the European
Commission, according to an annual proxy filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the European Commission and Microsoft declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's share of the European browser market has roughly
halved since 2008 to 24 percent in January, below the 35 percent
held by Google's Chrome and Mozilla's 29 percent share,
according to Web traffic analysis company StatCounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Industry Poised to Meet Emerging Markets Growth, IHS CERAWeek Conference Told
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
New investment -- including a world-scale ethylene steam cracker proposed by
ExxonMobil -- is expanding the U.S. petrochemical industry`s position as a
global producer, Steve Pryor, president of ExxonMobil Chemical Company, said in
a speech at the IHS CERAWeek 2013 conference today. 

"For the first time in more than a decade, major capacity additions have been
announced that convert ethane, a natural gas liquid, to ethylene, the largest
petrochemical building block," Pryor said. He estimated the announced additions
are equivalent to six to eight new world-scale steam crackers. 

"While all announced projects may not materialize, the U.S. industry is clearly
poised to expand its position as a leading petrochemical producer. With 85
percent of global demand growth projected to occur in emerging markets, this is
great news for U.S. exports," Pryor said. 

"ExxonMobil, as the largest U.S. chemical manufacturer and natural gas producer,
is developing a unique project that builds on our proven integration model,"
Pryor said. "It will be sustained over the ups and downs of the business cycle
by advantages in integration, scale and premium products." 

ExxonMobil Chemical has filed permit applications for a multibillion-dollar
expansion at its Baytown, Texas, site, already the country`s largest integrated
refining-chemical producing site. The project will convert ethylene from a new
world-scale steam cracker to premium polyethylene products to serve growing
markets around the world. Feedstock and energy supplies will be coordinated with
ExxonMobil`s upstream business. 

"The project will be a win-win for ExxonMobil and Texas, a pro-business state
which has attracted more ExxonMobil investment than anywhere in the country, and
where we are the state`s largest taxpayer," Pryor said. 

The benefits for the Greater Houston area are significant and will grow if the
project receives the necessary permits and proceeds to the construction phase.
Pryor estimated that the project would provide 10,000 jobs at the peak of
construction. The proposed project would also have a multiplier effect and
create an additional 3,800 other jobs in the area and increase regional economic
activity by $870 million per year, he added. 

Pryor said, "Just five years ago, American chemical production was in steady
decline due largely to the rising price of natural gas. The U.S. was on the
verge of becoming a net chemical importer. Growing supplies of shale gas and gas
liquids have changed all that. North American chemical manufacturers now have a
major cost advantage over competitors around the world that rely on more
expensive, oil-based feedstocks. This has boosted profitability and enabled the
industry to regain its position as America`s largest exporter." 

Statements relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are
forward-looking statements. Actual results, including project plans, costs,
timing, capacities, and economic impacts, could differ materially due to factors
including: changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions
affecting the oil, gas and petrochemical industries, including the scope and
duration of economic recessions; changes in law or government regulation,
including tax and environmental requirements; the outcome of commercial
negotiations; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other factors
discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the
"Investors" section of our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2012 Form
10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date. The
term "project" as used in this release does not necessarily have the same
meaning as under SEC Rule 13q-1 relating to government payment reporting.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded four classes and affirmed 16 classes of JP Morgan
Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. Series 2005-LDP1 (JPMCC 2005-LDP1)
commercial mortgage pass-through certificates due to an increase in Fitch
expected losses on the pool. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the
end of this press release. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Fitch modeled losses of 6.2% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the
original pool balance total 5.5%, including losses already incurred. The pool
has experienced $57.9 million (2% of the original pool balance) in realized
losses to date. Fitch has designated 33 loans (17.1%) as Fitch Loans of Concern,
which includes eight specially serviced assets (3.9%). 

As of the February 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal
balance has been reduced by 43.6% to $1.62 billion from $2.88 billion at
issuance. Per the servicer reporting, 15 loans (7.6% of the pool) are defeased.
Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes J through NR. 

The largest contributor to expected losses is the specially-serviced
Independence Plaza loan (1.2% of the pool), which is secured by a 252,000 sf
retail shopping center located in Hamilton Township, NJ. The property lost its
grocery anchor to bankruptcy in 2011. Further, T.J. Maxx vacated at its lease
maturity in January 2013. The loan was transferred to special servicing in March
2010 due to missed debt service payments; a foreclosure action was commenced in
October 2010 and is still ongoing. 

The next largest contributor to expected losses is the Preston Center Pavilion &amp;
Square loan (2.5%), which is secured by a 233,000 sf retail center located in
Dallas, TX. While the Dec. 31, 2012 rent roll reported occupancy of 95%; it was
expected to drop to at least 74% in the first half of 2013 significantly
impacting property cash flow. As part of a lease renewal, the largest tenant is
expected to downsize its space by 19,000 sf while the third largest tenant
(31,000 sf) vacated its space at lease expiration in January 2013. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

The ratings of the investment grade classes are expected to remain stable,
although value declines and/or prolonged workouts on the specially serviced
loans may lead to further downgrades. The distressed classes (those rated below
'B') are expected to be subject to further downgrades as losses are realized.
The 'B' rated class, may be subject to further rating actions should realized
losses be greater or less than Fitch's expectations. 

Fitch downgrades the following classes and assigns or revises Rating Outlooks as
indicated: 

--$54 million class D to 'BBBsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook to Stable from Negative;
--$28.8 million class E to 'BBsf' from 'BBB-sf'; Outlook to Stable from
Negative;
--$32.4 million class H to 'CCsf' from 'CCCsf'; RE 0%;
--$10.8 million class J to 'Csf' from 'CCsf'; RE 0%. 

Fitch affirms the following classes and assigns REs as indicated: 

--$28.8 million class G at 'CCCsf'; RE 30%. 

Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated: 

--$234.9 million class A-1A at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$76 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$157.5 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$601.5 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$36 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$94.3 million class A-J at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$100 million class A-JFL at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$68.4 million class B at 'AAsf', Outlook Stable;
--$25.2 million class C at 'Asf', Outlook Stable;
--$46.8 million class F at 'Bsf', Outlook Negative;
--$14.4 million class K at 'Csf', RE 0%;
--$10.8 million class L at 'Csf', RE 0%;
--$3.3 million class M at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
--$0 class N at 'Dsf', RE 0%;
--$0 class P at 'Dsf', RE 0%. 

Fitch previously withdrew the ratings on the interest-only class X-1 and X-2
certificates.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - MF Global MFGLQ.PK and its creditors have resolved a dispute with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) over the value of intercompany claims within the bankrupt brokerage's estate, eliminating what could have been a sticking point in effecting MF Global's creditor repayment plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of the settlement, a result of court-ordered mediation, is essentially to enhance JPMorgan's recovery, according to a statement on Tuesday from Louis Freeh, the trustee liquidating the broker's estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, MF's parent entity will subordinate $275 million of its $1.887 billion claim against MF Global's finance unit below JPMorgan's $1.2 billion claim against the estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remained unclear exactly how much that will serve to increase the bank's projected recoveries. Court filings containing more detail were expected to be entered "shortly" in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the current edition of the plan, proposed by a group of MF Global's hedge fund creditors with Freeh's cooperation, unsecured creditors of MF's parent would recover between 13.4 cents and 39 cents on the dollar. Creditors of its finance unit would receive between 14.7 cents and 34 cents on the dollar. It is unclear how the settlement will impact those figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The settlement will result in a slightly modified distribution range for unsecured creditors," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former trader customers of the Jon Corzine-led brokerage are projected to recover all of their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has claims against both the MF parent and its finance unit, is currently projected to recoup up to 73 cents on the dollar, but that figure could increase as a result of Tuesday's settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The settlement is in the best interest of creditors as it removes a major hurdle to confirmation of the plan," Freeh, the former FBI chief, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's claim is associated with the revolving credit facility on which it served as agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creditors have until March 25 to vote on the plan, after which it must go before a U.S. bankruptcy judge for a final approval hearing, currently scheduled for April 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re MF Global Holdings Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-15059.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Nick Brown; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

SAN RAMON, Calif., March 5, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ArmaninoLLP,
(www.amllp.com/microsoft-dynamics
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10024018=1=www.amllp.com%2Fmicrosoft-dynamics=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amllp.com%2Fmicrosoft-dynamics
) the 8th largest Microsoft Dynamics Partner in the U.S. and a provider of integrated audit, tax,
consulting services and technology, today released Revenue Management for High Tech Industries on
Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, a software application designed to support complex revenue
recognition standards.

The new release adds to Armanino's High Tech Industries for Dynamics AX Certified for Microsoft
Dynamics (CfMD) suite of industry modules, which include a number of pre-configured add-ons for
High Tech companies. Microsoft certified the Revenue Management module through a process that
includes rigorous testing, customer references, and other objective third-party verifications that
prove usability and effectiveness.

Armanino's Revenue Management module is an integrated application that provides a comprehensive
solution for this crucial accounting function for software companies, electronics and complex
equipment manufacturers, which have challenging revenue recognition requirements. In recent years,
standard setters have promulgated a series of rulings that have been difficult for high tech
companies to adhere to with existing business applications. Most recently, the revenue recognition
standards formerly known as SOP 97-2, EITF 08-01, and EITF 09-03 were formalized under the
Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14.

Armanino developed this new module to address these changes, allowing companies to abandon less
effective methods for making revenue recognition calculations with this new module that helps
clients meet the new standards, says Armanino Partner Chris Moore.

"Many companies have had to turn to applications such as Excel with its inherent limitations
around data control and auditability," Moore says. "But best-in-class companies can now deploy
this integrated ERP module to streamline and automate these functions and greatly reduce errors."

Technology companies often sell multi-element bundles that must be accounted for as independent
accounting units with revenue carve-outs, re-allocations and deferrals. The Armanino solution
addresses these and other requirements of companies that sell arrangements that include hardware
and software elements, as well as post-contract support and other professional services.

"We are excited to extend the value of our clients' ERP platforms and welcome the opportunity to
expand into new markets with this release on Dynamics AX 2012 R2," says Moore. "With extensions
like Revenue Management for High Tech Industry certified by Microsoft, our customers can be
confident that they're adding effective business process support without having to integrate a
separate application."

Journyx Accountlink for Microsoft Dynamics Allows for Integration with
Microsoft`s Enterprise Accounting Software
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Journyx today announces that W Squared is adding Journyx Timesheet to its
comprehensive solution to clients, coupled with Microsoft Dynamics GP and ADP.
Journyx Accountlink for Microsoft Dynamics allows Journyx Timesheet to
seamlessly integrate with the Dynamics family of products. 

W Squared provides business process outsourcing solutions including finance and
accounting, technology, human resources and payroll, healthcare implementation,
procurement and laboratory systems. W Squared trusts Microsoft Dynamics GP for
accounting and ADP for payroll, but needed a time tracking system that not only
integrated with Dynamics GP and ADP, but also allowed W Squared to make
customizations for some rather complex business processes. They found the
perfect solution with Journyx. 

"We needed time tracking data to be used for billing clients, and also wanted
this information to show which projects are profitable and which aren`t," said
Moreen Logsdon, Vice President of Enterprise Business Solutions for W Squared.
"We knew that customization around complex business processes would be
necessary, since the integration with each business system requires unique
rules. Journyx was able to make some major customizations to their system to
meet our needs." 

Journyx Accountlink for Microsoft Dynamics provides the following features:

* Integrates seamlessly with Dynamics GP, SL, AX and NAV 
* Eliminates common accounting problems such as dual entries and formatting
errors 
* Customized timesheet actions with flexible approval paths and data validation 
* Bi-directional data transfer options to access and utilize information in the
most convenient manner for your business requirements 
* Automated processes to guarantee consistency and accuracy of collected data 
* Well-tested project accounting interface to guarantee that data is always
accessible so your projects are on time and under budget

Many of W Squared`s clients are high-profile healthcare clients with nurses and
physicians working at offsite locations. These healthcare professionals enter
their time into Journyx where the data goes through a multi-level approval
process to ensure accuracy of the data which is then used for billing. A final
requirement of W Squared`s was that Journyx be rolled out to a large team of 800
employees very quickly with little time for training. 

"Journyx worked hard to get our team up and running quickly," said Logsdon. "The
employees were able to learn the system in a short time as it`s very intuitive.
It was an easy transition for us." 

W Squared plans to continue rolling out Journyx to more internal groups, as well
as offering it as part of their comprehensive solution to clients, coupled with
Microsoft Dynamics GP and ADP. The trio of these systems offers a complete and
unbeatable solution to W Squared clients.

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Predixion Software has been recognized as a winner of the Microsoft Health Users
Group (HUG) 2013 Innovation Award in the Innovation in Electronic Medical Record
Optimization category. The announcement was made at the HIMSS13 Annual
Conference &amp; Exhibition where Predixion is demonstrating Predixion Readmission
Insight in Microsoft`s booth #1127. 

A major healthcare provider was recognized for its implementation of Predixion
Readmission Insight, a preventable readmission healthcare solution designed in
collaboration with provider organizations and built on Predixion`s predictive
analytics platform that is fully integrated with Microsoft BI capabilities.
Predixion Readmission Insight is helping identify patients at risk of
readmission before they leave the hospital and allows for more tailored care to
ensure a more successful outcome. Predixion models have accurately predicted up
to 86 percent of readmissions, resulting in better and faster decision making,
improved patient outcomes, and reduced healthcare costs and readmission
penalties. 

"We are delighted to be recognized with an Innovation Award for our work in
preventable hospital readmissions," said Predixion co-founder and CEO Simon
Arkell. "We are focused on delivering advanced, easy-to-use predictive analytics
solutions for the Microsoft BI platform. This `last mile of analytics` puts
actionable predictions into the hands of non-technical information workers
enabling predictive analytics to cross over into mainstream business
applications and uses." 

About Predixion Enterprise Insight

Predixion has created a world class predictive platform for big data. Predixion
Insight is natively integrated with the Microsoft BI stack, leverages Apache
Mahout Algorithm libraries and is fully integrated with Microsoft SQL Server&#174;,
Greenplum and Hadoop Hive, with other analytic platforms on the way. An advanced
deployment framework was designed to simplify the process of sharing models
across an enterprise, automate predictions directly from source data to line of
business applications and Predixion`s own thin client app for PCs and tablets,
and squeeze complexity out of the end user experience, resulting in self-service
predictive analytics. 

"The 2013 Microsoft HUG Innovation Awards recognizes health organizations that
are using technology to improve patient care and engagement, streamline
processes and boost performance, as well as enable more informed decisions about
health," said Steve Aylward, general manager of U.S. Commercial Health and Life
Sciences, Microsoft. "Each of this year`s winners clearly demonstrate a
breakthrough in technology and made a significant impact on business processes,
costs, and the quality of patient care." 

In its 16th year, the Microsoft Health Users Group Innovation Awards program
honors health organizations and independent software vendors and systems
integrators who create the most impactful and innovative health solutions with
Microsoft-based products. This year`s winners were honored at an awards ceremony
March 3 at the HIMSS Conference.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - China is willing to join Exxon Mobil in a giant Iraqi oilfield project, a top executive said on Tuesday, which could see Beijing come to dominate Iraq's oilfields and help the U.S. major mend fences with Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Exxon (XOM.N) offered to sell its stake in the southern Iraq West Qurna-1 oilfield after fighting with Baghdad over contracts it has signed with autonomous Kurdistan in the north, deals the central government rejects as illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of December, the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) had emerged as the frontrunner to take over Exxon's 60 percent share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is working to keep the U.S. oil giant on side, industry sources say, offering much sweeter terms at West Qurna-1 - a $50 billion investment project and a greater potential prize than the Kurdish blocks if Baghdad structures the contract closer to the more lucrative Kurdish model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon is setting up a range of options, the sources say, including the possibility of selling just part of its 60 percent stake in West Qurna-1 to PetroChina (0857.HK) (601857.SS), the listed arm of CNPC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiang Jiemin, PetroChina's Chairman, told Reuters that China's largest oil and gas producer is prepared to team up with Exxon at the field, now pumping in excess of 400,000 barrels per day (bpd).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are willing to jointly develop the project with Exxon Mobil. Exxon Mobil welcomed our participation and the Iraqi government also supports us joining the development," Jiang said on the sidelines of the annual parliamentary session in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said PetroChina would "thoroughly evaluate the project" and make an investment decision at an "appropriate" time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The asset value of the whole project is massive, but near-term capital spending required is not that huge," said Jiang, adding that parties have yet to discuss the size of stakes to be shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with PetroChina operations in Iraq said the two companies were discussing a deal that would enable Exxon to retain operator status at the oilfield, where Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) is minority partner with 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNPC made a play for Exxon's full stake in West Qurna-1 at the end of last year, but the U.S. company was not satisfied with the bid, according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if PetroChina is aware of Baghdad trying to keep Exxon in the project, Jiang said: "Iraq has its own bottom lines. If Exxon continues with its new projects in the Kurdistan region, its operations in Iraq will face some difficulties".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon was the first major oil company to sign agreements with the government of the autonomous Kurdistan region, a move that increased tension between Baghdad and the Kurds in a long-running dispute over oil, territory and political autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad says any deals signed with Kurdistan are illegal, but the government of Kurdistan says the constitution allows it to sign oil agreement without permission from the central government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PetroChina, the first foreign oil company to sign an oil service deal in Iraq after the toppling of its former president Saddam Hussein, already has a formidable position in Iraq's prized southern oilfields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is in charge at Halfaya and partners BP (BP.L) at Rumaila, Iraq's biggest oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq has the world's fourth largest oil reserves and wants to at least double it production in the next few years. Now pumping just over 3 million bpd, it ranks as the second biggest producer behind Saudi Arabia in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Chen Aizhu; Editing by Peg Mackey and William Hardy)&lt;/p&gt;

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/zcg7k8/ibm_software) has announced
the addition of Wintergreen Research, Inc's new report "IBM Software Innovation:
Market Shares, Strategies, and Forecasts, Worldwide, 2013 to 2019" to their
offering. 

WinterGreen Research announces that it has published a new study IBM Software
Innovation Market Shares, Strategy, and Forecasts, Worldwide, 2013 to 2019.
Worldwide markets are poised to achieve continuing growth as the enterprise
seeks to develop new products in response to changing technology and changing
market conditions. 

IBM concentrates on building end to end systems that are able to adapt of market
changes. While this may make the IBM product set seem overly heavy in the short
run, in the long run, this is of enormous value to clients as proved by the
company market leading position in innovation software. 

The enterprise uses software innovation to transition to higher quality
automated process, middleware to support smarter computing, and cloud computing
in an era of smart phones. IBM is profiled as the leader in this software
innovation initiative. The ability to federate and spread workloads securely
between private and public clouds is "hybrid cloud computing." One mission of
software innovation is to lead customers on the journey to hybrid cloud
computing. 

Physical convergence with digital representations of the physical world is
creating complexity. Communication between machine to machine has caused an
inflection point for the need for a quickened pace for the management and design
of assets with software representing a significant aspect of innovation
implementation. 

Software is able to support innovation in enterprise markets because software is
so much easier to change than physical devices. 

Some software is better than other software in supporting innovation. Simple
software changes challenge the best of IT departments in many cases, just for
software that is used to run the business. For software used to create entire
new business initiatives, innovation software is needed. Innovation software is
used to handle the complexity of supporting a current market offering while
tailoring a new modality. 

Software for innovation represents a category distinct from software for
existing applications, middleware for existing applications, and upgrades to
existing applications. Software for Innovation is that software that helps
enterprises grow existing markets. For that reason, it is of interest to the
line of business more than to the IT department. 

Innovation is needed by an enterprise to gain competitive advantage and respond
to change in markets. Software used to effect business change, to make
innovation happen is fundamentally different from established applications
software and the infrastructure that supports those applications. Software for
Innovation is most often tuned to supporting any kind of analytics, to helping
the line of business change the fundamental nature of the business as product
cycles create new market opportunity that demands attention. 

Good businesses learn to listen to clients. They interview customers and try to
be responsive to customers. Customers, clients create fickle markets, demanding
the newest and best in an inevitable manner. Enabling client capabilities as the
foundation of business process speaks to the very heart of innovation. A lot of
support is needed to enable enterprise IT departments to adapt existing systems
to new challenges. 

Software for innovation market driving forces relate to the need to adapt to
market changes on an ongoing basis. People have difficulty with change; change
is hard. 

The worldwide enterprise software market at $295 billion showed broad growth in
2012. Growth was achieved as companies positioned to garner a presence in real
time computing, adapt to the Internet as a channel, and embrace mobile devices
as adjuncts to business process. Worldwide software revenue increased 8.9
percent in 2012. Software for innovation was a $73.4 billion sub-segment of the
overall software market. 

This is an entirely new category of software. As WinterGreen Research prepares
to break out its software industry index worldwide, studies define the segments
of the software industry more clearly. One of the things that jumps out of a
close look at all the software industry segments worldwide is the software for
innovation that is used primarily by the line of business to respond to the need
for growth initiatives. This software goes beyond managing the existing business
with implementation of automated process to giving the line of business tools
that support growth initiatives. 

Software for innovation markets at $73.4 billion in 2012 are anticipated to
reach $196.4 billion by 2019. Growth is a result of enterprise need to innovate
to grow. It is not enough to maintain a static position in a market, nimble
competitors steal market share away if innovation is not pursued. Innovation
provides competitive advantage and protection of market position.

Session Border Controllers Serve Critical Role in Enabling and Activating
Microsoft Lync within Enterprise SIP Networks 

Key Takeaways:

* Sonus SBC 1000 and Sonus SBC 2000 Session Border Controllers receive Microsoft
Lync 2013 qualification 
* As enterprise Unified Communications grows, session border controllers will be
critical in helping companies realize interoperability, service quality and
security required when implementing multi-vendor Internet Protocol networks 
* Survivable branch appliance capabilities of the SBC 1000 and SBC 2000 for
Microsoft Lync ensure business continuity in enterprise branch offices if the
wide area network fails 
* The Sonus SBC portfolio provides the industry`s broadest end-to-end SBC
solution, delivering Session Initiation Protocol-enabled applications from the
enterprise headquarters to the branch office

WESTFORD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Sonus Networks, Inc. (Nasdaq: SONS), a global leader in SIP communications,
today announced that the Sonus SBC 1000 and Sonus SBC 2000 are Microsoft Lync
2013 qualified for session border controller (SBC) and survivable branch
appliance (SBA) deployments. 

A Microsoft Gold Communications Partner, Sonus helps enterprises optimize
Microsoft Lync voice deployments by securing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
trunking services at the network border and providing a more seamless flow of
SIP-based multi-vendor media for Unified Communications (UC) deployments. Access
to UC applications such as instant messaging (IM), collaboration, conferencing
and voice empowers enterprises to communicate in the most efficient and
cost-effective ways - whenever and wherever. 

The Sonus portfolio provides the industry`s only end-to-end SBC solution
delivering SIP-enabled applications from the enterprise headquarters to the
branch office. SBCs are the critical access technology to enable customers to
unify disparate UC architectures across an enterprise. 

According to the January 2013 Webtorials study, "Enterprises Place 2013 Unified
Communications Bets: How Many Horses in This Race?" there is considerable
enterprise awareness and interest in Microsoft Lync as a platform for UC and
enterprise voice. A full 58 percent of those surveyed already plan to deploy
Microsoft for IM and presence, and it appears to have the inside track with many
buyers when it comes to more advanced UC functions like Web meetings, desktop
sharing and advanced directory services. 

A recent Nemertes Research report, "Microsoft Lync Reality Check," indicated
that most companies are implementing a gradual transition strategy to Microsoft
Lync voice, starting small and either augmenting existing telephony systems or
gradually migrating those groups most well suited to a softphone-centric working
model. For this reason, it is critical that different networks and different
network elements from a variety of vendors can communicate effectively with one
another. Sonus SBCs are designed and tested to provide interoperability with
legacy equipment (TDM, H.323), multiple SIP vendors and standards, application
providers and international standards. 

With the industry`s broadest portfolio of Microsoft Lync qualified SBCs, Sonus
gives enterprises and service providers more choices to communicate more
effectively, more efficiently and more intelligently. The award winning SBC 1000
and SBC 2000 are designed to help medium sized businesses and branch offices
safely and cost-effectively embrace new SIP-based communications. These Sonus
SBCs deliver built-in media transcoding, network security (such as encryption,
authentication and denial of service (DoS) protection), robust SIP interworking,
intelligent call routing and multi-vendor interoperability. 

Quotes:

"Microsoft Lync is making in-roads in the enterprise IP telephony market, with
11.2 percent of companies implementing or planning to implement it as a PBX
replacement by the end of 2013, more than double the adoption rate of a year
ago. With the release of Lync 2013, we expect that Microsoft will continue to
capture an increasing percentage of telephony endpoints," said Irwin Lazar, vice
president and service director, Nemertes Research. "However, the transition to
Lync will take some time; and IT professionals express growing interest in
leveraging session border controllers and session management to ease Lync
telephony migrations." 

"We are very proud to have received this qualification," states David Tipping,
vice president and general manager, SBC Business Unit, Sonus. "As the Unified
Communications functions provided by Microsoft Lync are increasingly utilized in
mission-critical applications, the survivable branch application of the Sonus
SBC 1000 and SBC 2000 provides essential capabilities for enterprises to ensure
that their intra-branch communications and business-continuity are maintained,
even in the event of a wide area network failure." 

Other Facts:

* Sonus is positioned in the Leaders quadrant of the "Magic Quadrant for Session
Border Controllers," published October 9, 2012 by Gartner, Inc. 
* The SBC 1000 and SBC 2000 have been performance verified by Miercom. To access

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Melissa Akin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, March 4 (Reuters) - BP, which lost its first
deal to drill for oil in Russia's Arctic to ExxonMobil,
tried to negotiate a new deal with Russian state oil company
Rosneft and was again beaten to the punch by its U.S.
rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil won access to the Arctic Laptev Sea fields, where
Rosneft's prospective reserves amount to 36 billion barrels of
oil equivalent, under a deal last month, but
three industry sources said BP had also been in talks with
Rosneft to explore several blocks there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setbacks have become the norm for BP's activities in Russia,
where it formed a joint venture, TNK-BP, in 2003, by
pooling its assets with those of four Soviet-born billionaires.
It is currently selling out of that troubled venture to Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TNK-BP became a battle of wills between the British firm and
the tycoons, who blocked BP's first attempt to form an Arctic
exploration deal with Rosneft, a deal that BP executives had
compared to the opening of a new North Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having negotiated that venture, which the tycoons said was
in breach of the TNK-BP agreement, BP had to step aside and
watch ExxonMobil take the spoils in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Rosneft has preferred ExxonMobil for the Laptev fields,
even though BP will become a significant shareholder of Rosneft
in April and name two directors to its board as part of the
takeover of TNK-BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has even offered Dudley a seat on the board
at state controlled Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, an
influential ally of President Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP and Rosneft were unable to respond immediately to a
request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP has been left a bystander as a rush for Arctic drilling
deals got under way. Italy's Eni and Norway's Statoil
 have also struck partnerships with Rosneft, trading
technology and capital for access to tens of billions of barrels
of prospective offshore Arctic reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $55 billion cash-and-share deal to sell TNK-BP to
Rosneft, freeing BP from its fractious partnership and making it
a 20 percent shareholder in Rosneft, appeared to promise a
second shot at an exploration deal with Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sechin has said Rosneft would remain interested in upstream
projects with the British major after the takeover, "which we
will develop with BP as a partner, not as a shareholder".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, out of nearly 30 Arctic licence areas held by Rosneft,
all but five have been parcelled out in upstream joint ventures
with other companies, leaving slim pickings for BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of the Laptev blocks to ExxonMobil, coupled with
concerns about BP's role in the integration of TNK-BP, prompted
Dudley to fly to Moscow in the middle of February, the sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dudley came to Moscow to try to salvage the situation," one
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source said Dudley met Sechin, the architect of
Rosneft's foreign upstream partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of the Laptev Sea acreage is an indication of the
difficult path still ahead for Dudley, who as CEO of TNK-BP was
driven out of Russia in a struggle for control of that venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INFLUENTIAL EXXON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sechin himself, at pains to indicate that the
conflict-ridden days of TNK-BP would end with the takeover, has
sought to show Rosneft can work with Dudley, who was nominated
to its board by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a sign of the differing roles for BP and ExxonMobil
at Rosneft, Vedomosti daily reported on Monday that as a state
appointee, Dudley would have to vote by government directive on
major issues, such as large deals and key appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, ExxonMobil's top financial official, Donald
Humphreys, has been nominated as an independent and as such can
decide for himself how to vote, Vedomosti said. The report could
not be immediately confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, it is unclear what rights, if any, BP will
have in managing an expanded Rosneft, while a senior ExxonMobil
executive, Zeljko Runje, was plucked from the Moscow office and
made a vice president at Rosneft at Sechin's behest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a few senior managers with ties to BP remain at
TNK-BP after a purge of Western executives in a 2008 conflict
between BP and its local partners, Sechin is unlikely to move
them to Rosneft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He doesn't know any of them," one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARCTIC ACCESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft's sudden decision to expand its Arctic drilling
venture with ExxonMobil may have been intended to protect its
own access to Arctic reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It followed a media report citing a Ministry of Natural
Resources presentation which suggested state companies'
exploration plans were not aggressive enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry, responsible for licensing access to mineral
reserves, was lobbying to expand access to Russia's offshore
fields to private companies over protests from Rosneft and state
gas company Gazprom, which had held exclusive rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources close to BP argue it will have an indirect share of
Rosneft's upstream ventures with rivals through its 20 percent
holding in Rosneft once the buyout of BP and its partners is
finalised at the beginning of April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A senate committee, which began an inquiry into JPMorgan's (JPM.N) multi-billion dollar trading loss last year, is expected to fault certain executives in its report for allowing the bank to build bets without fully warning regulators and investors, the New York Times reported, citing people briefed on the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations could ask Douglas Braunstein, who was chief financial officer at the time of the losses, and other senior executives to testify at a hearing this month, the people told the paper. The Senate committee's report is due to be released on March 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has been cooperating with the investigation and discussed the findings with the subcommittee, declined to comment to the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein and other bank executives have not been accused of any wrongdoing, and he is not the focus of a separate law enforcement investigation into the trading loss, according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan lost $6 billion in trading bets that came from a group called the Chief Investment Office (CIO), which managed risk for the bank and invested deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CIO group in London took large bets on derivatives, with one trader taking big enough positions to be called "the London Whale."

&lt;p&gt;* First round bids due in early April - source&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Infrastructure funds, Japan trading houses likely bidders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* CLP still interested in the stake -- source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Denny Thomas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, March 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has
launched an auction to sell up to $2 billion worth of shares in
a Hong Kong power venture after a year-long effort to offload
its holding to its partner yielded no result, sources familiar
with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest oil company by market value has hired
Barclays Plc as an advisor for the sale of nearly half
of its 60 percent stake in Castle Peak Power Co Ltd as part of
its plan to divest non-core assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks to sell the entire stake to CLP Holdings and
state-owned China Southern Power Grid had stalled due to
disagreements over valuations, the sources said. CLP owns 40
percent of Castle Peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction may attract interest from infrastructure funds,
Japanese trading houses and sovereign wealth funds, they added 
without specifying names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process is in its early stages and potential suitors are
assessing whether to bid for the stake. First-round bids are due
in early April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's cash-rich state power groups have also been scooping
up assets worldwide, with dominant power distributor State Grid
Corp establishing a presence in the Philippines, Spain, Brazil
and Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STILL INTERESTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP, controlled by Hong Kong's wealthy Kadoorie family,
remains attracted to the stake because Castle Peak offers
guaranteed returns, one source familiar with CLP's strategy
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "the ball is in Exxon's court now," the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castle Peak operates three coal-fired power stations and has
a generation capacity of 6,908 megawatts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP and Power Assets Holdings Ltd, Hong Kong's
other power supplier that is controlled by tycoon Li Ka-Shing,
garner an annual return of 9.99 percent on net fixed assets
until 2018 under a programme known as Scheme of Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources, who declined to be identified as the sale
process is confidential, said the 60 percent stake was valued at
around $3 billion last March. Around half of that plus a premium
would bring the deal value closer to $2 billion, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil said in an emailed statement that it does not
comment on rumours or speculation and that it routinely assesses
its global portfolio of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CLP spokeswoman and a Hong Kong-based spokesman for
Barclays declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP posted a 10.5 percent drop in its earnings last year
because of weak performances at its operations in Australia and
India. Hong Kong accounts for the bulk of CLP's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union fined Microsoft Corp 561 million euros ($731 million) on Wednesday for failing to offer users a choice of Web browser, an unprecedented sanction that will act as a warning to other firms involved in EU antitrust disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said the U.S. software company had broken a legally binding commitment made in 2009 to ensure that consumers had a choice of how they access the internet, rather than defaulting to Microsoft's Explorer browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investigation found that Microsoft had failed to honor that obligation in software issued between May 2011 and July 2012, meaning 15 million users were not given a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first time the European Commission, the EU's anti-trust authority, has handed down a fine to a company for failing to meet its obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the sanction is sizeable, representing more than 11 percent of Microsoft's expected net profit this quarter and 1 percent of annual sales, the Commission could have charged the company up to 10 percent of annual global revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company can easily pay the fine out of its $68 billion in cash reserves.

    By Foo Yun Chee
    BRUSSELS, March 6 (Reuters) - The European Union fined
Microsoft Corp 561 million euros ($731 million) on Wednesday for
failing to offer users a choice of Web browser, an unprecedented
sanction that will act as a warning to other firms involved in
EU antitrust disputes.
    It said the U.S. software company had broken a legally
binding commitment made in 2009 to ensure that consumers had a
choice of how they access the internet, rather than defaulting
to Microsoft's Explorer browser.
    An investigation found that Microsoft had failed to honour
that obligation in software issued between May 2011 and July
2012, meaning 15 million users were not given a choice.
    It is the first time the European Commission, the EU's
anti-trust authority, has handed down a fine to a company for
failing to meet its obligations. 
    While the sanction is sizeable, representing more than 11
percent of Microsoft's expected net profit this quarter and 1
percent of annual sales, the Commission could have charged the
company up to 10 percent of annual global revenue. 
    The world's largest software company can easily pay the fine
out of its $68 billion in cash reserves. It holds $61 billion of
that outside the United States, much of it in Europe, to take
advantage of low tax rates.
    Microsoft shares fell 0.9 percent to $28.09 on Nasdaq. 
    "If companies agree to offer commitments which then become
legally binding, they must do what they have committed to do or
face the consequences," Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition
commissioner, told a news conference.
    "I hope this decision will make companies think twice before
they even think of intentionally breaching their obligations or
even of neglecting their duty to ensure strict compliance."
    Microsoft said it took full responsibility for the incident,
which it has blamed on a technical error. The board cut chief
executive Steve Ballmer's bonus last year partly as a result,
and also faulted former Windows head Steven Sinofsky who left
the company last year for unrelated reasons.
    The company did not say whether it would challenge the
ruling, but it is not expected to do so, largely so as not to
antagonise regulators.
    "We have apologized for it," Microsoft said in a statement.
    "We provided the Commission with a complete and candid
assessment of the situation, and we have taken steps to
strengthen our software development and other processes to help
avoid this mistake - or anything similar - in the future."
    Almunia said regulators may have made a mistake by allowing
Microsoft to police its own behaviour instead of appointing an
external trustee to ensure compliance with the commitments.
    "In 2009, we were even more naive than today," he said.
    
    
    WARNING SHOT TO GOOGLE, OTHERS
    Microsoft's fine is a good example of the Commission's hard
line approach toward companies which disregard rules whether
deliberately or not, said Charles Whiddington, a partner at
London-based law firm Field Fisher Waterhouse.
    "The implications for companies going forward is that they
must be more rigorous in complying with any agreement with
the Commission, which does not take prisoners for infractions,"
he said.
    "Companies face severe sanctions for flouting EU rules, even
accidentally."
    Wednesday's fine brings the total of EU fines issued against
Microsoft over the past decade to more than 2.2 billion euros,
making it the world's worst offender of EU rules.
    While the charge could have been higher, it still marks a
firm sanction and will be noted by the likes of Google,
which is involved in a dispute with the Commission over how it
ranks search engine results.
    Google is under pressure to offer concessions to prevent the
Commission moving to the next stage in the case, which could
involve fines. Other major technology companies such as Samsung
Electronics are also under investigation.
    Wednesday's decision is expected to help Microsoft draw a
line under its troubles in Europe as it gears up for an
intensified battle against Google. Microsoft is one of the
complainants in the EU's investigation into the search giant.
    Almunia has also signaled EU regulators' concern over
antitrust issues in the links between technology platform owners
and application developers, in a move that could spell trouble
for Apple Inc and Google, whose iPads and
Android tablets are leading the growth of the computer market.
 
    Relations between the EU's antitrust body and Microsoft have
frequently been tense. In 2004, the Commission found that the
company had abused its dominant market position by tying Windows
Media Player to the Windows software package.
    In 2009, in order to resolve other competition concerns,
Microsoft undertook to offer users a browser choice screen
allowing them to download a browser other than Explorer.
    The Commission made that obligation legally binding for five
years, until 2014, and initially the company complied. From
March 2010 until November 2010, 84 million browsers were
downloaded via the screen, the Commission said. 
    But the Windows 7 service pack 1 rolled out between mid-2011
and mid-2012 failed to offer the choice, leading to the
investigation that resulted in Wednesday's fine.
    In calculating the fine, the Commission said it had taken
into account that Microsoft had cooperated by providing
information that had helped speed up the investigation.
    Analysts always found it odd that Microsoft would have
purposefully failed to offer a choice of browsers via its
software given that the potential fine for such a failure would
far exceed any potential income from not offering it.
    Microsoft's share of the European browser market has more
than halved since 2008 to 24 percent. Google's Chrome has a 35
percent share, followed by Mozilla's Firefox with 29 percent,
according to Web traffic analysis company StatCounter. 
    Given Microsoft's fading power in the browser market, some
questioned the size and point of the fine.
    "As always, the regulators are late to the party," said Kim
Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital
Group in Pittsburgh. "How did the EU come up with that figure in
damages? There are no restrictions as to being able to place a
new browser on the PC and it's really kind of clear that
Microsoft isn't benefiting monetarily from the browser at this
point."

Corp.'s mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2000-C9. A list of rating
actions follows at the end of this press release. 

Key Rating Drivers 

The affirmation is due to the stable performance of the remaining collateral. 

As of the February 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal
balance has been reduced approximately 97.4% to $21.7 million from $814.4
million at issuance, including 4.6% realized losses to date. There are only five
of the 140 original loans remaining. The largest loan (41.9%) of the pool is
defeased. Interest shortfalls are affecting the non-rated classes J through NR
with cumulative unpaid interest totaling $1.4 million. The weighted average debt
service coverage ratio for the non-defeased loans in the pool is 1.36x. 

Rating Sensitivity 

Fitch expects the Rating Outlook on the remaining rated class to remain Stable.
Although the credit enhancement for class H has increased significantly,
upgrades are not warranted due to the uncertain outcome related to the second
largest loan in the pool. Downgrades are not likely as the pool benefits from
defeasance of the largest loan. 

Fitch has identified the second largest loan (36.7%) as a Loan of Concern. The
loan is secured by a four-building industrial property totaling 1.02 million
square feet (sf) in Elisabeth, NJ. The loan was transferred to the special
servicer in October 2009 as the borrower was not able to refinance the loan at
the anticipated repayment date (ARD) of Sept. 1, 2009. The loan was modified in
January 2012 with a five-year extension of the ARD date and reduced interest
rate. The loan was returned to the master servicer in April 2012. As of third
quarter (3Q) 2012, the property performance has improved with significant
increase in net operating income (NOI) primarily due to reduced operating
expenses. Servicer reported occupancy was 75%, compared to 84% at year-end (YE)
2011 and 97% at underwriting. 

Per borrower notice, the property is subject to partial condemnation due to the
intention of the Port Authority of NY &amp; NJ to replace an existing bridge with a
new one. The Port Authority is currently working to finalize a compensation
plan. 

Fitch has affirmed the following class, as indicated: 

--$12.2 million class H at 'BB+sf'; Outlook Stable. 

Classes A-1 through G have paid in full. Classes J, K and NR are not rated by
Fitch. Fitch has previously withdrawn the rating on the Interest-only class X.

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) today announced it earned
$27.2 million, or basic net income per share of $2.95, on net sales of $1.61
billion for fiscal 2012, compared to net income of $28.6 million, or basic net
income per share of $3.11, on net sales of $1.56 billion for fiscal 2011. The
results for 2012 included $0.3 million of after-tax gains ($0.5 million on a
pre-tax basis) due to mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges and $2.7
million of incremental income tax charges related to an increase in our reserve
for uncertain tax positions and other income tax changes. The results for 2011
included $4.1 million of after-tax losses ($6.8 million on a pre-tax basis) due
to mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges and $0.6 million of
incremental income tax charges related to an increase in our reserve for
uncertain tax positions and other income tax changes. 

On a comparable basis, the Company earned $29.6 million in fiscal 2012, or
comparable basic net income per share of $3.21, versus $33.3 million in fiscal
2011, or comparable basic net income per share of $3.62.

J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, "We are pleased to report
another solid year with over three percent growth in revenue offset by an
increase in operating costs due to investments we made in people and marketing
to support our long-term growth strategy. We are committed to, and focused on,
profitably growing our business." 

Henry W. Flint, President and COO, added, "We are pleased with our results for
2012. Our strong revenue growth was a reflection of our efforts to deliver the
right products to our customers and consumers at attractive price points. Our
overall results for the year were down from 2011 due to increased SD costs. We
made significant investments during 2012 in people, marketing and technology to
help us grow both volume and market share in the very competitive marketplace in
which we operate. We continue to innovate and evolve packaging and marketing
strategies to respond to ever-changing consumer tastes."

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co shareholders on Wednesday re-elected the company's board, including Chairman and Chief Executive Bob Iger, and rejected an investor proposal to separate the roles of chairman and CEO in 2016, when Iger plans to leave the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders of the media and theme-park company defeated the proposal from Connecticut State Treasurer Denise Nappier, a Disney investor through the state's employee retirement funds, to split the CEO and chairman jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 35.3 percent of ballots cast supported the plan, according to figures reported at the company's annual shareholder meeting in Phoenix. The results were preliminary, based on votes submitted before the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger, who has served as Disney's CEO since 2005, won re-election to the board with support of 98.3 percent of votes cast. The nine other board members received at least 86.6 percent favorable votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the meeting, Iger touted Disney's recent financial performance. "Yesterday our stock price hit an all-time high. Market cap hit a record $102 billion," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board gave Iger, 62, the added title of chairman at the 2012 annual meeting, where he was elected by shareholders. Also at that meeting, the board named former Starbucks Corp CEO Orin Smith as Disney's independent lead director at meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some shareholders, Iger's dual roles recalled the turbulence surrounding former CEO Michael Eisner, stripped of his chairmanship in 2004 following a campaign by Walt Disney's nephew, Roy Disney, to drive him from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) and New York City Comptroller John Liu, who oversees the city's pension funds, supported the Connecticut resolution that urged the board to split the jobs except under "extraordinary circumstances," when the posts could be held jointly for no more than six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A large, highly integrated organization like Disney simply does not work most effectively when the CEO manages the board responsible for overseeing him and evaluating his performance," said Suzanne Hopgood, who spoke at the meeting on behalf of Connecticut Treasurer Nappier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proxy advisers ISS and Glass, Lewis &amp; Co also recommended ahead of the meeting that shareholders vote for separation of the roles, and against the pay for Iger and other executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a regulatory filing in January, Disney urged shareholders to vote against the proposal to split the chairman and CEO jobs, pointing to the company's financial record under Iger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has recorded a total shareholder return of 139 percent during Iger's tenure, far above the 36 percent return for the S 500 during the same time, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Wednesday's meeting, board member Smith said the decision to offer Iger the chairman's job was made "in the best interest of shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said: "It was clear that Disney had an exceptional CEO," and the chairman's job will keep him at the company for an additional 15 months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders approved the compensation packages for Iger and other executives in a non-binding vote, with 57.6 percent approval among the ballots cast. CalSTRS criticized the structure of long-term incentives ahead of the meeting and had urged votes against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger received $40.2 million in total compensation last year, according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shareholders also rejected a proposal from European institutional investor Legal &amp; General Investment Management that the company allow shareholders holding 3 percent or more of its shares to place candidates on the ballot alongside board-nominated candidates. About 39.8 percent of voters supported the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney slipped 0.3 percent to $56.34 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Ronald Grover, Phil Berlowitz, Bernadette Baum and David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

for the S 500 during the same time, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Wednesday's meeting, board member Smith said the decision
to offer Iger the chairman's job was made "in the best interest
of shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said: "It was clear that Disney had an exceptional
CEO," and the chairman's job will keep him at the company for an
additional 15 months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders approved the compensation packages for Iger and
other executives in a non-binding vote, with 57.6 percent
approval among the ballots cast. CalSTRS criticized the
structure of long-term incentives ahead of the meeting and had
urged votes against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger received $40.2 million in total compensation last year,
according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shareholders also rejected a proposal from European
institutional investor Legal &amp; General Investment Management
that the company allow shareholders holding 3 percent or more of
its shares to place candidates on the ballot alongside
board-nominated candidates. About 39.8 percent of voters
supported the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney slipped 0.3 percent to $56.34 in afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

* Neftegaz America Shelf LP (Neftegaz) joins ExxonMobil to explore deepwater
Gulf of Mexico 
* Neftegaz acquires 30 percent interest in 20 Gulf of Mexico blocks held by
ExxonMobil 
* ExxonMobil remains the operator

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Neftegaz America Shelf LP (Neftegaz), an indirect independent subsidiary of
Rosneft, acquires 30 percent interest in 20 deepwater exploration blocks in the
Gulf of Mexico held by ExxonMobil, under an agreement signed by the two
companies. 

The 20 blocks have a total area of approximately 111,600 acres (450 square
kilometers) in water depths ranging between 2,100 and 6,800 feet (640 and 2,070
meters). Seventeen are located in the Western Gulf of Mexico and three are in
the Central Gulf of Mexico. 

ExxonMobil retains 70 percent interest in the blocks and remains operator.
Analysis of seismic data is under way. There is currently no production on the
blocks. 

Rosneft and ExxonMobil continue to implement the Strategic Cooperation Agreement
signed in 2011, under which the companies and their subsidiaries plan to
undertake joint exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources in Russia
and other countries and to share technology and expertise. Under subsequent
agreements between Neftegaz and ExxonMobil, Rosneft`s subsidiary gained the
option to acquire interest in 20 blocks of its choosing from among ExxonMobil`s
Gulf of Mexico exploration portfolio. The latest agreement represents the
exercise of that option. 

The agreement was signed by Igor I. Sechin, president of Rosneft, and Stephen M.
Greenlee, president of ExxonMobil Exploration Company. 

"ExxonMobil has a long history of safe oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of
Mexico using state-of-the-art safety and environmental protection systems," said
Greenlee. "We look forward to working with Rosneft and its affiliates to explore
these blocks using our leading-edge exploration and development technology and
deepwater execution expertise." 

Sechin said, "This agreement provides Rosneft and its affiliates with access to
one of the world`s most prolific basins. We believe joint efforts of our
companies will ensure the most efficient development of these blocks, with
application of the latest technologies and adhering to high environmental
standards. Moreover, experience and knowledge acquired in the process may
potentially be used when developing deepwater blocks in Russia, including in the
Tuapse Trough in the Black Sea as envisaged under the Strategic Cooperation
Agreement." 

ExxonMobil and Rosneft continue to implement a program of staff exchanges for
technical and management employees to help strengthen the working relationships
between the companies and provide valuable career development opportunities for
employees of both companies. 

The 20 blocks are: 

Western Gulf of Mexico - Alaminos Canyon 569, 612, 613, 655, 656, 657, 698, 699,
700 and 701; East Breaks 429, 471, 472, 473 and 515; Keathley Canyon 529 and
573. 

Central Gulf of Mexico - Walker Ridge 629, 673 and 717.

&lt;p&gt;* 2013 spending seen at $41 bln, mostly on exploration,
production
    * Annual oil and gas output seen up 2-3 pct through 2017
    * Shares edge lower


    NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said
on Wednesday its oil and natural gas production would fall about
1 percent in 2013, but growth will return as more major projects
are started over the next five years.
    The world's largest oil companies have struggled to increase
oil and gas output, forcing them to invest record amounts of
capital to tap into difficult-to-reach fields. Those big
investments do not yield immediate growth, forcing the companies
to focus on wringing the most from every dollar by improving
operations through efficiency or technology. 
    This year, Exxon said it expects to spend $41 billion, a
figure that includes its $3 billion purchase of Celtic
Exploration. The bulk of that budget is earmarked for
exploration and production, the company said.
    "I never would have dreamed we'd be spending at this level,"
Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told the company's
annual analyst meeting in New York. 
    Projects including the company's 110,000-barrel-per-day
Kearl oil sands development and its liquefied natural gas
operations in Papua New Guinea are expected to boost oil and gas
volumes in coming years for the world's largest publicly traded
oil company.
    Through 2017, Exxon expects its annual oil and gas output to
rise 2 percent to 3 percent. Last year, Exxon's oil and gas
production fell 6 percent to average 4.2 million barrels of oil
equivalent (boe) per day.
    Phil Weiss, oil analyst at Argus, said the company's output
forecasts were largely in line with investor expectations.
    Exxon's output of higher-priced liquids such as crude oil is
expected to grow 2 percent this year. Natural gas production is
forecast to fall about 5 percent in 2013, primarily due to
lower-than-anticipated output in North America, Tillerson said.
    Exxon is also looking for speedier production growth in
North America, where it continues to increase investment in
unconventional resources like the Bakken formation in North
Dakota and the Woodford Ardmore shale in Oklahoma.
    Exxon believes the Woodford Ardmore potentially holds more
than 1.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent, more than double the
oil company's prior estimate.
    Tillerson declined to provide much detail about Exxon's
disputed drilling plans in Iraqi Kurdistan, but said the company
would like to be "engaged" throughout Iraq, a message that has
been communicated to the central government in Baghdad.
    Since it signed for six oil blocks with Kurdistan last year,
Exxon has been at the center of the growing disagreement between
Baghdad and Kurdistan that threatens to fracture the OPEC
member's uneasy federal union a year after U.S. troops left.
    Baghdad's central government is "very pleased" with the work
Exxon has done in the West Qurna 1 field, the executive said.
    "We want to continue that engagement," Tillerson told
analysts. 
    Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon fell 26 cents to $89.35
in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading.

billion in net income, up 18% over the year before. And our earnings per share
were up 24%, setting a new record of $3.13." Disney`s market capitalization hit
a record $102 billion, Mr. Iger told shareholders. 

"We`re very excited about what`s ahead-especially with our recent acquisition of
Lucasfilm and Star Wars," Mr. Iger said. "Lucasfilm joins Disney, Pixar, Marvel,
ESPN and ABC in our unprecedented collection of amazing brands." 

Mr. Iger also released the first model image of Shanghai Disneyland, which is
scheduled to open at the end of 2015. 

Based on preliminary results, all Disney Directors were re-elected to the

Company's independent accountants for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2013,
and approved terms of the Amended and Restated 2002 Executive Performance Plan
and the advisory resolution on executive compensation. 

Shareholders agreed with the Board in rejecting two shareholder proposals,
regarding proxy access and the future separation of the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer roles. 

Final voting tallies from this year`s annual meeting are subject to
certification by the Company's inspector of elections, and will be included in
the Company's report to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
within the next week.

&lt;p&gt;March 6 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co shareholders
re-elected Chief Executive Bob Iger and nine other board members
on Wednesday and rejected a proposal by investors to separate

Iger's contract with the media and theme park giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders defeated the proposal from Connecticut State

ExxonMobil`s volunteers for Junior Achievement provide positive role models for
local students and encourage community service
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Junior Achievement USA&#174; (JA) today presented Exxon Mobil Corporation with a
2011-2012 Silver U.S. President's Volunteer Service Award for providing the
organization with significant volunteer resources during the year. ExxonMobil
provided Junior Achievement with more than 10,000 volunteer hours. 

"Through innovative partnerships between businesses, educators and volunteers,
we can prepare young people to enter the workforce and succeed in a global
economy," said Alan Kelly, president of ExxonMobil Fuels &amp; Lubricants, who
received the award on behalf of the company. "This award honors the commitment
of hundreds of ExxonMobil employees around the world who volunteer with Junior
Achievement and share their experiences at schools in their communities." 

President George W. Bush established the President's Council on Service and
Civic Participation in 2003 to recognize the valuable contributions volunteers
make in communities and encourage more people to serve. The Council created the
President's Volunteer Service Award program as a way to thank and honor
Americans who, by their demonstrated commitment and example, inspire others to
engage in volunteer service. 

In 2006, Junior Achievement became an official certifying organization for this
award, which also recognizes corporations with a U.S. presence that provide
volunteers to teach JA programs anywhere in the world. 

"I thoroughly enjoyed the Junior Achievement program on leadership and
professional communications," said Ebony Jackson, a junior at Wunsche High
School in Spring ISD, Houston, Texas. "The program inspired me to be a leader on
my campus and a role model to my peers." 

ExxonMobil is one of only 33 JA corporate partners to be honored with a
President`s Volunteer Service Award this year. The entire list of recipients is
located here. 

"Junior Achievement volunteers play a key role in bringing Junior Achievement to
life. By sharing their personal and professional experiences and skills with
students in their communities, volunteers help young people to make a connection
between what they are learning in school and what they will need to succeed in
work and life. In so doing, they support students, their local communities and
America's economic competitiveness," said Jack E. Kosakowski, president and CEO
of Junior Achievement USA. "The U.S. President's Volunteer Service Award is an
outstanding way to acknowledge ExxonMobil and its employee-volunteers, who
demonstrate a commitment to their communities and encourage others to make
volunteering a priority." 

Larry A. Leva, global vice chairman of Quality and Risk Management for KPMG
International and chairman of Junior Achievement USA, added, "By recognizing and
honoring volunteers, we shine a spotlight on everyday heroes who are working to
address pressing social challenges. We are also setting a standard for service
and fostering civic participation."

people the knowledge and skills they need to own their economic success, plan
for their future, and make smart academic and economic choices. JA programs are

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union fined Microsoft Corp 561 million euros ($731 million) on Wednesday for failing to offer users a choice of web browser, an unprecedented sanction that will act as a warning to other firms involved in EU antitrust disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said the U.S. software company had broken a legally binding commitment made in 2009 to ensure that consumers had a choice of how they access the internet, rather than defaulting to Microsoft's Explorer browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investigation found that Microsoft had failed to honor that obligation in software issued between May 2011 and July 2012, meaning 15 million users were not given a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first time the European Commission, the EU's anti-trust authority, has handed down a fine to a company for failing to meet its obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the sanction is sizeable, representing more than 11 percent of Microsoft's expected net profit this quarter and 1 percent of annual sales, the Commission could have charged the company up to 10 percent of annual global revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the world's largest software company fell 1.3 percent to $27.98 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If companies agree to offer commitments which then become legally binding, they must do what they have committed to do or face the consequences," Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner, told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope this decision will make companies think twice before they even think of intentionally breaching their obligations or even of neglecting their duty to ensure strict compliance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it took full responsibility for the incident, which it has blamed on a technical error. The board cut chief executive Steve Ballmer's bonus last year partly as a result, and also faulted former Windows head Steven Sinofsky who left the company last year for unrelated reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not say whether it would challenge the ruling, but it is not expected to do so, largely so as not to antagonize regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have apologized for it," Microsoft said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We provided the Commission with a complete and candid assessment of the situation, and we have taken steps to strengthen our software development and other processes to help avoid this mistake - or anything similar - in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almunia said regulators may have made a mistake by allowing Microsoft to police its own behavior instead of appointing an external trustee to ensure compliance with the commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2009, we were even more naive than today," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNING SHOT TO GOOGLE, OTHERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's fine is a good example of the Commission's hard line approach towards companies which disregard rules whether deliberately or not, said Charles Whiddington, a partner at London-based law firm Field Fisher Waterhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The implications for companies going forward is that they must be more rigorous in complying with any agreement with the Commission, which does not take prisoners for infractions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Companies face severe sanctions for flouting EU rules, even accidentally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's fine brings the total of EU fines issued against Microsoft over the past decade to more than 2.2 billion euros, making it the world's worst offender of EU rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the charge could have been higher, it still marks a firm sanction and will be carefully noted by the likes of Google, which is involved in a dispute with the Commission over how it ranks search engine results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is under pressure to offer concessions to prevent the Commission moving to the next stage in the case, which could involve fines. Other major technology firms such as Samsung Electronics are also under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's decision is expected to help Microsoft draw a line under its troubles in Europe as it gears up for an intensified battle against Google. Microsoft is one of the complainants in the EU's investigation into the search giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almunia has also signaled EU regulators' concern over antitrust issues in the links between technology platform owners and application developers, in a move that could spell trouble for Apple Inc and Google, whose iPads and Android tablets are the leading the growth of the computer market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relations between the EU's antitrust body and Microsoft have frequently been tense. In 2004, the Commission found that the firm had abused its dominant market position by tying Windows Media Player to the Windows software package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, in order to resolve other competition concerns, Microsoft undertook to offer users a browser choice screen allowing them to download a browser other than Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission made that obligation legally binding for five years, until 2014, and initially the company complied. From March 2010 until November 2010, 84 million browsers were downloaded via the screen, the Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Windows 7 service pack 1 rolled out between mid-2011 and mid-2012 failed to offer the choice, leading to the investigation that resulted in Wednesday's fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In calculating the fine, the Commission said it had taken into account that Microsoft had cooperated by providing information that had helped speed up the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts always found it odd that Microsoft would have purposefully failed to offer a choice of browsers via its software given that the potential fine for such a failure would far exceed any potential income from not offering it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's share of the European browser market has more than halved since 2008 to 24 percent. Google's Chrome has a 35 percent share, followed by Mozilla's Firefox with 29 percent, according to Web traffic analysis company StatCounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given Microsoft's fading power in the browser market, some questioned the size and point of the fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As always, the regulators are late to the party," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. "How did the EU come up with that figure in damages? There are no restrictions as to being able to place a new browser on the PC and it's really kind of clear that Microsoft isn't benefiting monetarily from the browser at this point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle.

    By Foo Yun Chee
    BRUSSELS, March 6 (Reuters) - The European Union fined
Microsoft Corp 561 million euros ($731 million) on Wednesday for
failing to offer users a choice of web browser, an unprecedented
sanction that will act as a warning to other firms involved in
EU antitrust disputes.
    It said the U.S. software company had broken a legally
binding commitment made in 2009 to ensure that consumers had a
choice of how they access the internet, rather than defaulting
to Microsoft's Explorer browser.
    An investigation found that Microsoft had failed to honour
that obligation in software issued between May 2011 and July
2012, meaning 15 million users were not given a choice.
    It is the first time the European Commission, the EU's
anti-trust authority, has handed down a fine to a company for
failing to meet its obligations. 
    While the sanction is sizeable, representing more than 11
percent of Microsoft's expected net profit this quarter and 1
percent of annual sales, the Commission could have charged the
company up to 10 percent of annual global revenue.
    Shares of the world's largest software company fell 1.3
percent to $27.98 on Nasdaq. 
    "If companies agree to offer commitments which then become
legally binding, they must do what they have committed to do or
face the consequences," Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition
commissioner, told a news conference.
    "I hope this decision will make companies think twice before
they even think of intentionally breaching their obligations or
even of neglecting their duty to ensure strict compliance."
    Microsoft said it took full responsibility for the incident,
which it has blamed on a technical error. The board cut chief
executive Steve Ballmer's bonus last year partly as a result,
and also faulted former Windows head Steven Sinofsky who left
the company last year for unrelated reasons.
    The company did not say whether it would challenge the
ruling, but it is not expected to do so, largely so as not to
antagonise regulators.
    "We have apologized for it," Microsoft said in a statement.
    "We provided the Commission with a complete and candid
assessment of the situation, and we have taken steps to
strengthen our software development and other processes to help
avoid this mistake - or anything similar - in the future."
    Almunia said regulators may have made a mistake by allowing
Microsoft to police its own behaviour instead of appointing an
external trustee to ensure compliance with the commitments.
    "In 2009, we were even more naive than today," he said.
    
    
    WARNING SHOT TO GOOGLE, OTHERS
    Microsoft's fine is a good example of the Commission's hard
line approach towards companies which disregard rules whether
deliberately or not, said Charles Whiddington, a partner at
London-based law firm Field Fisher Waterhouse.
    "The implications for companies going forward is that they
must be more rigorous in complying with any agreement with
the Commission, which does not take prisoners for infractions,"
he said.
    "Companies face severe sanctions for flouting EU rules, even
accidentally."
    Wednesday's fine brings the total of EU fines issued against
Microsoft over the past decade to more than 2.2 billion euros,
making it the world's worst offender of EU rules.
    While the charge could have been higher, it still marks a
firm sanction and will be carefully noted by the likes of Google
, which is involved in a dispute with the Commission
over how it ranks search engine results.
    Google is under pressure to offer concessions to prevent the
Commission moving to the next stage in the case, which could
involve fines. Other major technology firms such as Samsung
Electronics are also under investigation.
    Wednesday's decision is expected to help Microsoft draw a
line under its troubles in Europe as it gears up for an
intensified battle against Google. Microsoft is one of the
complainants in the EU's investigation into the search giant.
    Almunia has also signaled EU regulators' concern over
antitrust issues in the links between technology platform owners
and application developers, in a move that could spell trouble
for Apple Inc and Google, whose iPads and
Android tablets are the leading the growth of the computer
market. 
    Relations between the EU's antitrust body and Microsoft have
frequently been tense. In 2004, the Commission found that the
firm had abused its dominant market position by tying Windows
Media Player to the Windows software package.
    In 2009, in order to resolve other competition concerns,
Microsoft undertook to offer users a browser choice screen
allowing them to download a browser other than Explorer.
    The Commission made that obligation legally binding for five
years, until 2014, and initially the company complied. From
March 2010 until November 2010, 84 million browsers were
downloaded via the screen, the Commission said. 
    But the Windows 7 service pack 1 rolled out between mid-2011
and mid-2012 failed to offer the choice, leading to the
investigation that resulted in Wednesday's fine.
    In calculating the fine, the Commission said it had taken
into account that Microsoft had cooperated by providing
information that had helped speed up the investigation.
    Analysts always found it odd that Microsoft would have
purposefully failed to offer a choice of browsers via its
software given that the potential fine for such a failure would
far exceed any potential income from not offering it.
    Microsoft's share of the European browser market has more
than halved since 2008 to 24 percent. Google's Chrome has a 35
percent share, followed by Mozilla's Firefox with 29 percent,
according to Web traffic analysis company StatCounter. 
    Given Microsoft's fading power in the browser market, some
questioned the size and point of the fine.
    "As always, the regulators are late to the party," said Kim
Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital
Group in Pittsburgh. "How did the EU come up with that figure in
damages? There are no restrictions as to being able to place a
new browser on the PC and it's really kind of clear that
Microsoft isn't benefiting monetarily from the browser at this
point."

&lt;p&gt;* Bicudo, Pereira are Goldman veterans in M, DCM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Wainstein was one of two partners based in Brazil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Goldman seeks growth in Brazil with complex products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Guillermo Parra-Bernal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, March 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 named bankers Fabio Bicudo and Antonio Pereira as
co-heads of investment banking in Brazil, where the U.S. firm is
seeking to leverage growth in fast-growing activities such as
structured finance and corporate lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both bankers were co-chief opperating officers of Goldman's
investment-banking unit in Brazil prior to the appointment,
according to a memo obtained by Reuters on Wednesday. Both
Bicudo and Pereira are veterans of the New York-based firm,
where the former worked in mergers and acquisitions primarily
and the latter worked in debt capital markets deals for some
time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointments came the same day that Goldman Sachs
announced that Daniel Wainstein, chairman of the
investment-banking unit in Brazil, plans to retire from the firm
after 13 years. Wainstein has been a partner of Goldman Sachs -
one of the two that the firm has in Brazil - since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As co-heads, Fabio and Antonio will continue to develop our
strategy and strengthen our developing client franchise in this
important market," the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is seeking fast growth in Brazil, where demand
for debt and hedging instruments has swelled as interest rates
have fallen to all-time lows this year. Companies and investors
are stepping up demand for corporate bonds, asset-backed
securities and private equity fund-related vehicles posting
higher returns than equities and government debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its investment bank ranked eighth in mergers and
acquisitions in Brazil last year, with $14.56 billion worth of
advisory work, according to Thomson Reuters data. In terms of
equity underwriting, Goldman Sachs was the fourth-biggest earner
from share offerings in Brazil with about $700 million in
proceeds. It failed to make any of the first 15 spots in global
debt underwriting for Brazil in the Thomson Reuters rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lender has been expanding aggressively in Brazil since
2009, when it became a full-service financial institution. The
bank, which last year increased the capital of its Brazilian
unit to about $400 million, has doubled its workforce in the
South American country over the past two years to approximately
300 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Goldman in Brazil declined to comment on
the appointments or Wainstein's departure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on Wednesday its oil and natural gas production would fall about 1 percent in 2013, but growth will return as more major projects are started over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest oil companies have struggled to increase oil and gas output, forcing them to invest record amounts of capital to tap into difficult-to-reach fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Exxon said it expects to spend $41 billion, a figure that includes its $3 billion purchase of Celtic Exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects including the company's Kearl oil sands development and fields offshore Angola are expected to boost oil and gas volumes in coming years for the world's largest publicly traded oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon has a long track record of success in finding and developing a broad spectrum of resource types," a fact that leaves the company well positioned to expand its volumes, Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson told the company's annual analyst meeting in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through 2017, Exxon expects its annual oil and gas output to rise 2 percent to 3 percent, helped by major project startups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's output of higher-priced liquids such as crude oil is expected to grow by 2 percent this year. Natural gas production is forecast to fall about 5 percent in 2013, primarily due to lower-than-anticipated output in North America, Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Exxon's oil and gas production fell 6 percent to average 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon fell 18 cents to $89.43 in late-morning New York Stock Exchange trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Driver; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, March 6 (Reuters) - Shares in Mexican
broadcaster Televisa, the world's biggest producer
of Spanish-language content, fell 2.3 percent after Swiss bank
UBS cut its recommendation on the stock to "neutral" on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa was the worst performing stock in Mexico's

the start of the year, and nearly 20 percent since the end of
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, with Mexico's government planning to reform the
country's telecom sector to introduce more competition, UBS said
it continued to view Televisa's future prospects as solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to like Televisa's core assets and view the
company as a long-term winner from Mexico's pending competition
laws," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Televisa reported a higher fourth-quarter profit
on solid sales and lower financing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Recognized by Ethisphere Institute for leadership in promoting ethical business
standards
FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), the global payments technology company, today was recognized
for leadership in business ethics when it was placed on the 2013 list of the
World`s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute, a leading international
think tank. Visa joins a group of global brands who are dedicated to doing
business with world-class ethical practices and promoting ethical business
standards. 

The Ethisphere Institute is dedicated to the creation, advancement and sharing
of best practices in business ethics, corporate social responsibility,
anti-corruption, and sustainability. This is the seventh year that the Institute
has produced its annual list, and the first time Visa has earned a position on
it since becoming a publicly-traded company in 2008. 

"Visa is honored to be part of this group of companies who are committed to
operating at the highest level of ethics," said Ellen Richey, Chief Enterprise
Risk Officer of Visa Inc. "This recognition reflects the commitment of Visa`s
employees worldwide to the highest levels of ethical business practices and
trust. Trust is critical to our business of enabling electronic commerce, and
that`s what we`ve done for more than 50 years." 

Ethisphere uses a proprietary Ethics Quotient (EQTM) rating system to evaluate
companies` performance in an objective, consistent and standardized way. The EQ
framework consists of five core evaluation categories including ethics and
compliance program; reputation, leadership and innovation; governance; corporate
citizenship and responsibility; and culture of ethics. 

"Visa Inc. continues to set the bar within its industry for a number of its
ethics programs," said Alex Brigham, executive director of the Ethisphere
Institute. "As more companies each year strive for recognition, Visa Inc. was
added to World`s Most Ethical 2013 by demonstrating its strong commitment to
ethical practices." 

Visa takes a comprehensive approach to ethical business practice, including
industry-leading policies, trainings and programs. For example, Visa`s Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all employees and directors,
emphasizes that honesty and integrity are of paramount importance in every
activity. In addition, Visa`s Corporate Responsibility program is focused on
areas where its business expertise and philanthropic contributions can
contribute to financial inclusion, humanitarian support, community involvement,
and responsible business practices.

Evidon InForm Tags Made Available to IBM DDX Clients 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Evidon, the global leader in revealing the invisible web, today announced that
its Evidon InForm solution has joined together with IBM Digital Data Exchange
(DDX). Evidon Inform will enable IBM Digital Analytics clients to comply with
global privacy regulations easily via a direct integration of Evidon privacy
control tags into IBM DDX. 

Through this partnership, Evidon becomes an IBM DDX Certified Partner.
Consequently, Evidon InForm tags, which enable businesses to provide privacy
notices on websites to give consumers transparency and control over how their
data is collected, will be easily accessible to all IBM DDX clients. The
integration will enable those clients to test and deploy Evidon website notice
across their sites directly from the DDX interface, eliminating the need to
spend valuable resources on manual deployments. 

"The integration of Evidon InForm tagging with IBM DDX has the potential to
yield tremendous benefits for companies like Recyclebank," said Jonathan Hsu,
CEO of Recyclebank and an Evidon Board Member. "We take pride on marketing
responsibly to our members, and this partnership between Evidon and IBM gives
organizations like ours the tools to improve disclosure of data collection
practices for the benefit of all of our constituents." 

Providing a privacy notice on EU websites, including a mechanism for visitors to
provide their consent to be tracked, is a requirement of compliance with the EU
ePrivacy Directive (most notices are labelled "cookie consent"). In the US,
utilizing the Ad Choices Icon as part of a website privacy notice solution has
become a widely accepted practice. Research has shown that when businesses give
people this sort of transparency and control, 48 percent of consumers are more
likely to transact with that business. 

"IBM has many data-related products that help marketers drive better results,
and we are obviously thrilled to work with IBM to make our market-leading
privacy tools more accessible to its customers," said Evidon CEO Scott Meyer.
"By integrating privacy tool tags into its Digital Data Exchange, IBM is going
beyond privacy compliance. They are demonstrating their deep commitment to
making it easier for marketers to use data responsibly, with respect for
consumer privacy." 

Evidon InForm is the industry-standard method for delivering these essential
privacy notices to hundreds of millions of consumers each day, and giving them
control over tracking, in more than 40 languages globally. 

IBM Digital Data Exchange is a tag management solution. DDX simplifies the
management of IBM and third-party page tags, enabling clients to deploy and
maintain website pages with minimal support from IT.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Mar 06 (MARKET WIRE) --
More than 15,000 Parent and Grandparent Super Visas have been issued
since the program's launch in December 2011, Citizenship, Immigration and
Multiculturalism Minister Jason Kenney announced today.

    "The Parent and Grandparent Super Visa provides families with
flexibility, and it is clearly growing in popularity," said Minister
Kenney. "Our government is committed to family reunification. I am
pleased to see that more and more parents and grandparents are getting
the opportunity to spend longer periods of time with their loved ones in
Canada."

    With over 1,000 Super Visas issued monthly, approval rates remain high at
86 percent. 

    The Super Visa-a multiple entry visa valid for up to 10 years-allows
parents and grandparents to visit Canada for up to two years at a time.
This Super Visa gives visiting parents and grandparents the freedom to
travel back and forth between Canada and their home country without long
waits. 

    The process for getting a Parent and Grandparent Super Visa is simple and
straightforward. Applicants for the Super Visa must provide proof that
the host child or grandchild meets a minimum income level, demonstrate
that they have purchased comprehensive Canadian medical insurance and
undergo the immigration medical examination. Almost 99 percent of Super
Visa applicants who met these requirements also went on to meet all other
standard admissibility criteria.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, March 6 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster
Televisa, the world's biggest producer of
Spanish-language content, had its stock downgraded to "neutral"
by Swiss bank UBS on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We no longer see sufficient upside to justify a 'Buy'

a client note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa's share price has risen just shy of 3 percent since
the start of the year, and nearly 20 percent since the end of
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, with a telecoms reform in Mexico pending, UBS
said it continued to view Televisa's future prospects as solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to like Televisa's core assets and view the
company as a long-term winner from Mexico's pending competition

Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) anticipates major project start-ups will
deliver 1 million oil-equivalent barrels over the next five years, Rex W.
Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer, said today at the New York
Stock Exchange. 

Production of crude oil and other liquids is expected to increase by an average
of four percent per year between 2013 and 2017 as the company starts production
at 28 major oil and gas projects, 24 of which are liquids or liquids-linked
projects. Twenty two major projects will start production over the next three
years, including an expansion of the Kearl oil sands project in Alberta, Canada,
and a liquefied natural gas export project in Papua New Guinea. 

In a presentation to investment analysts, Tillerson said the company has a
growing global portfolio of high-quality resource opportunities with exploration
success most recently in Romania and Tanzania. ExxonMobil is planning to more
than double its exploration acreage in a range of proven and emerging locations,
such as Russia, that will feed its inventory in the coming years. 

To continue to explore for and develop new resource opportunities, ExxonMobil
plans to invest about $190 billion over the next five years to meet growing
energy demand. 

"An unprecedented level of investment is needed to develop new energy
technologies to expand supply of traditional fuels and advance new energy
sources," Tillerson said. "We are developing a diverse portfolio of high-quality
opportunities across all resource types and geographies." 

At the meeting, the company outlined its major achievements in 2012 and plans
for the future. Highlights include:

* ExxonMobil replaced 115 percent of its 2012 production and 174 percent of its
crude oil and other liquids, increasing proved reserves to 25.2 billion oil
equivalent barrels. It was the 19th consecutive year the company replaced more
than 100 percent of its production, with proved reserve additions of 1.8 billion
oil-equivalent barrels. 
* 22 major upstream projects are expected to start up in the next three years,
including the Kearl oil sands project in Canada and the liquefied natural gas
project in Papua New Guinea. 
* In the downstream, the company is progressing new facilities in Singapore,
China and Finland to capture growth in markets like China and Russia. 
* A major expansion at the Singapore chemicals facilities was completed, which
adds 2.6 million tonnes per year of additional capacity and will help meet
demand growth in Asia Pacific. 
* In Saudi Arabia, the company is developing a world-scale synthetic rubber and
special elastomers plant to serve growing demand for these products in the
Middle East and Asia. 
* ExxonMobil Chemical has filed permit applications for a multi-billion dollar
petrochemical expansion at the company`s integrated Baytown complex in Texas.
The project would include a new ethane cracker and premium product facilities to
capitalize on abundant supplies of U.S. natural gas. 
* ExxonMobil continues to lead competitors in return on average capital employed
at 25.4 percent in 2012, about seven percentage points higher than the nearest
competitor.

This is the 11th year that ExxonMobil has made an annual presentation to
analysts at the New York Stock Exchange. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Projections, expectations, business plans, and other
statements of future events or conditions in this release are forward-looking
statements. Actual future results, including capital expenditures; resource
recoveries; production rates and growth; and project plans, schedules, and
outcomes, could differ materially due to changes in market conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry, including long-term oil and gas price levels;
political or regulatory developments; reservoir performance; timely completion
of development projects; technical or operating factors; the outcome of
commercial negotiations; and other factors discussed in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's
most recent Form 10-K and posted in the Investors section of our website
(www.exxonmobil.com). 

Proved reserves in this release for 2009 and later years are based on current
SEC definitions, but for prior years the referenced proved reserve volumes are
determined on bases that differ from SEC definitions in effect at the time.
Specifically, for years prior to 2009 included in our 19 straight years of at
least 100 percent replacement, reserves are determined using the price and cost
assumptions we use in managing the business, not the historic prices used in SEC
definitions. Reserves determined on ExxonMobil's pricing basis also include oil
sands and equity company reserves for all periods. Prior to 2009, oil sands and
equity company reserves were not included in proved oil and gas reserves as
defined by the SEC. The reserves replacement ratio is calculated for a specified
period utilizing the applicable proved oil-equivalent reserves additions divided
by oil-equivalent production. 

"Resources" and "resource base" include quantities of discovered oil and gas
that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but that are expected ultimately
to be recovered in the future. The term "resource base" is not intended to
correspond to SEC definitions such as "probable" or "possible" reserves. 

The term "project" as used in this release does not necessarily have the same
meaning as under SEC Rule 13q-1 relating to government payment reporting. For
example, a single project for purposes of the rule may encompass numerous
properties, agreements, investments, developments, phases, work efforts,
activities, and components, each of which we may also informally describe as a
"project." 

See the "Frequently Used Terms" posted in the Investors section of our website
for more information on proved reserves and resources, as well as information
regarding our calculation of return on average capital employed.

Expanding BYOD challenges fuel enterprise need for network testing to deliver
quality of service and quality of experience 
CALABASAS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Ixia (Nasdaq: XXIA) was selected by Microsoft as the official test house to
qualify Microsoft`s Lync application against Wi-Fi networking and client
devices. With the trend of BYOD expanding, and as unified communications
applications carrying voice and video traffic become pervasive, enterprises face
significant challenges to guarantee application quality. With Ixia
qualification, enterprises are now able to determine with certainty whether they
can expect Wi-Fi performance equal to wired networks, a commitment that cannot
be guaranteed without comprehensive qualification programs. 

News highlights

Microsoft Lync, a UC platform providing a consistent, single client experience
for presence, instant messaging, voice and video, continues to spread throughout
the enterprise and across mobile devices. However, consumer-grade Wi-Fi features
in devices that are now extensively being used in the enterprise lead to low
adoption of critical UC voice and video features. 

This combination of bandwidth-heavy UC tools and the increasing number of BYOD
policies mean rising frustrations for both users and the IT departments tasked
with fixing Wi-Fi and device issues. To solve this, Microsoft is collaborating
with Ixia to test and qualify Lync`s complete Wi-Fi ecosystem, from access
points to mobile devices, via the Ixia Wi-Fi test solutions. 

-As the official testing house for the complete Microsoft Lync Wi-Fi ecosystem,
Ixia works directly with potential Microsoft partners to test and qualify
technology used with the UC system. 

-Over a two-week time frame, Ixia will use the IxVeriWave solution to create
real-world conditions by emulating a full range of scalable, media-rich
application traffic. 

-Once testing is complete, Ixia delivers a qualification report to Microsoft and
the technology partner with the security and reliability findings. From this
report, Microsoft determines whether the technology is qualified for use with
the Lync platform. 

-As a result, Microsoft now has confidence that Lync users will receive
high-quality UC services, which equates to an increase in adoption of the
powerful and essential collaboration tool. 

Industry commentary

"With tablets and smartphones embedded in our everyday lives, Wi-Fi access to
collaboration tools has become an integral part of today`s enterprises; however,
poor quality over Wi-Fi has slowed that adoption. Microsoft is dedicated to
ensuring our customers` success, and qualifying the devices in the Lync Wi-Fi
ecosystem is a major driver to enabling needed enterprise collaboration," said
B.J. Haberkorn, director of Lync Product Marketing at Microsoft. "Collaborating
with Ixia to provide comprehensive, real-world Wi-Fi testing ensures that the
power of Lync can be securely and reliably delivered to our customers." 

"Wi-Fi is a vital component of customer and enterprise adoption of UC
collaboration tools, and the powerful but extensive video and voice capabilities
have put a strain on Wi-Fi`s stability," said Joseph Zeto, director of product
marketing for Ixia. "By working together with Microsoft and potential Lync
partners, Ixia is helping to ensure customers have the reliable networks they
need to unleash the power of the Microsoft Lync collaboration tools."

&lt;p&gt;* European Commission says company did not respect antitrust
deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* U.S. firm failed to offer users a web browser choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Fine raises total EU penalties against Microsoft to 2.16
bln euros&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, March 6 (Reuters) - The European Union fined
Microsoft Corp 561 million euros on Wednesday for
failing to offer consumers a choice of web browser, a charge
that will act as a warning to other technology firms involved in
antitrust disputes with the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the U.S. company had broken a legally binding
commitment made in 2009 to ensure consumers had a choice of
browser, rather than defaulting to Microsoft's Internet
Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An EU investigation found that Microsoft had failed to
honour that obligation in software issued between May 2011 and
July 2012, meaning that 15 million users were never made aware
that they could choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Legally binding commitments reached in antitrust decisions
play a very important role in our enforcement policy," said
Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A failure to comply is a very serious infringement that
must be sanctioned accordingly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's fine is the first time the European Commission,
the EU's antitrust authority, has fined a company for
non-compliance with agreed commitments. It could have charged
Microsoft up to 10 percent of its global turnover, or as much as
$7.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that respect, the fine is relatively light, but still
marks a firm sanction by the EU and will not go unnoticed by the
likes of Google, which is involved in a dispute with
the Commission over how it ranks search engine results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is under pressure to offer concessions to prevent the
antitrust authority moving to the next stage in the case, which
could involve fines. Other major technology firms are also in
the Commission's crosshairs in other cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a long and bitter relationship with the EU's
powerful antitrust authority, which has now issued fines
totalling 2.16 billion euros against the U.S. firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the Commission found that Microsoft had abused its
dominant market position in relation to the tying of Windows
Media Player to the Windows software package and imposed fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in 2009, in order to resolve other competition
concerns, Microsoft undertook to offer users a browser choice
screen allowing them to download a browser other than Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission made that obligation legally binding for five
years, until 2014, and initially the company complied. From
March 2010 until November 2010, 84 million browsers were
downloaded via the screen, the Commission said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Windows 7 service pack 1 rolled out between mid-2011
and mid-2012 failed to offer the choice, leading to the
investigation that resulted in Wednesday's fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said the failure was the result of a technical
error and that procedures have since been tightened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what was seen as an acknowledgement of the severity of
the mistake, the board cut the bonus of chief executive Steve
Ballmer last year, according to company's annual proxy filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said it had taken into account in calculating
the fine that Microsoft had cooperated by providing information
that had helped speed-up the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts always found it odd that Microsoft would have
purposefully failed to offer a choice of browsers via its
software given that the potential fine for such a failure would
far exceed any potential income from not offering it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's share of the European browser market has more
than halved since 2008 to 24 percent. Google's Chrome has a 35
percent share, followed by Mozilla with 29 percent, according to
Web traffic analysis company StatCounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, March 6 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators fined
Microsoft 561 million euros ($731 million) on Wednesday
for breaking a promise to offer European consumers a choice of
web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had made the pledge in 2009 in settling an
antitrust investigation in Europe, where the software group's
regulatory troubles date from the last decade and have cost it a
total of 2.16 billion euros, including the latest fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft promised to offer European consumers a choice of
rival browsers in the previous version of its Windows operating
system. But the European Commission, which acts as competition
regulator across the 27-member European Union, said it found the
company broke that undertaking between May 2011 and July
2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission said it takes such settlement commitments
very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Legally binding commitments reached in antitrust decisions
play a very important role in our enforcement policy because
they allow for rapid solutions to competition problems,"
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, such decisions require strict compliance. A
failure to comply is a very serious infringement that must be
sanctioned accordingly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) is pulling out of the panel that sets Australia's benchmark interbank lending rates, joining UBS (UBSN.VX) in an exodus from regional rate setting panels in the wake of the Libor rate rigging scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks around the world are reviewing their involvement in interest rate setting panels after regulators dished out billions of dollars in fines to banks including Barclays (BARC.L), UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) for manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel that sets Australia's bank bill swap (BBSW) reference rate, administered by the Australian Financial Markets Association (AFMA), will drop to 12 from 14 with the impending departure of JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have advised AFMA that we will be withdrawing," a JP Morgan spokesman told Reuters, adding that the move would take effect from the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan gave no explanation for its exit from the BBSW rate setting panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS stopped participating in the BBSW panel in February. The Swiss bank's move followed the publication of a Commodities Futures Trading Commission report into its manipulation of Libor and its Japanese yen equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFTC findings, reported by Reuters in January, noted attempted manipulation by UBS traders in the BBSW, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Through its internal investigation, UBS identified evidence of similar misconduct involving submissions for at least the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate ("HIBOR"), the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate ("SIBOR"), the Singapore Swap Offer Rate ("SOR") and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Rate ("BBSW")," a footnote in the CFTC charge sheet read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS, which agreed in December to pay regulators $1.5 billion for its role in the Libor scandal, said the withdrawal from BBSW was part of a global move to reduce its involvement on regional rate setting panels.

submissions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* AFMA says BBSW less risky than other rate setting methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Lincoln Feast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, March 8 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is
pulling out of the panel that sets Australia's benchmark
interbank lending rates, joining UBS in an exodus from
regional rate setting panels in the wake of the Libor rate
rigging scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks around the world are reviewing their involvement in
interest rate setting panels after regulators dished out
billions of dollars in fines to banks including Barclays
, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland for
manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel that sets Australia's bank bill swap (BBSW)
reference rate, administered by the Australian Financial Markets
Association (AFMA), will drop to 12 from 14 with the impending
departure of JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have advised AFMA that we will be withdrawing," a JP
Morgan spokesman told Reuters, adding that the move would take
effect from the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan gave no explanation for its exit from the BBSW rate
setting panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS stopped participating in the BBSW panel in February. The
Swiss bank's move followed the publication of a Commodities
Futures Trading Commission report into its manipulation of Libor
and its Japanese yen equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFTC findings, reported by Reuters in January, noted
attempted manipulation by UBS traders in the BBSW, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Through its internal investigation, UBS identified evidence
of similar misconduct involving submissions for at least the
Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate ("HIBOR"), the Singapore
Interbank Offered Rate ("SIBOR"), the Singapore Swap Offer Rate
("SOR") and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Rate ("BBSW")," a
footnote in the CFTC charge sheet read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS, which agreed in December to pay regulators $1.5 billion
for its role in the Libor scandal, said the withdrawal from BBSW
was part of a global move to reduce its involvement on regional
rate setting panels. A spokeswoman for Swiss bank declined to
comment on its internal investigation relating to BBSW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is also reviewing its involvement in other smaller
regional interbank rate setting panels. There is no suggestion
or evidence its traders were involved in efforts to manipulate
the BBSW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFMA said it had not been provided any details of UBS's
internal investigation into attempted manipulation of BBSW but
remained confident in the system, which unlike Libor is based on
traded prices rather than estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a range of checks and balances in place which would
make it extremely difficult to manipulate (BBSW) through the
submissions process," AFMA executive director David Lynch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submissions to the BBSW process report the prevailing prices

declining to comment on the minimum number required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS and JP Morgan are not alone in cutting their
participation in rate-setting panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Dutch lender Rabobank pulled out of the panel

contributing rates for the European money market benchmark last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Asia, RBS has pulled out from interbank panels in

Complexus to grow customer base for Simplement`s leading Enterprise SAP Business
Intelligence Solutions in South Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa 
CHICAGO &amp; JOHANNESBURG--(Business Wire)--
Simplement, Inc., a provider of simplified and streamlined data sourcing
solutions for SAP customers, and Complexus Software, a niche software
distributor and consultancy, announced today their partnership to bring
Simplement's leading enterprise SAP Business Intelligence solutions to South
Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. 

With a growing list of global clients, Simplement sought out a partner to help
develop its footprint in the African continent. "We were looking for a business
partner that shared our philosophy of helping clients move away from handcrafted
and expensive to maintain integrations with SAP. Many companies spend millions
of dollars to perform basic reporting and data abstraction from SAP, whereas
Simplement can make those key processes easy, fast and radically reduce initial
and ongoing costs," said Robert MacLean, President of Simplement. "Complexus is
doing the same with its clients in Africa, helping clients move away from the
broken cycle of `develop - fix - maintain` to the modern approach of `analyse -
configure - deploy.` We have a shared commitment to help clients gain more value
from their existing Microsoft and SAP investments, and to deliver the highest
levels of client support and satisfaction," MacLean added. 

Nick Bradshaw, Director of Complexus, said: "When we first started talking to
the team at Simplement, we realised from Day 1 there was a great fit. Our
approach with clients is to help them abstract value from their investments in
SharePoint and with a growing need to surface data "trapped" in SAP into
platforms like SharePoint, we knew this would be a great addition to our growing
portfolio of niche, value add products." Bradshaw concluded, "We are already
talking to several major Enterprises in Africa who have expressed an interest in
Simplement and are looking to improve efficiency and reduce costs in this area
of their business operations. We will be officially launching the product at
SHARE 2013 conference, at the The Sandton Sun, Johannesburg, 11-13 March 2013."

    - Devices &amp; Services net sales to grow faster than the market.

    - Devices &amp; Services non-IFRS operating margin to be 10% or more.

    Longer-term, Nokia Siemens Networks continues to target for its non-IFRS

    Additional disclosure on Microsoft agreement

    This annual report also includes additional information in relation to
Nokia's agreement with Microsoft, including mainly the following:

    - The remaining minimum software royalty commitment payments from Nokia to
Microsoft are expected to exceed the remaining platform support payments
from Microsoft to Nokia by a total of approximately EUR 0.5 billion over
the remaining life of the agreement.

    - However, in 2013 the amount of the platform support payments from
Microsoft to Nokia is still expected to slightly exceed the total amount

performance, basis. Non-IFRS information excludes special items for all
periods. In addition, non-IFRS results exclude intangible asset

management and investors regarding Nokia's performance by excluding the
above-described items that may not be indicative of Nokia's business
operating results. Non-IFRS financial measures should not be viewed in
isolation or as substitutes to the equivalent IFRS measure(s), but should

&lt;p&gt;  SAN RAFAEL, CA, Mar 07 (Marketwire) -- 
Monitise plc (LSE: MONI) (the "Company") and Visa Europe are further
strengthening their partnership with a new three-year commercial
agreement spanning the development and deployment of Mobile Money
payments and mobile commerce solutions for Europe's leading financial
institutions.

    Heads of terms have been signed for the agreement, which covers licence
rights to all aspects of Monitise's mobile technology. 

    The new relationship incorporates minimum revenues to Monitise of EUR 45
million over the first three years with the potential for greater
revenues as certain user generated thresholds are achieved. A further
announcement will be made when the Company has entered into the final
contractual agreement with Visa Europe (the "Agreement").

    At the same time the Agreement for this extended commercial partnership
is entered into, Monitise will grant Visa Europe a warrant to purchase 43
million ordinary shares of one pence each in the Company ("Ordinary
Shares") at a price of 36.25p per Ordinary Share, representing the
closing mid-market price of March 4, 2013. This warrant will be
exercisable from the point at which the Agreement is entered into between
Monitise and Visa Europe until August 4, 2014. In addition, the Company
will grant Visa Europe a further warrant to purchase an additional six
million Ordinary Shares at a price of one pence per Ordinary Share, being
the nominal value.

    Monitise has been working in partnership with Visa Europe since February
2011 to deploy mobile payments services to its more than 3,000 member
banks and financial institutions across 36 countries. Visa Europe owns
7.5 percent of the shares in Monitise via an investment that forms part
of its strategy to deliver increased value for financial institutions and
consumers through enabling and supporting mobile payments.

    Steve Chambers, Chief Information Officer at Visa Europe, said: "Mobile
is changing the way we pay and buy. Visa continues to ensure that
financial institutions remain at the center of this important landscape.
We are delighted to be deepening our long-standing relationship with
Monitise to ensure continued best-in-class services for Visa Europe
members."

    Monitise Chief Commercial Officer Lee Cameron said: "Payments is about
partnerships and Visa is the industry benchmark for trusted payments
innovation globally. This agreement underpins our growth expectations and
we are honored to be playing our role as a technology enabler and
ecosystem partner in helping Visa Europe deliver new solutions that
ensure its members can offer the most compelling, intuitive and robust
Mobile Money services." 

    He added: "Our technology has been designed with one clear purpose: to

Content Partners and CBS will each own 50-percent of CSI franchise
NEW YORK &amp; LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Content Partners LLC, an entertainment finance firm that acquires cash flows
from successful film, television and music properties, today announced that it
has purchased a 50-percent interest in the blockbuster television franchise
"CSI" (Crime Scene Investigation) from an affiliate of Goldman Sachs. The
acquisition makes Content Partners an equal stakeholder in the second largest
franchise in television history with CBS Corporation, which owns the other
50-percent interest. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 

Under the terms of the transaction, Content Partners and CBS will each own half
of all rights in the franchise, which includes the CBS series "CSI" (currently
in its 13th season), "CSI: New York" (currently in its ninth season), and "CSI
Miami" (10 seasons completed). CBS will control all domestic and international
distribution rights to the series. 

"One of the most attractive aspects of this acquisition is the strong commitment
that CBS has made in continuing to aggressively distribute and leverage the
`CSI` franchise across all media," said Steven H. Kram, President and CEO of
Content Partners. "The `CSI` franchise is internationally acclaimed and has
consistently been one of television`s top-rated shows since it debuted in 2000.
We are proud to partner with CBS, which is one of the best producers and
distributors of content in the world." 

LionTree Advisors acted as financial advisor to Content Partners in the
transaction. Paul Wachter, Content Partners` Co-Chairman of the Board was also
instrumental in finalizing the transaction. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and
J.P. Morgan provided financing for the deal. 

The "CSI" transaction represents Content Partners` largest acquisition to date,
and bolsters its already extensive catalog of entertainment properties, which
includes interests in 119 films and five television series, acquired from
numerous high-profile actors, writers, directors and other financial
participants in these properties. Content Partners leverages these assets
through a unique business model that provides the entertainment industry`s
creative and investment communities with financial liquidity in their interests
in entertainment properties. This approach mitigates future risk in revenue
receipts, and in return, Content Partners acquires future royalty ownership. 

The "CSI" franchise has long been among the world`s most-watched television
series; in fact, for five out of the last seven years, a "CSI" show has been the
most-watched show globally. Its library contains 724 one-hour episodes, and airs
in over 200 countries. Viewers and entertainment professionals have recognized
the "CSI" franchise over the years with more than 250 nominations and over 80
major awards, including eight Primetime Emmys, five People`s Choice Awards, and
one Screen Actors Guild Award.

&lt;p&gt;By Peter Thal Larsen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are the Montagues and the Capulets of investment banking. It&#8217;s almost as unusual for a senior banker to quit one firm for the other as it was for members of Romeo and Juliet&#8217;s feuding clans to consider marriage. That gives Goldman&#8217;s poaching of Kate Richdale, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s head of investment banking in Asia, an added edge. But while it&#8217;s tempting to see the defection as evidence of a decisive shift in the balance of power in the region, the grudge match has proved surprisingly enduring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing Richdale is a blow. A 13-year veteran of Morgan Stanley, she was put in sole charge of investment banking in the region just two years ago. Moreover, she&#8217;s not the first to leave: several of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s senior Asia bankers have quit in recent years. In a part of the world driven by personal relationships that take years to build, Goldman must have felt that Richdale&#8217;s contacts justified breaking its usual practice of filling senior positions from within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s tempting to look for signs of a broader cosmic shift. Morgan Stanley has suffered more than its fair share of senior upheaval recently: investment bank co-head Paul Taubman, who apparently was close to Richdale, was pushed out in November. Meanwhile, chief executive James Gorman has put noses out of joint by beefing up Morgan Stanley&#8217;s retail brokerage arm while talking tough on bonuses for investment bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet investment banks are remarkably resilient. Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman have experienced plenty of turmoil over the past decade. In Asia, at least, the rivalry remains as close as ever. In each of the last four years, both firms have been in the top three league table positions for advising on mergers and acquisitions in the region. When it comes to underwriting equity offerings, they have generally both been in the top five. It will take many more senior defections before this rivalry has a clear winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) has hired Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) Asia investment banking head Kate Richdale, the most senior banker in the region to switch firms so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richdale will be head of investment banking services for Asia ex-Japan, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters on Thursday, putting her in charge of client relationships in a region where banks are focusing on high-paying clients rather than broad coverage lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a pretty high profile hire," said Philippe Espinasse, a former investment banker with Nomura and UBS in Hong Kong, adding that Richdale's fluent Mandarin and Southeast Asia experience make her a "well-rounded and seasoned" executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley will replace Richdale with Dieter Turowski and Shane Zhang as co-heads of investment banking for Asia Pacific, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richdale's appointment comes at a time when investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are struggling to recapture the fee levels they earned in Asia in the past, as the region's high level of economic growth is tempered by a dwindling flow of large IPOs and other equity offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those deals had been the source of Asia's juiciest fees in the last decade. Banks are working now to focus on fewer clients than in the past, targeting those most likely to pay large and repeat fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richdale's role at Morgan Stanley made her one of the region's top bankers, and one of the few women in Asia to hold such a high ranking. Another top Asia banker is Morgan Stanley's, Wei Sun Christianson, co-Chief Executive of Asia Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richdale's departure from Morgan Stanley is a major hire for Goldman and puts some distance between her and Wei, with whom she had a longstanding personality clash, according to sources at the bank. A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation of Richdale leaving had built up last year, amid re-shuffling at the bank's New York headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richdale will report to Goldman's Asia Pacific investment banking co-heads, Matthew Westerman and Dan Dees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHAKEUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early part of the calendar year is usually when banks begin to see movement at the top, with year-end bonuses paid out and other factors contributing to job movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This February, Bank of America has hired Credit Suisse's Olivier Thiriet as head of Asia Pacific equities and the same bank's George Lin as head of consumer, retail and healthcare investment banking. It also nabbed Deutsche Bank's Richard Yacenda as chief operating officer for the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe-based Turowski was most recently the global co-head of natural resources, while Zhang is the bank's co-head of China investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 13-year veteran of Morgan Stanley, Richdale will join Goldman Sachs as a partner, a coveted title at the bank because of its prestige and high compensation. She was named as Morgan Stanley's sole head of investment banking for Asia-Pacific two years ago to the day, in a reshuffle that saw her co-head, Gokul Laroia, become the boss of the equities division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman will hope to benefit from Richdale's experience in Southeast Asia, a region where the US investment bank has sometimes lagged rivals in the past and where it has redeployed resources recently. It moved Steve Barg from Hong Kong to Singapore in July to become co-head of investment banking for the sub-region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2003 to 2006 Richdale was head of investment banking for Southeast Asia at Morgan Stanley, becoming CEO for the region in 2007. She is known internally for her good relations with Singapore's government fund Temasek TEM.UL, a repeat Morgan Stanley client, according to the source at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richdale is the third Morgan Stanley Asia veteran to defect to another bank in the last year. Will McLane, the head of the financial institutions group for Asia Pacific, went to Citi (C.N) in July and Jonathan Popper, the firm's top mergers and acquisitions banker in Southeast Asia, went to Temasek this January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Lawrence White, additional reporting by Elzio Barreto, Stephen Aldred; Editing by Michael Flaherty and Stephen Coates)&lt;/p&gt;

with Singapore's government fund Temasek, a repeat
Morgan Stanley client, according to the source at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richdale is the third Morgan Stanley Asia veteran to defect
to another bank in the last year. Will McLane, the head of the
financial institutions group for Asia Pacific, went to Citi
 in July and Jonathan Popper, the firm's top mergers and
acquisitions banker in Southeast Asia, went to Temasek this
January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) has launched an auction to sell up to $2 billion worth of shares in a Hong Kong power venture after a year-long effort to offload its holding to its partner yielded no result, sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest oil company by market value has hired Barclays Plc (BARC.L) as an advisor for the sale of nearly half of its 60 percent stake in Castle Peak Power Co Ltd as part of its plan to divest non-core assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks to sell the entire stake to CLP Holdings (0002.HK) and state-owned China Southern Power Grid had stalled due to disagreements over valuations, the sources said. CLP owns 40 percent of Castle Peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction may attract interest from infrastructure funds, Japanese trading houses and sovereign wealth funds, they added without specifying names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process is in its early stages and potential suitors are assessing whether to bid for the stake. First-round bids are due in early April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's cash-rich state power groups have also been scooping up assets worldwide, with dominant power distributor State Grid Corp establishing a presence in the Philippines, Spain, Brazil and Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STILL INTERESTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP, controlled by Hong Kong's wealthy Kadoorie family, remains attracted to the stake because Castle Peak offers guaranteed returns, one source familiar with CLP's strategy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "the ball is in Exxon's court now," the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castle Peak operates three coal-fired power stations and has a generation capacity of 6,908 megawatts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP and Power Assets Holdings Ltd (0006.HK), Hong Kong's other power supplier that is controlled by tycoon Li Ka-Shing, garner an annual return of 9.99 percent on net fixed assets until 2018 under a program known as Scheme of Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources, who declined to be identified as the sale process is confidential, said the 60 percent stake was valued at around $3 billion last March. Around half of that plus a premium would bring the deal value closer to $2 billion, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil said in an emailed statement that it does not comment on rumors or speculation and that it routinely assesses its global portfolio of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CLP spokeswoman and a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Barclays declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLP posted a 10.5 percent drop in its earnings last year because of weak performances at its operations in Australia and India. Hong Kong accounts for the bulk of CLP's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Anna Driver and Charlie Zhu; Editing by Michael Flaherty and Edwina Gibbs)&lt;/p&gt;

PEACHTREE CORNERS, Ga.--(Business Wire)--
I.B.I.S., Inc. announces their latest release for Advanced Distribution

Orleans. During the event, I.B.I.S. will be showcasing Advanced Distribution

Hall. 

Advanced Distribution Software is specifically designed for today`s fast paced
distribution market. The latest update further extends the Dynamics AX
functionality for: trade promotions management, deduction management,
chargebacks, lost sales tracking, upsell/downsell/substitute functionality,
quick order entry, left to qualify, protected/allocated inventory, and much
more. These features are found in the Advanced Revenue Management, Advanced
Order Management, and Advanced Inventory Management modules which can be
purchased individually or as a bundle. 

"The enriched industry-specific functionality strengthens Advanced Distribution
Software, a Microsoft based solution that distributors have long awaited," said
Andy Vabulas, CEO and owner of I.B.I.S., Inc. "Built on Microsoft Dynamics AX,
Advanced Distribution Software is the missing link that connects distributors to
their customers and vendors, providing them the ability to respond quickly and
confidently to increased demands and market changes." 

"If your vision is to convert from being a commodities for a price distributor
to delivering real value as a total replenishment process savings partner to
your customers and vendors, then Advanced Distribution Software is the solution
that will help you achieve your vision," said Dominic Telaro, Director of
Industry Solutions for I.B.I.S., Inc. "Advanced Distribution Software allows you

more. Role-based key performance indicators are included throughout the package
as well. 

A Competitive Advantage

At a time when many distributors are operating on outdated ERP and IT systems,
Advanced Distribution Software gives distributors a competitive advantage for
optimizing profits and gaining market share. Advanced Distribution Software
allows distributors to upgrade their ERP and IT systems today, rather than
waiting for their existing providers to identify, develop and release
mission-critical enterprise solutions. Advanced Distribution Software is the
solution that is essential for distributors to bridge the gap between their
customer requirements and vendor needs.

&lt;p&gt;* Deal adds heft to Liberia's oil sector&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Interest in West Africa rising after string of finds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Concerns linger over fairness of Liberian contracts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Richard Valdmanis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAKAR, March 8 (Reuters) - Liberia will sign off on a deal
giving oil major Exxon Mobil and its partner Canadian
Overseas Petroleum Limited rights to develop an offshore
oil block, a presidential spokeswoman said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landing the world's largest private sector oil company will
add heft to Liberia's nascent oil industry. The deal comes as
the impoverished West African state is seeking to overhaul its
petroleum policy and bolster transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The president feels that this deal is in the best interests
of the country and she is scheduled to sign it later this
afternoon," the spokeswoman for Liberia's President Ellen
Johnson-Sirleaf said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accord for offshore Block 13 will need to be ratified by
parliament, something which is likely in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in West Africa's offshore energy sector has surged
after Ghana struck oil in 2007. Companies have since announced a
string of smaller finds in regional neighbours like Sierra Leone
and Liberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Anadarko, and African Petroleum
also have rights to offshore blocks in Liberia. None have
identified commercial reserves, though African Petroleum said
last year it struck a "potentially large" reservoir on its Block
9 and was pursuing further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberia's state run oil company NOCAL negotiated the latest
deal, announcing on Thursday that it would give the state a 10
percent free equity stake and royalties of between 5 and 10
percent once production began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will also require Exxon and COPL to jointly pay a $50
million up-front signing bonus to Liberia's government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COPL shares gained more than 20 percent on Thursday after
the announcement, reflecting the importance of the Liberian
project on its relatively small portfolio of projects, while
Exxon shares slipped 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms are slightly better for Liberia than those of some
previous oil deals, some of which waive royalty payments or
offer reduced tax rates and state equity share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the latest deal still falls short of the country's
current laws, which call for royalties of no less than 10
percent and a free stake for the state of 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governance watchdogs, including the U.S.-based Revenue Watch
Institute, have highlighted the problem of poor nations flouting
their own laws in oil and mining contracts, either to attract
foreign investment or induce bribery payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberia is in the process of overhauling its petroleum and
mining laws. Officials have declined to say whether the overhaul
will lower existing royalty, tax, and state share requirements,
or if existing contracts will need to be renegotiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberia's Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI) is auditing more than $8 billion worth of oil, mining,
and agriculture contracts amid mounting pressure on President 
Sirleaf to clean up the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberia is one of the world's poorest and least developed
countries after 14 years of on-off civil war, which ended in
2003, left its infrastructure in ruins. The government is hoping
a recent flood of foreign investment will help it rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Block 13 was previously held by little-known UK energy firm
Peppercoast Petroleum which agreed to give up its rights after
missing its drilling targets.&lt;/p&gt;

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/gddt7k/mutual_fund) has announced
the addition of the "Mutual Fund Management" report to their offering. 

The US mutual fund management industry includes about 600 companies with about
$12 trillion in assets under management. Major companies include BlackRock,
Capital Research and Management (American Funds), FMR (Fidelity Investments),
JPMorgan Chase, and Vanguard. 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Demand is affected by the growth of retirement capital and returns on
alternative investments. The profitability of individual companies depends on
investment expertise and effective marketing. Large companies have economies of
scale in operations and marketing. Small companies can compete effectively by
specializing in desirable sectors and by producing higher investment returns. 

PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS &amp; TECHNOLOGY 

Major services include the initial formation of a mutual fund, sales and
redemption of shares, investment advisory services, and day-to-day management. 

Each mutual fund is a separate open-end investment company, with shareholders
(the investors) and a board of directors, but no operating staff. The sponsor of
a fund usually serves as investment adviser and manager of the fund, and
receives an annual fee typically calculated as a percentage of fund's assets.
Large mutual fund operators may sponsor and manage dozens of funds, collecting a
management fee from each. In addition to paying a management fee, mutual funds
pay the underwriters who sell their shares, the custodian of their portfolio,
the transfer agent, and an independent auditor. The expense ratio for a fund is
the sum of all annual expenses divided by the average net assets of the fund.
The average industry expense ratio is about 1 percent.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/w995qp/lubricant) has announced the
addition of the "Lubricant Industry in the United States" report to their
offering. 

The global lubricant industry has progressed form isolated applications to being
a major industry worldwide which has seen the growth and progress of companies
as ExxonMobil , Shell , BP &amp; Chevron Texaco which now account for a significant
market share of lubricants market. The lubricants business has grown manifold
over the last five years backed by strong lubricant sales of these global
majors. 

The major strategy push of these global players is to capitalize on economies of
scale whereby these players have pried open markets leading to value erosion in
midsize players which are either reprocessing base oil from these global giants
or depending on erratic domestic supply, these practices have led to their loss
of competitive ability. 

The market is increasingly moving toward polarization whereby competition has
moved from local or regional markets to global synergies. Competition is
therefore no longer limited to local, regional, or even national markets but is
increasingly becoming global in nature. 

The report looks at the trade scenario of the industry, along with the
regulatory framework applicable to the industry. The major industry contributors
such as BP Lubricants, Castrol International, Chevron Corporation, Shell
Lubricants US, and many other important industry players are analyzed in this
report. A future perspective of the Lubricant Industry in the United States
completes the report with a product subdivision forecast and a market outlook.

Key Topics Covered:

A. Executive Summary

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The newest stress tests for U.S. banks produced scores that are at odds with other measures of lenders' safety, in another sign that some institutions may be too big for regulators to understand and executives to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Citigroup Inc, which has been bailed out multiple times by the U.S. government, showed up on the score sheets posted by the Federal Reserve on Thursday as being clearly safer than JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That conclusion is at odds with the views of investors, bond analysts and credit-rating agencies, as well as when measured by a yardstick regulators themselves want to use in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the end of the day, there is a legitimate question about the ability of regulators to fully evaluate $2 trillion institutions because of the complexity and exposures they have," said Fred Cannon, director of U.S. research at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the Federal Reserve reported the latest results of the tests that began after the 2007-2009 financial crisis to determine if banks have enough capital to withstand a severe economic crisis. The Fed concluded that the banks are in "a much stronger position" than before the financial crisis in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While experts are not arguing with the fact that the banks are better capitalized now and that the system is safer than it was in the run-up to the financial crisis, some of the numbers the regulators published left analysts and bank executives groping for explanations. The test raises questions about the ability of regulators to head off the next big threat to the financial system because of the complexity of the institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are also important as they will help the Fed decide how much capital banks can return to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report showed that Citigroup's capital, as tracked by the Tier 1 common capital ratio, would dip to 8.3 percent during two years of hypothetical stress. JPMorgan's would fall to 6.3 percent. Both numbers are better than the 5 percent minimum under current regulations, but they show Citigroup having a bigger cushion to weather losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That does not make a lot of sense to Kathleen Shanley, a bond analyst at GimmeCredit, a research service for institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't say that Citi is safer than JPMorgan, for a variety of reasons, including its track record," Shanley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup has lower credit ratings than JPMorgan, and prices for credit default swaps show the market views JPMorgan as safer. Citigroup is the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets and JPMorgan is the biggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Federal Reserve spokeswoman declined to comment, as did representatives for Citigroup and JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY CITI LOOKS SAFE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's score came out better partly because it started the test with a better Tier 1 common ratio, 12.7 percent compared with JPMorgan's 10.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The starting ratios were based on the banks' financial statements at the end of September. They were calculated based on a set of international regulations known as Basel 1, which the Federal Reserve intends to replace as inadequate with a pending new set known as Basel 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the expected Basel 3 rules, Citigroup has estimated its ratio was 8.6 percent at the end of the third quarter, about the same as the 8.4 percent JPMorgan estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the reasons that Citigroup's ratio will fall so much under Basel 3 from the Basel 1 level is that the new rules will not treat as favorably Citigroup's deferred tax assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup expects those assets to allow it to pay lower taxes on future profits because it lost so much money when the financial crisis and recession hit. Also, Basel 3 will reduce the benefits of stakes Citigroup has in joint ventures, such as its brokerage with Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve did not publish stress scores for the banks under Basel 3 because the regulators have not finalized those rules yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Cannon said there was one reason to think of Citigroup as being safer: its capital markets business is smaller than JPMorgan's. Regulators regard capital markets operations as riskier than consumer banking businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROOM FOR SUBJECTIVITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed's scoring is also at odds with results some of the banks calculated for themselves under the same scenarios, which shows there is room for subjectivity in the testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, for example, found that its ratio would fall to 7.6 percent, significantly better than the 6.3 percent reported by the Fed. Goldman Sachs Group Inc determined its low during the hypothetical stress period would be 8.6 percent, compared with the 5.8 percent reported by the Fed, with some of the difference related to its extensive capital markets activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co pegged its low at 8.3 percent compared with the Fed's 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo said in a statement that it could not fully explain the difference because the Fed does not disclose all of the models it uses to score the banks. The bank said that for some securities, it takes into account more risk factors than the regulators do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is primarily model-driven assumptions that will drive the differences," said Fernando De La Mora, who leads PricewaterhouseCoopers' banking and capital markets risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, differences between scores by the banks and by the regulator were not disclosed, but people in the industry knew of significant disagreements over expected losses in some portfolios, said De La Mora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the Fed told the banks that it "will focus on the robustness" of each bank's testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Citigroup, the Fed's ratio this year of 8.3 percent was nearly as high as the 8.4 percent the bank tallied for itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Rick Rothacker in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, Martin Howell and Peter Cooney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - There was no place like "Oz" at the weekend box office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co's big-budget 3D movie "Oz the Great and Powerful" amassed $80.3 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales, the biggest domestic debut of 2013. The prequel starring James Franco added $69.9 million in international markets, Disney said, for a combined $150.2 million opening around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oz" dominated all other movies over the weekend, according to studio estimates released on Sunday. Another family film, "Jack the Giant Slayer," finished a distant No. 2 with $10 million domestically during its second weekend. Melissa McCarthy comedy "Identity Thief" landed third with $6.3 million from Friday through Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opening numbers for "Oz" provided a strong start for the $200-million production, a prequel to 1939 Hollywood classic "The Wizard of Oz." The movie stars Franco as a small-time magician who is whisked by hot-air balloon to a magical land where he is mistaken for a wizard. Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz play three witches the wizard encounters on his journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney spent up to $100 million on a marketing campaign that featured the cross-country tour of a bright blue, Oz-themed hot-air balloon, a commercial during the Super Bowl, and movie-related fashions sold on shopping channel HSN. [ID:nL1N0BRAKB]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expensive gamble paid off as families turned out to see the story of how the famous wizard came to lead the colorful land of Oz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's executive vice president for motion picture distribution Dave Hollis said the film hit a "sweet spot" in terms of timing; over the next few weeks, there will be little competition in the family film market, and many kids in the United States will be on school breaks and thus more likely to head to theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was mum on reports of a sequel. "It's too early to say too much," Hollis said. "I'm not really a part of that conversation at this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the weekend, Disney had projected domestic sales of around $70 million, while some box-office analysts saw receipts hitting as much as $85 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big debut for "Oz" outshined the sluggish opening a week earlier for "Jack the Giant Slayer," another family-oriented film that puts a modern spin on a classic children's tale. The new take on "Jack and the Beanstalk," which cost $189 million to produce, pulled in $27.2 million at North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters during its first three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Sunday, "Jack" had earned a total of $43.8 million domestically, plus $22.6 million from international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weekend's other new release, thriller "Dead Man Down," landed in fourth place on North American charts with $5.4 million. The movie stars Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace as two strangers who join together to seek revenge against a New York crime lord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug drama "Snitch" took fifth place with $5.1 million in domestic sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc, released "Jack the Giant Slayer." "Identity Thief" was distributed by Universal Pictures, a unit of Comcast Corp. Privately held FilmDistrict released "Dead Man Down." "21 and Over" was released by privately held Relativity Media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lisa Richwine and Andrea Burzynski; Editing by Bill Trott and Christopher Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA (Reuters) - Bolivian President Evo Morales suggested on Monday that the next Pope try wine made from coca leaf, something Bolivians have chewed for centuries and can also be used to make cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morales, himself a former coca leaf farmer who has fought to decriminalize its use by indigenous people, sang its praises at a meeting of the U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs and said the crop would be part of his country's drive to industrialize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recalled how Frenchman Angelo Mariani had won a Vatican gold medal in the 19th century for his coca wine, adding: "I really hope the new Pope, who should be named soon, will also use the wine like Mariani."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roman Catholic cardinals have assembled in Rome to elect a new Pope in secret voting starting on Tuesday, following the abdication of Pope Benedict last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mariani's tonic wine was prized in his time for its perceived benefits for health and vitality, and was enjoyed by public figures ranging from Queen Victoria to Thomas Edison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, popes Pius X and Leo XIII enjoyed drinking Mariani wine from coca leaves, which Bolivians traditionally chew as a mild stimulant that reduces hunger and altitude sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolivia said in January it had been re-admitted to the U.N. anti-narcotics convention after persuading members to recognize the right of its indigenous people to chew the leaf. Morales thanked the conference for that gesture on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca leaf was declared an illegal narcotic in the 1961 U.N. Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, along with substances including cocaine, heroin, opium and morphine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolivia is the biggest cocaine producer after fellow South American states Peru and Colombia. But Morales said the coca plant offers health benefits and has many legitimate uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have mate (tea), we have wine, we have toothpaste, we have many products," he said. "We even use coca in wedding cakes. It is very fashionable now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Derek Brooks; writing by Michael Shields; editing by Mark Heinrich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresh off debating the deficit with Joe Scarborough on Charlie Rose, Paul Krugman is now tangling with fellow lefty economist Jeffrey Sachs. At issue is the government&#8217;s post-crisis stimulus spending, and the basic tenets of Keynesianism. Or at least that&#8217;s what Sachs would have you believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sachs and Scarborough co-authored a Washington Post op-ed titled &#8220;Deficits Do Matter&#8221;, accusing Krugman of a crude interpretation of Keynes. Specifically, they say that short-term stimulus spending hasn&#8217;t achieved increased growth. (Krugman, by contrast, has long called the stimulus too small.) Sachs and Scarborough warn that things will only get worse as the US population ages, and healthcare costs increase. Keynes wouldn&#8217;t have approved, they say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keynes worried about the long-term buildup of public debt and called for balancing the budget over the course of a business cycle &#8212; allowing deficits during downturns to be offset by surpluses during good times. Unfortunately, Republicans and Democrats spent the past decade supporting reckless tax cuts, irresponsible wars and budget commitments without supporting revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The econoblogosphere has waded in to sort things out. Brad DeLong points to a citation error in Sachs&#8217;s op-ed: &#8220;to support the claim that Krugman said deficits dont matter, Scarborough and Sachs point to Krugman saying explicitly that people who say deficits dont matter are wrong&#8221;. Mark Thoma does a nice job of pointing out some of the less charitable parts of Sachs and Scarborough&#8217;s piece: Krugman doesn&#8217;t deny that the US has a long-term debt problem, and he&#8217;s backed stimulus spending because &#8220;short-run multipliers are sufficiently large, there is substantial cyclical unemployment, and our debt problems are not immediate.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Cooper pushes back on Sachs&#8217; claim that the 2009 stimulus wasn&#8217;t worth it. The stimulus spent money, he says, on precisely the things Sachs wants to spend money on: renewable energy, as well as rail and highway maintenance. Dean Baker notes that the stimulus is estimated to have created 2-3 million jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sachs took to his Huffington Post blog to respond in detail to these criticisms, sticking to his thesis that short-term stimulus does little to help the economy, and erodes the public&#8217;s belief that government spending can be effective. Tyler Cowen agrees, and calls for a &#8220;much longer-term perspective for government spending decisions&#8221;. Krugman isn&#8217;t changing his views in response. He might not need to. In the larger context of fiscal policy, as evidenced by Sachs&#8217; recent FT column, there&#8217;s not much they disagree on.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded two and affirmed 13 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase
Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2003-PM1 (JPMCC 2003-PM1). A
detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

The downgrades reflect expected losses from loans in special servicing including
loans in the top 15 with continued underperformance. The affirmations reflect
sufficient credit enhancement to the remaining Fitch classes after consideration
of expected losses. 

Fitch modeled losses of 12.8% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the
original pool balance total 9.2%, including losses already incurred. The pool
has experienced $20.8 million (1.8% of the original pool balance) in realized
losses to date. Fitch has designated 22 loans (21.1%) as Fitch Loans of Concern,
which includes eight specially serviced assets (10.8%). 

As of the February 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal
balance has been reduced by 42% to $666.8 million from $1.2 billion at issuance.
Per the servicer reporting, 23 loans (32% of the pool) are defeased. Interest
shortfalls are currently affecting classes J through P. The Rating Outlooks on
classes A-4 through B remain Stable. 

The largest contributor to expected losses is the Palm Beach Mall loan (6.5%).
While the loan is no longer secured by any collateral, an outstanding debt of
$43.6 million remains in the pool. The property was sold in October 2011, but
only $5.6 million was applied to the debt. The special servicer, ORIX, elected
not to make a final recovery determination or write down the remaining principal
balance of the loan until their ongoing litigation with the loan sponsor, Simon
Property Group has been resolved. Proceeds of the sale were used to repay
advances, fund a debt service and legal expense reserve (expected to keep loan
current until April 2013), and pay down a portion of the balance. Remaining
reserves are not allocated to principal repayment of the loan. As such, Fitch
modeled a full loss on the outstanding principal balance. 

The next largest contributor to losses (1.8%) is secured by a 127,676 sf office
property located in Hauppauge, NY. The loan transferred to special servicing in
September 2009 due to imminent default. The asset is being marketed for sale. 

The third largest contributor to expected losses (3.3%) is an office complex
consisting of four two-story office buildings located in Carlsbad, CA. The
properties have been experiencing a decline in cash flow due to lower occupancy.
Additionally, the properties face significant tenant rollover risk in the next
three years. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

The ratings of the 'AAA' classes are expected to remain stable. The Negative
Outlook on classes C through E reflect the likelihood of interest shortfalls
impacting these classes as the Palm Beach Mall loan is expected to begin
shorting their debt service starting in May. According to Fitch's global
criteria for rating caps, Fitch will not assign or maintain 'AAsf' ratings for
notes that it considers to have a high level of vulnerability to interest
shortfalls or deferrals, even if permitted under the terms of the documents
('Criteria for Rating Caps in Global Structured Finance Transactions', dated
Aug. 2, 2012). The distressed classes (those rated below 'B') are expected to be
subject to further downgrades as losses are realized. Furthermore, any prolonged
workouts may result in increased fees and expenses, leading to further
downgrades. 

Fitch downgrades the following classes and revises Rating Outlooks as indicated:


--$13 million class E to 'BBsf' from 'BBB-sf'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$13 million class G to 'Csf' from 'CCCsf'; RE 0%. 

Fitch affirms the following classes and revises the Rating Outlooks as
indicated: 

--$241.6 million class A1A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$244.6 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$33.2 million class B at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$13 million class C at 'AAsf'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$27.5 million class D at 'BBBsf; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$15.9 million class F at 'CCCsf'; RE 80%; 

--$18.8 million class H at 'Csf'; RE 0%; 

--$15.9 million class J at 'Csf/RE 0%'; 

--$7.2 million class K at 'Csf/RE 0%'; 

--$8.7 million class L at 'Csf/RE 0%'; 

--$7.2 million class M at 'Csf/RE 0%'; 

--$4.3 million class N at 'Csf/RE 0%'; 

--$2.8 million class P at 'Dsf/RE 0%'. 

Fitch does not rate class NR. Classes A-1 through A-3 have paid in full. Fitch
has previously withdrawn the ratings on the interest only class X-1 and X-2
notes.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The newest stress tests for U.S. banks produced scores that are at odds with other measures of lenders' safety, in another sign that some institutions may be too big for regulators to understand and executives to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Citigroup Inc, which has been bailed out multiple times by the U.S. government, showed up on the score sheets posted by the Federal Reserve on Thursday as being clearly safer than JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That conclusion is at odds with the views of investors, bond analysts and credit-rating agencies, as well as when measured by a yardstick regulators themselves want to use in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the end of the day, there is a legitimate question about the ability of regulators to fully evaluate $2 trillion institutions because of the complexity and exposures they have," said Fred Cannon, director of U.S. research at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the Federal Reserve reported the latest results of the tests that began after the 2007-2009 financial crisis to determine if banks have enough capital to withstand a severe economic crisis. The Fed concluded that the banks are in "a much stronger position" than before the financial crisis in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While experts are not arguing with the fact that the banks are better capitalized now and that the system is safer than it was in the run-up to the financial crisis, some of the numbers the regulators published left analysts and bank executives groping for explanations. The test raises questions about the ability of regulators to head off the next big threat to the financial system because of the complexity of the institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are also important as they will help the Fed decide how much capital banks can return to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report showed that Citigroup's capital, as tracked by the Tier 1 common capital ratio, would dip to 8.3 percent during two years of hypothetical stress. JPMorgan's would fall to 6.3 percent. Both numbers are better than the 5 percent minimum under current regulations, but they show Citigroup having a bigger cushion to weather losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That does not make a lot of sense to Kathleen Shanley, a bond analyst at Gimme Credit, a research service for institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't say that Citi is safer than JPMorgan, for a variety of reasons, including its track record," Shanley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup has lower credit ratings than JPMorgan, and prices for credit default swaps show the market views JPMorgan as safer. Citigroup is the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets and JPMorgan is the biggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Federal Reserve spokeswoman declined to comment, as did representatives for Citigroup and JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY CITI LOOKS SAFE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's score came out better partly because it started the test with a better Tier 1 common ratio, 12.7 percent compared with JPMorgan's 10.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The starting ratios were based on the banks' financial statements at the end of September. They were calculated based on a set of international regulations known as Basel 1, which the Federal Reserve intends to replace as inadequate with a pending new set known as Basel 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the expected Basel 3 rules, Citigroup has estimated its ratio was 8.6 percent at the end of the third quarter, about the same as the 8.4 percent JPMorgan estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the reasons that Citigroup's ratio will fall so much under Basel 3 from the Basel 1 level is that the new rules will not treat as favorably Citigroup's deferred tax assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup expects those assets to allow it to pay lower taxes on future profits because it lost so much money when the financial crisis and recession hit. Also, Basel 3 will reduce the benefits of stakes Citigroup has in joint ventures, such as its brokerage with Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve did not publish stress scores for the banks under Basel 3 because the regulators have not finalized those rules yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Cannon said there was one reason to think of Citigroup as being safer: its capital markets business is smaller than JPMorgan's. Regulators regard capital markets operations as riskier than consumer banking businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROOM FOR SUBJECTIVITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed's scoring is also at odds with results some of the banks calculated for themselves under the same scenarios, which shows there is room for subjectivity in the testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, for example, found that its ratio would fall to 7.6 percent, significantly better than the 6.3 percent reported by the Fed. Goldman Sachs Group Inc determined its low during the hypothetical stress period would be 8.6 percent, compared with the 5.8 percent reported by the Fed, with some of the difference related to its extensive capital markets activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co pegged its low at 8.3 percent compared with the Fed's 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo said in a statement that it could not fully explain the difference because the Fed does not disclose all of the models it uses to score the banks. The bank said that for some securities, it takes into account more risk factors than the regulators do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is primarily model-driven assumptions that will drive the differences," said Fernando De La Mora, who leads PricewaterhouseCoopers' banking and capital markets risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, differences between scores by the banks and by the regulator were not disclosed, but people in the industry knew of significant disagreements over expected losses in some portfolios, said De La Mora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the Fed told the banks that it "will focus on the robustness" of each bank's testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Citigroup, the Fed's ratio this year of 8.3 percent was nearly as high as the 8.4 percent the bank tallied for itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Rick Rothacker in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, Martin Howell and Peter Cooney)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story corrects name of research service in 9th paragraph to Gimme Credit from GimmeCredit)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Commodity revenues at leading Wall Street firms crashed last year to their lowest on record, as tighter regulation and limited price swings squeezed the once dominant traders of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan commodity revenue down 16 percent in 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* MS commodity revenue down 20 percent last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - Commodity revenues at leading
Wall Street firms crashed last year to their lowest on record,
as tighter regulation and limited price swings squeezed the once
dominant traders of Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three firms reported double-digit percentage declines in
revenues for oil, grains and copper trading in 2012,
illustrating how the one-time 'Wall Street Refiners' have
withered in the face of subdued markets and restrictions on
proprietary trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline is most stark at Goldman, where commodity
revenues collapsed by more than 60 percent year-on-year in 2012
to just $575 million, according to the bank's annual report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long considered the top commodity bank on Wall Street for
its expertise in both physical and financial markets, Goldman's
revenues have now fallen by almost 90 percent since 2009 when
they totaled more than $4.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, Goldman's fellow Wall Street pioneer in
commodity markets three decades ago, reported a 20 percent
decline in commodity revenues in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has grown its commodity business through a
series of bold acquisitions since the 2008 financial crisis and
now surpasses both Goldman and Morgan Stanley, saw revenues
decline 16 percent to $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for the banks, who have regularly declined to
discuss their commodity results since they began revealing them
in filings in 2009, were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, Wall Street's commodity revenues have fallen more
than 50 percent since 2008 to just $6 billion, according to a
survey by London-based research firm Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year commodities made up just 6.5 percent of revenues
from trading fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC),
Coalition said, down from 10.5 percent last year and 30 percent
in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ongoing concerns about increased regulation and capital
sensitivity (are) pushing banks to re-evaluate their commodities
strategies," Coalition said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIGHTENING REGULATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest results pose questions about how the banks' may
adapt in the commodities sector, which was estimated to be worth
as much as $14 billion to Wall Street annually at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Goldman and Morgan Stanley's lead, the boom in
resource markets that started 10 years ago attracted many big
banks to trade oil, metals and agricultural products, but many
have struggled since the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule has placed restrictions on trading
positions held purely for the banks' own profits as part of the

2012, that was just $1 more than the average price in the
previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's continued ownership of physical commodity
assets, including power plants, oil storage tanks and metals
warehouses, is also still under question after the conversion of
Goldman and Morgan Stanley to Bank Holding Companies during the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last year, Morgan Stanley held discussions about
selling part of its commodities business to the Qatari sovereign
wealth fund, though that deal appears to be on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Reuters' calculations, revenues at Morgan Stanley's
commodity business peaked at around $3 billion in 2008, but have
since declined to just over $1 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Goldman Sachs denied it had ever "seriously"
looked at splitting off its commodities business, after reports
said it had held "preliminary internal discussions" about a
possible spin-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At JPMorgan, which is a relatively late entrant to
large-scale commodity trading following its acquisition of RBS
Sempra's metals and energy trading desks in 2010, the 16 percent
decline may create concern rather than panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global commodity chief Blythe Masters has largely succeeded
in her goal of surpassing Goldman and Morgan Stanley as the
largest bank in commodities, though industry experts say
JPMorgan may now start to focus more on costs to boost
profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said last year it has 600 professionals in its
commodity division, and 10 offices globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 11 (Reuters) - Coal miner Walter Energy Inc,
in the midst of a spat with a British hedge fund that is looking
to replace half of its board, said it could further cut
production at underperforming mines and explore the sale of
non-core assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which has already curtailed production at
low-margin mines by more than 1 million metric tons, did not
give details on where the production cuts could be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audley Capital Advisors LLP said last month that it planned
to nominate five candidates to the board, saying investors had
lost confidence in the current board. Audley Capital holds less
than one percent of Walter Energy shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our progress should not be interrupted by the efforts of
Julian Treger's UK hedge fund, Audley Capital, which, with less
than 1 percent of the Company's shares and no articulated plans
for delivering shareholder value, has said it intends to seek 50
percent of the company's board seats," Walter Energy said in a
letter to shareholders on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also urged shareholders to re-elect their board, saying
that a change in leadership could derail the company's progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audley Capital in response urged shareholders not to support
the company's nominees, saying that they would be much better
served by its slate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy has 10 board members, including nine
independent directors and its chief executive. The company's
2013 annual meeting will be held on April 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which has operations in western Canada, the
United States and the United Kingdom, produced 11.7 million
metric tons of metallurgical, or steelmaking, coal in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miners such as Walter Energy, Alpha Natural Resources
, Consol Energy Inc and Arch Coal Inc 
have shut production as prices of steelmaking coal plunged about
50 percent in 2012.

Project delivered on schedule and within budget
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil has started production from the Telok natural gas field, located
offshore Malaysia in the South China Sea. 

"The Telok development will help meet increasing demand for natural gas in
Peninsular Malaysia," said Neil W. Duffin, president of ExxonMobil Development
Company. "It is one of many natural gas developments ExxonMobil will bring on
stream in the next few years around the world." 

The development concept of "design one, build many" was utilized to efficiently
develop the project and shorten construction and installation timelines,
allowing Telok to be completed on schedule and within budget. 

The Telok A platform is the first phase of the Telok natural gas project, which
when completed will consist of two four-legged unmanned gas satellite platforms.
Full well stream gas will be produced via a new 16-mile pipeline to the existing
Guntong E platform for processing. A total of 14 development wells are planned
for the Telok A and B platforms. 

The Telok gas field is located about 124 miles offshore the east coast of
Peninsular Malaysia. The field was developed under a gas production sharing
contract, and is a 50-50 joint venture between ExxonMobil, the operator, and
PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Estimates, expectations, and business plans in this
release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including
production rates, ultimate recoveries, and project plans and schedules, could
differ materially due to changes in market conditions affecting the oil and gas
industry or long-term oil and gas price levels; political or regulatory
developments; reservoir performance; timely completion of development projects;
technical or operating factors; and other factors discussed under the heading
"Factors Affecting Future Results" in the Investor Information section of our
website (www.exxonmobil.com) and in Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K.
References to "recoverable resources" and similar terms include quantities of
oil and gas that are not yet classified as proved reserves but that we believe
will be produced in the future. The term "project" as used in this release does
not necessarily have the same meaning as under SEC Rule 13q-1 relating to
government payment reporting. A single project for purposes of that rule may
encompass numerous properties, agreements, investments, developments, phases,
work efforts, activities, and components, each of which we may also describe
informally as a "project".

$100 Million Will Benefit Women Entrepreneurs within Coca-Cola`s 5by20 Economic
Empowerment Initiative


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company and IFC (International Finance Corporation), a member of
the World Bank Group, today announced a $100 million, three-year joint
initiative to provide access to finance for women entrepreneurs in Eurasia and
Africa. 

The collaboration builds on the synergies between Coca-Cola`s 5by20 women`s
economic empowerment initiative and IFC`s Banking on Women program to help
address barriers women entrepreneurs commonly face in some of the world`s
poorest countries. IFC will work through its network of local and regional
banking institutions to provide financing and business skills training to small
and medium sized businesses that are owned or operated by women entrepreneurs
across the Coca-Cola value chain. 

"Women entrepreneurs make significant contributions to emerging and developing
economies, yet have lower access to finance than their male counterparts. By
providing greater access to capital, we are investing in our own success and the
success of the communities we serve," said Nathan Kalumbu, president of Eurasia
and Africa Group, The Coca-Cola Company. "We are excited about this opportunity
to harness the collective power of our organizations to positively impact women
in Eurasia and Africa." 

"Women entrepreneurs represent significant untapped economic potential in
developing countries-they are essential for creating jobs and achieving
sustainable growth," said James Scriven, IFC Director of Financial Markets.
"This innovative partnership with Coca-Cola will help expand access to finance
for thousands of women who are part of the company`s supply and distribution
chain." 

Work related to this initiative is already beginning in Nigeria. Coca-Cola and
IFC are working with Access Bank to provide financing to women
micro-distributors (MDCs) in the Coca-Cola value chain, in close collaboration
with Coca-Cola`s bottling partner, Nigerian Bottling Company. 

This initiative with IFC is a notable milestone for 5by20, The Coca-Cola
Company`s global initiative to enable the economic empowerment of five million
women across the Company`s global value chain by 2020. Launched in 2010, 5by20
is helping women succeed as entrepreneurs, while also creating thriving,
sustainable communities by providing access to business skills, financial
services, assets and support networks of peers and mentors. 5by20 currently has
programs in 12 countries. 

IFC Banking on Women is playing a catalyzing role helping financial institutions
and corporate partners like The Coca-Cola Company, and chambers of commerce to
profitably and sustainably serve businesses owned by women, focusing on regions
and countries that have strong enabling ecosystems for small and medium
enterprises and large numbers of women entrepreneurs. The Banking on Women
portfolio has made 20 investments in Eastern Europe, East Asia and Africa and a
robust pipeline of new investments is under development. 

About IFC

IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development
institution focused exclusively on the private sector. IFC helps developing
countries achieve sustainable growth by financing investment, mobilizing capital
in international financial markets, and providing advisory services to
businesses and governments. In FY12, IFC`s investments reached an all-time high
of more than $20 billion, leveraging the power of the private sector to create
jobs, spark innovation, and tackle the world`s most pressing development
challenges. For more information, visit www.ifc.org.

Developer hack-a-thon to create Microsoft + FreedomPay digital wallet
applications
RADNOR, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
FreedomPay has been invited by Microsoft to lead a week long development session
at the #DigitalWalletFoundry event. With digital wallets being the hub of value
for banks, retailers, and consumers alike, and the lynchpin of mobile payments
innovation, both FreedomPay and Microsoft will collaborate with the region`s
burgeoning tech-savvy and creative population to kick start the innovative
development of digital wallet applications. Digital Wallet Foundry takes place
March 18-22, 2013 at the ultra-hip Modern Jago building in London`s East End. 

"In the past, the payments business was very transactional. Today, social and
mobile connectivity means the payments business is an information business,"
commented Colin Kerr, industry solutions director, worldwide financial services
at Microsoft. "The heart of this is the digital wallet, and Microsoft has
identified FreedomPay with its SEEK Commerce Platform as a strategic partner
aligned closely with the Microsoft go to market strategy for innovative payment
and mobile wallet solutions on Windows Azure and Windows Phone." 

At this event developers, designers and industry thought leaders from the
world`s leading banks and mobile operators are coming together to collaborate on
everything from envisioning, defining wallet strategies and business planning,
to coding and agile project development. At the event, developers will be tasked
to develop `proof of concept` demonstrations within the 5-day, hack-a-thon style
event. The week will conclude with awards and recognition for products conceived
and developed during the week. 

Developers will have access to the full suite of APIs that drive the powerful
SEEK Commerce Platform built on the Microsoft platform. These APIs allows
developers to perform traditional and mobile payments, tokenization and
tokenized payments, Point-To-Point Encrypted (P2PE) transactions, incentives,
loyalty and data as a service transactions. 

"The scope and pace of social and technological change is challenging the global
banking industry to build new consumer touch points to service their customers,"
noted Tom Durovsik, CEO at FreedomPay, Inc. "Today, connectivity, convergence
and communication have become generational buzz words in an attempt to reach
customers anytime, anywhere and on any device. The FreedomPay Commerce Platform,
in conjunction with Windows Azure cloud computing technology addresses the
global enterprise and financial institution solution requirements."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Goldman commodity revenues down 90 pct since 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan commodity revenues down 16 percent in 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* MS commodity revenues down 20 percent last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - Wall Street commodity
revenues crashed last year to their lowest on record, as tighter
regulation and limited price swings squeezed the once dominant
traders of Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
 and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three firms reported double-digit percentage declines in
revenues for oil, grains and copper trading in 2012,
illustrating how the one-time 'Wall Street Refiners' have
withered in the face of subdued markets and restrictions on
proprietary trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline is most stark at Goldman, where commodity
revenues collapsed by more than 60 percent year-on-year in 2012
to just $575 million, according to the bank's annual report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long considered the top commodity bank on Wall Street for
its expertise in both physical and financial markets, Goldman's
revenues have now fallen by almost 90 percent since 2009 when
they totaled more than $4.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, Goldman's fellow Wall Street pioneer in
commodity markets three decades ago, reported a 20 percent
decline in commodity revenues in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has grown its commodity business through a
series of bold acquisitions since the 2008 financial crisis and
now surpasses both Goldman and Morgan Stanley, saw revenues
decline by 16 percent to $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for the banks, who have regularly declined to
discuss their commodity results since they began revealing them
in filings in 2009, were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIGHTENING REGULATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest results pose questions about the banks' future
strategy in the commodities sector, which was estimated to be
worth as much as $14 billion to Wall Street annually at its
peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Goldman and Morgan Stanley's lead, the boom in
resource markets that started 10 years ago attracted many big
banks to trade oil, metals and agricultural products, but many
have struggled since the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule has placed restrictions on trading
positions held purely for the banks' own profits as part of the
Dodd-Frank Act. Lower market volatility has also cut into
clients' trading and hedging activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brent crude oil averaged a record $112 a barrel in
2012, that was just $1 more than the average price in the
previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's continued ownership of physical commodity
assets, including power plants, oil storage tanks and metals
warehouses, is also still under question after the conversion of
Goldman and Morgan Stanley to Bank Holding Companies during the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last year, Morgan Stanley held discussions about
selling part of its commodities business to the Qatari sovereign
wealth fund, though that deal appears to be on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Reuters' calculations, revenues at Morgan Stanley's
commodity business peaked at around $3 billion in 2008, but have
since declined to just over $1 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Goldman Sachs denied it had ever "seriously"
looked at splitting off its commodities business, after reports
said it had held "preliminary internal discussions" about a
possible spin-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At JPMorgan, which is a relatively late entrant to
large-scale commodity trading following its acquisition of RBS
Sempra's metals and energy trading desks in 2010, the 16 percent
decline may create concern rather than panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global commodity chief Blythe Masters has largely succeeded
in her goal of surpassing Goldman and Morgan as the largest bank
in commodities, though industry experts say JPMorgan may now
start to focus more on costs to boost profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said last year it has 600 professionals in its
commodity division, and 10 offices globally.&lt;/p&gt;

Board Level Change is Urgently Needed

Audley Capital`s Five Highly-Qualified Director Nominees Will Bring Needed
Experience and Accountability
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Audley Capital Advisors LLP ("Audley Capital") today urged stockholders of
Walter Energy, Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT) ("Walter Energy" or "the Company")
not to take any action in response to the Company`s proxy materials for the
Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April 25, 2013. In addition, Audley Capital
urges stockholders not to sign or return any WHITE proxy card that they may
receive with the Company's proxy materials. 

Audley Capital will soon be sending stockholders a definitive proxy statement
and a GOLD proxy card. 

Julian Treger, Managing Partner of Audley Capital, said, "We are working to
benefit all Walter Energy stockholders and firmly maintain that our Board
nominees are the ideal candidates to implement initiatives that will create
lasting value at Walter Energy. We continue to believe that there is substantial
value that is not currently reflected in Walter Energy`s share price due to the
financial and operational performance of the current Board and management.
Supporting the current slate proposed by the Company's Board will only enable
the Board and management to continue to lead the Company down a path that has
cost stockholders dearly. We believe stockholders will be much better served by
Audley Capital's slate of highly-qualified and experienced nominees." 

Audley Capital`s director nominees include individuals with extensive experience
in the metallurgical coal industry on an international basis and possess the
skills required to manage multi-jurisdictional coal operations and their
financing. The nominees are:

now known as BHP Billiton Energy Coal South Africa. In this role Mr. Scholtz
oversaw one of the largest coal businesses in the world. More recently Mr.
Scholtz was also Managing Director for BHP Billiton's bauxite and alumina
operations in Suriname in South America and was formerly Chief Operating Officer
for TSX-listed CIC Energy Corp, which was acquired by Jindal Steel and Power
Limited in 2012, and was formerly President and CEO of TSX-listed Talon Metals
Corp. 

Mr. Scholtz has undertaken management development studies at London Business
School, University of South Africa (UNISA), and University of Cape Town's
Graduate Business School. 

Mr. Mark Lochtenberg (52)

Formerly the co-head of Glencore International AG`s worldwide coal division, Mr.
Mark Lochtenberg spent 13 years at Glencore`s commodity trading concern,
overseeing a range of trading activities including the purchase and aggregation

Mr. Lochtenberg had established a coal "swaps" market for Bain Refco (Deutsche
Bank) after having served as coal marketing manager for Peko Wallsend Limited.
He is also a director of Australian Transport and Energy Corridor Limited
("ATEC") and an alternate director of Surat Basin Rail Pty Ltd. Mr. Lochtenberg
is currently the Executive Chairman and a founding executive director of
ASX-listed Cockatoo Coal Limited. 

Mr. Lochtenberg graduated with a Bachelor of Law (Hons) degree from Liverpool

called on Western Coal`s management to engage with potential acquirers to
consider a sale of the business in 2010 when the stock was trading in the range
of C$4.00 to C$5.00 per share. The company was eventually sold to Walter Energy
in 2010 for C$11.50 per share. Mr. Treger also helped uncover significant value

a number of coal investments in Australia, Canada and South Africa. Through
related entities, Mr. Treger also acts as an advisor to the Audley family of
funds, which are shareholders in Walter Energy. Prior to starting Audley, he

Walter Energy Outlines Progress on Business Plan and Value Creation
Initiatives in Letter to Shareholders

BIRMINGHAM, AL--(Marketwire - March 11, 2013) - Walter Energy Inc. (NYSE: WLT)
(TSX: WLT) today began mailing the proxy statement for its Annual Meeting of
Shareholders scheduled for April 25, 2013. In addition, Michael T. Tokarz,
Chairman of the Board, and Walter J. Scheller, III, Chief Executive Officer
and Director, sent a letter to all Walter Energy shareholders outlining
progress made in executing the Company's strategy to achieve profitable growth
in anticipation of the recovery of met coal prices.

"The Board and management are intensely focused on maximizing the value of
your investment in the Company," Messrs. Tokarz and Scheller state in the
letter. "Moreover, we are committed to pursuing operational and financial
initiatives that will support and accelerate our efforts -- including, if
value creating, further reducing production at any underperforming mines and
exploring non-core asset sales."

Text of letter from Messrs. Tokarz and Scheller to Walter Energy shareholders:

March 11, 2013

Dear Fellow Walter Energy Shareholders:

Your Board, together with your Company's new senior management team, has made
significant progress in executing a new strategic course for Walter Energy. We
have created a geographically diversified, high-quality metallurgical (met)
coal company and have overseen a significant increase in the production at our
mines. Moreover, we have accomplished these objectives while taking decisive
steps to materially reduce our operating costs in the context of navigating a
challenging cyclical trough in met coal demand and pricing. As a result of
these initiatives, the Company and its shareholders are well positioned to
benefit fully from the anticipated recovery of the met coal market.

At our April 25th Annual Meeting, you will have the opportunity to re-elect
the Board of Directors of Walter Energy. We encourage you to vote today by
telephone, by Internet, or by signing and dating the enclosed WHITE proxy card
and returning it in the postage-paid envelope provided.

The Board and management are intensely focused on maximizing the value of your
investment in the Company. We believe the disciplined execution of Walter
Energy's business plan by our talented and experienced management team has put
the Company on course to achieve this objective. Moreover, we are committed to
pursuing operational and financial initiatives that will support and
accelerate our efforts -- including, if value creating, further reducing
production at any underperforming mines and exploring non-core asset sales.

Our progress should not be interrupted by the efforts of Julian Treger's U.K.
hedge fund, Audley Capital, which, with less than 1% of the Company's shares
and no articulated plans for delivering shareholder value, has said it intends
to seek 50% of the Company's Board seats.

We do not believe it is in our shareholders' best interest to risk
jeopardizing our strong operational momentum as our efforts gain traction.
Your Board has been instrumental in driving and supporting Walter Energy's new
leadership and business initiatives. Now is not the time for change to our
Company's leadership that could derail that progress.

In our view, replacing our highly-qualified, engaged and independent directors
with the Audley Capital bloc consisting of Mr. Treger and his four other
nominees would be detrimental to the value of your investment.

OUR BUSINESS PLAN POSITIONS YOUR COMPANY FOR PROFITABLE GROWTH 

The full focus of our Board and management is to position Walter Energy for
vigorous and profitable growth in anticipation of the recovery of met coal
prices.

We know our job is to continue to perform in the face of industry challenges.
To that end, we have aggressively pursued critical steps to improve our
results and reposition our assets. This effort has been led by Chief Executive
Walter Scheller, who was appointed CEO by your Board 18 months ago and brings
a significant track record of success in our industry. Following are notable
2012 milestones:


Safely increased production of high quality met coal by 35% to a record 11.7
million metric tons while reducing total reportable injuries by 26% from 2011.



Improved average met coal cash cost per ton of production by 6% in 2012
compared to 2011 and 20% in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth
quarter of 2011. 


Curtailed production at low margin mines by more than 1 million metric tons
and transitioned the Brule and Willow Creek mines from contractor-operated to
owner-operated. 


Reduced SGA by 19% and tightened capital spending. 


Maximized cash flow to pursue further debt reduction and improved liquidity
and debt maturity profile. 


Transformed the management team, adding three talented new executives in key
positions and elevating two experienced and proven leaders to run its two key
operating businesses. 




As we enter 2013, we have the capacity to produce in excess of 15 million
metric tons of high quality met coal in our existing operations when market
conditions warrant. We also continue to drive greater efficiencies throughout
our business and seize opportunities to generate greater cash flow to improve
our financial flexibility and continue development of our new Blue Creek
Energy Mine in Alabama.

YOUR BOARD HAS A RECORD OF DELIVERING SUPERIOR SHAREHOLDER VALUE 

These positive developments are the most recent in a successful, long-term
transformation of your Company that has created significant value for
shareholders under the leadership of your Board. Walter Energy's directors are
among the most experienced and accomplished in the mining industry and hold
themselves and management accountable for acting in the best interests of all
shareholders. To highlight a few key Board achievements:


Successfully engineered the evolution of Walter Energy into a focused,
pure-play metallurgical coal mining company. 


Implemented spin-offs of Mueller Water and Walter Investment Management,
unlocking significant value for shareholders. 


Presided over the major strategic acquisitions of Western Coal and the Chevron
mineral leases. The now fully-integrated acquisitions have provided Walter
Energy with operating, geographic and customer diversification with a 30+ year
reserve life and in-place valuable growth options.




The broad and diverse expertise of our Board will continue to serve Walter
Energy well. Three experienced coal mining executives are on our Board, as
well as directors with expert knowledge of the corporate governance, finance,
accounting and regulatory requirements applicable to Walter Energy. Together
they provide a balance of fresh perspectives and continuity, with four of the
ten having served less than two years.

To further expand and diversify the Board, Walter Energy recently appointed
Nina Henderson as a Director. She brings significant leadership, governance
and international expertise and experience, having served on numerous
corporate boards including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, The Shell Transport and
Trading Company, AXA Financial, Pactiv Corporation, and the Hunt Corporation.

Your Board has demonstrated responsible stewardship and a clear vision in
serving the best interests of the Company and you, its shareholders.

ON TRACK AND COMMITTED TO SHAREHOLDER VALUE CREATION 

As a result of all we have done and continue to do to position our Company for
the future, we are confident that our shareholders will realize meaningful
value from the long-term growth in demand we expect for met coal. We have the
right team, strong momentum, and a proven track record of delivering
shareholder value. We look forward to our continuing dialogue with you and to
reporting our progress.

Your vote is important in this election, and we urge you to vote TODAY so that
your voice is heard. To elect the Walter Energy Board's nominees, we encourage
you to vote today by telephone, by Internet, or by signing and dating the
enclosed WHITE proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope
provided.

Sincerely,

(SIGNATURE)

Michael T. Tokarz 
Chairman of the Board

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street commodity revenues crashed last year to their lowest on record, as tighter regulation and limited price swings squeezed the once dominant traders of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three firms reported double-digit percentage declines in revenues for oil, grains and copper trading in 2012, illustrating how the one-time 'Wall Street Refiners' have withered in the face of subdued markets and restrictions on proprietary trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline is most stark at Goldman, where commodity revenues collapsed by more than 60 percent year-on-year in 2012 to just $575 million, according to the bank's annual report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long considered the top commodity bank on Wall Street for its expertise in both physical and financial markets, Goldman's revenues have now fallen by almost 90 percent since 2009 when they totaled more than $4.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, Goldman's fellow Wall Street pioneer in commodity markets three decades ago, reported a 20 percent decline in commodity revenues in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has grown its commodity business through a series of bold acquisitions since the 2008 financial crisis and now surpasses both Goldman and Morgan Stanley, saw revenues decline by 16 percent to $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for the banks, who have regularly declined to discuss their commodity results since they began revealing them in filings in 2009, were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIGHTENING REGULATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest results pose questions about the banks' future strategy in the commodities sector, which was estimated to be worth as much as $14 billion to Wall Street annually at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Goldman and Morgan Stanley's lead, the boom in resource markets that started 10 years ago attracted many big banks to trade oil, metals and agricultural products, but many have struggled since the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule has placed restrictions on trading positions held purely for the banks' own profits as part of the Dodd-Frank Act.

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman commodity revenues down 90 pct since 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan commodity revenues down 16 percent in 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* MS commodity revenues down 20 percent last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - Wall Street commodity
revenues crashed last year to their lowest on record, as tighter
regulation and limited price swings squeezed the once dominant
traders of Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
 and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three firms reported double-digit percentage declines in
revenues for oil, grains and copper trading in 2012,
illustrating how the one-time 'Wall Street Refiners' have
withered in the face of subdued markets and restrictions on
proprietary trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline is most stark at Goldman, where commodity
revenues collapsed by more than 60 percent year-on-year in 2012
to just $575 million, according to the bank's annual report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long considered the top commodity bank on Wall Street for
its expertise in both physical and financial markets, Goldman's
revenues have now fallen by almost 90 percent since 2009 when
they totaled more than $4.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, Goldman's fellow Wall Street pioneer in
commodity markets three decades ago, reported a 20 percent
decline in commodity revenues in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has grown its commodity business through a
series of bold acquisitions since the 2008 financial crisis and
now surpasses both Goldman and Morgan Stanley, saw revenues
decline by 16 percent to $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for the banks, who have regularly declined to
discuss their commodity results since they began revealing them
in filings in 2009, were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TIGHTENING REGULATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest results pose questions about the banks' future
strategy in the commodities sector, which was estimated to be
worth as much as $14 billion to Wall Street annually at its
peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Goldman and Morgan Stanley's lead, the boom in
resource markets that started 10 years ago attracted many big
banks to trade oil, metals and agricultural products, but many
have struggled since the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule has placed restrictions on trading
positions held purely for the banks' own profits as part of the
Dodd-Frank Act. Lower market volatility has also cut into
clients' trading and hedging activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brent crude oil averaged a record $112 a barrel in
2012, that was just $1 more than the average price in the
previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's continued ownership of physical commodity
assets, including power plants, oil storage tanks and metals
warehouses, is also still under question after the conversion of
Goldman and Morgan Stanley to Bank Holding Companies during the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last year, Morgan Stanley held discussions about
selling part of its commodities business to the Qatari sovereign
wealth fund, though that deal appears to be on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Reuters' calculations, revenues at Morgan Stanley's
commodity business peaked at around $3 billion in 2008, but have
since declined to just over $1 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Goldman Sachs denied it had ever "seriously"
looked at splitting off its commodities business, after reports
said it had held "preliminary internal discussions" about a
possible spin-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At JPMorgan, which is a relatively late entrant to
large-scale commodity trading following its acquisition of RBS
Sempra's metals and energy trading desks in 2010, the 16 percent
decline may create concern rather than panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global commodity chief Blythe Masters has largely succeeded
in her goal of surpassing Goldman and Morgan as the largest bank
in commodities, though industry experts say JPMorgan may now
start to focus more on costs to boost profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said last year it has 600 professionals in its
commodity division, and 10 offices globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's ambitious bid to overhaul its phone and television markets threatens to eat into revenue of the major players, telecoms tycoon Carlos Slim and TV mogul Emilio Azcarraga, and may force the two to seek new business on each other's turf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new bill aims to stir up competition in the telecoms sector by allowing increased foreign ownership of media and phone companies, and giving regulators the power to force players controlling more than 50 percent of the market to sell some assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planned reform has been hailed as the boldest attempt to shake up the market since Slim, the world's richest man, first acquired former fixed-line phone monopoly Telmex in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telmex is now part of Slim's telecommunications giant America Movil, whose shares have been hit since the reform was presented on Monday. Investors have also sold off shares of Azcarraga's broadcasting giant Televisa, albeit less so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty over how the reforms will be implemented could put further pressure on the share prices of both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that the net risks introduced by this proposal are higher for America Movil than for Televisa, but negative for both," wrote analyst Gregorio Tomassi at Brazil's Itau bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requiring Televisa to offer its public TV channels to rivals for either a reduced rate or free could wipe around 3 percent from the company's core profit, Tomassi estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tough-sounding elements such as forcing dominant companies to sell assets, as well as opening up the market to greater foreign investment would mean lower future revenue for both America Movil and Televisa, analysts agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the government is being aggressive," said Rogelio Gallegos, who manages 8 billion pesos ($640 million)in equity at Mexico City-based Actinver, adding that he expected Televisa and America Movil shares to fall further still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important details of the reform, such as how regulators might force dominant companies to restructure to meet a 50 percent market-share cap, are still to be worked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it is unclear how the bill may fare in Congress, though President Enrique Pena Nieto thrashed out the plan with the leaders of both of Mexico's main opposition parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party say they are confident it will be approved in Congress by May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America Movil (AMXL.MX) (AMX.N) shares have lost almost $5 billion in market value, down 5.8 percent since the reform was announced on Monday, while Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N) shares have lost 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOMINANT PLAYERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telmex controls about 80 percent of the fixed-line market, and Slim's Mexican mobile phone unit Telcel has about 70 percent market share. Total revenues for Slim's phone businesses in Mexico was 277 billion pesos ($22 billion) in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azcarraga's Televisa is estimated to have about 60 percent of Mexico's broadcast market, but because of the more diffuse nature of its business, it is harder for regulators to calculate the company's market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Televisa and America Movil are forced to reduce assets, it would cut cash flow, which could mean the companies would have to reduce their debt loads, said Nymia Almeida, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa and America Movil welcomed the reform in statements released on Monday. Officials for both companies declined to comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not all bad news for Slim and Azcarraga. The two tycoons have battled for years to make inroads into each other's territory. The reform unveiled by Pena Nieto may open the door for them to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 72-year-old Slim has so far been kept out of Mexico's television market, but the bill appears to let him enter it if he can meet certain requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering television would allow Slim to sell so-called triple-play packages bundling phone, Internet and television, something that he has sought for years in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Televisa's cellphone joint venture with rival broadcaster TV Azteca, Iusacell, could benefit if the government forces Slim to cut his market share in Mexico. Iusacell currently has about 6 percent of the Mexican mobile market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESTRUCTURING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Slim and Azcarraga have the option of restructuring their businesses or looking abroad to curb the reform's impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eduardo Garcia, editor-in-chief of Mexican financial website Sentido Comun, said Slim might want to tap the United States for new opportunities and cut his exposure in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He must have a Plan B, and Plan B, in my order of thinking, would be to get rid of what's less profitable to lower his size, but not his profits," said Garcia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slim could reduce his phone presence in poor far-flung rural areas, Garcia said, adding that America Movil has already been preparing for tighter regulation in Mexico with recent expansion into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, however, has been expensive so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, America Movil spent billions of dollars acquiring large stakes in Dutch telecom KPN and Telekom Austria, but the shares of both European companies have tumbled since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa has not taken the same risks to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broadcaster, which is the world's biggest producer of Spanish-language content, is set to face greater competition as the reform will launch two new public television channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Televisa, which has sold its soap operas around the globe, could even benefit by selling its content to new channels, noted Michael Corty, a Chicago-based analyst at Morningstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Content is king," Corty said, "and Televisa is definitely a video content leader."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 12.44 Mexican pesos)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by David Alire Garcia, Alexandra Alper and Dave Graham; Editing by Kieran Murray and Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Says 98 pct of 2017 target producing or being developed
    * Base business decline rate at 3-4 pct, half of 4 years ago
    * Negotiating to add 3 mln acres of shale in Central Europe


    By Braden Reddall
    NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp, the
second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Tuesday it had already
started nearly all the projects that would deliver 25 percent
growth in oil and gas output over the next half a decade.
    At its annual New York meeting with analysts, Chevron said
98 percent of its targeted production by 2017 was already in
design, construction or production.
    Chevron reaffirmed the target of 3.3 million barrels per day
of oil equivalent, up from an estimated 2.65 million bpd this
year. Looking beyond that, the company highlighted expansion in
Kazakhstan, steam-flooded oil production in the Middle East, and
even more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Canada and Australia.
    "We feel very good about our 2017 target, and we anticipate
continuing to grow beyond 3.3 million barrels per day," said
George Kirkland, Chevron's head of exploration and production.
    Increasing production has been a serious challenge for the
world's big oil companies, a trend underlined by last week's
prediction of a 1 percent decline this year by Exxon Mobil Corp
 despite its increased budget of $41 billion.
 
 
    In 2013, Chevron expects to drill about 440 wells in the
Permian basin, located in the west part of Texas and New Mexico.
The company bought assets in the area from Chesapeake Energy
Corp in September, and Kirkland said that acreage
appeared more productive than the initial estimates.
 
    Asked about potential asset sales of its own, Chief
Executive John Watson noted the Permian represented an area
where the company had a legacy position which became attractive
again because of the improvements in shale drilling technology.
    "We'll sell assets when it makes sense to do so," he said.
    Chevron expects to add four rigs in the Permian this year,
bringing the total to 23, and it sees output rising to 200,000
bpd by 2017. Chevron acreage in the Marcellus shale in the
northeastern United States is expected to produce the equivalent
of nearly 100,000 bpd by then.
    To the north, Chevron has just invested in Canada's Kitimat
LNG export project, and Kirkland said the company would want to
have between 60 and 70 percent of its gas committed to long-term
contract before making a final investment decision.
    Chevron is spending $9 billion this year on two LNG projects
in Western Australia alone - a quarter of its company-wide
budget. Spending is expected to remain high for the next few
years until they are complete, with first LNG shipping from its
Gorgon plant due in early 2015.
    The cost estimate for Gorgon recently went up by $15
billion, mostly due to foreign exchange movements, but also
because of bad weather and the challenges of making deliveries
to the remote location. 
    "We'll put more emphasis on logistics on the next project,"
Kirkland said in an interview. "We learned something on that." 
    As for what Chevron is already producing, Watson said the
rate of decline for existing fields was now down to between 3 
and 4 percent, nearly half the level of four years ago.
    Speaking to reporters after the meeting, he said it was too
early to say what opportunities would come out of government
changes in Venezuela and Myanmar - two countries where Chevron
already has interests. 
    "One of the reasons that oil is over $100 a barrel is that
there are a lot of risks," Watson had told the analysts. "I
could alphabetize them."
    It was also too early to say how its Chinese shale
exploration would turn out. But the company remains firmly
committed to shale gas in Central Europe, despite Exxon pulling
out of Poland and Talisman Energy saying on Tuesday it
might do the same. 
    Chevron now has 4 million acres in Central Europe, and is
negotiating for 3 million more, the company said on Tuesday. 
    Shares of Chevron fell slightly to close at $118.25, having
touched a record high of $119.30 earlier in the day.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 began disclosing more information about the way it values
illiquid assets after staff from the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission pressured the bank to do so, according to
documents released on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank and SEC staff corresponded for five
months about how Goldman treats its so-called "Level 3" assets,
which change hands so infrequently that the bank determines
values using its own internal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC asked Goldman to disclose the effect of how it
accounted for offsetting trades with derivatives trading
counterparties, known as "counterparty netting." It also
requested information on cash collateral, as well as a weighted
average of its "unobservable inputs" and additional "qualitative
information" about the range of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman eventually changed its reporting to disclose what
kind of inputs it uses in valuation models - such as bond
yields, loss rates and durations of securities - to satisfy the
SEC's requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letters involving Level 3 assets were sent from the fall
of last year through February, but disclosed on Tuesday. The SEC
also made public other correspondence in which it requested that
Goldman provide more information on how it calculates its
exposure to risky European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Tuesday it had already started nearly all the projects that would deliver 25 percent growth in oil and gas output over the next half a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its annual New York meeting with analysts, Chevron said 98 percent of its targeted production by 2017 was already in design, construction or production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron reaffirmed the target of 3.3 million barrels per day of oil equivalent, and highlighted its expansion in Kazakhstan, steam-flooded oil production in the Middle East, and even more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Canada and Australia.

Advanced Business Intelligence Within Changepoint

 Offers Critical Insight for Companies With Growing, Global Services Organizations

DETROIT, March 12, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Compuware
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10024581=2=Compuware=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.compuware.com%2F
 Corporation (Nasdaq:CPWR) today announced it has partnered with IBM to deliver IBM Business
Analytics within Compuware's market-leading PSA/PPM solution, Changepoint. Through Changepoint,
businesses with growing, global services and IT organizations will now have access to advanced
business analytics for smarter decision-making.

The technology services sector, a key market for Compuware Changepoint, has experienced
significant growth over the last number of years, and according to a research report by Global
Industry Analysts Inc., (GIA),1 this sector -- driven by cloud technology and
software-as-a-service adoption -- is expected to reach a value of $1.2 trillion by 2015. As
companies in this sector grow and mature, they are actively seeking to sharpen business insight,
align metrics with key business objectives, and improve execution on strategy.

Every day, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data -- so much that 90% of the data in the world
today has been created in the last two years alone.2 Because of the exponential increase of
corporate big data, Compuware Changepoint selected IBM's Business Analytics solution to help its
customers:

* Manage growing amounts of data. The ability to sort and manage vast quantities of data and
access this information on various devices including tablets is a business necessity for
executives. Changepoint and IBM Business Analytics provide robust portal, dash-boarding and visual
analytic access in a real-time environment to provide increased visibility.
 
* Translate data into knowledge. Not only do executives need to manage and access more and more
data, they need to be able to quickly interpret this data to drive real-time business decisions.
The key metrics for managing a services business are revenue and margin. Traditionally, executives
have had difficulty in obtaining real-time financial information from their services business. As
an example, organizations with no resource visibility are not optimizing allocation. Real-time
access into resource skills and availability translates to increased resource utilization. A one
percent increase in utilization for a 100-person organization can contribute an additional
$312,000 to the bottom line.3 IBM Business Analytics provides better visibility and drill-through
capabilities into data, which impacts the overall health and performance of a business.

"As Changepoint adoption grows within technology services and IT organizations and as customers
broaden the deployment of Changepoint within their organizations -- in some cases to tens of
thousands of users -- there's an increased volume of data collected and a need to analyze and
interpret business information and turn it into powerful insight," said Lori Ellsworth, Senior
Vice President and General Manager, Compuware Changepoint Business Unit. "Customers want powerful,
secure reports and business analytics. After an extensive survey of the BI marketplace, we
determined that IBM was the best fit for our customer base. We believe the addition of IBM
Business Analytics sets us well ahead of our competitors in the market today."

By delivering a consistent, accurate view of all business information, IBM Business Analytics
provides decision makers at all levels of the enterprise with ground-breaking capabilities to
better manage performance. The seamless integration between IBM Business Analytics and Changepoint
will provide users with robust out-of-the-box business intelligence to drive financial
forecasting, operational excellence, and resource planning and customer satisfaction -- enabling
improved execution on services strategy. 

Additionally, IBM Business Analytics will provide executives with more powerful analytics to
manage critical objectives for their professional services and IT organizations. Key capabilities
of the integrated solution include:

* Real-time visibility within Changepoint through embedded dashboards and portals showcasing
interactive graphical and tabular data that provides clear revenue, cost and margin type metrics
providing increased visibility into operational success.
 
* Ability to tailor analytic information by use in real-time through IBM Business Analytics using
extended grouping, filtering and drill-through capabilities.
 
* Comprehensive data model that respects Changepoint's security protocol to ensure organizational
analytical integrity for end users.
 
* Ability for executives and consultants to access analytics via tablet, mobile devices and
desktop providing real-time access to data.

IBM Business Analytics will be available with Compuware Changepoint in March, 2013, delivered as

* Upstream major capital projects remain on track, active exploration program
continues
* Downstream completes three-year restructuring plan, focus turns to targeted
growth in petrochemicals and lubricants
* Financial strength supports investment program and shareholder distributions

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) executives said today at the company`s annual
security analyst meeting in New York that the company is continuing to deliver
industry-leading operational and financial results and progressing key
development projects. 

"We had another outstanding year in 2012. We continue to lead the industry in
total shareholder returns and most other safety and financial performance
metrics," said John Watson, Chevron`s chairman and CEO. Watson added, "Our key
development projects remain on track, and we are well positioned to deliver our
2017 target of 3.3 million barrels of oil-equivalent production first announced
three years ago. In addition, our project queue is gaining momentum to deliver
growth beyond 2017." 

George Kirkland, vice chairman and executive vice president, Upstream,
highlighted Chevron`s industry-leading upstream results, which include top
rankings on earnings per barrel, cash margin per barrel and return on capital
employed. The company also highlighted the strong performance of Chevron`s
current producing base, where a consistent focus on reliability, operating
efficiency and targeted investments has reduced natural field decline rates. He
also noted ample investment opportunities and the ability to expand shale and
tight reservoir operations, particularly in North America`s Permian and
Marcellus basins. 

Kirkland reviewed progress on key growth projects under construction. "We are
advancing our project queue as planned. Construction on our Australian LNG
projects, Gorgon and Wheatstone, is progressing very well, with first LNG for
Gorgon targeted for early 2015. Construction continues on the Jack/St. Malo and
Big Foot deepwater projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, both of which are
scheduled for start-up in 2014." He highlighted encouraging results from recent,
new technology applications designed to improve recoveries and reduce costs for
deepwater developments. Finally, Kirkland commented on favorable project
returns, noting, "The projects we are bringing on line over the next five years
have very sound economics and potential to increase our cash margins." 

As part of the upstream discussion, Jay Johnson, president, Chevron Europe,
Eurasia and Middle East Exploration and Production, focused on Chevron`s queue
of projects and exploration opportunities aimed to deliver additional long-term
production growth. "Our growth opportunities include multiple frontier
exploration plays and developing existing resources, most notably Tengiz
operations in Kazakhstan, Wafra steamflood operations in the Partitioned Zone,
and Australian and Canadian LNG. We`re well positioned for growth beyond 2017,"
Johnson said. 

Mike Wirth, executive vice president, Downstream and Chemicals, summarized the
results of Chevron`s multiyear plan to improve earnings in refining and
marketing. "Our restructuring efforts are complete. We`ve sold under-performing
or non-strategic assets, simplified our operations and reduced costs. Returns
have increased 10 percent as a direct function of the improvements we`ve
captured." Wirth added, "We will maintain a focused and competitive portfolio,
and selectively pursue growth in petrochemicals and lubricants." 

Pat Yarrington, vice president and chief financial officer, highlighted
Chevron`s financial performance and consistent financial priorities. Yarrington
noted the company`s history of investing for growth while significantly
increasing the dividend, repurchasing shares and strengthening the balance
sheet. "Over the next five years, operating cash flows should grow
significantly, as new production comes online. We intend to continue our cash
distribution policies," Yarrington said. 

Presentations delivered by Watson, Kirkland, Wirth, Yarrington and Johnson are
available on the Investor Relations website at www.chevron.com. 

Chevron is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company is involved in
virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and lubricants; manufactures and sells petrochemical

delays in the development, construction or startup of planned projects; the

under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant
investment or product changes required by existing or future environmental

the heading "Risk Factors" on pages 28 through 30 of the company`s 2012 Annual
Report on Form 10-K. In addition, such results could be affected by general
domestic and international economic and political conditions. Other

have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - The private equity owners of
Spanish metal packaging firm Mivisa are seeking to pay
themselves a dividend totalling 185 million euros ($240.77
million) just two years after buying the company, banking
sources said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone and N+1 Private Equity bought Mivisa in 2011 for
$1.3 billion backed with 667.5 million euros of debt, according
to Thomson Reuters LPC data. They now want to conduct a dividend
recapitalisation - a process that sees more debt added to the
existing borrowings and a dividend taken from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dividend recapitalisations have been few and far between
this year as bankers and loan investors worry about increasing a
company's debt pile and taking money out of the business during
difficult market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only other dividend recapitalisation in Europe this year
was for French aluminium manufacturer Constellium, and that was
mainly conducted in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackstone and N+1 are looking to raise a new loan totalling
150 million euros that will be used to pay themselves a dividend
alongside 35 million euros of cash from the company's balance
sheet, banking sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackstone and N+1 were not immediately available to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dividend will take Mivisa's leverage to 5 times its
approximate 140 million euro EBITDA from a current level of
around 3.8 times, bankers added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mivisa has performed well and its debt in Europe's secondary
loan market has risen significantly this year. Its term loan B
was quoted at 99.25 percent of face value on Monday compared to
96.25 percent of face value at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Initial reactions to this deal were that the sponsors must
be kidding as the company is Spanish and involved in the food
industry.  However, if you look a bit more closely, the company
has performed well and produces a lot of cash," one of the
bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From thinking it was ludicrous to do this deal in the
current market, the company actually has a good business case to
pull it off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1972, Mivisa is the third largest European
manufacturer of metal packaging for the food canning industry,
according to its website. It has six factories in Spain and
three abroad.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government has threatened the country's telecommunications giants with forced asset sales, unveiling a plan to loosen billionaire Carlos Slim's hold on the telephone market and curb broadcaster Televisa's dominance of the airwaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited bill seeks to shake up the telecoms sector by allowing increased foreign ownership of media and phone companies, and giving regulators the power to make players controlling more than 50 percent of the market sell assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The purpose of these measures is to free up the sector's potential, and do it as quickly as possible," President Enrique Pena Nieto said as he presented the plan on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flanked by the leaders of Mexico's main political parties, Pena Nieto said the reform would allow companies to grow, but added they would have to do so with innovation and investment, by improving prices and the quality of their service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous governments have failed to curb the power of Mexico's telecoms and media tycoons, and fostering more competition in the industry is seen as a crucial yardstick of the new government's ability to unlock the economy's potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto's government, which took office in December, negotiated the reform bill with leaders from the main opposition parties after the two forged an accord with the president in December called the Pact for Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the planned reform may still face a tough road in Congress, where Pena Nieto lacks a majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slim, the world's richest man, dominates Mexico's telecommunications market, controlling about 70 percent of its mobile market and 80 percent of its fixed phone lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa, controlled by tycoon Emilio Azcarraga, has about 60 percent of the broadcast market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill stipulates that any company with a market share exceeding 50 percent will be deemed dominant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dominant player may be subject to sanctions including possible forced asset disposals, the proposal said. It also seeks to curb the ability of companies to suspend legal rulings against them while they appeal decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limits on foreign ownership of fixed-line assets would be eliminated under the bill. It also envisages allowing foreign investors to take up to 49 percent ownership of TV or radio broadcasters, pending a review by a foreign investment commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said Spain's Telefonica SA could move to buy up phone companies Maxcom and Axtel, once foreign ownership limits are removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the television market, the bill aims to increase competition by auctioning rights to run two new television channels, a process that will not be open to the two most powerful broadcasters, Televisa and TV Azteca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also open the door for Slim to the television market, which he has been kept out of so far, but it is unclear whether he will be able to take part in the new auction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Javier Oliva, a political scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said with the leaders of the three main parties backing the bill, it would be much tougher for telecom industry lawyers to neuter the reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEALTH DIVIDE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill proposed introducing a new telecoms regulator, the Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT), along with specialized courts for settling competition disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's peso strengthened to its highest point in 18 months early on Monday with traders saying the currency had benefited from optimism about the country's reform drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto has pledged to ramp up economic growth to six percent a year, from about four percent in 2012 and has said that a shake-up of state oil firm Pemex, broadening the tax base and increasing competition will be key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how much telecoms reform could help Mexico's economy, Finance Minister Luis Videgaray said some analysts estimated the bill could add up to 1 percentage point to annual growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark IPC stock index slipped 0.7 percent, dragged down by a fall of more than 3 percent for Slim's America Movil and nearly a 1 percent drop for Televisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America Movil welcomed the reform bill in a statement, noting that the lifting of limits on foreign investment would help bring in the additional capital it said the sector needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa's chief executive, Azcarraga, said on his Twitter account that Mexico was entering a period of great challenges and opportunities. "Welcome competition," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill also aims to underline Pena Nieto's commitment to reducing the divide between rich and poor Mexicans. Around half the population lives in poverty, while much of the country's economic power is concentrated in the hands of a few families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICAL FIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some worry that Congress could water down the plan, but lawmakers in Pena Nieto's centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) are confident the bill will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRI congressman Hector Garcia said he expected it to pass the lower house of Congress by the end of next week and get Senate approval by the end of the current session on April 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're certain it'll be voted on in the Senate this period," he said. "The Pact for Mexico stipulates this timeframe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia said he believed the planned reform would be signed into law no later than September of this year. A secondary law will be needed to implement the changes foreseen by the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the outline of the bill presented on Monday prompted investors to dump shares in the large incumbents, America Movil and Televisa, smaller companies benefited from the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Maxcom and Axtel, which has waded deep into debt to compete with Slim's fixed line giant Telmex, gained about 7 percent apiece. Shares in cable firm Megacable rose 2 percent while TV Azteca shares were nearly flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's obvious the reform will benefit the companies with the least market share," said Jorge Nevid, head of trading at brokerage Accival in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of revenue, America Movil could be much harder hit by the reform than Televisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slim's companies had 67 percent of the 414 billion pesos ($33 billion) in total revenue from Mexican phone and television companies in 2012, while Televisa's cable companies had just 8.5 percent, according to data from market research group The Competitive Intelligence Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 12.55 Mexican pesos)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay, Alexandra Alper, Lizbeth Diaz and Noe Torres; Editing by Kieran Murray, David Gregorio and Edwina Gibbs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, March 12 (Reuters) - Germany's second
biggest utility RWE has hired Goldman Sachs to
sell its oil and gas exploration unit DEA, two people familiar
with the matter told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RWE last week said it was planning to sell the unit in a
move to slash investments and cut its 33 billion euro ($43
billion) debt pile. DEA swallowed investments of about 700
million euros in both 2011 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the sources said DEA was valued at about 5 billion
euros though some analysts last week said DEA could be worth as
much as 8 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RWE and Goldman Sachs both declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEA, which is active in Egypt, Norway, Libya and Britain
among others, produced 5.1 million cubic metres in oil
equivalents in 2011 and accounted for 23 percent of RWE's
operating profit in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German utilities RWE, E.ON and EnBW 
have launched large asset sale programmes worth nearly 30
billion euros to raise cash for investment in new areas,
including renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group's are still recovering from Germany's decision to
exit nuclear energy by 2022 in the wake of the nuclear disaster
at Japan's Fukushima plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Reform aims to reduce dominance of America Movil, Televisa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Bill threatens telecoms giants with forced asset sales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Bill also proposes new telecoms regulator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* President has support of opposition parties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* America Movil and Televisa shares fall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Michael O'Boyle and Dave Graham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, March 11 (Reuters) - Mexico's government has
threatened the country's telecommunications giants with forced
asset sales, unveiling a plan to loosen billionaire Carlos
Slim's hold on the telephone market and curb broadcaster
Televisa's dominance of the airwaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited bill seeks to shake up the telecoms sector
by allowing increased foreign ownership of media and phone
companies, and giving regulators the power to make players
controlling more than 50 percent of the market sell assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The purpose of these measures is to free up the sector's
potential, and do it as quickly as possible," President Enrique
Pena Nieto said as he presented the plan on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flanked by the leaders of Mexico's main political parties,
Pena Nieto said the reform would allow companies to grow, but
added they would have to do so with innovation and investment, 
by improving prices and the quality of their service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous governments have failed to curb the power of
Mexico's telecoms and media tycoons, and fostering more
competition in the industry is seen as a crucial yardstick of
the new government's ability to unlock the economy's potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto's government, which took office in December,
negotiated the reform bill with leaders from the main opposition
parties after the two forged an accord with the president in
December called the Pact for Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the planned reform may still face a tough road in
Congress, where Pena Nieto lacks a majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slim, the world's richest man, dominates Mexico's
telecommunications market, controlling about 70 percent of its
mobile market and 80 percent of its fixed phone lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa, controlled by tycoon Emilio
Azcarraga, has about 60 percent of the broadcast market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill stipulates that any company with a market share
exceeding 50 percent will be deemed dominant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dominant player may be subject to sanctions including
possible forced asset disposals, the proposal said. It also
seeks to curb the ability of companies to suspend legal rulings
against them while they appeal decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limits on foreign ownership of fixed-line assets would be
eliminated under the bill. It also envisages allowing foreign
investors to take up to 49 percent ownership of TV or radio
broadcasters, pending a review by a foreign investment
commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said Spain's Telefonica SA could move
to buy up phone companies Maxcom and Axtel
, once foreign ownership limits are removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the television market, the bill aims to increase
competition by auctioning rights to run two new television
channels, a process that will not be open to the two most
powerful broadcasters, Televisa and TV Azteca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also open the door for Slim to the television
market, which he has been kept out of so far, but it is unclear
whether he will be able to take part in the new auction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Javier Oliva, a political scientist at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico, said with the leaders of the
three main parties backing the bill, it would be much tougher
for telecom industry lawyers to neuter the reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEALTH DIVIDE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill proposed introducing a new telecoms regulator, the
Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT), along with
specialized courts for settling competition disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's peso strengthened to its highest point in 18 months
early on Monday with traders saying the currency had benefited
from optimism about the country's reform drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto has pledged to ramp up economic growth to six
percent a year, from about four percent in 2012 and has said
that a shake-up of state oil firm Pemex, broadening the tax base
and increasing competition will be key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how much telecoms reform could help Mexico's economy,
Finance Minister Luis Videgaray said some analysts estimated the
bill could add up to 1 percentage point to annual growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark IPC stock index slipped 0.7 percent,
dragged down by a fall of more than 3 percent for Slim's America
Movil  and nearly a 1 percent drop for
Televisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America Movil welcomed the reform bill in a statement,
noting that the lifting of limits on foreign investment would
help bring in the additional capital it said the sector needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa's chief executive, Azcarraga, said on his Twitter
account that Mexico was entering a period of great challenges
and opportunities. "Welcome competition," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill also aims to underline Pena Nieto's commitment to
reducing the divide between rich and poor Mexicans. Around half
the population lives in poverty, while much of the country's
economic power is concentrated in the hands of a few families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICAL FIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some worry that Congress could water down the plan, but
lawmakers in Pena Nieto's centrist Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI) are confident the bill will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRI congressman Hector Garcia said he expected it to pass
the lower house of Congress by the end of next week and get
Senate approval by the end of the current session on April 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're certain it'll be voted on in the Senate this period,"
he said. "The Pact for Mexico stipulates this timeframe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia said he believed the planned reform would be signed
into law no later than September of this year. A secondary law
will be needed to implement the changes foreseen by the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the outline of the bill presented on Monday prompted
investors to dump shares in the large incumbents, America Movil
and Televisa, smaller companies benefited from the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Maxcom and Axtel, which has waded deep into debt
to compete with Slim's fixed line giant Telmex, gained about 7
percent apiece. Shares in cable firm Megacable rose
2 percent while TV Azteca shares were nearly flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's obvious the reform will benefit the companies with the
least market share," said Jorge Nevid, head of trading at
brokerage Accival in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of revenue, America Movil could be much harder hit
by the reform than Televisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slim's companies had 67 percent of the 414 billion pesos
($33 billion) in total revenue from Mexican phone and television
companies in 2012, while Televisa's cable companies had just 8.5
percent, according to data from market research group The
Competitive Intelligence Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 13 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp will not proceed
further in a shale oil venture with Argentina's YPF 
 until a court freeze on the U.S. oil major's Argentinian
assets has been lifted, a top Chevron executive said in an
interview with the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YPF, Argentina's state-controlled energy firm, and Chevron
in December agreed to a preliminary deal of about $1 billion to
develop Argentina's vast shale oil resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That came one month after an Argentinian judge ordered a
freeze up to $19 billion worth of assets held by Chevron in
Argentina as part of an environmental lawsuit by Ecuadorean
villagers. Chevron has accused the Ecuadorean courts of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An appeals court later upheld the freeze in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron cannot move forward on the deal as long as the
freeze is in effect, as a lock-up could be ordered on money the
oil major brought in to spend, the company's Vice President
George Kirkland told the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirkland's comments come days after YPF Chief Executive
Miguel Galuccio said negotiations with Chevron were moving
slowly due to the court freeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - The raging fire that broke out after a tug and barge hit a pipeline near Bayou Perot 30 miles south of New Orleans Wednesday has been reduced by about 30 percent in size, the U.S. Coast Guard said in its latest update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are no reports of oil in the water. Visual imagery initially indicated potential pockets of crude oil, however, those areas have been determined to be particulate ash from the liquefied natural gas burn off," the Coast Guard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 2,200 barrels of crude oil remain on board the barge and has not been compromised, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tug pushing the barge that carried 2,215 barrels of crude oil struck the Chevron Corp pipeline in shallow water early evening on Tuesday, the Coast Guard had said earlier. The tug carried 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shut the line and isolated the damaged section, but officials waited for the fire to burn out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a one mile by 75-foot-wide sheen reported in the vicinity of the tug and barge," the Coast Guard said. "The pipeline was shut in Wednesday evening and the fire will diminish as the product diminishes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responders had deployed a containment boom to capture any oil leaking from the barge or tug, the Coast Guard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accident happened about 30 miles south of New Orleans in a bayou west of the Mississippi River. Chevron said the line connects a gas plant in Venice, Louisiana, with a pump station in Paradis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also said that apart from the pipeline shutdown, the accident had no impact on the company's operations, as LPG was being re-routed around the damaged line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four crew members of the tug were accounted for, though the captain reportedly sustained serious burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of the accident is under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kristen Hays in Houston, and NR Sethuraman and Shruti Chaturvedi in Bangalore; Editing by David Cowell, Bob Burgdorfer and Sofina Mirza-Reid)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said it will hold its annual meeting in Salt Lake City this year, the first time the Wall Street bank is inviting shareholders to cast their votes at a gathering outside the New York metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're delighted to hold our annual shareholder meeting in what has become our second-largest office in the U.S.," Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement provided to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's Utah operation is one of its largest, with 1,500 employees.

&lt;p&gt;  SCOTTSDALE, AZ, Mar 13 (Marketwire) -- 
OneNeck IT Services, a leading application management and cloud hosting
provider, announced today, it has attained Microsoft Gold competencies
for Hosting, as well as Identity and Access. Earning Gold competencies
demonstrates OneNeck's "best-in-class" ability and commitment to meet
Microsoft Corp. customers' evolving needs in today's dynamic business
environment and distinguishing itself within the top one percent of
Microsoft's partner ecosystem. 

    To earn a Microsoft Gold competency, partners must successfully complete
exams (resulting in Microsoft Certified Professionals) to prove their
level of technology expertise, and then designate these certified
professionals uniquely to one Microsoft competency, ensuring a certain
level of staffing capacity. Microsoft Gold competency partners must also
submit customer references that demonstrate successful projects (along
with implementing a yearly customer satisfaction study), meet a revenue
commitment (for most Gold competencies), and pass technology and/or sales
assessments. 

    "Earning these Microsoft Gold competencies for Hosting and for Identity
and Access showcase our expertise and commitment to today's technology
market," said Chuck Vermillion, OneNeck chief executive officer. "It also
demonstrates our deep knowledge of Microsoft and its products. With this
knowledge, we plan to accelerate our customers' success by continuing to
be technology advisors for their business demands."

    OneNeck provides a variety of application management and cloud hosting
solutions that deliver maximum value to its customers through: server
management, database management, operating system management, disaster
recovery solutions and a 24/7 support center.

    "By achieving a Gold competency, partners have demonstrated the highest,
most consistent capability and commitment to the latest Microsoft
technology," said Jon Roskill, corporate vice president, Worldwide
Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. "These partners have a deep expertise
that puts them in the top one percent of our partner ecosystem, and their
proficiency will help customers drive innovative solutions on the latest
Microsoft technology."

    Attaining the Hosting competency is exclusively for partners that
specialize in hosting solutions and maintain their own data centers or
act as a reseller or agency of services hosted by Microsoft; provide
agreed-upon service levels and customized hosted offerings; and consult
for common customer scenarios. Equipped with exclusive training, the
latest software and support, gold partners help customers offset the cost
of maintaining critical business applications with scalable hosting
solutions. 

    Attaining the Identity and Access competency, on the other hand,
demonstrates partner expertise in building and deploying integrated,
simplified, and comprehensive security solutions that help customers
access and protect corporate information across the data center and
cloud. Equipped with exclusive training, the latest software and support
on key technologies like Windows Server 2012, Windows Azure, Office 365
and Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager, partners can increase customer
confidence by enabling secure access to corporate applications and data
from any location and any device, while ensuring unauthorized users are
prevented from accessing sensitive information. 

    The Microsoft Partner Network helps partners strengthen their
capabilities to showcase leadership in the marketplace on the latest
technology, to better serve customers, and to easily connect with one of
the most active, diverse networks in the world.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 said it will hold its annual meeting in Salt Lake City
this year, the first time the Wall Street bank is inviting
shareholders to cast their votes at  a gathering outside the New
York metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're delighted to hold our annual shareholder meeting in
what has become our second-largest office in the U.S.," Chief
Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement provided to
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's Utah operation is one of its largest, with 1,500
employees. It is also one of the few offices where Goldman has
kept hiring workers amid broader staff cuts the past few years
-- partly because of an agreement with the state to boost job
growth in exchange for tax cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's meeting will take place at Goldman's Salt Lake
City headquarters at 222 South Main Street at 9:30 a.m. local
time ( 1530 GMT) o n May 23, a day after Blankfein and Utah

such as technology, operations, finance and research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is not the only big bank to hold its annual meeting
away from its New York headquarters in an effort to promote
positive news about its impact on the national economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co - whose CEO Jamie Dimon takes
bus tours to visit the bank's offices and branches around the
country - has held its two most recent annual meetings in Tampa,
Florida, and Columbus, Ohio. Citigroup Inc also held its
annual meeting in Dallas last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes of venue have not shielded the banks from
shareholder initiatives to cut executive pay or anti-Wall Street

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - Current and former top
executives of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co will appear before a
Senate panel on Friday to testify about the multi-billion dollar
"London Whale" trading loss, but Chief Executive Jamie Dimon
will not be a witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released
a witness list for the hearing, which included Ina Drew, the
former chief investment officer who ran the London-based group
responsible for the $6-billion trading loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Douglas Braunstein, the former chief financial officer, and
Michael Cavanaugh, the JPMorgan executive who led the internal
investigation into the losses, will also testify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, officials from the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, one of JPMorgan's primary regulators, will appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli declined to comment
on why Dimon would not be testifying. A spokeswoman for the
committee didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, to date, has been front and center in explaining the
trading loss. He was criticized for initially dismissing rumors
of a troubled trading position as a "tempest in a teapot" during
an April conference call. Less than a month later, the bank
disclosed problems with the trading strategy, saying it had lost
more than $2 billion and that the figure could be worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also testified before the Senate Banking Committee last
June, during which he apologized for the trading loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate panel, chaired by retiring Democratic Senator
Carl Levin, has spent months investigating why JPMorgan top
management and regulators did not spot the dangerous and
ultimately costly trades in an obscure corner of the credit
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's losses stemmed from bets by London-based Chief
Investment Office trader Bruno Iksil on an index for credit
default swaps. His outsized positions earned him the nickname
"London Whale" from the hedge fund traders taking the other
sides of his positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trading loss returned the spotlight to big banks'
risk-taking and raised questions about whether certain banks
were effectively too big to manage or to regulate.&lt;/p&gt;

SAN RAMON, Calif., March 13, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ArmaninoLLP,
(www.amllp.com/microsoft-dynamics
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10024955=1=www.amllp.com%2Fmicrosoft-dynamics=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amllp.com%2Fmicrosoft-dynamics
) one of the largest Microsoft Dynamics Partners in the U.S. and a provider of integrated audit,
tax, consulting services and technology, today released a Warranty Management and Product Repair
solution for Microsoft CRM 2011 - an integrated application that supports the product lifecycle
for manufacturers, distributors and medical device and life sciences companies.

Specifically, the application manages and monitors standard manufacturing and extended warranty
contracts; return material authorizations (RMAs) where products are returned for depot repairs;
and field service where technicians make repairs at customer premises.

The new release adds to Armanino's Certified for Microsoft Dynamics (CfMD) suite of industry
modules, which include a number of pre-configured add-ons for technology, manufacturing and
distribution companies. Microsoft certified the Warranty Management and Product Repair module
through a process that includes rigorous testing, customer references, and other objective
third-party verifications that prove usability and effectiveness.

In addition to technology and manufacturing companies, medical device and life sciences companies
can utilize this solution to enable complaint management tracking and support, leveraging the
"Corrective and Preventative Action (CAPA)" process, says Scott Mangelson, Armanino's CRM practice
leader.

"This solution is tailored to satisfy FDA documentation requirements about complaints related to
medical equipment or life sciences products, including failure and root cause analysis," Mangelson
says. "Clients who use this solution to automate their FDA compliance create a more efficient and
more accurate process for what would otherwise be a labor-intensive compliance activity."

Mangelson notes that in helping clients create more efficient businesses and understanding their
needs, Armanino has developed customized applications that add value to Microsoft products. The
firm's automation of industry-specific processes reflects the different ways that industries
manage their supply chains and how they interact with customers, suppliers, prospects and
regulators. He says that with the Warranty Management solution, clients can store their data in a
private cloud or create on-premise systems in their own data centers. One of the new application
components - the RMA function - can be used separately and can be supported as stand-alone. The
fully integrated suite of modules includes Warranty Management, RMA and Field Repair.

"If a company needs support in managing and moving material only, the RMA application can be
utilized without the other applications," Mangelson says. "However, the suite of three modules,
when integrated, is very effective for companies that have complex product lifecycles and service
networks."

Mangelson says that clients can access and purchase Armanino's Warranty and Product Repair
solutions for Microsoft CRM at Microsoft's PinPoint site at

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 13 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp expects oil
and natural gas production in North America to rise 45 percent
over the three decades to 2040, boosted by output from U.S.
shale formations, Canadian oil sands projects and the Gulf of
Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and other global oil companies are increasing
investment in North America, where reserves are easier to access
and production is often cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal
drilling have also unlocked vast reserves of crude oil and
natural gas, supplies that are changing North America's energy
outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in a report released on
Wednesday that oil and other liquid fuel production, led by
output from projects in the Alberta oil sands, will grow 40
percent in the next three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company sees U.S. energy consumption falling about 5
percent from 2010 to 2040, driven by efficiency gains in the
transportation sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of rising output and slowing demand should
lead to North America becoming a net energy exporter by about
2025, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased reliance on natural gas and renewable sources of
energy such as wind will lead to a 25 percent reduction in
carbon emissions by 2040, when emissions will be at the lowest
level since the 1970s, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon were down 28 cents, or less than 1 percent,
at $88.88 at midday on Wednesday on New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

various factors that could cause results to vary materially from those
indicated in the forward-looking information include: the successful
execution of the contract; costs associated with the contract; general
market conditions of the industries we service; strength of the oil and

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/mvqn44/trobaltpotiga) has announced
the addition of GlobalData's new report "Trobalt/Potiga (Epilepsy) - Forecast
and Market Analysis to 2022" to their offering. 

Trobalt/Potiga (Epilepsy) - Forecast and Market Analysis to 2022 

Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by spontaneously occurring and
recurrent seizures. The market is heavily driven by the sales of antiepileptic
drugs (AEDs) targeted at seizure reduction. The AED market is currently
dominated by UCB's Keppra and GlaxoSmithKline's Lamictal. Although both drugs
have experienced significant generic erosion, they form the mainstay of epilepsy
treatment in the nine markets and will continue to have significant market share
during the forecast period. 

Other key drugs include older generation AEDs such as Pfizer's Dilantin,
Abbott's Depakote, and Novartis' Tegretol and Trileptal which still have
significant usage due to their longevity in the market. However, the AED
dominance landscape will continue to shift towards newer generation drugs
particularly following the recent market entry of GlaxoSmithKline's
Trobalt/Potiga and Eisai's Fycompa which both offer first-in-class mechanisms of
action. 

Trobalt/Potiga (retigabine/ezogabine) is a first-in-class AED that was
originally developed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International and is co-marketed
globally with GSK. Although it was originally registered under the molecular
name retigabine, in 2010 it was assigned the name ezogabine in the US by the
United States Adopted Name (USAN) council. Therefore, the drug has two generic
names - ezogabine in the US and retigabine in the rest of the world. It was
approved in 2011 in the EU, where it is marketed under the trade name Trobalt
(retigabine), and also in the US, where it is marketed under the trade name
Potiga (ezogabine). Although Trobalt officially launched in Europe in May 2011,
the US launch has been delayed due to safety concerns regarding some adverse
effects and its narcotic potential, which warranted further studies at the
request of the FDA. Retigabine/ezogabine has a unique MOA compared with other
AEDs on the market and works by targeting and opening a subset of potassium
channels. It is believed that by facilitating the opening of specific neuronal
potassium channels, retigabine increases the inhibitory effect of the potassium
current and reduces the excitability of neuronal cells. 

Reasons to buy 

- Understand and capitalize by identifying products that are most likely to
ensure a robust return 

- Stay ahead of the competition by understanding the changing competitive
landscape for Epilepsy 

- Effectively plan your M and partnership strategies by identifying drugs with
the most promising sales potential 

- Make more informed business decisions from insightful and in-depth analysis of
Trobalt/Potiga performance

&lt;p&gt;* Lets JPMorgan, Goldman proceed with plans
    * Fed rejects capital plans by BB and Ally
    * Other major banks can proceed with dividends, buybacks
    * Shares of JPMorgan, Goldman and BB fall after hours


    By Emily Stephenson and Rick Rothacker
    March 14 (Reuters) - In a blow to two major Wall Street
banks, the Federal Reserve told Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co that they must fix flaws in how
they determine capital payouts to shareholders, but still
approved their plans for share buybacks and dividends.
    The Fed said JPMorgan and Goldman would have to submit new
plans by the end of the third quarter. A senior central bank
official declined to identify specific problems.
    In the second phase of the Fed's annual stress tests of the
18 largest U.S. banks, the regulator said on Thursday that it
had approved 14 firms' capital plans without any strings
attached.
    The Fed vetoed submissions by BB Corp and Ally
Financial.
    The results show the Fed is keeping a tight leash on the
nation's big banks five years after the U.S. financial crisis. 
    The annual testing has become a key tool for regulators to
ensure that banks are not eating too much into their capital
cushions, by examining how banks would weather a hypothetical
major market shock.
    Last week, in the first set of stress test results, the Fed
said that without their planned capital distributions, major
U.S. banks overall had enough capital to withstand a severe
economic downturn. 
    Ally Financial was the only bank last week that failed to
meet the minimum hurdle of a 5 percent capital buffer in the
Fed's test, which assumed a spike in unemployment to 12.1
percent and a 50 percent drop in share prices.
    
    The Fed also uses the tests to determine whether banks are
in a position to pay out dividends or buy back shares.
    The tests have become a source of tension between banks and
the Fed. Some banks last week released results of their own
tests, calculated using the same scenarios the Fed used. Many
banks scored themselves higher than the Fed did.
    The Fed reprimanded JPMorgan and Goldman based on
"qualitative" concerns, not their capital ratios. That could
confuse investors, said Ernie Patrikis, a former New York Fed
official who is now a partner at the law firm White &amp; Case.
    "It's a strange public process because to us it all looks
kosher, but the Fed is saying, 'No, it's not kosher because we
know more than you do about the numbers,'" Patrikis said.
    In after-market trading, shares of Goldman Sachs and
JPMorgan fell 2 percent, while BB shares fell 3.1 percent.
    The Fed said JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs each had "weaknesses
in their capital plans or capital planning processes that were
significant enough to require immediate attention, even though
those weaknesses do not undermine the quantitative results of
the stress tests."
    Tom Day, senior director of stress testing and capital
planning at Moody's Analytics, foresaw few problems for the two
Wall Street banks. "I don't expect that Goldman and JP will have
anything but approval when they resubmit," he said.
    The two can move forward with any plans for dividends or
share buybacks, but they will have to submit new plans to the
Fed at the end of the third quarter. If the Fed deems those
plans insufficient, it could order the banks to halt any new
capital distributions, the senior Fed official said.
    "We are pleased to continue to have the flexibility to
return capital to shareholders," Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd
Blankfein said in a statement. The company said it would
resubmit its capital plan with enhancements by the end of the
third quarter.
    "JPMorgan Chase is fully committed to meeting all of the
Fed's requirements," CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement.
    
    CAPITAL PLANS
    Overall, the Fed said the stress tests showed that the 18
banks have substantially increased their capital bases since the
regulator's first exams in 2009. From the end of 2008 through
the end of 2012, their total Tier 1 common equity increased to
$792 billion from $393 billion.
    Part of the reason for their strengthened position is that
banks are distributing much less capital to shareholders, the
Fed said. The 18 institutions doled out 19 percent of their net
income in common dividends in 2012, half of what they paid as a
percentage of profits in 2006, before the onset of the financial
crisis.
    The Fed on Thursday did not provide a breakdown of each
bank's plans for dividends and repurchases, but some individual
banks began disclosing those details themselves.
    JPMorgan said that the Fed had approved its plan to buy back
$6 billion of stock over the next 12 months, subject to
addressing the weaknesses found in the firm's capital planning
process. JPMorgan will raise its quarterly dividend in the
second quarter to 38 cents a share from 30 cents, it said.
    Goldman did not disclose details of its capital plan.
    Bank of America said it would buy back $5 billion in
common stock and redeem $5.5 billion in preferred shares after
the Fed approved its capital plan. That is considered a step
forward for a bank that had its capital plan rejected in 2011
and did not ask to return more capital to shareholders in 2012. 
    Bank of America shares rose 4.3 percent in after-hours
trade. The bank's quarterly dividend will stay at a penny per
share.
    American Express said it plans to increase its
quarterly dividend to 23 cents per share, a 3 cent increase, and
to buy back up to $4 billion in company shares in 2013.
    The company had to lower its submission after the Fed
concluded that under its initial plan, American Express's
capital level would have dropped below the minimum requirement
for at least one quarter during the hypothetical nine-quarter
"stressed" period.
    The Fed this year gave banks 48 hours to resubmit their
plans if it appeared the initial proposal would not be approved,
the first time banks got a second shot at capital distributions.
    Ally Financial and BB will not be able to move forward
with proposed capital distributions. 
    The U.S. government owns a majority stake in Ally, the
former General Motors lending arm, after a series of
government bailouts.
    The Fed said it rejected Ally's capital plan "both on
quantitative and qualitative grounds." Ally submitted a revised
plan, but that plan was also rejected by regulators.
    A senior Fed official would not disclose Ally's capital
plan. Ally spokeswoman Gina Proia said the company has withdrawn
a requested capital action but declined to provide details.
    Ally, which has a mortgage unit in bankruptcy proceedings
and is trying to sell its international businesses, has disputed
the Fed's assumptions in the stress tests. Proia said the
company would be positioned to pay back the U.S. Treasury once
it has completed "certain milestones in its strategic plans."
    The Fed said it rejected BB's proposal based on
qualitative concerns.
    BB, which scored above many of its peers in the stress
test, said in a statement the Fed does not permit banks to
disclose the reason for a capital plan rejection, but it did not
believe it was related to the bank's "capital strength, earnings
power or financial condition."    
    The Fed did not object to the continuation of its quarterly
dividend of 23 cents per share and the payment of preferred
dividends, BB said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Aruna Viswanatha and Emily Flitter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
ignored risks, misled investors, fought with regulators and
tried to work around rules as it dealt with mushrooming losses
in a derivatives portfolio, a Senate report alleged in a damning
review of the largest U.S. bank's management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior managers at the bank were told for months about the
bad derivatives bets that ended up costing the bank more than
$6.2 billion but did little to rein them in, according to the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate report came on the same day the U.S. Federal
Reserve separately asked JPMorgan to improve its capital
planning process as part of an annual "stress tests" of banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barrage of bad news for JPMorgan, long seen as the
safest and best-managed U.S. bank, could taint the reputation of
the bank, as well as Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. Dimon has been
one of the most outspoken critics of Washington's attempts to
tightly regulate Wall Street after the 2007-2009 financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also gives ammunition to advocates calling for
stricter financial reform regulations. In particular, the
301-page Senate report will likely give new energy to regulators
crafting the Volcker rule, which proposes to put limits on banks
betting with their own funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman said, "While we have repeatedly
acknowledged mistakes, our senior management acted in good faith
and never had any intent to mislead anyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committee sources said the losses from the trades appeared
to total more than $6.2 billion. But these sources said they
could not determine how much because the trades originally made
by the bank's Chief Investment Office were moved to other parts
of the bank. They said JPMorgan declined to provide them more
information about the values of the positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate subcommittee will hear directly from senior
JPMorgan executives - but not from Dimon - at a hearing on
Friday morning on the derivatives bets that came to be known as
the "London whale" trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin, who chairs the subcommittee, said he had
not yet decided whether to refer the report to criminal or civil
authorities. He said the panel could hold further hearings and
left the door open to calling Dimon for the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLASHES WITH REGULATORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon publicly criticized lawmakers for creating onerous new
rules for banks after the crisis, but the report shows JPMorgan
also frequently clashed with regulators behind the scenes as the
losses mounted last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, Dimon ordered the bank to stop sending daily
trading profit and loss reports to the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, one of its main regulators, Senate
investigators said. The bank feared that information from the
reports was being leaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Douglas Braunstein, the bank's chief financial officer at
the time, resumed sending the reports to the OCC a few days
later. When Dimon found out that Braunstein had done so, at a
meeting with an OCC examiner, the CEO "raised his voice in anger
at" the CFO, the report said. Braunstein left his CFO spot early
this year, moving to a spot as vice chairman of JPMorgan,
focusing on clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another senior bank executive, Chief Investment Officer Ina
Drew, complained to the OCC that the agency was trying to
"destroy" JPMorgan's business. In another episode, bank
executives yelled at OCC examiners and called them "stupid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate report also accused the bank of changing its risk
models to work around capital rules. The report includes emails
from a quantitative analyst for the bank in which he explained
how he could rearrange its modeling procedures to mask the
ballooning risk inside the chief investment office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bank employees were also cautious when it came to
leaving evidence of those efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think, the, the email that you sent out, I think there is
a, just FYI, there is a bit of sensitivity around this topic," a
member of the bank's central risk modeling group warned the
analyst afterward in a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank "increased risk by mislabeling the synthetic credit
portfolio as a risk-reducing hedge when it was really involved
proprietary trading," the subcommittee's top Republican, John
McCain, said in a briefing with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate investigators also faulted regulators at the OCC for
missing red flags and failing to be aggressive in monitoring
problems at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency was informed of JPMorgan's risk limit breaches
and of changes to the model the bank was using to calculate its
risk, yet raised no concerns at the time, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An OCC spokesman said the agency recognizes shortcomings in
its supervision and has taken steps to improve its supervisory
process. The spokesman also said the agency is continuing to
investigate the matter and "will take additional action as
appropriate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'LET THE BOOK SIMPLY DIE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the bank's large credit bets surprisingly paid off
after American Airlines filed for bankruptcy, generating $400
million in unexpected revenue for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employees most closely associated with the trades were
among the highest paid that year. Drew made $29 million in 2010
and 2011, and Achilles Macris, who reported to her, made $32
million during the same time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in January 2012, when the strategy began producing
sustained losses and traders began warning of additional losses,
managers decided to stay the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trader responsible for the position, Bruno Iksil pushed
for the bank to take the losses and let the existing positions
expire, according to emails in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote to his boss that in his view the "only" course of
action was "to stay as we are and let the book simply die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the traders continued to add to the positions, and by
March supervisors were urging them to mark the values at levels
that portrayed them in the most positive light, even if it meant
skirting the bank's normal valuation practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know where he wants to stop, but it's getting
idiotic," Iksil wrote in an instant message, referring to his
supervisor who had ordered the marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 23, Iksil estimated in an email that the portfolio
had lost about $600 million using midpoint prices and $300
million using the "best" prices, but it reported a daily loss of
only $12 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drew ordered a halt in the derivatives trading that same
day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the group continued to understate the extent of losses
in the position through May, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

    By Emily Stephenson and Rick Rothacker
    March 14 (Reuters) - In a blow to two major Wall Street
banks, the Federal Reserve told Goldman Sachs and
JPMorgan Chase that they must fix flaws in how they
determine capital payouts to shareholders, but still approved
their plans for share buybacks and dividends.
    The Fed said JPMorgan and Goldman would have to submit new
plans by the end of the third quarter. A senior central bank
official declined to identify specific problems.
    In the second phase of the Fed's annual stress tests of the
18 largest U.S. banks, the regulator said on Thursday that it
had approved 14 firms' capital plans without any strings
attached.
    The Fed vetoed submissions by BB Corp and Ally
Financial. 
    The results show the Fed is keeping a tight leash on the
nation's big banks five years after the U.S. financial crisis. 
    The annual testing has become a key tool for regulators to
ensure that banks are not eating too much into their capital
cushions, by examining how banks would weather a hypothetical
major market shock. 
    Last week, in the first set of stress test results, the Fed
said that without their planned capital distributions, major
U.S. banks overall had enough capital to withstand a severe
economic downturn. 
    Ally Financial was the only bank last week that failed to
meet the minimum hurdle of a 5 percent capital buffer in the
Fed's test, which assumed a spike in unemployment to 12.1
percent and a 50 percent drop in share prices.
    
    The Fed also uses the tests to determine whether banks are
in a position to pay out dividends or buy back shares.
    The tests have become a source of tension between banks and
the Fed. Some banks last week released results of their own
tests, calculated using the same scenarios the Fed used. Many
banks scored themselves higher than the Fed did.
    The Fed reprimanded JPMorgan and Goldman based on
"qualitative" concerns, not their capital ratios. That could
confuse investors, said Ernie Patrikis, a former New York Fed
official who is now a partner at the law firm White &amp; Case.
    "It's a strange public process because to us it all looks
kosher, but the Fed is saying, 'No, it's not kosher because we
know more than you do about the numbers,'" Patrikis said.
    In after-market trading, shares of Goldman Sachs and
JPMorgan fell 2 percent, while BB shares fell 3.1 percent. 
    The Fed said JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs each had "weaknesses
in its capital plan or capital planning process that were
significant enough to require immediate attention, even though
those weaknesses do not undermine the quantitative results of
the stress tests."
    Tom Day, senior director of stress testing and capital
planning at Moody's Analytics, foresaw few problems for the two
Wall Street banks. "I don't expect that Goldman and JP will have
anything but approval when they resubmit," he said.
    The two can move forward with any plans for dividends or
share buybacks, but they will have to submit new plans to the
Fed at the end of the third quarter. If the Fed deems those
plans insufficient, it could order the banks to halt any new
capital distributions, the senior Fed official said.
    "We are pleased to continue to have the flexibility to
return capital to shareholders," Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd
Blankfein said in a statement. The company said it would
resubmit its capital plan with enhancements by the end of the
third quarter.
    "JPMorgan Chase is fully committed to meeting all of the
Fed's requirements," CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement.
    
    CAPITAL PLANS
    The Fed did not provide a breakdown of each bank's plans for
dividends and repurchases. Some individual banks on Thursday
began disclosing those details themselves.
    JPMorgan said that the Fed had approved its plan to buy back
$6 billion of stock over the next 12 months, subject to
addressing the weaknesses found in the firm's capital planning
process. JPMorgan will raise its quarterly dividend in the
second quarter to 38 cents a share from 30 cents, it said.
    Goldman did not disclose details of its capital plan.
    Bank of America said it would buy back $5 billion in
common stock and redeem $5.5 billion in preferred shares after
the Fed approved its capital plan. That is considered a step
forward for a bank that had its capital plan rejected in 2011
and did not ask to return more capital to shareholders in 2012. 
    Bank of America shares rose 4.3 percent in after-hours
trade. The bank's quarterly dividend will stay at a penny per
share.
    American Express said it plans to increase its
quarterly dividend to 23 cents per share, a 3 cent increase, and
to buy back up to $4 billion in company shares in 2013.
    The company had to lower its submission after the Fed
concluded that under its initial plan, American Express's
capital level would have dropped below the minimum requirement
for at least one quarter during the hypothetical nine-quarter
"stressed" period.
    The Fed this year gave banks 48 hours to resubmit their
plans if it appeared the initial proposal would not be approved,
the first time banks got a second shot at capital distributions.
    Ally Financial and BB will not be able to move forward
with proposed capital distributions. 
    The U.S. government owns a majority stake in Ally, the
former General Motors lending arm, after a series of
government bailouts. 
    The Fed said it rejected Ally's capital plan "both on
quantitative and qualitative grounds." Ally submitted a revised
plan, but that plan was also rejected by regulators.
    A senior Fed official would not disclose Ally's capital
plan. Ally spokeswoman Gina Proia said the company has withdrawn
a requested capital action but declined to provide details. 
    Ally, which has a mortgage unit in bankruptcy proceedings
and is trying to sell its international businesses, has disputed
the Fed's assumptions in the stress tests. Proia said the
company would be positioned to pay back the U.S. Treasury once
it has completed "certain milestones in its strategic plans."
    The Fed said it rejected BB's proposal based on
qualitative concerns.
    BB, which scored above many of its peers in the stress
test, said in a statement the Fed does not permit banks to
disclose the reason for a capital plan rejection, but it did not
believe it was related to the bank's "capital strength, earnings
power or financial condition."    
    The Fed did not object to the continuation of its quarterly
dividend of 23 cents per share and the payment of preferred
dividends, BB said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Aruna Viswanatha and Emily Flitter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
ignored risks, misled investors, fought with regulators and
tried to work around rules as it dealt with mushrooming losses
in a derivatives portfolio, a Senate report alleged in a damning
review of the largest U.S. bank's management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior managers at the bank were told for months about the
bad derivatives bets that ended up costing the bank more than
$6.2 billion but did little to rein them in, according to the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate report came on the same day the U.S. Federal
Reserve separately asked JPMorgan to improve its capital
planning process as part of an annual "stress tests" of banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barrage of bad news for JPMorgan, long seen as the
safest and best-managed U.S. bank, could taint the reputation of
the bank, as well as Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. Dimon has been
one of the most outspoken critics of Washington's attempts to
tightly regulate Wall Street after the 2007-2009 financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also gives ammunition to advocates calling for
stricter financial reform regulations. In particular, the
301-page Senate report will likely give new energy to regulators
crafting the Volcker rule, which proposes to put limits on banks
betting with their own funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman said, "While we have repeatedly
acknowledged mistakes, our senior management acted in good faith
and never had any intent to mislead anyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committee sources said the losses from the trades appeared
to total more than $6.2 billion. But these sources said they
could not determine how much because the trades originally made
by the bank's Chief Investment Office were moved to other parts
of the bank. They said JPMorgan declined to provide them more
information about the values of the positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate subcommittee will hear directly from senior
JPMorgan executives - but not from Dimon - at a hearing on
Friday morning on the derivatives bets that came to be known as
the "London whale" trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin, who chairs the subcommittee, said he had
not yet decided whether to refer the report to criminal or civil
authorities. He said the panel could hold further hearings and
left the door open to calling Dimon for the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLASHES WITH REGULATORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon publicly criticized lawmakers for creating onerous new
rules for banks after the crisis, but the report shows JPMorgan
also frequently clashed with regulators behind the scenes as the
losses mounted last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, Dimon ordered the bank to stop sending daily
trading profit and loss reports to the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, one of its main regulators, Senate
investigators said. The bank feared that information from the
reports was being leaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another senior bank executive, Chief Investment Officer Ina
Drew, complained to the OCC that the agency was trying to
"destroy" JPMorgan's business. In another episode, bank
executives yelled at OCC examiners and called them "stupid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate report also accused the bank of changing its risk
models to work around capital rules. The report includes emails
from a quantitative analyst for the bank in which he explained
how he could rearrange its modeling procedures to mask the
ballooning risk inside the chief investment office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bank employees were also cautious when it came to
leaving evidence of those efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think, the, the email that you sent out, I think there is
a, just FYI, there is a bit of sensitivity around this topic," a
member of the bank's central risk modeling group warned the
analyst afterward in a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank "increased risk by mislabeling the synthetic credit
portfolio as a risk-reducing hedge when it was really involved
proprietary trading," the subcommittee's top Republican, John
McCain, said in a briefing with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate investigators also faulted regulators at the OCC for
missing red flags and failing to be aggressive in monitoring
problems at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency was informed of JPMorgan's risk limit breaches
and of changes to the model the bank was using to calculate its
risk, yet raised no concerns at the time, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An OCC spokesman said the agency recognizes shortcomings in
its supervision and has taken steps to improve its supervisory
process. The spokesman also said the agency is continuing to
investigate the matter and "will take additional action as
appropriate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'LET THE BOOK SIMPLY DIE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the bank's large credit bets surprisingly paid off
after American Airlines filed for bankruptcy, generating $400
million in unexpected revenue for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employees most closely associated with the trades were
among the highest paid that year. Drew made $29 million in 2010
and 2011, and Achilles Macris, who reported to her, made $32
million during the same time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in January 2012, when the strategy began producing
sustained losses and traders began warning of additional losses,
managers decided to stay the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trader responsible for the position, Bruno Iksil pushed
for the bank to take the losses and let the existing positions
expire, according to emails in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote to his boss that in his view the "only" course of
action was "to stay as we are and let the book simply die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the traders continued to add to the positions, and by
March supervisors were urging them to mark the values at levels
that portrayed them in the most positive light, even if it meant
skirting the bank's normal valuation practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know where he wants to stop, but it's getting
idiotic," Iksil wrote in an instant message, referring to his
supervisor who had ordered the marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 23, Iksil estimated in an email that the portfolio
had lost about $600 million using midpoint prices and $300
million using the "best" prices, but it reported a daily loss of
only $12 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drew ordered a halt in the derivatives trading that same
day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Emily Stephenson and Rick Rothacker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 14 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve told Goldman Sachs
 and JPMorgan Chase that they must fix flaws in
how they determine capital payouts to shareholders, but still
approved their plans for share buybacks and dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second phase of the Fed's annual stress tests of the
18 largest U.S. banks, the regulator said on Thursday that it
had approved 14 firms' capital plans without any strings
attached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed vetoed submissions by BB Corp and Ally
Financial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show how the Fed is keeping a tight leash on the
nation's big banks five years after the U.S. financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual stress testing process has become a key tool for
regulators to ensure that banks are not eating too much into
their capital cushions, by examining how banks would weather a
hypothetical major market shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, in the first set of stress test results, the Fed
said that without their planned capital distributions, major
U.S. banks overall had enough capital to withstand a severe
economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ally Financial was the only bank last week that failed to
meet the minimum hurdle of a 5 percent capital buffer in the
Fed's test that assumed a spike in unemployment to 12.1 percent
and a 50 percent drop in share prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed also uses the tests to determine whether banks are
in a position to pay dividends to shareholders or buy back
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express had to submit an adjusted capital
plan after the Fed determined its first proposal would have
eroded its capital position too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators gave Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan conditional
approval based on "qualitative" concerns with their capital
planning processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed said JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs each had "weaknesses
in its capital plan or capital planning process that were
significant enough to require immediate attention, even though
those weaknesses do not undermine the quantitative results of
the stress tests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Fed official declined to identify the specific
problems but said that capital planning involves projecting
revenues and losses under stress scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two banks can move forward with any plans for dividends
or share buybacks, but they will have to submit new plans to the
Fed at the end of the third quarter. If the Fed deems those
plans insufficient, it could order the banks to halt any new
capital distributions, the senior official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to continue to have the flexibility to
return capital to shareholders," Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd
Blankfein said in a statement. The company said it would
resubmit its capital plan with enhancements by the end of the
third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan Chase is fully committed to meeting all of the
Fed's requirements," CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAPITAL PLANS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed did not provide a breakdown of each bank's plans for
dividends and repurchases. Some individual banks on Thursday
began disclosing those details themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said that the Fed had approved its plan to buy back
$6 billion of stock over the next 12 months, subject to
addressing the weaknesses found in the firm's capital planning
process. JPMorgan will raise its quarterly dividend in the
second quarter to 38 cents a share from 30 cents, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America said it would buy back $5 billion in
common stock and redeem $5.5 billion in preferred shares after
the Fed approved its capital plan. That is considered a step
forward for a bank that had its capital plan rejected in 2011
and did not ask to return more capital to shareholders in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's quarterly dividend will stay at a penny per
share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express said it plans to increase its quarterly
dividend to 23 cents per share, a 3 cent increase, and to buy
back up to $4 billion in company shares in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it lowered its submission after the Fed
concluded that under its initial plan, American Express's
capital level would have dropped below the minimum requirement
for at least one quarter during the hypothetical nine-quarter
"stressed" period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year was the first time the Fed gave banks a second
shot at capital distributions, giving them 48 hours after the
initial results were announced last week to submit a new plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ally Financial and BB will not be able to move forward
with proposed capital distributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government owns a majority stake in Ally, the
former General Motors lending arm, after a series of
government bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed said it rejected Ally's capital plan "both on
quantitative and qualitative grounds." Ally submitted a revised
plan, but that plan was also rejected by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ally did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A
senior Fed official would not disclose Ally's capital plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed said on Thursday that it had confirmed an error in
Goldman's initial data submission. The Fed released a corrected
version of the stress-test results, which showed lower projected
capital ratios for Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Fed official said the problem stemmed from a
projection of when some capital instruments would mature and was
discovered in consultation with Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express had to submit an adjusted capital
plan after the Fed determined its first proposal would have
eroded its capital position too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators gave Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan conditional
approval based on "qualitative" concerns with their capital
planning processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed said JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs each had "weaknesses
in its capital plan or capital planning process that were
significant enough to require immediate attention, even though
those weaknesses do not undermine the quantitative results of
the stress tests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Fed official declined to identify the specific
problems but said that capital planning involves projecting
revenues and losses under stress scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two banks can move forward with any plans for dividends
or share buybacks, but they will have to submit new plans to the
Fed at the end of the third quarter. If the Fed deems those
plans insufficient, it could order the banks to halt any new
capital distributions, the senior official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to continue to have the flexibility to
return capital to shareholders," Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd
Blankfein said in a statement. The company said it would
resubmit its capital plan with enhancements by the end of the
third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan Chase is fully committed to meeting all of the
Fed's requirements," CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAPITAL PLANS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed did not provide a breakdown of each bank's plans for
dividends and repurchases. Some individual banks on Thursday
began disclosing those details themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said that the Fed had approved its plan to buy back
$6 billion of stock over the next 12 months, subject to
addressing the weaknesses found in the firm's capital planning
process. JPMorgan will raise its quarterly dividend in the
second quarter to 38 cents a share from 30 cents, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America said it would buy back $5 billion in
common stock and redeem $5.5 billion in preferred shares after
the Fed approved its capital plan. That is considered a step
forward for a bank that had its capital plan rejected in 2011
and did not ask to return more capital to shareholders in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's quarterly dividend will stay at a penny per
share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express said it plans to increase its quarterly
dividend to 23 cents per share, a 3 cent increase, and to buy
back up to $4 billion in company shares in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it lowered its submission after the Fed
concluded that under its initial plan, American Express's
capital level would have dropped below the minimum requirement
for at least one quarter during the hypothetical nine-quarter
"stressed" period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year was the first time the Fed gave banks a second
shot at capital distributions, giving them 48 hours after the
initial results were announced last week to submit a new plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ally Financial and BB will not be able to move forward
with proposed capital distributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government owns a majority stake in Ally, the
former General Motors lending arm, after a series of
government bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed said it rejected Ally's capital plan "both on
quantitative and qualitative grounds." Ally submitted a revised
plan, but that plan was also rejected by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ally did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A
senior Fed official would not disclose Ally's capital plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed said on Thursday that it had confirmed an error in
Goldman's initial data submission. The Fed released a corrected
version of the stress-test results, which showed lower projected
capital ratios for Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Fed official said the problem stemmed from a
projection of when some capital instruments would mature and was
discovered in consultation with Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' senior metals
trader David Freeland has left the U.S. investment bank just
over a year after being hired to build its physical copper book
in London, market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His departure from Wall Street's No. 1 bank for commodities
is the strongest sign yet that the bank is struggling to expand
into the capital-intensive and high-risk business perfected by
commodity merchants Glencore and Trafigura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman at Goldman in London declined to comment on
Freeland. The bank is one of the world's largest traders of
metal derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His resignation comes after the retirement of Steve
Branton-Speak who, as head of the bank's global metals business,
spearheaded its march into physical trading in 2010 in a bid to
offset tighter regulation that forced it to close its
proprietary metals derivatives trading desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don Casturo filled veteran metal trader Branton-Speak's
shoes just over a year ago. He was previously head of investor
products, according to a report in the Financial Times in
October 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commodity revenues at leading Wall Street firms crashed last
year to their lowest on record, as tighter regulation and
limited price swings squeezed the once dominant traders of
Goldman, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline is most stark at Goldman, where commodity
revenues collapsed by more than 60 percent year-on-year in 2012
to just $575 million, according to the bank's annual report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman hired Freeland in December 2011 from Trafigura
, where he ran the European copper book in
Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It hired Scott Evans from Mitsubishi in 2010 to trade
aluminium, the same year it bought warehousing company Metro for
about half a billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market sources have said the team has been hampered by a
lack of capital and bank bureaucracy, a big cultural shift for
the traders who joined from some of the world's biggest
merchants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the world's investment banks have had to rein in
risk and capital due to exposure to the euro-zone debt crisis
and to comply with capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition from new entrants with deep pockets and an
appetite for risk has also intensified. Energy-focused
merchants, including Vitol and Mercuria, have swooped into the
metals space spying better returns than in oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, a pioneer of Wall Street banks' foray into
commodities, and its rivals JPM and Morgan Stanley are locked in
a struggle to retain their ownerhip of physical commodity assets
after their conversion to Bank Holding Companies during the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co frequently clashed with its main regulator as the bank's losses from bad credit trades mounted last year, a Senate report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dysfunctional relationship between JPMorgan and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees the regulated bank subsidiary of JPMorgan's holding company, went all the way to the top of the bank, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January and February, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon ordered the bank to stop sending daily trading profit and loss reports to the OCC, according to the report from the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, citing the OCC's main JPMorgan examiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank told the OCC that it was stopping the reports because they provided too much information, as well as to prevent the leak of data, the report said. When the OCC asked for the data again, Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein provided it. The profit and loss reports stopped for less than a week, according to the Senate report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a later meeting, when Dimon learned that Braunstein had resumed supplying the reports to regulators, the CEO shouted at the CFO in anger, the report said, citing the OCC examiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein stepped aside as chief financial officer earlier this year to become a vice chairman at JPMorgan. The long-time investment banker was replaced by Marianne Lake, previously CFO of the bank's retail branch network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank frequently pushes back on OCC findings and examinations, according to the report. At one point, bank employees yelled at OCC regulators and called them "stupid." In early 2012, when a junior OCC examiner went to a meeting that he thought would be with his counterpart at the bank to discuss the results of an examination, he was instead met by all the heads of risk divisions of the bank, who criticized the OCC's findings in a "loud" and "combative" tone, the report said, citing an interview with the examiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase loss more than $6 billion last year after making a series of wrong-way bets in credit derivatives markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Emily Flitter; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Quantitative expert suggested change in risk calculations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Bank risk group warned discussion should be kept out of
email&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Senate report expected to bolster Volcker Rule proponents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Emily Flitter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
risk managers tried so hard in 2012 to get around international
capital rules that they viewed their own discussions as too
sensitive for email, according to a Senate report released on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report on the JPMorgan "London Whale" scandal includes
the story of a quantitative engineer for the bank who made waves
internally by sending an email suggesting how the bank could
rearrange its risk modeling procedures to better accommodate the
ballooning risk metrics inside the chief investment office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think, the, the email that you sent out, I think there is
a, just FYI, there is a bit of sensitivity around this topic," a
member of the bank's central risk modeling group warned the
engineer afterward in a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we have repeatedly acknowledged mistakes, our senior
management acted in good faith and never had any intent to
mislead anyone," a spokeswoman for the bank said in response to
the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineer, Patrick Hagan, a math expert who had
previously worked at Exxon designing chemical reactors, had
written to the risk modeling group suggesting a way to "optimize
the firm-wide capital charge," explaining how he could rearrange
the calculations required to determine how much capital JPMorgan
needed to hold to adhere to international regulatory
requirements. Hagan wanted to make it so the bank needed to hold
less capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bank may be leaving $6.3 billion on the table, much of
which may be recoverable," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I would do is not put these things in email," the risk
group employee told Hagan on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hagan's email appears in a report by the Senate Permanent
Committee on Investigations, which capped a nine-month
investigation into JPMorgan's $6.2 billion trading losses with
the report and a hearing scheduled for Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report's findings are expected to provide new political
fodder for proponents of the Volcker Rule, which bans
proprietary trading by depository institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report includes an account of JPMorgan's internal
wrangling with its methods for calculating risk and assessing
how much capital it needed to hold as new rules from the Basel
Committee, an international group of regulators, took effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An internal report the bank released in January also
discussed some of the attempts the bank's chief investment
office made to find creative ways to adhere to the new Basel
requirements. However, it did not disclose Hagan's email or the
other bank employees' responses to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the bank did not take Hagan's advice in its
original form, according to the Senate report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, the bank reached a compromise with Mr. Hagan,"
the report said. It agreed to implement some of his ideas for
categorizing the various assets inside a portfolio of credit
derivatives while rejecting others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Senate report makes clear that the attempts to
change the bank's risk modeling to help it hold on to as many
risky assets as possible were deliberate, not simply an issue of
theoretical differences over mathematical theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Emails, telephone conversations, and internal presentations
offer evidence that efforts to manipulate risk-weighted assets
results to artificially lower the bank's capital requirements
were both discussed and pursued by the bank's quantitative
experts," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - Senior managers at JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co, including Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew,
were told for months about the bad derivatives bets that ended
up costing the bank $6.2 billion  but did little to rein them in
until it was too late, according to a U.S. Senate report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telephone calls and instant messages show traders felt
pressure to misstate the values of the derivatives and were
upset about doing so, but the bank stood by the prices and said
in an internal document they were "consistent with industry
practices," according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has described the position, built by a trader who
came to be known as the "London Whale," as one caused by rogue
traders and the bank's lack of proper oversight and risk limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Senate panel said five risk limits already in place
were breached in early 2012. Bank managers as senior as Chief
Executive Jamie Dimon knew of the breaches, but the bank lifted
the limits or altered the risk measures to improve the results,
the report said. The Senate permanent subcommittee on
investigations, which wrote the report, is holding hearings
about the trades on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report will likely give ammunition to financial industry
reformers who support the Volcker rule, a ban on banks betting
with their own funds. Regulators are struggling to finalize the
rule, which was part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has described the position as a hedge on other
businesses, but the subcommittee's investigators said the bank
failed to identify any assets or portfolios being hedged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank "increased risk by mislabeling the synthetic credit
portfolio as a risk-reducing hedge when it was really involved
proprietary trading," the subcommittee's top Republican, John
McCain, said in a briefing with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emails and phone recordings disclosed in the report also
showed the efforts bank employees made to devise complicated
means of flouting new international capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's hearing will feature JPMorgan executives including
former finance chief Douglas Braunstein; Drew, who led office
that was responsible for the trades; and investment banking
co-head Michael Cavanagh, who led the internal investigation
into the losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report paints a picture of senior managers doing little
to rein in major risks that had paid off for the bank in the
past, misleading the public and regulators about those bets, and
expressing outright disdain for regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Senator Carl Levin, who chairs the subcommittee, said
he had not yet decided whether to refer the report to criminal
or civil authorities, he said the panel could hold further
hearings and left the door open to calling Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we have repeatedly acknowledged mistakes, our senior
management acted in good faith and never had any intent to
mislead anyone," a JPM spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MISLEADING STATEMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to identifying mismanagement at the bank, Senate
investigators faulted regulators at the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency for missing red flags and failing to
be aggressive in monitoring problems at the bank. The agency was
informed of JPMorgan's risk limit breaches and of changes to the
model the bank was using the calculate its risk, yet raised no
concerns at the time, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A testy relationship between the bank and the OCC went to
the highest levels of the bank including Drew, who criticized
the OCC for being overly intrusive, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But investigators laid the blame mainly on the bank itself,
and said at times JPMorgan withheld documents from the OCC,
declined to tell the agency about its position even as its
notional size grew to $51 billion from $4 billion, and
downplayed the importance of the portfolio by claiming it
planned to reduce the value when the bank instead tripled it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An OCC spokesman said the agency recognizes shortcomings in
its supervision and has taken steps to improve its supervisory
process. The spokesman also said the agency is continuing to
investigate the matter and "will take additional action as
appropriate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also made inaccurate statements to regulators and
to the public, the report said. On an April earnings call, for
example, JPMorgan executives said the positions were fully
transparent to regulators, that decisions about the portfolio
were made on a long-term basis, and that they were designed as
hedges consistent with the Volcker Rule, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committee sources also said the losses appeared to stretch
beyond $6.2 billion, but as other parts of the bank absorbed the
portfolio, JPMorgan declined to provide more information about
the values of the assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SKEPTICISM ON HEDGING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report could fuel further skepticism about whether banks
are telling the truth in describing derivative positions as
hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2012, as the positions came into public view, Dimon
asked the chief investment office for a information about a
portfolio the trades were meant to hedge, according to the
report. The OCC sought such an analysis, but the subcommittee
found no evidence it was completed, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recommendations outlined in the report, Levin called for
regulators to require banks to tell them about all portfolios
containing large derivatives positions, and provide
documentation to back up any described hedge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
frequently clashed with its main regulator as the bank's losses
from bad credit trades mounted last year, a Senate report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dysfunctional relationship between JPMorgan and the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees the
regulated bank subsidiary of JPMorgan's holding company, went
all the way to the top of the bank, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January and February, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie
Dimon ordered the bank to stop sending daily trading profit and
loss reports to the OCC, according to the report from the
Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, citing the
OCC's main JPMorgan examiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank told the OCC that it was stopping the reports
because they provided too much information, as well as to
prevent the leak of data, the report said. When the OCC asked
for the data again, Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein
provided it. The profit and loss reports stopped for less than a
week, according to the Senate report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a later meeting, when Dimon learned that Braunstein had
resumed supplying the reports to regulators, the CEO shouted at
the CFO in anger, the report said, citing the OCC examiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein stepped aside as chief financial officer earlier
this year to become a vice chairman at JPMorgan. The long-time
investment banker was replaced by Marianne Lake, previously CFO
of the bank's retail branch network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank frequently pushes back on OCC findings and
examinations, according to the report. At one point, bank
employees yelled at OCC regulators and called them "stupid." In
early 2012, when a junior OCC examiner went to a meeting that he
thought would be with his counterpart at the bank to discuss the
results of an examination, he was instead met by all the heads
of risk divisions of the bank, who criticized the OCC's findings
in a "loud" and "combative" tone, the report said, citing an
interview with the examiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase loss more than $6 billion last year after
making a series of wrong-way bets in credit derivatives
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

* $6 Billion Equity Repurchase
* $0.38 Quarterly Per Share Common Stock Dividend Effective Second Quarter

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Following the Federal Reserve Board`s release of 2013 CCAR results, JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today announced that:

* The Firm is authorized to repurchase an additional $6 billion of common equity
between April 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014. 
* The Board of Directors intends to declare the first quarter common stock
dividend of $0.30 per share. 
* The Board of Directors intends to increase the Firm`s quarterly common stock
dividend to $0.38 per share, effective second quarter of 2013.

The Federal Reserve Board informed the Firm today that it does not object to the
Firm`s proposed 2013 capital distribution plan. The Federal Reserve Board also
asked that the Firm submit an additional capital plan by the end of the third
quarter addressing the weaknesses identified in the Firm`s capital planning
processes. Following their review, the Federal Reserve Board may require the
Firm to modify its capital distributions. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase said: "We are pleased to
announce that our Board intends to increase our dividend in the second quarter,
returning it to its highest level, and to continue our equity buyback program.
We anticipate reaching a Basel III Tier I common ratio of 9.5% by the end of
this year after these capital actions and with the ongoing growth in our
businesses." 

Mr. Dimon added: "JPMorgan Chase is fully committed to meeting all of the Fed`s
requirements." 

The Firm`s 2013 dividends will be subject to the Board`s approval at the
customary times those dividends are declared. The Board intends to declare the
first quarter common stock dividend of $0.30 per share on March 19, 2013. The
second quarter dividend, which the Board intends to increase to $0.38 per share,
would be for shareholders of record on July 5, payable on July 31, 2013. 

Repurchases of equity will be pursuant to the common equity repurchase program
previously authorized by the Firm`s Board of Directors on March 13, 2012. The
timing and exact amount of common stock and warrants purchased will be
consistent with the Firm`s capital plan and will depend on various factors,
including market conditions, the Firm`s capital position, internal capital
generation, and organic investment opportunities. The Firm`s repurchase program
does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market
purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including the use of Rule 10b5-1
programs, and may be suspended at any time.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - An investor who claimed that Goldman Sachs &amp; Co misrepresented the risks of a distressed debt fund has lost a $1.4 million securities arbitration case against the brokerage and two of its advisers, according to a ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athena Venture Partners LP, an investment vehicle for Richard Caruso, filed the case against the unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) in 2009. The case alleged civil fraud and misrepresentation and the sale of unsuitable investments, among other things, according to a securities arbitration ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration panel also recommended removing disclosures about the case that appear in public filings for the investor's private wealth adviser at the firm and a Goldman portfolio manager, according to the ruling dated Wednesday and posted to FINRA's website on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Athena did not return a call or respond to an email requesting comment. A Goldman Sachs spokesman did not respond to an email requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision provides a glimpse at some of the unique challenges that wealthy investors can face in arbitration, say lawyers. Brokerages typically argue that wealthy and sophisticated investors fully understand the risks of the securities they are buying, including certain alternative investments such as the distressed debt fund at issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distressed debt funds invest in low-rated securities from troubled companies or may extend credit to those companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman argued that Caruso, who controlled Athena, understood the risks of alternative investments and had many years' experience in financial ventures. A general partner for Athena was also an experienced financial professional, Goldman argued. Athena established the account at Goldman specifically to pursue higher-risk, higher-reward investments, it argued, according to the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA's panel rejected arguments that Goldman misled Athena. Athena alleged that a summary description about the fund failed to disclose, among other things, its use of leverage, types of investments, and the high risk to principal.

&lt;p&gt;* Evidence did not support investor's misrepresentation
claim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Investor's principal experienced in financial ventures
-Goldman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Suzanne Barlyn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 14 (Reuters) - An investor who claimed that Goldman
Sachs &amp; Co misrepresented the risks of a distressed debt fund
has lost a $1.4 million securities arbitration case against the
brokerage and two of its advisers, according to a ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athena Venture Partners LP, an investment vehicle for
Richard Caruso, filed the case against the unit of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc in 2009. The case alleged civil fraud and
misrepresentation and the sale of unsuitable investments, among
other things, according to a securities arbitration ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
arbitration panel also recommended removing disclosures about
the case that appear in public filings for the investor's
private wealth adviser at the firm and a Goldman portfolio
manager, according to the ruling dated Wednesday and posted to
FINRA's website on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Athena did not return a call or respond to an
email requesting comment. A Goldman Sachs spokesman did not
respond to an email requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision provides a glimpse at some of the unique
challenges that wealthy investors can face in arbitration, say
lawyers. Brokerages typically argue that wealthy and
sophisticated investors fully understand the risks of the
securities they are buying, including certain alternative
investments such as the distressed debt fund at issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distressed debt funds invest in low-rated securities from
troubled companies or may extend credit to those companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman argued that Caruso, who controlled Athena,
understood the risks of alternative investments and had many
years' experience in financial ventures. A general partner for
Athena was also an experienced financial professional, Goldman
argued. Athena established the account at Goldman specifically
to pursue higher-risk, higher-reward investments, it argued,
according to the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA's panel rejected arguments that Goldman misled Athena.
Athena alleged that a summary description about the fund failed
to disclose, among other things, its use of leverage, types of
investments, and the high risk to principal.  The panel
disagreed, writing that the description itself was not an
official fund offering and was sent before the fund opened to
investors, according to the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athena also alleged that it did not receive a private fund
prospectus from Goldman, known as a private placement
memorandum, which discloses various risks. But Athena did not
prove that point, the panel wrote. Athena's signature in another
document acknowledged receiving the memorandum, the panel wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA rulings typically do not include reasons for the
panel's decision. Arbitrators must, however, explain their
reasons for recommending to remove certain disclosures from
public records for securities industry professionals, a process
known as "expungement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athena initially asked for more than $2.4 million in damages
but lowered the request to $1.4 million after the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed 13 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp. 2011-C3 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A
detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Fitch's affirmations are based on the stable performance of the underlying
collateral pool. There have been no delinquent or specially serviced loans since
issuance. Fitch reviewed the most recently available quarterly financial
performance of the pool as well as updated rent rolls for the top 15 loans,
which represent 75.1% of the transaction. 

As of the February 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal
balance has been reduced by 1.7% to $1.48 billion from $1.50 billion at
issuance. 

RATING SENSITIVITY 

All classes maintain Stable Rating Outlooks. No rating actions are expected
unless there are material changes to property occupancies or cash flows,
delinquencies, or loans transferred to special servicing. The pool has
maintained performance consistent with issuance. Additional information on
rating sensitivity is available in the report 'J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Trust 2011-C3' (Feb. 17, 2011), available at
www.fitchratings.com. 

The largest loan in the pool is secured by a 1,556,382 square feet (sf) regional
mall located in Holyoke, MA (14.7% of the pool). The mall is anchored by Macy's,
Sears, Target, and J.C. Penney. The total collateral size is 1,356,382 sf, as
Macy's owns both the store and land. As of year-end 2012, the occupancy at the
property remains at 91%. 

The second largest loan is secured by a portfolio of 32 geographically
diversified Alberston's grocery retail properties. The properties are located
across five states, primarily in the Southwest. As of year-end 2012, the
occupancy of the portfolio remains at 100%. 

Fitch affirms the following classes and maintains the Stable Outlook: 

--$56.4 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$318.7 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$253.6 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$100 million class A-3FL at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$485.4 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$41.1 million class B at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$52.3 million class C at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$35.5 million class D at 'BBB+sf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$41.1 million class E at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$9.3 million class G at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$16.8 million class H at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$3.7 million class J at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable. 

Fitch does not rate the class F, NR and interest-only class X-B certificates.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigned its final ratings to fourteen classes
of JPMCC 2013-C10, a $1.28 billion CMBS multi-borrower transaction
collateralized by 50 fixed rate commercial mortgage loans that are secured by
101 properties. Concurrently, we have withdrawn our preliminary ratings of the
certificates, which were assigned on February 22, 2013 (see our ratings listed
below). 

The mortgage loan sellers are JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMCB),
CIBC Inc. (CIBC) and Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation (RCMC). The
respective contribution of each seller to the pool balance is as follows: JPMCB
(36 loans, 81.1%), CIBC (8 loans, 12.0%) and RCMC (6 loans, 6.9%). The majority
of the loans (29 loans, 69.2%) were used to refinance existing debt, while the
proceeds from 21 loans (30.8%) were used for property acquisitions. 

The loans have principal balances that range from $3.0 million to $130.0 million
for the largest loan in the pool, which is secured by The Shops at Riverside
(10.2%), a regional mall property located in Hackensack, New Jersey. The top
five loans, which also include Gateway Center (8.8%), EIP Industrial Portfolio
(7.1%), 111 West Jackson (6.3%) and Pot-Nets Manufactured Housing Portfolio
(4.8%), represent 37.0% of the initial pool balance, and the top 10 loan
exposures represent 55.0%. The properties are geographically diverse and located
across 22 states with the three largest state concentrations being New Jersey
(14.0%), Illinois (11.6%) and Pennsylvania (11.4%). The pool has exposure to two
property types with concentrations in excess of 10%: retail (35.2%) and office
(33.9%). 

KBRA`s analysis of the transaction incorporated our multi-borrower rating
process that begins with our analysts' evaluation of underlying collateral
properties' financial and operating performance, which determine KBRA`s estimate
of sustainable net cash flow (KNCF) and KBRA value. The analysis utilized our
CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines to determine KNCF, which on an aggregate
basis was 3.3% less than the issuer cash flow. KBRA capitalization rates were
applied to each asset`s KNCF to derive individual property values that, on an
aggregate basis, were 33.4% less than third party appraisal values. The pool has
an in-trust KLTV of 97.8% and an all-in LTV of 101.5%. 

KNCF and KBRA capitalization rates were among the key inputs used in our credit
modeling process. The model deploys rent and occupancy stresses, probability of
default regressions, and loss given default calculations to determine losses for
each collateral loan that were used by KBRA to assign our credit ratings for
this transaction.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded five classes and affirmed 14 classes of JP Morgan
Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp (JMCC) commercial mortgage
pass-through certificates series 2006-CIBC15 due to further pool deterioration,
most of which involves increased loss expectation on the specially serviced
loans. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press
release. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Fitch modeled losses of 16.4% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the
original pool balance total 21.7%, including losses already incurred. The pool
has experienced $171.2 million (8.1% of the original pool balance) in realized
losses to date. Realized losses on several of the specially serviced assets were
higher than expected. Fitch has designated 38 loans (48.3%) as Fitch Loans of
Concern, which includes 10 specially serviced assets (14.9%). 

As of the February 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal
balance has been reduced by 16.9% to $1.76 billion from $2.12 billion at
issuance. Per the servicer reporting, one loan (0.3% of the pool) is defeased.
Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes A-J through NR. 

The largest contributor to expected losses is the Warner Building loan (16.6% of
the pool), which is secured by a 616,135 square foot (sf) office property,
designated a historical landmark, located in Washington, D.C., approximately
three blocks from the White House. In January 2012, the property experienced a
significant decline in occupancy from 99% to 49% as a result of the bankruptcy
and vacancy of the largest tenant, Howrey Simon Arnold &amp; White (54%). Currently,
the largest tenants are Baker Botts, LLP (26%, lease expiration 2020), Cooley
LLP (14%, lease expiration 2028) recently signed, General Electric Company (8%,
lease exp. 2016), and Live Nation (Warner Theatre) (7%, lease expiration 2014).
As of the January 2013 rent roll, the property occupancy has increased to 65%.
The borrower continues to aggressively market the vacant space and discussions
continues with a few prospective tenants. The loan is with the master servicer
and remains current. 

The next largest contributor to expected losses is the Scottsdale Plaza Resort
loan (3.4%), which is secured by a 404-key hotel located in Scottsdale, AZ. The
loan remains current as the borrower continues to fund debt service shortfalls
out of pocket. The property's performance continues to lag its competitive set
in terms of occupancy, average daily rate (ADR), and revenue per available room
(RevPAR). According to the January 2013 STR Global (STR) report, the property's
occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR were 55%, $123.82, and $68.16, respectively, compared
to the competitive set's performance of 65.1%, $214.42, and $139.49. The most
recent servicer reported debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for year-end (YE)
2011 was 0.64x, stable with last year but down significantly from the 1.93x
reported at issuance. 

The third largest contributor to expected losses is the specially-serviced US
Bank Center (2.2%), a 362,031 sf office property located in St. Paul, MN, two
blocks from the State Capital building. The loan was transferred to special
servicing back in June 2009 for imminent default due to the second largest
tenant (at issuance) vacating at lease expiration. The trust acquired the
property in October 2012 through a foreclosure sale. Occupancy at the property
has increased from 63% to 74% with the addition of two new leases. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES: 

The 'AAA' rated classes are expected to remain stable as they are first in
priority for payment. The 'AA' rated classes may be subject to further rating
actions should the performance of the larger performing loans deteriorate or
loss expectations increase. Additionally, three of the loans in the top 15 are
leased to single tenants. The lower distressed classes are subject to further
rating actions as losses are realized. 

Fitch downgrades the following classes and assigns or revises Rating Outlooks
and Recovery Estimates (REs) as indicated: 

--$1 billion class A-4 to 'AAsf' from 'AAAsf', Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$219.4 million class A-1A to 'AAsf' from 'AAAsf', Outlook to Negative from
Stable; 

--$211.8 million class A-M to 'CCCsf' from 'BBsf', RE 85%; 

--$164.2 million class A-J to 'CCsf' from 'CCCsf', RE 0%; 

--$37.1 million class B to 'Csf' from 'CCsf', RE 0%. 

Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated: 

--$13.1 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable; 

--$62.3 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable; 

--$15.9 million class C at 'Csf', RE 0%; 

--$31.8 million class D at 'Csf', RE 0%; 

--$3.7 million class E at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--$0 class F at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--$0 class G at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--$0 class H at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--$0 class J at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--$0 class K at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--$0 class L at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--$0 class M at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--$0 class N at 'Dsf', RE 0%; 

--$0 class P at 'Dsf', RE 0%. 

The class A-1 certificates have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the class NR
certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the ratings on the interest-only class
X-1 and X-2 certificates.

&lt;p&gt;  SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA, Mar 14 (Marketwire) -- 
Visang Education, a Korea-based educational publishing company, and
MetaMetrics(R) Inc., a U.S.-based educational measurement company, today
announced a strategic partnership focused on English language learning
innovation and Lexile technology.

    "Lexile measures are distinguished for their practical value in
education," said Tae Hoe Yang, chief executive officer of Visang. "We
endeavor to bring groundbreaking new English learning solutions to
market, and our partnership with MetaMetrics is founded on the premise of
achieving this goal together."

    "We are honored to be in partnership with Visang on this critical
initiative," said Dr. Malbert Smith III, co-founder and president of
MetaMetrics. "English is an increasingly vital skill for academic and
workplace success, and the demand is growing worldwide for educational
products that personalize and accelerate learning for all students.
Lexile measures offer distinct capabilities to help Visang address these
needs."

    The Lexile(R) Framework for Reading is an objective approach for
measuring readers and texts using a common measurement scale. Readers
receive a Lexile measure through assessment linking technology, while
text measures are determined using proprietary software that analyzes the
complexity of the vocabulary and syntax. When the Lexile measure of a
reader matches the Lexile measure of a text, reading and learning
improves. Lexile measures range from below 200L for beginner level
readers and texts to 1600L and above for advanced level readers and
texts. Lexile measures are prominently featured in the new U.S. Common
Core State Standards for English language arts, which have been adopted
by 48 of 50 states.

    MetaMetrics research and development division is working closely now with
David Choi, chief operating officer of Visang's English education
division. "With all the ways that Lexile measures can enhance our
capabilities," said Mr. Choi, "it is exciting to contemplate the many
benefits ahead for students, teachers and parents once we bring our
solutions forward."

    "Our partnerships across Asia are growing in recognition of the
fundamental value that Lexile measures provide in matching readers with
text," said Todd Sandvik, senior vice president of Global Services for
MetaMetrics. "What sets Visang apart is their deep understanding of how
Lexile measures can enrich and compliment their own unique vision. We now
share a commitment to realizing its fullest potential."

    Recognized as the most widely used measure of English reading, Lexile
measures today connect tens of millions of students to more than 100
million articles and books through extensive partnerships in government,
publishing, technology and research. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' metals trader
David Freeland has left the U.S. investment bank just over a
year after being hired to build its physical copper book in
London, market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His departure is the strongest sign yet that the bank is
struggling to expand into the capital-intensive and high-risk
business perfected by commodity merchants Glencore and
Trafigura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman at Goldman in London declined to comment on
Freeland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His resignation comes just months after the retirement of
Steve Branton-Speak who spearheaded the bank's march into
physical trading in 2010 in a bid to offset tighter regulation
that forced it to close its proprietary metals derivatives
trading desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commodity revenues at leading Wall Street firms crashed last
year to their lowest on record, as tighter regulation and
limited price swings squeezed the once dominant traders of
Goldman, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline is most stark at Goldman, where commodity
revenues collapsed by more than 60 percent year-on-year in 2012
to just $575 million, according to the bank's annual report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman hired Freeland from Trafigura in December 2011. It
hired Scott Evans from Mitsubishi in 2010 to trade aluminium,
the same year it bought warehousing company Metro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market sources have said the team has been hampered by a
lack of capital and bank bureaucracy, a big cultural shift for
the traders who joined from some of the world's biggest
merchants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Raheem Salman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD, March 14 (Reuters) - Indonesia's state-owned oil
and gas firm Pertamina is in talks to buy 10-20
percent of Exxon Mobil's stake in Iraq's West Qurna-1
oilfield, Indonesia's Chief Economic Minister said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of the $50 billion West Qurna-1 project has
been in question since last year, when Exxon offered to sell its
stake after contracts it signed with the autonomous Kurdistan
region riled Baghdad, which rejects them as illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesian minister Hatta Rajasa confirmed that Pertamina is
interested in buying into the project. It has begun negotiations
for a possible 10 to 20 percent stake, he said at a news
conference in Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources have said Exxon is considering selling part of its
60 percent stake in West Qurna-1 to PetroChina 
, the listed arm of China National Petroleum Corp
(CNPC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has offered Exxon
sweeter contract terms to keep it operating in the south, on
condition that the U.S. oil giant gives up its Kurdish deals,
industry sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's news conference also confirmed the signing of a
memorandum of understanding that Iraq is to supply Indonesia
with 35,000 barrels of oil per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  CHELMSFORD, MA, Mar 14 (Marketwire) -- 


--  Aspect earns distinction through demonstrated technology success and
    customer commitment

    a few Gold competencies attainted

    

Aspect Software, a leading provider of next generation customer
contact and enterprise workforce optimization, announced today that it

and six Silver Competencies. Microsoft Gold Competencies place Aspect in
the top 1% of Microsoft's partner network and demonstrates the company's
ability to meet Microsoft Corp. customers' evolving needs in today's
dynamic business environment. 

    To earn a Microsoft gold competency, partners must successfully complete

level of technology expertise, and then designate these certified
professionals uniquely to one Microsoft competency, ensuring a certain
level of staffing capacity. They also must submit customer references
that demonstrate successful projects (along with implementing a yearly

over five years and this level of achievement is representative of the
significant commitment and dedication our Microsoft Professional Services
group has shown," said Stewart Bloom, Aspect CEO. "We believe that our
history and our competencies with Microsoft differentiate us in today's
competitive market as the Go-To contact center solution for
Microsoft-centric organizations. We expect that our current increase in
R investment and market expansion will only accelerate the value Aspect
and Microsoft provide to our joint clients."

    As a Microsoft Partner with Gold and Silver competencies, Aspect is in
the top tier of the Microsoft Partner Network. Earning the Microsoft
competencies means Aspect gains access to exclusive training, software
licenses and support to better serve clients.

    "By achieving a gold competency, partners like Aspect have demonstrated
the highest, most consistent capability and commitment to the latest
Microsoft technology," said Jon Roskill, corporate vice president,
Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. "These partners have a deep
expertise that puts them in the top 1 percent of our partner ecosystem,
and their proficiency will help customers drive innovative solutions on
the latest Microsoft technology."

    Aspect's Gold Competencies include:


--  Communications
--  Collaboration and Content
--  Digital Marketing
--  Mobility
--  Business Intelligence
--  Customer Relationship Manager
--  OEM

    

Aspect's Silver Certifications include:


--  Application development
--  Data platform
--  Application integration
--  Midmarket solution provider
--  Hosting
--  Learning

    

The Microsoft Partner Network helps partners strengthen their
capabilities to showcase leadership in the marketplace on the latest
technology, to better serve customers and, with 640,000 Microsoft
partners in their ecosystem, to easily connect with one of the most
active, diverse networks in the world.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Mar 14 (Marketwire) -- 
Bill Blais has been named LOYAL3 Executive Vice President, effective
immediately. LOYAL3 offers a technology platform that enables individual
investors to buy stock in their favorite companies on Facebook or the web
easily, in affordable amounts and with no fees to buy or sell stock. 

    Mr. Blais will lead LOYAL3 Securities, Inc.'s efforts in positioning
LOYAL3's highly scalable technology platform for IPOs and follow-on
offerings. Called a Social IPO(TM), the platform provides IPO access to
individuals on a first-come, first-serve basis on Facebook and the web at
the same price, and the same time, as institutions.

    "Bill's 28 years on Wall Street make him uniquely qualified to lead our
capital markets segment," said Barry Schneider, LOYAL3 Chairman &amp; CEO.
"People who have worked with Bill know and trust him, and we look for
Bill to connect our Silicon Valley technology with Wall Street in a
ubiquitous way, for the benefit of issuers and individual investors
alike." 

    Blais was most recently with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., where he served as
managing director in the Equity Capital Markets group of the firm's
Investment Banking Division. Previously, Blais spent 22 years at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., most recently as a managing director in its Global Capital
Markets group. Blais is a graduate of the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University and Brown University.

    "I'm thrilled to be joining LOYAL3," Blais said. "I have observed LOYAL3
for almost two years as they have developed their Social IPO offering,
and in my view its impact to the capital markets will be transformative.
It opens access to a new investor channel, creating incremental demand
and liquidity for issuers," he explained.

    About LOYAL3 

    LOYAL3 offers a highly scalable social technology platform for a whole
new class of individual investors. By making stock ownership easy and
affordable, we are dedicated to opening up market access to tens of
millions of people.

    Our principle is "fee-free investing" and our technology processes
fractional shares at scale. We generate revenue from companies by helping
them raise capital, attract low-cost individual shareholders, and create
a deeper level of brand engagement.

    LOYAL3's core product enables people to buy stock in their favorite
companies in just 3 steps on Facebook or the web, as easily as buying a
product online. People can invest as little as $10 and they pay no fees
to buy or sell stock. 

    The company also offers an IPO product, called a Social IPO, that opens
up IPO access to everyday people on a first-come, first-serve basis,
making IPO stock available at the same price, and at the same time, as
institutions.

    With its newest product, called Stock Rewards(TM), LOYAL3 enables
companies to use their stock for brand-positive promotions, increasing
acquisition, engagement and loyalty.

BALTIMORE, March 14, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Goldman Small Cap Research, a stock market research
firm focused on the small cap and micro cap sectors, has issued a research report on Scout
Exploration, Inc. (OTCBB:SCXN), an early stage company engaged in the development a unique
airborne oil spill technology response system, designed to contain offshore and shoreline oil
spills.

Each year there are hundreds of offshore and shoreline oil spills, ranging from tens of millions
of gallons to millions of barrels of oil in size, causing up to tens of billions of dollars' worth
of ecological and business damages. Through a recent transaction, Scout has acquired the rights to
what may be the most effective method of oil spill containment and remediation.

In the Goldman Opportunity Research report on the Company, analyst Rob Goldman outlines his
investment thesis.

"The Company's proprietary technology and approach is highlighted by a unique airborne delivery
method which substantially reduces response time and limits the damage caused by the accident. The
size of the market is enormous and, if future tests prove successful, the Scout system could be
broadly deployed around the world."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks slipped on Friday, ending the Dow Jones industrial average's longest winning streak since 1996 as investors paused just below the S 500's record high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decline in JPMorgan Chase shares after the bank was hit by a one-two punch of bad news also weighed on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day after ending within 2 points of the all-time closing high of 1,565.15 hit in October 2007, the benchmark S 500 ended Friday's session about 5 points away. For the week, the S 500 rose 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow snapped its 10-day winning streak, when it racked up a series of all-time highs. Equities have rallied since the start of the year on signs of improvement in the economy and supported by the Federal Reserve's efforts to bolster the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors could use the pause to consolidate bets before pushing the market higher again, said Cam Albright, director of asset allocation at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors in Wilmington, Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think that one or two days' movement is really going to change the underlying momentum of this market, which I still think is pretty strong at this point," Albright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) was the biggest drag on the S 500 and one of the biggest weights on the Dow, falling 1.9 percent to $50.02.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve told JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) that they must fix flaws in how they determine capital payouts to shareholders, though the central bank still approved their plans for share buybacks and dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Senate report alleged that JPMorgan had ignored risks, misled investors, fought with regulators and tried to work around rules as it dealt with mushrooming losses in a derivatives portfolio. A former top JPMorgan official told lawmakers on Friday she was not to blame for the losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Goldman shares recovered from early weakness to gain 0.5 percent to $154.84. The stock of rival Bank of America (BAC.N) rose 3.8 percent to $12.57. The S financial sector index .SPSY edged up 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slipped 25.03 points, or 0.17 percent, to 14,514.11 at the close.

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, shareholder lawyers leading the 10-month-old securities fraud class action accusing JPMorgan Chase of deceiving investors about billions of dollars in losses by the banks chief investment office received permission to delay filing their latest complaint until April 12, in order to allow them time to digest the findings of a Senate investigation of the banks so-called whale trades. That was good thinking. The&#160;307-page reportof the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released Thursday evening, is a trove for plaintiffs lawyers, filled with well-documented allegations of overly risky, undersupervised trading by JPMorgans chief investment office; deliberate attempts by the CIO to minimize the appearance of burgeoning losses; and subsequent efforts by the bank to mislead regulators and investors about the CIOs activities and losses. The report references previously undisclosed emails, memos and other documents purportedly showing that senior managers were told the (CIO portfolio) was massive, losing money, and had stopped providing credit loss protection to the bank, yet downplayed those problems and kept describing the portfolio as a risk-reducing hedge, until forced by billions of dollars in losses to admit disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of documentary evidence is a rare gift for securities class action lawyers, who usually have to scrape through the preliminaries of fraud litigation without access to any evidence at all from defendants. Here, by contrast, the Senate subcommittee has mapped out precisely what it considers to be misleading statements by top bank officials alongside its evidence that JPMorgan knew the statements were false at the time they were made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the Senate report targets comments CEO Jamie Dimon and CFO Douglas Braunstein made during the infamous April 13, 2012, earnings call in which JPMorgan first publicly discussed the CIO and its increasingly troubled portfolio, after news stories earlier in the month reported that JPMorgans position was warping the derivatives market. That earnings call has been scrutinized by shareholder lawyers since they first began&#160;battling for control&#160;of the securities fraud case against JPMorgan last June, and the Senate subcommittee doesnt supply indisputable evidence that Dimon or Braunstein deliberately lied to analysts about the CIO. Theres a fair amount of inference in the knowledge imputed to Dimon and Braunstein in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Senate provides a ton of detail about what JPMorgan knew or should have known at the time of the analyst call. So even though the CEO told analysts that the controversy over the CIOs losses was a tempest in a teapot (a comment he has since said he regrets), the Senate report documents that Dimon already knew the CIO portfolio had experienced three months of losses  including exponentially rising losses the previous month  and that the bank would have difficulty extricating itself from the CIOs positions. On the same earnings call, Braunstein said the CIOs trading positions were subject to the banks risk management processes; were fully transparent to regulators whom the bank regularly briefed; were managed on a long-term basis; and were hedges to reduce JPMorgans risk. The Senate report offers evidence that, to the contrary, Braunstein had been informed that CIO positions and trades were inconsistent with long-term protection against credit risk. The report doesnt specifically accuse him of misrepresenting his own knowledge of CIO risk management or reports to regulators, but said his statements were mischaracterizations that omitted facts known to JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most potentially powerful evidence that the bank was massaging its message about CIO positions and losses, according to the Senate report, came from emails involving JPMorgans corporate communications staff. The head of that department supposedly devised the strategy of telling analysts that CIO trading was a long-term hedge against structural risk that was reported to regulators. And according to the report, his tempering of the exact words in which the bank would describe the CIOs role shows that bank was aware that its initial characterizations were not entirely true. The day after the public relations strategy launched, the report said, a trader in the CIO sent an email to his boss. The market is quiet today, he said. The banks communications yesterday are starting to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholder lawyers from&#160;Bernstein Litowitz Berger  Grossmann,&#160;Grant  Eisenhofer&#160;and&#160;Kessler Topaz Meltzer  Check, who were appointed lead counsel in the case last August, will also benefit from the Senate reports description of JPMorgans failure to control the risk of the CIOs portfolio and efforts to keep the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the dark, first about the very existence of the CIO and then about its losses. Overall, the report portrays top JPMorgan officials as negligent, at best, in overseeing the activities of a trading group with an unclear mandate and a confusing strategy to mitigate losses as they developed. Thats the same theme plaintiffs have already articulated in the&#160;amended complaint&#160;they filed last November, but the evidence JPMorgan turned over to Senate investigators (as well as JPMorgans&#160;own internal report&#160;on the CIO, released in January) will add layers of detail to shareholders allegations. In its yet to be filed but inevitable motion to dismiss the case, JPMorgan and its lawyers at&#160;Sullivan  Cromwell&#160;will surely argue that despite the rhetorical flourishes in the Senate report, theres no solid evidence that Dimon and Braunstein deliberately deceived the market. But Ill be very surprised if shareholders cant get past a dismissal motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If U.S. District Judge&#160;George Daniels&#160;of Manhattan eventually certifies a class, how big is JPMorgans exposure? That will depend on the length of the class period. The shareholders complaint filed in November proposes a much longer class period than plaintiffs initially suggested, dating back to Feb. 24, 2010, when JPMorgan shares traded at about $40, and ending on May 21, 2012, when shares closed at about $32 after the bank restated earnings to reflect CIO losses. That period would permit anyone who bought or sold shares over those two years to claim damages for their losses. For a company with a public float of more than 3.75 billion shares, those are potentially vast numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is likely to argue that any class period should be much shorter, and in that argument it might even find support in the Senate report. The subcommittee pinpoints supposed misstatements to the market in that April 2012 analyst call. The bank issued corrective disclosures less than a month later. If plaintiffs get past the dismissal stage of the case, expect JPMorgan to assert that the class period should be restricted to the few weeks between the analyst call and the May 2012 filings that disclosed larger CIO losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#160;told Reuters&#160;Thursday that despite the Senate committees portrayal (and its own previous admission of mistakes in the handling of the CIO), our senior management acted in good faith and never had any intent to mislead anyone. JPMorgan counsel&#160;Daryl Libow&#160;of SC declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more of my posts, please go to&#160;Thomson Reuters News  Insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

March 27, 2013.

&lt;p&gt;* S 500 fails to hit closing high this week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Trading volume higher than average on 'quadruple witching'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan drops on Senate report, Fed findings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow off 0.2 pct, S 500 off 0.2 pct, Nasdaq off 0.3 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Angela Moon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on
Friday, ending the Dow Jones industrial average's longest
winning streak since 1996 as investors paused just below the S
500's record high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decline in JPMorgan Chase shares after the bank was hit by
a one-two punch of bad news also weighed on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day after ending within 2 points of the all-time closing
high of 1,565.15 hit in October 2007, the benchmark S 500
ended Friday's session about 5 points away. For the week, the
S 500 rose 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow snapped its 10-day winning streak, when it racked up
a series of all-time highs. Equities have rallied since the
start of the year on signs of improvement in the economy and
supported by the Federal Reserve's efforts to bolster the
recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors could use the pause to consolidate bets before
pushing the market higher again, said Cam Albright, director of
asset allocation at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors in
Wilmington, Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think that one or two days' movement is really
going to change the underlying momentum of this market, which I
still think is pretty strong at this point," Albright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co was the biggest drag on the S
500 and one of the biggest weights on the Dow, falling 1.9
percent to $50.02.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve told JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc that they must fix flaws in how they determine
capital payouts to shareholders, though the central bank still
approved their plans for share buybacks and dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Senate report alleged that JPMorgan had ignored risks,
misled investors, fought with regulators and tried to work
around rules as it dealt with mushrooming losses in a
derivatives portfolio. A former top JPMorgan official told
lawmakers on Friday she was not to blame for the losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Goldman shares recovered from early weakness to
gain 0.5 percent to $154.84. The stock of rival Bank of America
 rose 3.8 percent to $12.57. The S financial sector
index edged up 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 25.03
points, or 0.17 percent, to 14,514.11 at the close. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 Index  shed 2.53 points, or 0.16 percent, to
1,560.70. The Nasdaq Composite Index  dropped 9.86
points, or 0.30 percent, to end at 3,249.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week, the Dow rose 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq gained
just 0.15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume was robust because of 'quadruple witching' - the
quarterly settlement and expiration of four different types of
March equity futures and options contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 8.2 billion shares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT, compared with the 2012
average daily closing volume of about 6.45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting the Nasdaq, shares of Apple Inc rose 2.6
percent to $443.66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service showed investors
in U.S.-based funds poured $11.26 billion of new cash into stock
funds in the latest week, the most since late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A busy day of economic reports reinforced investors' view
that the economic recovery has momentum to it. Manufacturing
output bounced back in February, though the pace of
manufacturing growth in New York state cooled slightly in March
and consumer sentiment fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 retail sector index lost 0.8 percent
after the consumer sentiment data from Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer prices registered their biggest increase in nearly
four years as the cost of gasoline rose. But a smaller gain in
the core U.S. Consumer Price Index, which excludes volatile food
and energy prices, left the door open for the Federal Reserve to
continue its bond-buying program, which has contributed to the
stock market's rally.&lt;/p&gt;

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7bgvtc/industrial) has announced the
addition of the "Industrial Equipment Wholesalers" report to their offering. 

Companies in this industry distribute machinery and equipment used in
manufacturing, oil and gas exploration and production, and warehousing. Major
companies include MSC Industrial and the wholesale operations of manufacturers
such as General Electric and NACCO Materials Handling Group (all based in the
US), as well as Brammer (UK) and China National Machinery Import &amp; Export
Corporation. 

The US industrial equipment wholesalers industry consists of about 25,000
companies with combined annual revenue of about $150 billion. Domestic demand
for industrial machinery is expected to grow moderately in the next two years.
Key growth drivers include low interest rates and the health of the economy. 

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE 

Demand depends heavily on US manufacturing activity. Profitability depends on
product selection and efficient operations. Large companies have economies of
scale in advertising and sales programs. Small companies can compete effectively
by specializing in particular industries, end-use applications, or geographical
areas, and by offering special services. The industry is highly fragmented: the
50 largest companies account for about 25 percent of industry revenue. 

Imports are an important source of product for industrial machinery wholesalers.
Major sources of imports are Germany, Japan, China, and Canada. 

PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS &amp; TECHNOLOGY 

Major products are general purpose machinery such as pumps and engines (about 30
percent of revenue); oil well, oil refinery, and pipeline machinery (about 13
percent of revenue); and material handling equipment (10 percent). Other
products include manufacturing machinery, machine tools, and oil field
equipment.

Key Topics Covered:

1. Industry Overview 

2. Quarterly Industry Update 

3. Business Challenges 

4. Business Trends 

5. Industry Opportunities 

6. Call Preparation Questions 

7. Financial Information

Friday, weighed by a decline in JPMorgan Chase shares after the
bank was hit by a one-two punch of bad news and as investors
paused just below the S 500's record high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The widely watched index was about 6 points away from its

year on signs of improvement in the economy and supported by the
Federal Reserve's efforts to bolster the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems like the market is digesting some of the rally
that we have seen so far, but when we reflect on the current
valuation which is 13 1/2 times earnings on a forward looking
basis, it is still a comfortable level compared to around 20 in
2007 and 29-30 levels in 2000," said David Lyon, Investment

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday threw out a class action lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), making it easier for companies that clear trades to avoid being accountable to investors who are defrauded by their brokerages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said clearing firms need "sufficiently direct" involvement in a brokerage's fraud, by instigating or directing it or through other "extraordinarily high involvement," to create a duty to disclose or correct the improper conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent such a duty, brokerage customers could not sue as a group on the ground that they relied on inadequate disclosures, a three-judge appeals court panel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A clearing broker's knowledge of the fraud alone is an insufficient basis on which to impose a duty of disclosure," Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston wrote for the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearing firms perform such activities as delivering securities, maintaining records, safeguarding customer funds, and sending trade confirmations and monthly statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOILER ROOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case concerned activities at Sterling Foster &amp; Co, a defunct Melville, New York-based penny stock firm that federal investigators said was a boiler room that defrauded thousands of investors out of more than $70 million in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randolph Pace, who prosecutors said ran the fraud, was sentenced to 8-1/3 years in prison in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors had accused Bear Stearns Cos, which JPMorgan bought in 2008, of helping Sterling manipulate a September 1996 initial public offering for ML Direct Inc, a marketer of products sold through infomercials and home shopping networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the investors, Sterling offered 3.9 million ML Direct shares though it had fewer than 1.1 million to sell, and covered the resulting 2.86 million share short position by purchasing shares from insiders at a big discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investors said this let Sterling pocket more than $24 million, a profit exceeding 400 percent, when it sold the shares to the public at a price inflated by the artificial shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the investors, Bear knew about the fraud through its role as a clearing broker, and furthered it by extending credit to Sterling, carrying the short position on its books, and dutifully mailing trade confirmations to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SAD DAY FOR INVESTOR PROTECTION"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2010, U.S. District Judge Arthur Spatt in Central Islip, New York certified a class action. He said the Sterling customers were entitled to rely on Bear to handle their trades properly, and disclose behind-the-scenes activity at Sterling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the 2nd Circuit said Bear's relationship with Sterling was too distant to warrant a special duty to the investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investors "allege, at most, that Bear Stearns approved the ML Direct offering; that it agreed to serve as clearing broker for the offering; and that it may have violated certain NASD rules and Federal Reserve regulations," Livingston wrote. "We think substantially more direct participation by the clearing broker is required for a duty of disclosure to exist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leslie Trager, a lawyer for the investors, said in a phone interview he is weighing his options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The 2nd Circuit's ruling has for the first time held that a clearing firm has no duty to disclose that it is knowingly participating in market manipulation by its introducing broker," he said. "It is a sad day for investor protection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Justin Perras had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Levitt et al v. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 10-4596.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)&lt;/p&gt;

by their brokerages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said
clearing firms need "sufficiently direct" involvement in a
brokerage's fraud, by instigating or directing it or through
other "extraordinarily high involvement," to create a duty to
disclose or correct the improper conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent such a duty, brokerage customers could not sue as a
group on the ground that they relied on inadequate disclosures,
a three-judge appeals court panel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A clearing broker's knowledge of the fraud alone is an
insufficient basis on which to impose a duty of disclosure,"
Circuit Judge Debra Ann Livingston wrote for the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearing firms perform such activities as delivering
securities, maintaining records, safeguarding customer funds,
and sending trade confirmations and monthly statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOILER ROOM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case concerned activities at Sterling Foster &amp; Co, a
defunct Melville, New York-based penny stock firm that federal
investigators said was a boiler room that defrauded thousands of
investors out of more than $70 million in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randolph Pace, who prosecutors said ran the fraud, was
sentenced to 8-1/3 years in prison in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors had accused Bear Stearns Cos, which JPMorgan
bought in 2008, of helping Sterling manipulate a Sept. 1996
initial public offering for ML Direct Inc, a marketer of
products sold through infomercials and home shopping networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the investors, Sterling offered 3.9 million ML
Direct shares though it had fewer than 1.1 million to sell, and
covered the resulting 2.86 million share short position by
purchasing shares from insiders at a big discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investors said this let Sterling pocket more than $24
million, a profit exceeding 400 percent, when it sold the shares
to the public at a price inflated by the artificial shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the investors, Bear knew about the fraud
through its role as a clearing broker, and furthered it by
extending credit to Sterling, carrying the short position on its
books, and dutifully mailing trade confirmations to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SAD DAY FOR INVESTOR PROTECTION"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2010, U.S. District Judge Arthur Spatt in Central
Islip, New York certified a class action. He said the Sterling
customers were entitled to rely on Bear to handle their trades
properly, and disclose behind-the-scenes activity at Sterling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the 2nd Circuit said Bear's relationship with Sterling
was too distant to warrant a special duty to the investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investors "allege, at most, that Bear Stearns approved
the ML Direct offering; that it agreed to serve as clearing
broker for the offering; and that it may have violated certain
NASD rules and Federal Reserve regulations," Livingston wrote.
"We think substantially more direct participation by the
clearing broker is required for a duty of disclosure to exist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leslie Trager, a lawyer for the investors, said in a phone
interview he is weighing his options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The 2nd Circuit's ruling has for the first time held that a
clearing firm has no duty to disclose that it is knowingly
participating in market manipulation by its introducing broker,"
he said. "It is a sad day for investor protection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Justin Perras had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Levitt et al v. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 10-4596.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Response operations continued on Friday in a Louisiana bayou where a fire ignited earlier this week after a tug and oil barge hit a Chevron Corp liquid petroleum gas pipeline about 30 miles south of New Orleans, the Coast Guard said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tug pushing the barge that carried 2,215 barrels of crude oil struck the Chevron pipeline in shallow water early evening on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shut down the line right after the accident, but the remaining LPG has been burning off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the amount of liquid petroleum gas remaining in the pipeline dwindles, it is predicted that the size, color and smoke amount may fluctuate," the Coast Guard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This controlled burn will clear the line of the residual liquid petroleum gas," the Coast Guard said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tank barge was separated from the tug wreckage late Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responders were monitoring to maintain integrity of the barge to allow for safe salvage once the fire is extinguished, according to the Coast Guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accident happened in a bayou west of the Mississippi River. Chevron had said the line connects a gas plant in Venice, Louisiana, with a pump station in Paradis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Alden Bentley)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan drops on Senate report, Fed findings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* S 500 hovers 4 points below record closing high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow off 0.2 pct, S 500 off 0.1 pct, Nasdaq off 0.2 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Leah Schnurr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dipped on Friday,
weighed by a decline in JPMorgan Chase after a one-two punch of
bad news for the bank, though the S 500 remained in sight of
record levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 was roughly 4 points away from its record
closing high after failing to end above that level on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday morning's dip also brought the Dow's 10-day winning
streak to an end. Still, investors could use the pause to
consolidate bets before pushing the market higher again, said
Cam Albright, director of asset allocation at Wilmington Trust 
Investment Advisors, in Wilmington, Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think that one or two days' movement is really
going to change the underlying momentum of this market, which I
still think is pretty strong at this point," Albright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the biggest drag on both the Dow and
S 500, falling 2 percent to $49.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve told JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc that they must fix flaws in how
they determine capital payouts to shareholders, though it still
approved their plans for share buybacks and dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Senate report alleged that JPMorgan had ignored risks,
misled investors, fought with regulators and tried to work
around rules as it dealt with mushrooming losses in a
derivatives portfolio. A former top JPMorgan official told
lawmakers on Friday she was not to blame for the losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Goldman shares recovered from early weakness to
gain 0.6 percent to $154.94. The stock of rival Bank of America
 rose 3.2 percent to $12.50. The S financial sector
index edged up 0.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 26.59
points, or 0.18 percent, to 14,512.39. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index edged down 2.15 points, or 0.14 percent, at
1,561.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 6.38 points,
or 0.20 percent, to 3,252.55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market volatility may be increased due to 'quadruple
witching' - the quarterly settlement and expiration of four
different types of March equity futures and options contracts.
Expiration can lead to greater volume and volatility as players
adjust or exercise derivatives positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service showed investors
in U.S.-based funds poured $11.26 billion of new cash into stock
funds in the latest week, the most since late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A busy day of economic reports reinforced investors' view
that the economic recovery has momentum to it. Manufacturing
output bounced back in February, though the pace of
manufacturing growth in New York state cooled slightly in March
and consumer sentiment fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer prices registered their biggest increase in nearly
four years as the cost of gasoline rose. But a smaller gain in
the core U.S. Consumer Price Index, which excludes volatile food
and energy prices, left the door open for the Federal Reserve to
continue its bond-buying program, which has contributed to the
stock market's rally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - A former top JPMorgan Chase
 official blamed traders and managers who reported to her
for bets that led to $6 billion in losses for the bank, telling
lawmakers on Friday that her team changed projected losses and
hid important information from her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ina Drew, the former chief investment officer, said she does
not believe she bears personal responsibility for the disastrous
trading scheme that has been a black mark against the Wall
Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some members of the London team failed to value positions
properly and in good faith, minimized reported and projected
losses, and hid from me important information regarding the true
risks of the book," said Drew, who spoke softly but firmly about
her role in the debacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drew's comments kicked off a hearing into the losing
derivatives bets that came to be known as the "London Whale"
trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released
on Thursday a report that alleged the bank ignored risks, misled
investors, fought with regulators and tried to work around rules
as it dealt with mushrooming losses in that portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report blamed Drew and other senior managers for doing
little to rein in the risky trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her testimony, Drew defended her oversight as "reasonable
and diligent" and said she believed she didn't hold personal
responsibility for the losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly mistakes were made," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drew spent more than 30 years at the bank, and left it in
May, after the bad bets became public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank has long been seen as the safest and
best-managed in the country, but the report could taint its
reputation as well as that of its Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also gives ammunition to advocates calling for
stricter financial reforms, including to regulators crafting the
Volcker rule, which proposes to put limits on banks betting with
their own funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In opening remarks, Senator Carl Levin, the Democrat from
Michigan who heads the subcommittee, said: "If derivatives books
can be cooked as blatantly as they are in this case without
breaking the rules, then the rules need to be revamped."&lt;/p&gt;

 rose 3.1 percent to $12.49. Goldman shares
slipped 0.9 percent to $152.70. The S financial sector 
shed 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data showed consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in February,
the largest increase in nearly four years due mostly to higher
gasoline prices, though the climb wasn't enough to garner much
attention from the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, New York Federal Reserve data showed the
manufacturing sector expanded for a second straight month in
March, although the 9.24 reading was down from 10.04 in February
and expectations for a reading of 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the market's declines, the S 500 remained within
striking distance of its all-time closing high of 1,565.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving economic signs and expectations that the Federal
Reserve will continue its easy monetary policy have helped boost
the Dow by 10.5 percent and the S by more than 9 percent this
year so far, with no major pullbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we do get a little bit of a retracement it's just a dip
and all these dips are being met by investors looking to buy any
kind of reversal they can get near," said Gordon Charlop,
managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 56.98
points, or 0.39 percent, to 14,482.16. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Index lost 6.07 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,557.16. The
Nasdaq Composite Index fell 10.75 points, or 0.33

that she does not bear personal responsibility for the losses,

LONG BEACH, N.Y., March 15, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Visa recently announced the opening of the
Myanmar market to ATM and POS acceptance through their licensing agreements with Co-operative
Bank, Kanbawza Bank, and Myanmar Overseas Bank. This represents significant progress for Myanmar's
electronic payments infrastructure as it provides the country with a platform to participate in
the global financial system. By joining the Visa network, the banks agree to adopt Visa's global
security standards for electronic payment.

Bringing the Myanmar banks into the network quickly and efficiently was accomplished through each
of the Visa bank partners subscribing to a Visa managed service solution that allowed them to
quickly activate their systems to support the needs of inbound business travelers and tourists
alike.

"Visa card acceptance for ATM and point-of-sale transactions in Myanmar are operating well. As
part of our ongoing commitment and partnership with local banks, we are working together to
improve efficiency in operations and services," said Somboon Krobteeranon, Visa Country Manager,
Myanmar and Thailand.

Phillip Kumnick, Visa's Head of Global Acquirer Processing, said: "Working with each bank we were
able to deliver the processing solutions needed to operate their ATM and merchant acquiring
systems through a Visa managed service. For the core technology and operating systems we are
working with Planet Payment (USA: NASDAQ: PLPM; UK: LSE: AIM: PPT). Our service now connects the
Myanmar banks' ATMs and POS machines to Visa managed services, and manages the complexities of
cross border processing acquiring services."

Philip Beck, Chairman and CEO of Planet Payment, said: "Planet Payment's single proprietary
processing platform enables the delivery of payment solutions that can be tailored quickly to meet
the requirements of a particular market. Visa and Planet Payment share the vision that payments
have the power to improve the way business is done. We are very excited to be working together in
Myanmar and we continue to work together on opportunities to deliver innovative payment solutions
to banks, merchants and consumers in other developing economies."

"As Myanmar continues its journey toward full international reintegration, there will be more
opportunities to extend the reach and scope of electronic payments in the market. We look forward
to working with the government, central bank, financial institutions and merchant community to
grow electronic payments in the country," added Krobteeranon.

As a result of the recent success in Myanmar, Visa and Planet Payment are working on opportunities
to target the deployment of the managed service to additional developing markets in support of
traditional ATM and POS acceptance as well as developing support for mobile point of sale (mPOS).
As more and more merchants look to capitalize on the value of accepting electronic payments, Visa
stands ready to help its client banks support growing the financial network, expand on its
financial inclusion goals, and partner to develop their payments systems.

About Visa

Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial
institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and
reliable electronic payments. We operate one of the world's most advanced processing
networks-VisaNet-that is capable of handling more than 24,000 transaction messages a second, with
fraud protection for consumers and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not
issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for consumers. Visa's innovations, however,
enable its financial institution customers to offer consumers more choices: pay now with debit,
ahead of time with prepaid or later with credit products. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) ignored risks, misled investors, fought with regulators and tried to work around rules as it dealt with mushrooming losses in a derivatives portfolio, a Senate report alleged in a damning review of the largest U.S. bank's management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior managers at the bank were told for months about the bad derivatives bets that ended up costing the bank more than $6.2 billion but did little to rein them in, according to the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate report came on the same day the U.S. Federal Reserve separately asked JPMorgan to improve its capital planning process as part of an annual "stress tests" of banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barrage of bad news for JPMorgan, long seen as the safest and best-managed U.S. bank, could taint the reputation of the bank, as well as Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. Dimon has been one of the most outspoken critics of Washington's attempts to tightly regulate Wall Street after the 2007-2009 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also gives ammunition to advocates calling for stricter financial reform regulations. In particular, the 301-page Senate report will likely give new energy to regulators crafting the Volcker rule, which proposes to put limits on banks betting with their own funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman said, "While we have repeatedly acknowledged mistakes, our senior management acted in good faith and never had any intent to mislead anyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committee sources said the losses from the trades appeared to total more than $6.2 billion. But these sources said they could not determine how much because the trades originally made by the bank's Chief Investment Office were moved to other parts of the bank. They said JPMorgan declined to provide them more information about the values of the positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate subcommittee will hear directly from senior JPMorgan executives - but not from Dimon - at a hearing on Friday morning on the derivatives bets that came to be known as the "London whale" trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin, who chairs the subcommittee, said he had not yet decided whether to refer the report to criminal or civil authorities. He said the panel could hold further hearings and left the door open to calling Dimon for the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLASHES WITH REGULATORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon publicly criticized lawmakers for creating onerous new rules for banks after the crisis, but the report shows JPMorgan also frequently clashed with regulators behind the scenes as the losses mounted last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, Dimon ordered the bank to stop sending daily trading profit and loss reports to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of its main regulators, Senate investigators said. The bank feared that information from the reports was being leaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Douglas Braunstein, the bank's chief financial officer at the time, resumed sending the reports to the OCC a few days later. When Dimon found out that Braunstein had done so, at a meeting with an OCC examiner, the CEO "raised his voice in anger at" the CFO, the report said. Braunstein left his CFO spot early this year, moving to a spot as vice chairman of JPMorgan, focusing on clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another senior bank executive, Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, complained to the OCC that the agency was trying to "destroy" JPMorgan's business. In another episode, bank executives yelled at OCC examiners and called them "stupid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate report also accused the bank of changing its risk models to work around capital rules. The report includes emails from a quantitative analyst for the bank in which he explained how he could rearrange its modeling procedures to mask the ballooning risk inside the chief investment office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bank employees were also cautious when it came to leaving evidence of those efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think, the, the email that you sent out, I think there is a, just FYI, there is a bit of sensitivity around this topic," a member of the bank's central risk modeling group warned the analyst afterward in a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank "increased risk by mislabeling the synthetic credit portfolio as a risk-reducing hedge when it was really involved proprietary trading," the subcommittee's top Republican, John McCain, said in a briefing with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate investigators also faulted regulators at the OCC for missing red flags and failing to be aggressive in monitoring problems at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency was informed of JPMorgan's risk limit breaches and of changes to the model the bank was using to calculate its risk, yet raised no concerns at the time, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An OCC spokesman said the agency recognizes shortcomings in its supervision and has taken steps to improve its supervisory process. The spokesman also said the agency is continuing to investigate the matter and "will take additional action as appropriate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'LET THE BOOK SIMPLY DIE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the bank's large credit bets surprisingly paid off after American Airlines filed for bankruptcy, generating $400 million in unexpected revenue for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The employees most closely associated with the trades were among the highest paid that year. Drew made $29 million in 2010 and 2011, and Achilles Macris, who reported to her, made $32 million during the same time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in January 2012, when the strategy began producing sustained losses and traders began warning of additional losses, managers decided to stay the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trader responsible for the position, Bruno Iksil pushed for the bank to take the losses and let the existing positions expire, according to emails in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote to his boss that in his view the "only" course of action was "to stay as we are and let the book simply die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the traders continued to add to the positions, and by March supervisors were urging them to mark the values at levels that portrayed them in the most positive light, even if it meant skirting the bank's normal valuation practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know where he wants to stop, but it's getting idiotic," Iksil wrote in an instant message, referring to his supervisor who had ordered the marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 23, Iksil estimated in an email that the portfolio had lost about $600 million using midpoint prices and $300 million using the "best" prices, but it reported a daily loss of only $12 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drew ordered a halt in the derivatives trading that same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the group continued to understate the extent of losses in the position through May, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Aruna Viswanatha and Emily Flitter; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Paritosh Bansal, Andre Grenon and Ryan Woo)&lt;/p&gt;

15 March 2013 - Aker Solutions has signed a contract with ExxonMobil for the supply of subsea
umbilicals for the Erha North phase 2 development in Nigeria.

The Erha North Phase 2 development is an extension of the existing Erha subsea system and
infrastructure located approximately 97 kilometres offshore Nigeria in water depths between 1 000
and 1 200 metres. 

Aker Solutions' scope of work includes the delivery of 2 dynamic and 2 static steel tube
umbilicals, at a total length of 16.5 kilometres. The umbilicals will be delivered in 2014.  

"We are pleased to extend our global footprint and support ExxonMobil in Nigeria. Aker Solutions
provides cost effective and technically advanced subsea umbilicals worldwide and we look forward
to execute another deepwater project", says Tove Roskaft, head of Aker Solutions' umbilicals
business area. 

She adds: "Aker Solutions is committed to developing the Nigerian oil and gas industry through
technology transfer and training of Nigerian nationals."

The umbilicals will be designed, engineered and manufactured at Aker Solutions' facility in
Mobile, Alabama, in the US, supported by project management and engineering by a local team in
Lagos, Nigeria. 

The Mobile facility provides reliable horizontal bundling and extrusion machines, deepwater access
to installation vessels, high capacity processing and storage carousels and on-site welding and
test facilities.

Subsea umbilicals are deployed on the seabed to supply necessary controls and chemicals to subsea
oil and gas wells, subsea manifolds and any subsea systems requiring remote control.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's stock buyback plan that was conditionally approved by the Federal Reserve on Thursday calls for spending half as much as was allowed before the bank lost $6.2 billion in the "London Whale" derivatives trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said in a statement that the Fed had approved its plan to buy back $6 billion of stock over the next 12 months, subject to addressing weaknesses the Fed found in the firm's capital planning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan Chase is fully committed to meeting all of the Fed's requirements," CEO Jamie Dimon said in an announcement from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also said it intends to raise its quarterly dividend in the second quarter to 38 cents a share from 30 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approved rate of stock purchases of $1.5 billion per quarter is half that approved last year before the loss on derivatives contracts made by trader Bruno Iksil, who became known in the markets as the "London Whale" for the size of positions he took while working in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday bank executives were strongly criticized over the "London Whale" loss in a report by the U.S. Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon had said earlier this year that the bank had proposed to regulators spending less on buybacks in order to build up capital to meet pending new requirements from regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's "Oz the Great and Powerful" worked more box office magic in its second weekend, following up its strong debut a week earlier with $42.2 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Wizard of Oz" prequel starring James Franco topped a stronger-than-expected performance from "The Call," a new thriller about a 911 operator played by Halle Berry who tries to save a kidnapped teenager. "The Call" earned $17.1 million from Friday through Sunday, according to studio estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Incredible Burt Wonderstone," a new comedy featuring Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey as dueling Las Vegas magicians, finished the weekend in third place. It conjured up $10.3 million at North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters - several million less than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic ticket sales for the big-budget, effects-filled "Oz" dropped 47 percent from its opening weekend, according to the box office division of Hollywood.com. Movies typically see a 40 percent to 60 percent decline in their second weekend of release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oz" added $46.6 million over the weekend from international markets. Its global total after 10 days reached $282 million, a strong start for a movie that cost $200 million to make plus up to $100 million more to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Call" handily beat pre-weekend forecasts of a debut of around $10 million. The $15 million production overperformed on strong word-of-mouth, showing itself to be "a real crowd-pleaser," said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Sony Corp's Sony Pictures studio, which acquired the film from Troika Pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People like this film a lot, and it's going to be a big success for us," Bruer said, adding that "the film could end up doing anywhere from $40 million to $50 million, which would be huge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Burt Wonderstone," meanwhile, fell short of some pre-weekend forecasts, which had pegged the debut at $12 million to $15 million. The film had a modest budget of about $30 million, according to Warner Bros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously we didn't want to come in number-three this weekend, but it's not for lack of trying," said Dan Fellman, Warner Bros. president of theatrical distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive said the studio harbored hopes that upcoming school spring breaks would stoke the film's box office, adding that "with the budget being as reasonable as it was, I'm sure at the end of the day that we'll be okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the top of the charts, the big-budget film "Jack the Giant Slayer" took fourth place with $6.2 million domestically. The global total for the March 1 release, which is trying to make back a $189 million production cost, reached nearly $90 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fifth place, Melissa McCarthy comedy "Identity Thief" added $4.5 million to its impressive $123.7 million total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jack the Giant Slayer" was released by Warner Bros.

Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey as dueling Las Vegas magicians,
finished the weekend in third place. It conjured up $10.3
million at North American (U.S. and Canadian) theaters - several
million less than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic ticket sales for the big-budget, effects-filled
"Oz" dropped 47 percent from its opening weekend, according to
the box office division of Hollywood.com. Movies typically see a
40 percent to 60 percent decline in their second weekend of
release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oz" added $46.6 million over the weekend from international
markets. Its global total after 10 days reached $282 million, a
strong start for a movie that cost $200 million to make plus up
to $100 million more to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Call" handily beat pre-weekend forecasts of a debut of
around $10 million. The $15 million production overperformed on
strong word-of-mouth, showing itself to be "a real
crowd-pleaser," said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide
distribution for Sony Corp's  Sony Pictures
studio, which acquired the film from Troika Pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People like this film a lot, and it's going to be a big
success for us," Bruer said, adding that "the film could end up
doing anywhere from $40 million to $50 million, which would be
huge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Burt Wonderstone," meanwhile, fell short of some
pre-weekend forecasts, which had pegged the debut at $12 million
to $15 million. The film had a modest budget of about $30
million, according to Warner Bros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously we didn't want to come in number-three this
weekend, but it's not for lack of trying," said Dan Fellman,
Warner Bros. president of theatrical distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive said the studio harbored hopes that upcoming
school spring breaks would stoke the film's box office, adding 
that "with the budget being as reasonable as it was, I'm sure at
the end of the day that we'll be okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the top of the charts, the big-budget film
"Jack the Giant Slayer" took fourth place with $6.2 million
domestically. The global total for the March 1 release, which is
trying to make back a $189 million production cost, reached
nearly $90 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fifth place, Melissa McCarthy comedy "Identity Thief"
added $4.5 million to its impressive $123.7 million total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jack the Giant Slayer" was released by Warner Bros.
"Identity Thief" was distributed by  Universal Pictures, a unit
of Comcast Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Polycom also achieves Microsoft Lync 2013 qualification for Polycom VVX Business
Media Phones

Polycom HDX Series, Polycom RealPresence Group Series and Polycom RealPresence
Platform to be compatible with Lync 2013 in June


ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Polycom, Inc. (Nasdaq: PLCM), the global leader in open, standards-based unified
communications and collaboration (UC), today announced broad interoperability
for Microsoft Lync 2013 that includes new qualified Polycom voice solutions and
a new software extension to the Polycom RealPresence Platform that will deliver
interoperability between Lync 2013 and the full portfolio of Polycom
standards-based video collaboration and content sharing solutions. These
announcements further the extensive partnership between the two companies,
building on Polycom`s portfolio of 40 video, voice and content sharing solutions
that are interoperable or optimized to work with Lync 2010 today. Together,
Microsoft and Polycom offer the most complete UC portfolio at the lowest total
cost of ownership. 

"With today`s announcement, Polycom will deliver the broadest interoperability
for Lync 2013 in our industry," said Andy Miller, President and CEO, Polycom.
"The majority of companies choose Polycom and Microsoft over other vendors for a
complete UC solution today, and we will continue to ensure that our joint
customers have a superior collaboration experience, unmatched interoperability
and investment protection. The combination of Polycom and Microsoft software
provides a seamless UC solution for video, voice, conferencing and
collaboration, from anywhere, anytime, and drives increased productivity across
organizations." 

Microsoft Lync Server 2013 Qualification for Polycom VVX Business Media Phones
and Compatibility of Polycom Video Room Systems and Polycom RealPresence
Platform with Lync 2013

As part of today`s news, Polycom announced native integration and Lync Server
2013 qualification for Polycom VVX Business Media Phones (Polycom VVX 500 and
Polycom VVX 600 models), with the Polycom VVX 300 and Polycom VVX 400 models
expected to achieve qualification in Q2 2013. In addition, the Polycom
RealPresence Platform and the Polycom HDX Series and Polycom RealPresence Group
Series of video collaboration endpoints are expected to be compatible with Lync
Server 2013 in June. 

Software Extensions to RealPresence Platform Delivers Lync 2013 Interoperability
with Polycom Video Solutions and AVC/SVC Industry Standard Endpoints

New software extensions to the Polycom RealPresence Platform will include
software updates to the Polycom RealPresence Collaboration Servers (RMX Series
and Collaboration Server 800s) and Polycom RealPresence Virtualization Manager
(Polycom DMA), which will deliver Lync 2013 interoperability across Polycom`s
full portfolio of video solutions, including the new Polycom RealPresence Group
Series, executive desktop video systems, mobile video apps and other endpoints. 

With these new software updates, Polycom and Microsoft customers will be able to
use endpoints and infrastructure supporting open-standards based H.264 AVC or
SVC (Scalable Video Coding) with Lync 2013. Last year, Polycom licensed the
first open standards-based SVC implementation royalty free to the industry,
including the Unified Communications Interoperability Forum (UCI Forum), to
ensure adoption and industry-wide interoperability (see press release).
Microsoft implemented open standards-based SVC into Lync 2013. Last fall,
Polycom added its open standards-based SVC to the RealPresence Platform, which
provides customers with 3X HD multipoint video capacity for greater scalability
and dramatically lower TCO, superior performance, and backwards- and
forwards-compatibility for investment protection. 

The software extensions announced today will also include Lync 2013
interoperability for the recently launched Polycom RealPresence Content Sharing
Suite, a software application that allows Lync users to share content back and
forth with standards-based video collaboration devices such as room-based video
solutions (e.g., Polycom HDX systems) or mobile apps (e.g., Polycom RealPresence
Mobile 2.2 app). Additionally, the software extensions will include a new
cross-platform scheduling application that integrates with Lync 2013, Exchange
and Polycom RealPresence solutions to allow combined Lync 2013 and traditional
video endpoint meetings using existing Microsoft Outlook scheduling
capabilities. This capability will enable customers to easily schedule video
meetings with both participants and video endpoints, which makes setting up and
managing video calls easier for end users while freeing up IT support resources.


Delivering a Unifying Communications and Collaboration Experience

Together, Polycom RealPresence video and voice solutions and Microsoft Lync
unify communications across work environments - on the go, home and work
offices, conference rooms and immersive theaters. With the combination of Lync
and Polycom RealPresence solutions, employees can launch video collaboration
sessions easily and intuitively from within familiar interfaces and normal
workflows, from any work environment on- or off-premises. They simply click a
name in their Lync contact list to securely collaborate face-to-face via Polycom
video in a conference room or on a mobile device. 

Advanced Services Help Customers with Implementation

On March 1, Polycom finalized the acquisition of Sentri, Inc., a leading
provider of advanced services with expertise in Microsoft technologies
(including Lync), UC, video collaboration, cloud services and networking. As a
Premier Support for Lync Partners (PSLP) certified company, Sentri brings
significant expertise integrating Microsoft Lync with Polycom solutions that
will benefit customers. 

Availability

Polycom VVX 500 and Polycom VVX 600 Business Media Phones natively integrate and
are qualified for Lync Server 2013 today, and the Polycom VVX 300 and Polycom
VVX 400 models are expected to pass qualification in Q2 2013. The Polycom HDX
Series and Polycom RealPresence Group Series of video collaboration endpoints,
and Polycom RealPresence Platform, are expected to be compatible with Lync 2013
in June 2013. The new software extensions to Polycom RealPresence Platform that
will deliver broad interoperability between Lync 2013 and Polycom`s full
portfolio of video solutions with support for Lync 2013 features are currently
planned to be available in the second half of 2013. Polycom RealPresence Content
Sharing Suite is available today. For more information about today`s news and

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) has won the dismissal of a nationwide investors' lawsuit accusing the largest U.S. bank of conspiring to drive down silver prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson in Manhattan said the investors, who bought and sold COMEX silver futures and options contracts, failed to show that JPMorgan manipulated prices at their expense, including by amassing huge short positions that were not justified by market events at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a decision made public on Monday, Patterson said that while the investors showed that JPMorgan had the ability to influence prices, a fact the bank did not dispute, they failed to show that the bank "intended to cause artificial prices to exist" and acted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for the investors did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a similar request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors had, in at least 43 complaints filed in 2010 and 2011, accused banks of amassing hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal profit by manipulating silver prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the lawsuits were consolidated, HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) was dropped in September 2011 as a defendant, leaving JPMorgan and 20 unnamed individuals as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterson had rejected the investors' claims in December, but gave them one last chance to bolster their case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint had sought triple damages for what it called JPMorgan's antitrust violations in distorting silver prices between 2007 and 2010, including through alleged "fake" trades late in the day when market volume was thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission began probing allegations of silver price manipulation in 2008, and two years later proposed regulations to give it greater power to thwart traders who try to manipulate prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re: Commodity Exchange Inc Silver Futures and Options Trading Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-md-02213.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a similar request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors had, in at least 43 complaints filed in 2010 and
2011, accused banks of amassing hundreds of millions of dollars
in illegal profit by manipulating silver prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the lawsuits were consolidated, HSBC Holdings Plc
 was dropped in September 2011 as a defendant, leaving
JPMorgan and 20 unnamed individuals as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterson had rejected the investors' claims in December,
but gave them one last chance to bolster their case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint had sought triple damages for what it called
JPMorgan's antitrust violations in distorting silver prices
between 2007 and 2010, including through alleged "fake" trades
late in the day when market volume was thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission began probing
allegations of silver price manipulation in 2008, and two years
later proposed regulations to give it greater power to thwart
traders who try to manipulate prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re: Commodity Exchange Inc Silver Futures and
Options Trading Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York, No. 11-md-02213.&lt;/p&gt;

FREMONT, Calif., March 18, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ArmaninoLLP (www.amllp.com/microsoft-dynamics
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10025590=1=www.amllp.com%2Fmicrosoft-dynamics=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amllp.com%2Fmicrosoft-dynamics
), the 8th largest Microsoft Dynamics Partner in the US and a provider of integrated audit, tax,
consulting services and technology solutions, proudly announces that its client, Ikanos
Communications, is a finalist in the manufacturing category of Microsoft Dynamics' Customer
Excellence Awards program for 2013.

Ikanos, a developer of high-performance semiconductor and software products, received this honor
for the exceptional success it enjoyed in rapidly replacing its legacy ERP and CRM applications
with a complete Microsoft Dynamics solution. Partnering with Armanino, Ikanos achieved a rapid
deployment of a world class, integrated front and back office solution composed of Microsoft
Dynamics CRM 2011 powered by Axonom and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 for High Tech Industries, in
approximately 4.5 months. In doing so, it solved a number of complex problems. Specifically,
Ikanos:

* Reduced costs and increased flexibility over previous ERP solution
* Infused greater order into complex supply chain management and production planning
* Created more internal visibility and rigor in the sales process
* Solved service challenges around warranty management
* Introduced a uniform process with accountability that drives sales behavior
* Created more efficient internal communications

Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 for High Tech Industries is a Certified for Microsoft Dynamics AX
(CfMD) ISV solution designed by Armanino to accelerate implementations through comprehensive,
industry specific ERP functionality for high tech manufacturers. Dynamics CRM powered by Axonom
extends the already robust Microsoft CRM platform to help high tech manufacturers and distributors
streamline their sales processes including Design Win, Forecasting and Channel Management.

The 2013 Customer Excellence Awards, which are presented in 16 categories, recognize and celebrate
Microsoft Dynamics customers that have achieved notable accomplishments using Microsoft Dynamics
solutions. To be considered as a finalist for this prestigious award, Ikanos demonstrated how it
used Microsoft products to solve a series of challenging business and service problems.

Ikanos was able to achieve an immediate, measurable savings after Microsoft Dynamics AX and CRM
were deployed. This quick tactical win for the semiconductor manufacturer was followed by full
integration of Dynamics AX, which resulted in even more significant benefits including improved
process automation and reporting capability around "chipset" metrics which are among Ikanos' core
key performance indicators.

"We are growing very fast and we needed business process solutions that would enable us to
continue that growth and increase our competitiveness," says Ed Abate, Sales Operations Senior
Director at Ikanos. "Microsoft Dynamics AX and CRM solved many of our biggest challenges and with
the advice and support of Armanino, we were able to deploy and realize significant productivity
gains very quickly."

Established in 1997, the Customer Excellence Awards are awarded each year at the Microsoft
Convergence User Conference in the United States. Microsoft Dynamics is a line of financial,
customer relationship and supply chain management solutions that help businesses work more
effectively.

NEW YORK and CARMIEL, Israel, March 18, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and
Protalix BioTherapeutics, Inc. (NYSE MKT:PLX) (TASE:PLX) announced today that the Brazilian
National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA, Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria) has granted
regulatory approval to UPLYSO (alfataliglicerase) for the long-term enzyme replacement therapy for
adults with a confirmed diagnosis of Type I Gaucher disease. Gaucher disease is a rare lysosomal
storage disorder that affects approximately 10,000 people worldwide.

UPLYSO is known as ELELYSO (taliglucerase alfa) outside of Latin America. ELELYSO was approved by
the United States Food and Drug Administration in May 2012 and by Israel's Ministry of Health in
September 2012 for the long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for adults with a confirmed
diagnosis of Type I Gaucher disease. The ANVISA approval comes after the approval of UPLYSO by the
Ministry of Public Health in Uruguay in November 2012.

"ANVISA's approval of UPLYSO demonstrates Pfizer's ability to successfully bring therapies for
rare diseases to the marketplace," said Diem Nguyen, Ph.D., MBA, general manager, Pfizer
Biosimilars. "We are committed to the Gaucher community and look forward to continuing to work
closely with our partner Protalix toward our goal of bringing UPLYSO to those living with Gaucher
throughout Latin America."

UPLYSO is the first plant cell-based ERT for the treatment of Gaucher disease. It is also the
first approved plant cell-expressed drug that is derived from ProCellEx&#174;, Protalix's proprietary
plant cell-based protein manufacturing system, using genetically engineered carrot cells. UPLYSO
is a form of the human lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase, used to treat Gaucher disease.

"The approval of UPLYSO provides an important treatment option for those in Brazil using enzyme
replacement therapy to manage their Gaucher disease and demonstrates the potential of our plant
cell manufacturing technology," said David Aviezer, Ph.D., MBA, president and chief executive
officer of Protalix BioTherapeutics.

On November 30, 2009, Protalix entered into an agreement with Pfizer to develop and commercialize
taliglucerase alfa/alfataliglicerase. Under the terms of the agreement, Protalix retained the
exclusive commercialization rights in Israel, while Pfizer received exclusive licensing rights for
commercialization in all other markets.

Indication for UPLYSO in Brazil

UPLYSO (alfataliglicerase) is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for adults with a
confirmed diagnosis of Type I Gaucher disease. The manifestations of Gaucher disease may include
one or more of the following: splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone disease.

Important Safety Information for UPLYSO in Brazil

As with any intravenous protein medicine, like enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), UPLYSO may cause
infusion-related reactions (i.e., occurring during or shortly after infusion) and hypersensitivity
reactions. If a severe allergic reaction occurs, immediate discontinuation of the
alfataliglicerase infusion is recommended. Patients who experience reactions of hypersensitivity
or related to the infusion, can however be managed successfully. The therapy can be continued by
slowing the infusion rate, treating with medicinal products such as antihistamines, antipyretics
and/or corticosteroids, and/or stopping and resuming treatment with decreased infusion rate.
Pre-treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent reactions.

The most commonly observed infusion reactions were headache, hypersensitivity (allergic reaction),
dizziness, flushing (redness), throat irritation, nausea (qualm), pruritus (itch), erythema
(redness), rash, bone pain, back pain, arthralgia (joint pain), among others.

Also, there is a possibility of developing antibodies to UPLYSO. However, it is currently unclear
whether this has an impact on the clinical response or adverse reactions. Patients with an immune
response to other ERTs who are switching to UPLYSO should continue to be monitored for antibodies.
Patients who have developed infusion or immune reactions with UPLYSO or with another ERT should be
monitored for antidrug antibodies when being treated with UPLYSO.

If you are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about potential
benefits and risks.

Indication for ELELYSO in the U.S.

ELELYSO (taliglucerase alfa) for injection is a hydrolytic lysosomal glucocerebroside-specific
enzyme indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for adults with a confirmed
diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease.

Important Safety Information for ELELYSO in the U.S.

As with any intravenous protein medicine, like enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), severe allergic
reactions (including anaphylaxis) have been observed in patients treated with ELELYSO. If this
occurs, ELELYSO should be immediately discontinued, and appropriate medical treatment should be
initiated. Patients who have experienced anaphylaxis to ELELYSO or another ERT should proceed with
caution upon retreatment.

In addition, infusion reactions (including allergic reactions)-defined as a reaction occurring
within 24 hours of the infusion-were the most commonly observed reactions to ELELYSO. The most
commonly observed infusion reactions were headache, chest pain or discomfort, weakness, fatigue,
hives, abnormal redness of the skin, increased blood pressure, back or joint pain, and flushing.
Other infusion or allergic reactions included swelling of the face, mouth, and/or throat;
wheezing; shortness of breath; skin color turning blue; coughing; and low blood pressure. Most of
these reactions were mild and did not require treatment.

Management of infusion reactions is based on the type and severity of the reaction. Your doctor
may manage infusion reactions by temporarily stopping the infusion, slowing the infusion rate, or
treating with medications such as an antihistamine and/or a fever reducer. Treatment with
antihistamines and/or corticosteroids prior to infusion with ELELYSO may prevent these reactions.

Other common adverse reactions observed were upper respiratory tract infections, throat infection,
flu, urinary tract infection, and pain in extremities.

As with all therapeutic proteins, including ERTs, there is a possibility of developing antibodies
to ELELYSO. However, it is currently unclear whether this has an impact on the clinical response
or adverse reactions. Patients with an immune response to other ERTs who are switching to ELELYSO
should continue to be monitored for antibodies. Comparison of the frequency of antibodies across
ERTs may be misleading. Patients who have developed infusion or immune reactions with ELELYSO or
with another ERT should be monitored for antidrug antibodies when being treated with ELELYSO.

If you are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about potential
benefits and risks.

About Gaucher Disease 

Gaucher disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder in humans that affects an estimated
10,000 people worldwide and can cause severe and debilitating symptoms, including: enlargement of
the liver and spleen, various forms of bone disease, easy bruising and anemia (a low number of red
blood cells). Gaucher disease consists of varying degrees of severity; it has been sub-divided
into three subtypes-Types 1, 2 and 3-according to the presence or absence of neurological
involvement. Type 1, the most common, is found at a higher frequency among individuals who are of
Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc suffered a defeat on Monday as the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a decision forcing it to defend against claims it misled investors about mortgage securities that lost value during the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without comment, the court refused to consider Goldman's appeal of a September 2012 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That court's action lets the NECA-IBEW Health &amp; Welfare Fund, which owned some mortgage-backed certificates underwritten by Goldman, sue on behalf of investors in certificates it did not own, but that were backed by mortgages from the same lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trading, Goldman shares were down $2.47, or 1.6 percent, at $152.37 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other bank stocks also fell, amid concern about an escalation of the euro zone crisis, with the S financial sector index down 0.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and other banks have faced thousands of lawsuits by investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has said that letting the 2nd Circuit decision stand could cost Wall Street tens of billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darren Robbins, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd representing the plaintiffs, said about 10 cases within the 2nd Circuit are affected by Monday's order, including one against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co that his firm is handling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the Goldman case will now proceed toward a possible trial. The NECA-IBEW fund is based in Decatur, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These mortgage-backed securities are ground zero for the mortgage meltdown," Robbins said in a phone interview. "Our clients are certainly very pleased with the outcome. It reiterates the common sense test endorsed by the 2nd Circuit. It's a good day for pension funds and investors, for sure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred Isquith, a class action and securities litigation specialist who is not involved in the Goldman case, said Monday's order is important given other pending mortgage securities cases but that the fallout may be contained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you expand the number of securities, you expand the amount of potential damages," said Isquith, a partner at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &amp; Herz. "How much more? I'm willing to bet dollars to donuts that when it comes down to dealing with actual damages, it will be less than they argued."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'VEXATIOUS' LITIGATION FEARED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Goldman case, the issue was whether the NECA-IBEW fund, an electrical workers' union pension plan that bought certificates from two of 17 trusts under a 2007 registration statement, could sue on behalf of investors in all 17 offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd Circuit let the fund sue over seven of the offerings: the two it invested in, plus five others that also contained loans from GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, later part of Capital One Financial Corp, and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. It said the other 10 offerings were too different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theodore Olson, a partner at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher representing Goldman, warned in court papers that letting the 2nd Circuit decision stand "will effectively increase by tens of billions of dollars the potential liability that financial institutions face in this and similar class actions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said the case also merited review because it conflicted with a decision by the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals involving Japan's Nomura Holdings Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supported Goldman, saying they feared "vexatious, abusive litigation and coercive multimillion or billion dollar settlements to the detriment of the nation's economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the JPMorgan case, the largest U.S. bank faces a lawsuit led by the Laborers Pension Trust Fund for Northern California and Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California encompassing 10 mortgage offerings that they did not purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman case is Goldman Sachs &amp; Co et al v.

enHanced Mobile enables Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 users to conduct real-time,
supply chain transactions with mobile devices
NEW ORLEANS--(Business Wire)--
enVista unveiled its enHanced Mobile solution for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012
users today at the Microsoft Dynamics Convergence conference in New Orleans, La.
enHanced Mobile enables organizations running Microsoft Dynamics AX ERP to
access their global business solution on any mobile device and manage their
inventory with greater accuracy and efficiency, from any remote location. 

enVista President and CEO Jim Barnes said, "enVista brings extensive Microsoft
Dynamics AX implementation and upgrade experience. We are intimately familiar
with the technology stack and how to seamlessly integrate it into complex
environments. Our enHanced Mobile for AX solution is another way we provide
value to Microsoft Dynamics AX users and extend the value of their ERP
investment." 

Mobile transaction reporting offers several strategic advantages. enHanced
Mobile provides real-time transaction visibility and reporting. The
browser-based application is simple to implement and upgrade and only takes
minutes to install. The solution`s web interface enables users to leverage any
device, form factor or manufacturer. enHanced Mobile can also be accessed
globally and is significantly less expensive than fixed workstations and
traditional radio frequency data collection devices. 

enVista`s enHanced Mobile features integrated barcode scanning that records each
transaction, such as shipping and receiving, picking, and cycle counting, as
soon as physical inventory is picked and scanned. These real-time updates ensure
companies have the very latest inventory management snapshot readily available.
The embedded barcoding validation process reduces risks associated with
paper-based systems, such as data entry errors and information loss. Optimizing
transaction record and reporting processes improves internal efficiencies by
eliminating unnecessary data tracking and sharing activity. 

Barnes said, "enVista enHanced Mobile users benefit from partnering with a
single services provider to manage and optimize supply chain technology and
processes from source to consumption. enVista not only provides an experienced
Microsoft Dynamics AX ERP practice, we also offer exceptionally deep supply
chain consulting experience across Retail, Supply Chain, Transportation and IT.
We look forward to meeting with Microsoft Dynamics AX users at Convergence Booth
#2155."

manufacturing, distribution, consumer goods, food and beverage and third party
logistics.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on
Monday declined to consider a dispute over a class action

misleading investors about the risks associated with mortgage
securities offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was revived in September 2012 when the New

investors in other certificates backed by mortgages from the

Cutwater AIM (Advanced Inventory Management) gives wholesale distributors a way
to manage inventory with little installation effort and minimal training
NEW ORLEANS--(Business Wire)--
Cutwater Solutions, the developer and seller of Cutwater AIM, is introducing the
Microsoft Dynamics versions of its inventory management software at Convergence
in New Orleans this week. The inventory management software provides an easy to
us use and install tool for helping wholesale distributors stay competitive
while maintaining customer satisfaction. 

The first version of Cutwater AIM (Advanced Inventory Management) software was
designed to help wholesale distributors who were using Epicor`s Prophet 21 as
their ERP system. 

"Bringing Cutwater AIM into play is how you can turn inventory into a value
added asset," said Sujit Singh, managing director of Cutwater. "AIM now provides
a preconfigured and affordable way for wholesale distributors who are using
Microsoft Dynamics (GP, NAV, AX &amp; SL) to more profitably manage inventory. We
have already signed up the first few customers who use Microsoft Dynamics GP.
AIM can also continue to be implemented by users of Epicor`s Prophet 21." 

As a special introduction to the Microsoft Dynamics users, Cutwater will install
and provide initial user orientation at no cost, and there is no commitment to
license until the product has been used for one month. This gives customers a
risk free way to try the product before they make an investment. 

Cutwater AIM Standard Report Categories for Microsoft Dynamics allows users to
quickly gain insight into the cost and efficiency of current stocks. Reports
highlight inventory items - in units and dollars - which are moving slowly or
have not been moving at all. Filter report results on significant items separate
the "vital few" from the "trivial many." Reports also highlight items where
there is too little inventory to avoid disruption to the business. 

"Cutwater is also looking to meet and identify potential Microsoft Dynamics
VAR`s who would be interesting in marketing the Cutwater AIM product," said
Singh. "We would invite all interested parties to visit us at booth 657." 

Cutwater Announces AIM Pilots for Microsoft Dynamics GP

One of Cutwater`s pilots is with Regal Lager, Inc. a major distributor of infant
care items such as car seats, strollers, safety gates, cloth diapers, and
training pottys. Headquartered outside of Atlanta, Ga., the company distributes
its products throughout the United States and Canada. 

"Cutwater AIM provides us with a scalable solution that allows us to use current
and historical inventory data to make better business decisions," said Bill
Jarvela, IT Manager at Regal Lager. "AIM gives our employees an easy way to
quickly analyze inventory levels and take action in ways that manage capital,
while maintaining a high level of customer service." 

Headquartered in Charlotte, NC, C Boiler Sales &amp; Service, Inc. is a full
service company geared to meet all of a customer`s boiler room needs. C is one
of the largest and most established boiler room equipment sales, service and
rental companies in the Carolinas. The company provides a wide range of boilers
for a variety of industrial uses. 

"In a sales and services environment time is money," said Tony Larson,
Controller at C Boiler Sales and Service. "We were very pleased to see how
quickly Cutwater AIM could be up and running and making a contribution to our
business. The time to learn the software was amazingly fast."

&lt;p&gt;* Seeking proceeds of at least 1.5 bln euros&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Unit valued at 14-15 times EBITDA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Private equity investors among potential buyers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Axel Springer and Bertelsmann seen as interested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, March 18 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom 
is close to appointing Goldman Sachs to manage the sale
of its online classified advertising unit Scout24, two sources
close to the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe's third-largest telecoms group behind Vodafone
 and Telefonica said late last year that it
would evaluate the options for Scout24 to free funds for more
investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bonn-based group hopes to fetch at least 1.5 billion
euros ($1.96 billion) for Scout24, another source familiar with
the sale said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scout24, a bundle of internet portals including European car
trading site AutoScout24, could become one of only a few
financially successful investments for Deutsche Telekom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group does not have a strong track record with
acquisitions. Over the past decade it was forced to write off
almost two thirds of the value of VoiceStream, which it bought
for $51 billion in 2000. It now operates under the name T-Mobile
USA and is in the process of being merged with MetroPCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Telekom's T-online unit bought the Scout group for
180 million euros in 2004 from Swiss private equity firm
Beisheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Axel Springer, owner of Germany's
top-selling daily newspaper Bild, has said in the past that it
will look at Scout24. Sources familiar with the company have
said that Springer tried to buy the portal in 2004 but was
outbid by Deutsche Telekom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media conglomerate Bertelsmann is also set to
throw its hat into the ring, as is private equity investor Apax
, which owns the UK's Auto Trader portal, the sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further potential bidders include private equity firms
Warburg Pincus, Providence, Charterhouse, BC
Partners, KKR, Hellman &amp; Friedman and EQT,
sources familiar with the investors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providence and Hellman &amp; Friedman were not immediately
available for comment, while Deutsche Telekom, Goldman Sachs and
the other prospective buyers declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 1.5 billion euro price tag would valuate Scout24 at 14 to
15 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA), a source familiar with the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is slightly below a ratio of almost 18 for peer
Rightmove, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Telekom is also looking at options for its British
mobile telephony operator EE, a joint venture with France
Telecom. Both partners have said that an initial public
offering of part of the shares by the end of this year was the
preferred option.&lt;/p&gt;

NEW ORLEANS, March 18, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Convergence 2013 -- Edgewater Fullscope, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Edgewater Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:EDGW) (http://www.edgewater.com
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10025451=1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edgewater.com ), today
announced Fullscope EDGE Solutions for Microsoft Dynamics Customer Relationship Management (CRM),
on-premise or cloud-based software designed to help manufacturing companies with complex sales
cycles improve communication gaps between sales, services and engineering; gain better visibility
to data and performance levels; and improve the overall customer experience.

Fullscope EDGE Solutions for CRM features four solutions that can be deployed as a stand-alone
solution for Microsoft Dynamics CRM, or as part of an integrated solution with Dynamics CRM and
Microsoft Dynamics AX enterprise resource planning (ERP). The solutions leverage Microsoft
SharePoint and Business Intelligence to provide easy-to-use dashboards and real-time access to
information including key performance indicators.

* EDGE Partner Relationship Management (PRM), helps improve communications between direct and
indirect sales channels, distributors, resellers and dealers. It offers real-time visibility to
management of all sales activities including lead registration, opportunity management, quoting,
order tracking and status reporting. EDGE PRM provides clarity of the entire sales process,
enabling manufacturers to have the information needed to make better business decisions, including
more accurate and timely input for production planning.
 
* EDGE Sales Force Automation (SFA), makes it easy to realign sales territories in response to
changing markets, new products, competitive forces or new hires, and provides a method for
effective project collaboration between sales, service, engineering and training departments. EDGE
SFA helps the appropriate sales team, either internal or external, respond to sales opportunities
faster and have visibility into the entire sales process.
 
* EDGE Customer Service Assistance (CSA), enables manufacturers to provide better service to
existing customers and capture additional revenue opportunities by overseeing service and software
contracts, managing end-of-life products and offering new products. Dashboards present critical,
consolidated data from existing business systems and offer a simple, fast way to track information
without having to log into multiple systems. EDGE CSA also helps manage return merchandise
authorizations (RMAs), credits, product giveaways and discounts.
 
* EDGE Trade Promotion Management (TPM), designed for consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies,
helps plan, budget, execute, monitor and analyze sales programs with retailers. EDGE TPM is a
flexible and agile option to manage the constant pressure and complexity of today's trade
programs. It provides the integrated tools to manage promotions, and synchronize discounts and
pricing strategies to help improve margins and revenue.

"EDGE Solutions allow manufacturers to extend their existing investment in Microsoft Dynamics CRM
to address business issues that can result in increased customer service levels and new

ANAHEIM, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Menara Networks, a vertically integrated company developing optical IP/Ethernet
transport solutions that simplify optical networking, announces today general
availability of a new full C-band tunable XFP with integrated G.709 OTN framing,
enhanced forward error correction, and Ethernet Monitoring capabilities. 

The 100% MSA compliant second generation OTN XFP module provides enhanced
capabilities and lower power consumption. The new "System-in-a-Module," in
addition to G.709 OTU2 framing, Forward Error Correction (FEC), tunability over
102 channels on the ITU-T 50 GHz C-band grid and advanced optical features such
as automatic receiver threshold adjustment and SBS suppression, also offers
Enhanced FEC at higher coding gain, ODU2 client access, Ethernet payload
monitoring, and OTU General Communication Channel (GCC) access via the 30-pin
MSA connector. Each Telcordia qualified Menara OTN XFP transceiver provides a
host of system and line loopback options as well as built-in 231 PRBS
generator/checker for rapid, automated in-field testing, troubleshooting and
simpler provisioning and turn-up. At under 3.5 Watts, Menara`s patented OTN XFP
offers the industry`s highest OSNR and receiver sensitivity performance at 15 dB
and -29 dBm respectively and is a true replacement for DWDM transponders
offering error-free transmission over distances exceeding 2,000 km. 

"Our new 65 nm CMOS based OTN processor allows us to add key features that our
customers have requested such as enhanced FEC and SONET/Ethernet monitoring. It
also allows us to reduce the overall OTN XFP power consumption to meet the 3.5W
maximum," comments Salam ElAhmadi, Ph.D. Menara CTO and Co-Founder. "We look
forward to continue supporting both our carrier and system vendor customers in
their quest to significantly reducing the cost, space and power foot-print of
their optical networks." 

The company will be conducting live demonstrations of this and other products at
its booth # 1421 on the exhibit floor of this year`s OFC/NFOEC conference taking
place in Anaheim, CA, between March 19 and March 21. For more information and/or
order placement, please contact menarainfo@menaranet.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - In 2011, senior executives at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co told one of the bank's trading and hedging groups to scale back its riskier positions as new regulations would make these bets much more expensive to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, called the Chief Investment Office (CIO), was asked to cut risk-weighted assets, a key measurement that regulators use when assessing a bank's stability and how much capital it needs to hold, according to a U.S. Senate subcommittee report on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2011, the CIO came up with a plan to change its risk models. It estimated that by calculating risk differently, the bank could reduce its risk-weighted assets by $7 billion - more than half the targeted amount - without having to actually sell the securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CIO famously went on to lose more than $6 billion last year from bad credit derivatives bets that came to be known as the "London whale" trades. One of the main reasons the losses grew so large, according to Senate investigators, were the changes that JPMorgan made to its risk models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment. The largest U.S. bank has acknowledged mistakes but said senior management acted in good faith and never had any intent to mislead anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors say they fear that JPMorgan is not alone in tinkering with risk models to meet tougher capital requirements laid out in new regulations known as Basel III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global banks are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to install elaborate computer models to measure risk and make sure they are adequately capitalized. Under Basel III, banks can shrink their risk-weighted assets - and boost profits - if they can build a model to prove the bond or loan is not so risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While banks can use these models legitimately, they can also be tweaked to try to game the system, said Adam Compton, a portfolio manager at Atlanta-based hedge fund GMT Capital Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're naive if you don't think it ever happens," said Compton, who scrutinizes financial statements for banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital is a key source of safety for the global banking system, and bad models could lead to undercapitalized banks. Many big banks were not holding enough capital when the financial crisis erupted in 2008, forcing some to fail or take government bailouts as they were unable to absorb losses. But keeping capital levels high makes banks less profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As JPMorgan's experience with the CIO shows, the line between optimizing capital and manipulating it is fine, and often hard for outsiders - including regulators - to discern, say experts in regulatory measurements of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon himself pointed out in 2010 that "some banks have far more aggressive risk-weighted asset calculators than we do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOING INTO BOOKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks need to seek regulatory approval for new risk models, but regulators may not have the time or sophistication to figure out when they are being duped, according to financial risk experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basel III rules run to 616 pages, compared with 347 pages for Basel II and 30 pages for the 1988 Basel I accord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An examiner of bank books, who is stationed inside one of the biggest U.S. banks by a regulatory body, said regulators can - and do - back-test model changes, ask for detailed information on what specifically changed, and fight the banks on changes if they are inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going into their credit books all the time, literally pulling out securities and testing them on the models every quarter," the regulatory examiner said, declining to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve's stress tests of the largest U.S. banks this month showed that some banks' own calculations of capital levels differed sharply from the central bank's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is acute enough that at the end of January, the regulators behind Basel III said they found wide variations in how banks implement the rules, and they might revise them as a result. A survey by a research analyst at Barclays Capital last year found that half of investors distrust banks' risk-weighted asset figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some regulators say the rules need to be simplified as banks are wasting time and effort on getting the best possible treatment for their assets instead of making their holdings safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The amount of money being spent on this is just incredible," said Thomas Hoenig, vice-chairman of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior regulatory head at one large European bank said his firm alone had spent about $500 million to optimize systems to move from Basel I to Basel III over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISAPPEARING ASSETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On both sides of the Atlantic, 13 of the biggest financial institutions have together announced plans to reduce their risk-weighted assets by 20 percent, or $1 trillion in total, according to consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, for example, wants to reduce its risk-weighted assets by $80 billion to $100 billion. Goldman Sachs Group Inc plans to shed $28 billion worth of risk-weighted assets by the end of this year, from $728 billion as of September 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is using new technology so that traders can assess risk-weightings of individual securities more quickly, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in November. The bank has said that without its modeling efforts, upcoming Basel III rules would result in 40 percent higher risk-weighted assets, compared with the prior risk-weighting regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKinsey estimates that slashing risk-weighted assets will boost return on equity by 3 percentage points for the 13 financial institutions. The group only earned a 4 percent return in 2011. Return on equity is a widely watched measure of how effectively a bank uses shareholder funds to generate profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Risk-weighted assets used to be done by some department of the bank and no one concentrated on them; they were insignificant," the European bank source said. "Now, we're all trying to optimize them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the London whale trades, JPMorgan executives fought with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and failed to disclose information about the bank's new value-at-risk model until weeks after it was implemented, according to the report from the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Michigan Democrat Carl Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2012, Levin's committee found that the chief quantitative analyst for JPMorgan's CIO, Patrick Hagan, wrote an email in which he proposed to "optimize the firm-wide capital charge," meaning he would tweak the way the group measured risk to ensure its assets got better treatment under firm-wide capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, a colleague told him to be careful about leaving a paper trail when discussing these moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think what I would do is not put these things in email," said Anil Bangia, who helped the group develop risk and capital models, according to the Senate's report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry, Lauren Tara LaCapra and Dan Wilchins in New York; Additional reporting by Laura Noonan in London; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Tiffany Wu)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PERTH, March 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its forecast
for iron ore prices by up to 11 percent over the next three
years due to excess supply and slower steel output in China,
sending the shares of major miners to their lowest in nearly
four months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman lopped its forecast for 2014 by 11 percent to $115 a
tonne and for 2015 by 9 percent to $80 a tonne. The forecast for
2013 was lowered by 3 percent to $139 a tonne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seaborne prices will be supported in the near-term by
high-cost marginal mines in China, but this cost support will be
gradually eroded over the next two years," the investment bank
said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eventually, high-cost mines vulnerable to competition from
imported ore will be displaced," the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing use of scrap steel in China and lower crude steel
production would also weigh on iron ore prices, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The result is a market surplus from 2014 onwards, driving
prices towards the marginal cost of seaborne supply," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron ore prices nearly doubled from
three-year lows in September to hit a 16-month high of $158.90 a
tonne in February as Chinese mills ramped up steel output in
anticipation of a pickup in demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the price has since declined to around $134.40 a tonne
as doubts grow about the strength of future demand, curbing
appetite for iron ore. Stockpiles of steel products held by
Chinese traders have swollen to a record high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian miners Rio Tinto Ltd , BHP
Billiton Ltd  and Fortescue Metals Group 
warned on Tuesday of volatile markets and softer prices as
growth in China's steel production slows and more supply comes
through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rio's Australia-listed shares slid as much as 3.7 percent to
A$56.48, the lowest since Nov. 28. BHP fell nearly 3 percent to
a session low of A$33.57, its weakest since Nov. 23, with both
stocks tracking steep losses in London in the previous session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp shut a 29,400 barrel-per-day (bpd) pipeline carrying diesel and jet fuel between its Salt Lake City, Utah, refinery and Boise, Idaho after a leak was discovered in wetlands where millions of migrating birds will rest in the coming weeks, Utah officials said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the concerns we have is we have three weeks to clean up before the northern migration," said John Whitehead, assistant director of the Utah division of water quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The northern migration is the return of birds that wintered south of Utah to nesting areas north of Utah in Idaho, Montana and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More important (than risk of fire) are the toxic effects on the ecosystem," he said. "The diesel is floating right now. That allows the cleanup to happen more easily. But we will be looking at longer term impacts to the wetland area it flows through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leak occurred in the wetlands less than a quarter of a mile from Willard Bay, which drains into the Great Salt Lake, near Ogden, Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no visible sign that contamination has entered the bay, said Whitehead. A small surface stream flows near the pipeline break and that flows directly into the bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willard Bay is a manmade freshwater reservoir sandwiched between the Great Salt Lake and the Wasatch Mountains. The bay and adjoining wetlands are a key stop for migratory water birds like ducks, geese, tundra swans, white pelicans and shore birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron detected a drop in pressure along the pipeline at 2:30 p.m. MDT Monday (1830 GMT Monday) and closed the valves allowing diesel and jet fuel to flow though the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no further details about the impact on (Chevron) operations at this stage. The volume of the release is still to be determined," Chevron spokesman Gareth Johnstone said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaking pipeline carries diesel and jet fuel from the 45,000 bpd Salt Lake City refinery through Burley, Idaho to Boise. A second pipeline carries gasoline from Salt Lake City to Boise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitehead said the leak was estimated to be between 100 barrels and 150 barrels (4,200 gallons-6,300 gallons).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site of the leak was found at 6:30 p.m. MDT Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it had mobilized emergency and clean-up crews, and initiated emergency response procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 100 people were working on containment and clean-up, Whitehead said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, a leak from an oil pipeline supplying Chevron's Salt Lake City refinery contaminated a creek feeding the Great Salt Lake. Clean-up workers collected about two-thirds of estimated 785 barrels (33,000 gallons) in oil that leaked from the pipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Laura Zuckerman in Salmon, Idaho and Shruti Chaturvedi in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

engines.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The Willard Bay State Park in Utah was closed after around 4,200 to 6,300 gallons (100-150 barrels) of diesel leaked from a Chevron Corp pipeline that runs just north of the park, the Salt Lake Tribune reported on its website on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline carries diesel from Chevron's Salt Lake refinery to Boise, Idaho, according to the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tribune report said the company had dispatched more than 100 cleanup workers, who laid down absorbent booms to sop up the diesel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Shruti Chaturvedi in Bangalore)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Rwanda has refused to issue entry visas to two members of a U.N. expert panel that accused Kigali last year of arming rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, describing them as biased, Rwandan and other diplomats said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several U.N. diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, disputed the allegations of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N. Security Council's Group of Experts, which monitors compliance with sanctions and an arms embargo on Congo, said in a report last year that Rwanda's defense minister was commanding the M23 revolt in Congo and that Rwanda was arming the rebels and supporting them with troops. It also accused Uganda of supporting M23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rwanda's government was furious about the experts' report, as was the Ugandan government, and denied the allegations. U.N. officials and Security Council diplomats, however, said the Rwandan denials were not credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Rwandan diplomat confirmed the refusal to issue entry visas to Bernard Leloup of Belgium and Marie Plamadiala of Moldova. Several council diplomats dismissed the Rwandan allegations of bias, saying they suspected Kigali may be getting revenge over the group's revelations about M23's Rwandan links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We told the DRC (Congo) sanctions committee ... that no visa will issued to both of them," Rwanda's deputy U.N. ambassador, Olivier Nduhungirehe, told Reuters. He was referring to the Security Council's Congo sanctions committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several diplomats said the other four members of the expert group are currently in the Rwandan capital Kigali for discussions with the government regarding the panel's continued investigation of Rwanda's role in supporting M23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain, France and the United States are among the countries that have urged Kigali to cooperate with all six members of the expert panel, council diplomats said, adding that they hoped Rwanda would relent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's report by the Group of Experts caused significant grief for Rwanda. The United States, Sweden, the Netherlands, Britain and the European Union reacted to the experts' accusations by suspending some aid to Rwanda, which relies on donors for about 40 percent of its budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACCUSATIONS OF BIAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rwandan U.N. mission prepared a memo complaining about Leloup and Plamadiala. In that memo, obtained by Reuters from a diplomatic source, Rwanda accused Leloup of "a clear pattern of a deeply-seated bias against the GoR (government of Rwanda)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo said Plamadiala has "no demonstrated expertise" suitable to being a member of the expert panel and "demonstrates inappropriate professional boundaries not befitting a U.N. expert."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Rwanda's complaints, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reappointed Leloup and Plamadiala to the expert group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N. press office did not have an immediate response to the question of whether the Rwandan memo complaining about the two experts had been received by Ban's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plamadiala declined to comment in an email to Reuters. Leloup did not respond to an emailed request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Rwanda accused the Group of Experts' coordinator, Steve Hege of the United States, of bias and leaking information to the media. Several council diplomats told Reuters those allegations about Hege were unfounded. The experts' new coordinator is Emilie Serralta of France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently the M23 rebellion started to implode, U.N. diplomats and officials say. Hundreds of Congolese M23 rebels loyal to warlord Bosco Ntaganda fled into neighboring Rwanda or surrendered to U.N. peacekeepers over the weekend after being routed by a rival faction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ntaganda, the fugitive Rwandan-born former Congolese general, walked into the U.S. Embassy in Rwanda on Monday and asked to be transferred to the International Criminal Court, where he faces war crimes charges racked up during the rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;African leaders signed a U.N.-mediated regional accord late last month aimed at ending two decades of conflict in eastern Congo and paving the way for the possible creation of a U.N. intervention force to combat armed groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Louis Charbonneau; Editing by Paul Simao)&lt;/p&gt;

Microsoft was subject of probes by both the Justice Department
and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over tips from
a former Microsoft employee that the company handed kickbacks to
foreign government officials in return for software contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DoJ and SEC declined immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;

Leading Git and Mercurial DVCS Client Now Free to Users on the Microsoft
Platform
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Atlassian, provider of the popular Bitbucket free code hosting service and
collaboration software for product development teams, today announced a major
addition to its popular Git solutions: SourceTree, a free desktop client for Git
and Mercurial distributed version control systems (DVCS) is now available for
download on the Microsoft Windows platform (previously only available for Mac).
SourceTree for Windows allows developers to interface with distributed Git
source repositories through a simple desktop client. SourceTree integrates with
Bitbucket, a cloud-based hosting service for software development projects using
DVCS, and Stash, an on-premise DVCS solution for enterprise teams managing their
code on-site. SourceTree can also connect with other code-hosting services,
including GitHub, Kiln, Microsoft Team Foundation Server and proprietary DVCS
servers. SourceTree for Windows Beta is available today for download at

"SourceTree beats everything else I`ve looked at for presenting the information
I want and then simply getting out of the way," said Julian Adams of Mad Atom
Games, an independent video game developer. "We use SourceTree because it stops
revision control being a problem and lets us get on with making games! For our
Windows users, SourceTree makes sense of the Git experience like nothing else." 

"With the explosive growth of Git amongst developer populations, enterprises are
increasingly in search of tools to smooth its learning curve for employees,"
said Stephen O'Grady, principal analyst with RedMonk. "And with millions of
businesses using Windows worldwide, SourceTree's new Windows version will not
lack for an addressable market." 

SourceTree simplifies how developers interact with and manage code repositories,
and fits seamlessly into a developer's workflow. It automates complex command
line operations and enables users to visualize change sets across multiple
branches and forks. With SourceTree, newbies and more advanced DVCS veterans
alike can:

* Commit, push, pull and merge changes easily with a click of a button 
* Organize repositories with an intuitive bookmarks window 
* Visualize work changes over time with SourceTree's log view 
* Detect and resolve conflicts 
* Search commit histories for changes and review file logs 
* Stage and stash code changes until ready to push 
* Customize actions to support individual commands

"Whether you're working on Mac or Windows, behind the firewall or in the cloud,
our tools will bring you the power of Git while making adoption a breeze. With
this latest release of SourceTree, we now provide a full complement of tools
that will help you and your development team make the most of Git," said Justen
Stepka, product manager for SourceTree and Bitbucket. "We see huge potential for
the Windows platform."

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The 2013 Catalyst Award will be presented tonight to three global
companies-Alcoa Inc., The Coca-Cola Company, and Unilever-for exceptional
initiatives which expand opportunities for women and business in ways that are
successful and locally relevant within their workplaces and communities. 

The initiatives will be celebrated at the Catalyst Awards Dinner, which is
expected to draw close to 100 CEOs of major multinational corporations and firms
as well as nearly 1,600 guests, including leaders of corporations, academic
institutions, and nonprofit organizations. Denise Morrison, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Campbell Soup Company, will chair the Dinner, which is
sponsored by RBC and Shell Oil Company. 

"These companies are challenging assumptions about how work should be done, and
they have come up with innovative solutions to create workforces brimming with
skilled and experienced women," said Ilene H. Lang, President &amp; CEO, Catalyst.
"Their leaders have the vision to recognize that advancing women in the
workplace goes hand in hand with advancing women in society. They have not only
accelerated opportunities for their employees, they`ve gone beyond the walls of
their corporations to produce change for women in their communities." 

Alcoa Inc.`s initiative, Building Opportunities for Women in a "Hard Hat"
Company, breaks down barriers in a male-dominated industry and achieves greater
gender representation through an aggressive diversity agenda that develops women
supervisors and leaders in Alcoa`s refineries, smelters, and factories
worldwide. "Talent is the only truly sustainable advantage," said Alcoa Chairman
and CEO Klaus Kleinfeld. "To get the best talent, you must have diversity of
thought, experience, skills and background. We are extremely proud to be one of
the first `hard hat` companies to earn the prestigious Catalyst Award, and we
plan to build on this achievement and extend diverse talent deeper into our
organization in the future." 

The Coca-Cola Company`s Global Women`s Initiative: Women as the Real Drivers of
the 21st Century is a strategic, internal and external initiative focused on
fueling the advancement of women as dynamic leaders and entrepreneurs across the
organization and in communities throughout the globe. "We are truly honored to
receive this prestigious award which validates that we are on the right track
toward empowering women inside our company and across our value chain," said
Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company. "We are proud to be
recognized for our accomplishments, but we realize there is still a great deal
of work to do to reach our goal of achieving true diversity." 

Unilever builds on its strong foundation of cultural diversity and multinational
expertise with its Global Reach With Local Roots: Creating a Gender-Balanced
Workforce in Different Cultural Contexts initiative, which accelerates the
advancement of high-potential women across different regions by promoting a
culture of inclusion and creating flexible "anytime, anywhere" work-life
programs. Unilever CEO Paul Polman said, "We are delighted to be recognized by
Catalyst for our long-standing commitment to gender balance. From our successful
mentoring program to our rollout of flexible working, I am very encouraged by
the progress we are making to help both men and women at Unilever reach their
full potential. To achieve our company`s ambition of doubling the size of our
business while reducing our environmental impact and increasing our positive
social impact, it is crucial that we build a diverse and engaged workforce where
everybody can develop to his or her full potential. The benefits of having a
gender-balanced organization are plain to see; it helps power creativity and
innovation, deepens the talent pool and allows us to better serve our diverse
consumer base." 

With the theme "Ready for Change," the 2013 Catalyst Awards Conference earlier
in the day invited the 600-plus participants, including leaders from the
Catalyst Award-winning initiatives, to shape the dialogue related to women`s
leadership, focusing on how the corporate community can more effectively
capitalize on the talents of its women employees. Ursula Burns, Chairman and CEO
of Xerox Corporation, provided insights into her career in a luncheon keynote
conversation with Ms. Lang. The lead sponsor of the Conference is Walmart and
the supporting sponsor is AT

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Russian property company O1
Properties has bought Moscow's White Square office complex, home
to a local arm of Microsoft, for about $1 billion in
the country's largest ever office deal, a source close to the
sale said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal, financed by Russia's Sberbank, will help

that was shelved last year due to the weak state of the new

business district and was sold by a consortium of Russia's VTB
Capital, U.S. private equity company TPG Holdings and developer
AIG/Lincoln, according to a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not disclose the sale price but the transaction was
described by property consultant Jones Lang LaSalle 
(JLL), which advised AIG/Lincoln and VTB on the deal, as "one of
the five largest single-asset deals across the globe in 2012".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tenants of the complex, which was completed in 2009 and has
76,000 square metres of space, include accountants PwC and
Deloitte as well as U.S. software group Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This property will take its justified place among other
trophy assets in our portfolio and raise its gross asset value
to almost $4 billion," said Dmitry Mints, chairman of O1
Properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow has a shortage of top-end office space, which has
helped push rents up from $700 per square metre per year in the
second quarter of 2009 to $1,150 today, JLL said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Visa Inc Chief Executive Charlie Scharf suggested on Wednesday that the payment network may impose a fee on digital wallet operators like PayPal, following rival MasterCard Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard said earlier this year that it plans a new fee for digital wallet operators starting in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PayPal is not an official payment network in its own right. Instead, when people use PayPal to pay for something, the purchases are funded from their bank account or their credit and debit cards. Because of this, PayPal already pays huge amounts of fees to Visa, MasterCard and American Express whenever a PayPal purchase is funded with a credit card bearing those logos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of eBay Inc, owner of PayPal, the largest digital wallet operator, have been hit hard on concerns other payment networks may roll out similar fees, cutting into PayPal's profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it is totally appropriate to do that," Scharf said during the Barclays Emerging Payments Forum on Wednesday, when asked if Visa was planning a digital wallet fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital wallets are electronic versions of real wallets that store card and bank information and can be used to buy things online quickly and anonymously. These digital wallets are increasingly moving into the physical world, through consumers' use of smartphones while shopping in retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PayPal is moving from its online roots into the physical retailer world, where the vast majority of payments still take place.

&lt;p&gt;* Online 'very different' from point of sale -CEO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Visa, MasterCard often follow each others' moves -analysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* PayPal may be more of a threat in physical stores
-analysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Alistair Barr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, March 20 (Reuters) - Visa Inc Chief
Executive Charlie Scharf suggested on Wednesday that the payment
network may impose a fee on digital wallet operators like
PayPal, following rival MasterCard Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard said earlier this year that it plans a new fee
for digital wallet operators starting in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PayPal is not an official payment network in its own right.
Instead, when people use PayPal to pay for something, the
purchases are funded from their bank account or their credit and
debit cards. Because of this, PayPal already pays huge amounts
of fees to Visa, MasterCard and American Express whenever a
PayPal purchase is funded with a credit card bearing those
logos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of eBay Inc, owner of PayPal, the largest
digital wallet operator, have been hit hard on concerns other
payment networks may roll out similar fees, cutting into
PayPal's profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it is totally appropriate to do that," Scharf said
during the Barclays Emerging Payments Forum on Wednesday, when
asked if Visa was planning a digital wallet fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital wallets are electronic versions of real wallets that
store card and bank information and can be used to buy things
online quickly and anonymously. These digital wallets are
increasingly moving into the physical world, through consumers'
use of smartphones while shopping in retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PayPal is moving from its online roots into the physical
retailer world, where the vast majority of payments still take
place. It is a big opportunity for the business, and that has
driven eBay shares higher in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as a payment option in lots of physical stores,
PayPal will be a bigger threat to networks like MasterCard, Visa
and American Express, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of the people we compete with started out as one thing
and they morph into another thing, and doing things online is
very different than doing things at point of sale," Scharf said
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are always thinking about those relationships and they
have changed," he added. "And if they changed enough that we
think it warrants us to change something with us, we will do
that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Visa spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MasterCard fee will be charged on "staged" digital
wallets, such as PayPal, Google's Wallet, Square,
iZettle in Europe and Intuit Inc's GoPayment, according
to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staged digital wallets typically share less information with
card issuers and the networks, creating customer service
problems and making it more difficult to deal with card rewards 
programs, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Allowing data to be passed through to our issuers and then
not allowing data to be passed through to our issuers makes us
re-think about our pricing and our rules," Scharf said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said it is
"inevitable" that Visa will follow MasterCard's move and
introduce a digital wallet fee of its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a fully functioning duopoly. When one does
something, the other one follows suit," Luria explained. "It was
MasterCard's turn to exercise its market power. If they are
allowed to do it then Visa will follow."&lt;/p&gt;

ExxonMobil Chemical President discusses plans at IHS World Petrochemical
Conference
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
State-of-the art environmental technology will enable ExxonMobil`s planned
chemical expansion at Baytown to operate within existing Texas permitted
emission limits, Steve Pryor, president of ExxonMobil Chemical Company, said in
a speech today at the IHS World Petrochemical Conference. 

"Reducing environmental impact has been an ongoing strategy at Baytown," Pryor
said. Over the past decade, the site has invested over $1.3 billion in
environmental upgrades to improve air quality and achieve double-digit
improvements in energy efficiency. 

The plans include a new multi-billion dollar world-scale steam cracker and
expansion of premium polyethylene production at ExxonMobil`s Baytown site,
already the country`s largest integrated refining-chemical complex, Pryor noted.
The facilities will produce premium polymers incorporating company advances that
have reduced film thickness by two percent per year for the last 20 years, said
Pryor. 

He pointed out that the unique advantages of premium products, unmatched scale
and integration with the company`s refining and natural gas businesses should
sustain economic returns over the ups and downs of the business cycle. 

The Greater Houston area would benefit from $870 million per year in increased
economic activity, including an estimated 10,000 jobs at the peak of
construction and 3,800 permanent jobs. 

The Baytown project illustrates the company`s strategy for sustainability,
benefiting customers, shareholders, the environment, and society, Pryor
concluded.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The founder of a global medical device company who racked up personal losses of $1.4 million in a Goldman Sachs private debt fund is concerned about practices that may lure investors into securities that are riskier than sales pitches indicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Caruso, who launched Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp in 1989, told Reuters he invested personal assets in a distressed debt fund Goldman launched in 2007, only to learn it was riskier than the firm and its advisers indicated in a preliminary pitch before the fund launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitrators last week, rejected claims that Caruso raised in an arbitration filed against a unit of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc in 2009. The case, filed in the name of Caruso's family investment vehicle, Athena Venture Partners LP. sought recovery of $1.4 million in losses from Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arbitrators, in their ruling on March 13, described Caruso as an "accomplished businessman with many years of experience in entrepreneurial and financial type ventures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision offers a glimpse at challenges that wealthy and sophisticated investors often face in securities arbitration, say lawyers. Although the wealthy do win some cases, brokerages typically argue that such investors fully understand the risks of the securities they are buying. That is the case even when the investments brokerages pitch is not suitable or misrepresented, lawyers for investors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman approached Caruso about the fund in 2007 when first looking for investors, he said. He decided to invest based on information he and Athena's general partner received in a written summary and discussions with Goldman advisers. But the strategy Goldman pitched, while risky, was different than the one it used, Caruso said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caruso, who became a Goldman client about 13 years ago, is considering whether to try to overturn the ruling in court. "I am concerned about other people who are trying to do things with Goldman," said Caruso, now president of The Provco Group, a Villanova, Pennsylvania-based venture capital and business finance consultancy. He is still on the board of directors at Integra, whose products include orthopedic implants and regenerative products for bone and tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said the firm "prevailed entirely" in the arbitration. "The panel rejected every claim asserted and found each of them to be &#8216;clearly erroneous' and &#8216;false'," she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BLANKET EXCUSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convincing arbitrators that even wealthy and sophisticated investors may have been led astray can be tricky, especially when brokerage firms point to lengthy offering documents that may describe a multitude of risks that did not come up in initial sales presentations, according to Philip Aidikoff, a lawyer at Aidikoff, Uhl &amp; Bakhtiari who often represents wealthy investors in complex cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge requires proving that what a broker told the firm's customer about an investment, or details included in initial pitch materials were at odds with the actual trading strategy once a product is actually launched, said Aidikoff, who was not involved in the Caruso case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athena's $5 million investment in the distressed debt fund lost up to about 50 percent of its value during the 2008 credit crisis, according to Caruso's lawyer, David Moffitt of Saul Ewing LLP in Wayne, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund was also supposed to buy quality fixed income securities at steep discounts and then sell the securities at face value when the market recovered, Caruso says he was told in the presentations. Leverage, if used at all, would be small and manageable. The fund, while speculative, was not a hedge fund, Caruso said he was told. Caruso, who wanted the money to fund other commitments if needed, described that representation as "critically important" to his decision to invest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality was different, said Moffitt, the lawyer. Goldman described the investment as a "hedge fund" in some account statements, Moffitt said. Not all the securities Goldman bought were deeply discounted and it leveraged the fund as much as 2.7 times, Moffitt said. While the leverage was not as high as strategies for some other credit-oriented investments in the pre-crisis period, when some funds effectively leveraged assets up to 10 times their value, it was not what Caruso anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arbitrators ruled that the initial presentation included details Caruso said it did not. Caruso also did not prove the statements he said Goldman's advisers made, they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caruso's losses stood at $2.4 million in late 2008, but inched down to $1.4 million after Goldman deleveraged the fund, Moffitt said. Goldman declined to disclose leverage ratios or other details about the fund's investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key argument by Goldman that backed the panel's decision is that Caruso, after the initial presentations, received an offering memorandum that described the risks. Caruso and Athena said they did not receive the document, an argument that was virtually impossible to prove, say lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, FINRA guidance explains that brokerages cannot point to disclosure documents as a blanket excuse for representations made by other means, like pitches, say lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outcome troubles some lawyers for investors who say that a client's wealth and sophistication should not excuse any level of misrepresentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your sophistication shouldn't even make it into the equation," said Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago-based lawyer who represents investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn; Additional reporting by Susan Kelly; Editing by Jennifer Merritt and Kenneth Barry)&lt;/p&gt;

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigns preliminary ratings to eight classes of
mortgage pass-through certificates from J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust 2013-1, a
jumbo prime RMBS transaction. 

The mortgage pool backing J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust 2013-1 is comprised of 752
first-lien mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of $616,260,381 as
of the cut-off date. The pool is divided into two sub-pools, one consisting
almost entirely of 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, the other consisting of a mix
of 30-year ARMs with a 10-year fixed period and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages.
The pool is characterized by substantial borrower equity in each mortgaged
property, as evidenced by the weighted average LTV (63%) and CLTV (65%). The
weighted average credit score of the mortgage pool is 769 which is well within
the "prime" mortgage range. 

KBRA`s analysis of the transaction includes a loan-level analysis of the
mortgage pool using our Residential Mortgage Default and Loss Model, together
with a review of the transaction parties, results of loan file reviews performed
by independent third party firms and a pre-closing review of the legal structure
and key documentation. This analysis is further described in our U.S. RMBS
Rating Methodology. 

For complete details on the analysis, please see our Pre-Sale Report, J.P.
Morgan Mortgage Trust 2013-1 which was published today at
www.krollbondratings.com. 

The preliminary ratings are based on information known to KBRA at the time of
this publication. Information received subsequent to this release could result
in the assignment of final ratings that differ from the preliminary ratings.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings expects to rate J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust, Series 2013-1 as
follows: 

--$244,401,000 class 1A-1 certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$244,401,000 class 1-A-IO notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$326,256,000 class 2A-1 certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$326,256,000 class 2-A-IO notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$15,406,000 class B-1 certificate 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$9,244,000 class B-2 certificate 'Asf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$7,703,000 class B-3 certificate 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$5,238,000 class B-4 certificate 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable; 

The $8,012,381 class B-5 certificate will not be rated. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

High-Quality Mortgage Pool: The collateral pool consists of a mixture of 15-,
20-, and 30-year fixed rate mortgages (77%) and seven- and 10-year hybrid ARMs
(23%) to borrowers with strong credit profiles, full documentation, low
leverage, and significant liquid reserves. A 65.1% CLTV provides a significant
buffer against potential home price declines. Strong borrower quality is
reflected in the 768 weighted average (WA) FICO and $633,428 WA household
income. In addition, third-party due diligence was conducted on 100% of the pool
and the results indicated strong underwriting controls. 

Weak Representations and Warranties (R) Framework: While the transaction
benefits from strong rep providers, Fitch believes the value of the R
framework is significantly diluted by qualifying and conditional language that
substantially reduces lender loan breach liability and the inclusion of sunsets
for a number of provisions including fraud. While the agency believes that the
high credit quality pool and clean diligence results mitigate the R risks to
some degree, Fitch considered the weaker framework in its expected loss
estimation and credit enhancement analysis. 

Strong Counterparties: The transaction benefits from strong counterparties with
88.8% originated by JPMCB and FRB, two entities with 'above average' origination
platforms and strong financial capacities to meet potential repurchase
obligations. With respect to servicing, Fitch maintains a 'RPS2+' servicer
rating on JPMCB and views FRB as an acceptable servicer. The transaction also
benefits from the participation of an experienced master servicer, Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. (rated 'RMS1'). 

Limited Alignment of Interests: While JPMCB will be providing R into the
transaction as the originator of 48.1% of the collateral pool, the sponsor, J.P.
Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Corp. (JPMMAC), does not anticipate retaining any
portion of the capital structure or associated credit risk. The lack of shared
risk between the issuer and investors is a divergence from recent transactions
that Fitch has rated. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Fitch's analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how the
ratings would react to steeper market value declines (MVDs) than assumed at both
the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and national levels. The implied rating
sensitivities are only an indication of some of the potential outcomes and do
not consider other risk factors that the transaction may become exposed to or be
considered in the surveillance of the transaction. 

Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected lower
home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool. The model
currently projects sustainable MVDs (sMVDs) at the MSA level. For three of the
top 15 regions in the mortgage pool, Fitch's SHP model does not project declines
in home prices, and for another region in the top 15, the projected decline is
less than 5.00%. These regions include Chicago-Joliet-Naperville in Illinois
(5.6%), Boston-Quincy in Massachusetts (4.1%), Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale in Arizona
(2.3%), and Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown in Texas (1.7%). The sensitivity analyses
indicated no impact on ratings for all bonds in each scenario. 

Another sensitivity analysis focused on how the ratings would react to steeper
MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in
addition to the model projected 14% for this pool. The analysis indicates there
is some potential rating migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model
projection. 

Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the presale
report titled ' J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust, Series 2013-1', dated March 20,
2013, which is available on Fitch's web site, www.fitchratings.com. 

Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Please replace the release dated March 19, 2013 with the following corrected
version due to multiple revisions. 

The corrected release reads: 

ENTWISTLE &amp; CAPPUCCI LLP, BERGER &amp; MONTAGUE, P.C. AND THE TRUSTEE FOR THE MF
GLOBAL LIQUIDATION ANNOUNCE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AGAINST JPMORGAN

Co-Lead Counsel for the Class of MF Global Inc. ("MFGI") customers and James W.
Giddens, the trustee ("Trustee") for the liquidation of MFGI, have announced a
settlement ("Settlement") of all potential claims against JPMorgan Chase Bank,
NA and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates ("JPMorgan"). The proposed
Settlement will be contemporaneously presented by motions for approval to both
District Court Judge Victor Marrero and to Bankruptcy Court Judge Martin Glenn. 

The proposed Settlement, which will resolve all of the Customer Representatives`
and Trustee`s potential claims against JPMorgan arising both from transfers of
Customer Property during the days preceding MFGI`s collapse and from JPMorgan`s
conduct as one of MFGI`s primary banks and repositories of Customer Property,
provides a sizable benefit to the Settlement Class of former customers of MFGI.
Subject to Court approval, the Settlement provides for a $100 million cash
payment from JPMorgan for distribution to MFGI`s former customers. 

In addition to the $100 million cash payment, the Settlement also provides for
the return of approximately $29 million in proprietary MFGI funds held by
JPMorgan to secure potential obligations under a certain revolving credit
facility agreement and JPMorgan`s clearance and other agreements with MFGI, as
well the release of JPMorgan`s retained liens and set off rights in
approximately $417 million of proprietary MFGI funds it previously remitted to
the Trustee, permitting these funds to be made available to MFGI`s customers and
creditors. 

Upon approval, the Settlement will enable the Trustee to immediately seek to
allocate $250 million to the 4d Customer Estate for the benefit of MFGI
customers who engaged in commodity transactions on domestic exchanges ("4d
Customers") and $50 million to the 30.7 Customer Estate for the benefit of
customers who transacted on foreign exchanges ("30.7 Customers"). Moreover, the
Settlement with JPMorgan will satisfy an important condition to the
effectiveness of the settlement between the Trustee and the Joint Special
Administrators of MF Global UK Limited ("MFGUK"), approved by the Bankruptcy
Court on January 31, 2013, which will facilitate the recovery from MFGUK of
approximately $500-$600 million (over time) for additional distribution to
customers and general creditors. All told, the Settlement will ultimately enable
the Trustee to distribute to customers an amount approaching $1 billion. 

The Class is continuing to pursue its claims against the former directors and
officers of MFGI, including Jon Corzine, and against MFGI`s former auditor,
PricewaterhouseCoopers and MFGI`s primary regulator, the CME Group. 

Co-Lead Counsel for the customers, Andrew Entwistle of Entwistle &amp; Cappucci LLP
and Merrill Davidoff of Berger &amp; Montague, P.C., were especially pleased with
the Settlement. Attorney Entwistle observed that: "This Settlement reflects the
cooperative efforts of our team and the Trustee over many months of
investigation and negotiations with JPMorgan; represents a favorable and
economically sound resolution to what would otherwise have been a costly and
protracted legal battle; and is a key recovery for the Customers both in its own
right and as the lynchpin to the UK settlement recently approved by Judge
Glenn." Attorney Davidoff observed that: "We are pleased JPMorgan elected to
resolve these claims early enough to enable the Trustee to return significant
sums to customers, and especially that the contemporaneous release of liens
asserted by JPMorgan will free up hundreds of millions of dollars that can be
distributed once the Settlement becomes final." 

Entwistle also observed that: "While a substantial shortfall will still remain
for 4d and 30.7 Customers, the $800m-900m that this Settlement will cause to be
paid to customers over time is a tremendous step forward in this process."
Davidoff further stated that: "Nearly a year and a half has passed since the
management of MFGI improperly transferred hundreds of millions of dollars in
segregated customer property for use by the firm, while PwC and CME Group
enabled their reckless behavior. It is time that the remaining parties pay for
their improper behavior and make MFGI`s former customers whole."

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Acorn, a provider of profitability and cost management solutions and a Microsoft
Managed Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Partner, today announced a new
integrated solution for Microsoft Dynamics AX customers. Designed to drive even
greater profitability and cost efficiency from their ERP investment, Acorn`s
Total Profitability for Microsoft Dynamics AX is available immediately to
Microsoft Dynamics AX resellers and customers. 

Acorn has been a Microsoft Managed ISV Partner for eight years and recently
signed a global strategic collaboration agreement with Microsoft to drive mutual
innovation and solutions for manufacturing and other industry verticals. 

"We are excited to welcome Acorn as a member of the Global ISV program," said
Doug Kennedy, Vice President of Partners for Microsoft Dynamics. "Their long
history of delivering value through profitability and cost management solutions
aligns directly with our goals for the initiative. Acorn, in combination with
Microsoft Dynamics AX, allows our customers to drive more profitable volume and
truly understand and manage their operations." 

Total Profitability for Dynamics AX combines Acorn`s ability to drive real
business insight with the proven backbone of Microsoft Dynamics AX. Tightly
integrated to Dynamics AX, it is an easily configured, highly flexible modeling
and calculation solution. Joint customers will understand the true operating
profit of customers and products, including the `cost to serve` and `net landed
cost.` 

"Our goal is to deliver true visibility into the business operations of today`s
complex enterprises, delivering insight into customers and products,
understanding which are making or losing money and why. A simple premise, but
one that has been stuck for years at a gross level and not taken into account
concepts like cost to serve and net landed cost," says Jerome Patterson, Chief
Marketing Officer of Acorn. 

"We will make Microsoft Dynamics AX customers more profitable and allow partner
resellers to further delight and deliver value to their strategic clients," says
Patterson. "Basically this Acorn integrated solution is getting back to the
basic premise of ERP - to drive profitability and cost efficiency." 

Microsoft Dynamics partner resellers are already thrilled by the potential, as
Luc Van Aelbroeck, Managing Partner of Delaware Consulting remarks, "We are
excited about the potential of the Acorn solution to truly transform the
business value our clients see from their investments with Microsoft and our
company. With Acorn, we know we can drive profitable volume and outpace the
competition." 

About Acorn

drive better business decisions. Combining proprietary technology with proven
methodology, Acorn reveals enterprise-wide profit opportunities. Our unique
approach enables clients to make continuous, fact-based decisions to improve

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia--(Business Wire)--
Stevia Nutra Corporation (OTCQB: STNT) - (The Company), an Agro-Management
company focused on stevia agronomics, having just reported a successful first
harvest, is developing plans to expand its production capacity of high quality
stevia in Cambodia. This ramp up in production capacity coincides with a number
of positive announcements by leading food and beverage brands to increase the
use of the all-natural, zero calorie sweetener `stevia` in their ingredient mix.


One clear example of this trend is Coca-Cola`s recent announcement that its
regular Sprite will no longer be available in the United Kingdom, to be replaced
with a version that uses the sweetener stevia, and has 30 percent fewer
calories. The change by the world's biggest beverage maker comes in response to
a government push calling on companies to address obesity. Coca-Cola already
made a similar move with Sprite in France last year. Sprite is Coca-Cola's fifth
most popular brand in the United Kingdom, after Coke, Diet Coke, Schweppes and
Fanta. 

The announcement came ahead of the airing of Coca-Cola's anti-obesity TV ad in
the United Kingdom. That ad first aired in the United States in January amid
increasing fire over the role sodas play in fueling obesity rates. New York
City, for example, is looking to enact a first-in-the-U.S. ban on sugary drinks
bigger than 16 ounces in restaurants, movie theatres and other venues. Coke has
already been experimenting with reduced-calorie versions of Sprite and Fanta
that use stevia in select U.S. markets since this summer 2012. 

"It's pretty clear where the trend line is pointing", said Stevia Nutra
President, Brian Dicks. "The big food and beverage brands and manufacturers are
addressing the "obesity-battle", and consumer demands, with new healthier
products and formulations that are lower in calories. Stevia really hits the
sweet spot because it delivers on taste, calories and is naturally derived from
a plant, not from a lab. There is not enough stevia grown in the world to meet
current demand and Stevia Nutra intends to expand its operations and capacity
dramatically to take advantage. It`s very simple. Consumers want stevia; we will
grow it."

Stevia Nutra CEO, Dr. Hilary Rodrigues further noted, "We applaud Coca-Cola,
with its global reach and influence on consumer tastes, for taking proactive
steps in expanding stevia use as a food and beverage ingredient. In doing so
they are extending the benefits stevia offers to consumers, especially those
battling diabetes and other obesity related illnesses."

About Us

Stevia Nutra:

Stevia Nutra is an Agro-Management company focused on stevia agronomics which
includes plant breeding, proprietary agricultural practices and post-harvest
techniques. Stevia Nutra intends to invest heavily in R and IP acquisition and
manage large-scale plantations for the production of high value stevia products.


Stevia Nutra is dedicated to utilizing best agronomic and business practices to
demonstrate the sustainability and profitability of stevia production. By
subscribing to, and implementing the performance standards published by the
World Bank, Stevia Nutra is committed to becoming the premier producer of the
highest quality stevia. Stevia Nutra recognizes the potential this remarkable
plant has to reduce the global epidemic of obesity and diabetes and promote
general good health. The Company's priority will be to embrace sustainability
for smarter innovation and profitable growth. 

Stevia and the stevia sector:

Stevia is the world`s only all natural zero calorie sweetener. Since being
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration late in 2008, stevia
can now be found in over 6,000 food, beverage and medicine products, with many
more new products to follow as globally consumers are making healthier food
choices. 

Stevia is the fastest growing sweetener product in the world. The World Health
Organization estimates that stevia will replace up to 20% of the global
sweetener market valued at over $10 Billion USD. Zenith International expects
that stevia agriculture production will have to triple within two years to keep
up with the strong demand. Only one year after FDA approval in the U.S., stevia
sales surged past both aspartame and saccharin in the tabletop sugar market.

billion compared to 2011.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has reached a $546 million settlement with the trustee liquidating the failed broker-dealer unit of MF Global Holdings, a court filing showed, an amount that will help repay the brokerage's customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a settlement reached with James Giddens, the trustee who is tasked with liquidating MF Global Inc, JPMorgan will pay $100 million that will be made available for distribution to former MF Global customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will also return more than $29 million of the brokerage's funds held by the bank, while releasing claims on $417 million that was previously returned to Giddens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The settlement agreement resolves claims by the trustee and customer representatives against JPMorgan that would otherwise result in years of costly litigation between the parties with an uncertain outcome," Giddens said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the lead on a $1.2 billion loan to MF Global, and was also one of its primary clearing banks before the broker-dealer went bankrupt. The bank had previously retained claims on some of the collateral posted by MF Global that led to the legal tussle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giddens will also request the bankruptcy court to authorize distribution of $250 million to former MF Global Inc customers who traded on U.S. exchanges and $50 million to customers who traded on foreign exchanges, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MF Global declared bankruptcy in 2011. Commodity traders with personal accounts lost millions of dollars when, according to Giddens, the firm improperly used client money to cover corporate transactions as the firm sank. MF Global customer accounts were frozen in the wake of the bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case became a political firestorm when regulators discovered an estimated $1.6 billion hole in the trading accounts of the broker's trading customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re: MF Global Inc, case No. 11-2790, in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Paul Tait and Miral Fahmy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A key bank regulator has called for improvement in the management of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) on concerns linked to the multi-billion dollar "London Whale" trading loss last year, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing knowledgeable sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) downgraded the firm's management rating in July to level 3, meaning the board's abilities "may be insufficient" and "need improvement", the paper said, quoting sources familiar with the matter. (link.reuters.com/wyp76t)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators measure the strength of financial institutions using a confidential ratings yardstick that has several components including asset quality and management capability, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French-born JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil became known as the "London Whale" in credit markets because of the size of his bets, which unraveled in 2012 leaving the U.S. investment bank with a $6 billion trading loss and a lot of wounded pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Journal reported that the OCC's decision to downgrade the bank's management rating was not related solely to Iksil's trades. It did not indicate the rating's previous level or how far it had dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on the rating change but told the Journal, "we are working hard to strengthen all of our processes and have already remediated many significant issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and OCC could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside of U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mridhula Raghavan in Bangalore; Editing by Stephen Coates)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 20 (Reuters) - A key U.S. bank regulator has called
for improvement in the management of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
on concerns linked to the multi-billion dollar "London Whale"
trading loss last year, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
knowledgeable sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
downgraded the firm's management rating in July to level 3,
meaning the board's abilities "may be insufficient" and "need
improvement", the paper said, quoting sources familiar with the
matter. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators measure the strength of financial
institutions using a confidential ratings yardstick that has
several components including asset quality and management
capability, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French-born JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil became known as the
"London Whale" in credit markets because of the size of his
bets, which unravelled in 2012 leaving the U.S. investment bank
with a $6 billion trading loss and a lot of wounded pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Journal reported that the OCC's decision to downgrade
the bank's management rating was not related solely to Iksil's
trades. It did not indicate the rating's previous level or how
far it had dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on the rating
change but told the Journal, "we are working hard to strengthen
all of our processes and have already remediated many
significant issues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and OCC could not immediately be reached for
comment by Reuters outside of U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan will pay $100 mln, to return more than $29 mln&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan will release claims on $417 mln that was
previously returned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Trustee seeks to distribute $300 mln to customers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sakthi Prasad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 19 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has reached
a $546 million settlement with the trustee liquidating the
failed broker-dealer unit of MF Global Holdings, a
court filing showed, an amount that will help repay the
brokerage's customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a settlement reached with James Giddens, the
trustee who is tasked with liquidating MF Global Inc, JPMorgan
will pay $100 million that will be made available for
distribution to former MF Global customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will also return more than $29 million of the
brokerage's funds held by the bank, while releasing claims on
$417 million that was previously returned to Giddens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The settlement agreement resolves claims by the trustee and
customer representatives against JPMorgan that would otherwise
result in years of costly litigation between the parties with an
uncertain outcome," Giddens said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the lead on a $1.2 billion loan to MF Global,
and was also one of its primary clearing banks before the
broker-dealer went bankrupt. The bank had previously retained
claims on some of the collateral posted by MF Global that led to
the legal tussle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giddens will also request the bankruptcy court to authorize
distribution of $250 million to former MF Global Inc customers
who traded on U.S. exchanges and $50 million to customers who
traded on foreign exchanges, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MF Global declared bankruptcy in 2011. Commodity traders
with personal accounts lost millions of dollars when, according
to Giddens, the firm improperly used client money to cover
corporate transactions as the firm sank. MF Global customer
accounts were frozen in the wake of the bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case became a political firestorm when regulators
discovered an estimated $1.6 billion hole in the trading
accounts of the broker's trading customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re: MF Global Inc, case No. 11-2790, in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Suzanne Barlyn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 21 (Reuters) - The founder of a medical devices
company who racked up losses of $1.4 million in a Goldman Sachs
Group Inc private debt fund is considering whether to
appeal an arbitration ruling against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Caruso, who launched Integra LifeSciences Holdings
Corp in 1989, filed an arbitration case against the Wall Street
firm in 2009, alleging misrepresentation, fraud and other causes
of action. The case was filed in the name of Caruso's family
investment vehicle, Athena Venture Partners LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
arbitrators rejected Caruso's claim in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said the firm "prevailed
entirely" in the arbitration. "The panel rejected every claim
asserted and found each of them to be 'clearly erroneous' and
'false,'" she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caruso said Goldman first approached him about the fund in
2007. He said he decided to invest based on information he and
Athena's general partner received in a written summary and
discussions with Goldman advisers. But he alleged that the
strategy Goldman pitched, while risky, was different from the
one it used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their ruling, however, the arbitrators said the
misrepresentation claims were not supported by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athena's $5 million investment in the distressed debt fund
lost roughly 50 percent of its value during the 2008 credit
crisis, according to Caruso's lawyer, David Moffitt of Saul
Ewing LLP in Wayne, Pennsylvania. Those losses declined to about
$1.4 million after Goldman shifted its strategy, Moffitt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caruso is now president of The Provco Group, a Villanova,
Pennsylvania-based venture capital and business finance
consultancy. Caruso became a Goldman client about 13 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 21 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp, after years of
living in the shadow of Exxon Mobil Corp, has grown
accustomed to having to punch above its weight, and it has now
landed a notable blow against another big oil company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it ranks fourth in oil and gas reserves among the
world's non-government-controlled producers, the California
major recently seized the number two spot from Royal Dutch Shell
Plc in terms of stock market valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's steady climb underlines the fact that the total
reserves number matters less today than proportion of oil versus
gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While average crude oil prices hit a record high in 2012,
last year also saw U.S. natural gas prices plumb a
10-year low because of a glut of production from North American
shale rock that has shaken up the global market for gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proved reserves include estimated crude oil in the ground as
well as natural gas converted into "barrels of oil equivalent"
(boe) for easy comparison. Along with current levels of
production and prevailing oil and gas prices, reserves are how
accountants and analysts derive an oil company's book value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell's end-2012 reserves are 54 percent natural gas, while
the equivalent figure for Chevron is only 43 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, more than half of Shell's worldwide production
is natural gas, whereas gas represented less than a third of
Chevron's 2012 output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of that, among other reasons, Chevron generated
earnings from oil and gas production of $23.8 billion, compared
with $22.2 billion in "upstream" earnings for Shell. Its "oily" 
resource base also helped it beat the other majors, including
Exxon and BP Plc, in earnings per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key is Chevron's different production," said Jason
Gammel, a London-based analyst at Macquarie. "Chevron generates
just as much cash, and at the end of the day that's what
matters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the comparative reserves, Shell's ability to
rapidly switch to more liquids production in response to prices
is more constrained than that of the other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OIL-LINKED CONTRACTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Kirkland, head of Chevron's upstream business,
acknowledges his company is becoming more gas-focused over time,
with huge projects starting up in Australia and Angola set to
more than double its LNG production to 460,000 boe/day from
2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirkland predicts that in the future Chevron's actual output
will be about 60 percent oil and 40 percent natural gas, but he
noted that much of the LNG has already been sold for long-term
contracts linked to oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you look at the revenue stream, it will still look
very close to 80-20 oil, because so much of this gas coming on
is sold with an oil linkage," Kirkland said in an interview last
week. "I think we showed that last year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So all gas is not the same, as Exxon has found out the hard
way ever since its $30 billion purchase of XTO in 2010. The
addition of XTO registered in a clear tick up in gas reserves
that year for Exxon, despite the size of the Texas giant's
portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXXON FALL-OUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts cite Exxon's big bet on shale gas with XTO as part
of a strategic direction that allowed its stock to underperform
its smaller U.S. rival over the past half decade, with Chevron
shares up 45 percent versus just 3 percent for Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As Exxon Mobil suffers the fall-out from a decade of an
excessively low oil price planning assumption, lack of
exploration, and a huge bet on US natural gas, Chevron is
clearly marching towards a position of the world's number 1 oil
company," Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Sankey wrote last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big risk for Chevron, Sankey added, is the amount of money
it is having to fork out to compete with Exxon: Chevron's
capital budget for 2013 is $36.7 billion, only $1.3 billion
dollars short of Exxon's spending this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the outlook for Chevron looks more promising, with
annual production growth of between 4 percent and 5 percent
expected between 2014 and 2017, Gammel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Kirkland put investors' minds to rest last week when he
explained that 98 percent of the projects delivering that growth
are in design, construction or production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares hit a new record high of $120.98 on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is shrinking, but so are some of its bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight years ago, Goldman Sachs Group&#8217;s Kishan Shah&#160;weighed 400 pounds and couldn&#8217;t find a suit that fit his 62&#8221; waist for a job interview. Now he&#8217;s 195 pounds, and he&#8217;s quitting Goldman to spread the gospel of healthy weight loss as chief executive of a chain of gyms for obese Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I made a vow that day to focus on diet and exercise, and I lost over 200 pounds &#8211; no surgeries, no fad diets, no trainers,&#8221; Shah said in a&#160;video chat&#160;this month with First Lady Michelle Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah, who is 26 and works as an analyst in the Special Situations Group at Goldman Sachs, may not be representative of the typical bank employee whos leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fearing that three will be fewer opportunities at banks in the future, many young workers are heading to hedge funds and private-equity firms, or else to the tech industry, where startups are&#160;itching to hire Wall Street ex-pats&#160;who can help manage their finances and operations. Senior bankers are heading to greener pastures, too.

He met with an Unstructured Finance reporter for coffee in Midtown this week to explain his mission: motivating obese people to get into shape without feeling ashamed, ostracized or alone.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Walt Disney Company's (Disney)
new $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
Approximately $17.5 billion of debt was outstanding as of Dec. 29, 2012. A
complete list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. 

The new credit facility will support the company's expanded commercial paper
program and other general corporate purposes. The new revolver will expire on
March 14, 2014 and includes an option to extend the maturity date one year, and
will rank pari passi with all existing debt. The terms and conditions of the new
facility are substantially similar to those contained in the company's existing
revolving credit facilities, including the maintenance of an interest coverage
ratio greater than 3x. 

Disney's committed credit facilities, which now total $6 billion after
considering the new revolver, support the company's commercial paper program and
strong liquidity position. The company's existing two revolving credit
facilities total $2.25 billion each; the first matures in February 2015 and the
second in June 2017. There were no amounts outstanding under these credit
facilities as of Dec. 31, 2012. In addition to the committed credit facilities,
liquidity is derived from $3.2 billion of cash ($320 million of which was held
at the International Theme Parks), and expected free cash flow (FCF) generation.


KEY RATING DRIVERS: 

The ratings and Outlook reflect Disney's ample financial flexibility,
underpinned by strong free cash flow (FCF) generation that Fitch expects to
exceed $3.5 billion beginning fiscal 2013, and total leverage around 1.5x.
Ratings incorporate Fitch's expectations that the company's share repurchases
and M activity will likely exceed FCF generation given strong liquidity and
current credit profile. The company's acquisition of Lucasfilm Limited for $2
billion in cash and $2 billion of equity, along with the contemplated equity
repurchase over the subsequent 24 months, is within Fitch's expectations for the
company's financial policy and within the current ratings. 

The company's pro forma maturity schedule over the next several years
(approximately $1 billion of maturities through calendar year end (CYE) 2013
(excluding CP balance), approximately $1.55 billion of maturities in CY 2014,
and $1.5 billion in CY 2015) will be easily manageable with FCF and access to
the capital markets. Fitch does not expect debt reduction going forward. 

The ratings incorporate the cyclicality of Disney's businesses, particularly
Parks &amp; Resorts (31% of revenue), Consumer Products (8%), and the advertising
portion of Broadcast and Cable Networks (18%). These businesses have exhibited a
degree of resiliency in the recent sluggish macroeconomic backdrop but remain at
risk in the event of a more severe economic downturn. Should macroeconomic
volatility return, Fitch expects these cyclical businesses to be under renewed
pressure but that the company's credit and financial profile will likely remain
within current ratings. The ratings incorporate Fitch's expectation that the
Studio Entertainment business, similar to that of its peers, will remain
volatile and low margin, given the hit-driven nature. The decline of DVD sales,
which is the window in which many films become profitable, is becoming less of a
concern amid the growth of higher-margin digital distribution, and should be
accommodated within current ratings. 

Total debt at Dec. 29, 2012 was $17.5 billion and consisted of: 

--$3 billion of CP; 

--$12.3 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from December
2013-2093; 

--$269 million of debt related to Hong Kong Disneyland (Disneyland Paris debt is
no longer outstanding after Disney refinanced it with intercompany debt in
September 2012), which is non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch
consolidates under the assumption that the company would back the loan payments;


--Approximately $1.3 billion of foreign currency-denominated debt, including
approximately $300 million of debt assumed in the February 2012 acquisition of
UTV, which was refinanced in September 2012. 

--$524 million of other debt. 

Fitch notes the company's pension was 70% funded at Sept. 29, 2012 (the last
reported date). While annual pension funding obligations of several hundred
million dollars should continue over the next few years, they will be more than
covered by FCF. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Positive: Upward momentum to the ratings is unlikely over the intermediate term.
However, a compelling rationale for, and an explicit public commitment to more
conservative leverage thresholds could result in upgrade consideration. 

Negative: Rating pressure is less likely to be driven by operating performance
than by discretionary actions (debt-funded acquisitions) on the part of
management. 

Fitch currently rates Disney as follows: 

The Walt Disney Company 

--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'; 

--Short-term IDR 'F1'; 

--Commercial paper 'F1'. 

ABC Inc. 

--IDR 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'. 

Disney Enterprises, Inc. 

--IDR 'A'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A'. 

Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based on the lack of
any material restrictions on movements of cash between the entities) and treats
the unsecured debt of the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the
absence of upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney
Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch
does not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the strong 'A'
category investment-grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of stable financial
policies, and the anticipation that future debt will be issued by Walt Disney
Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing between the ratings if there
appeared to be heightened risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment
grade (where Disney Enterprises' enhanced recovery prospects would be more
relevant). 

Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, March 21 (Reuters) - Shares of top Mexican
broadcaster Televisa fell on Thursday ahead of an expected vote
on a sweeping telecommunications bill that could threaten its
market position, while Carlos Slim's flagship phone company
clawed back ground from a recent fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on Thursday, the lower house of Congress is expected
to vote on the bill, which has been hailed as the biggest
planned shakeup of the closed telecoms industry in decades. If
it is passed, the bill then heads to the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa shares fell 1.7 percent to 64 pesos in
early trading. The stock had risen on Wednesday, helped by
speculation that lawmakers could soften proposed regulations
affecting the company's pay TV business. That is now in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, shares of Slim's America Movil rose as they
continued a recovery from their lowest price in about four
years. The stock was hit by concerns that the bill could
undermine Slim's dominance of Mexico's phone and Internet data
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America Movil shares rose 1.52 percent to 12.01
pesos. The stock has lost about a fifth of its value this year
due to weak earnings and the threat of tougher regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the bill it presented on March 11, the government is
trying to boost competition in the telecoms sector by increasing
foreign investment and giving regulators the power to force
companies with a market share above 50 percent to sell assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slim, the world's richest man, controls about 70 percent of
the Mexican mobile phone market and roughly 80 percent of the
fixed line business through America Movil. Televisa has about 60
percent of the broadcast market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of America Movil have fallen by about 12 percent, and
Televisa stock is down by about 6 percent since March 8, the
last market close before President Enrique Pena Nieto unveiled
the bill.

&lt;p&gt;In ruling for Goldman, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reversed a lower court's 2011 ruling denying the Wall Street bank's motion to compel arbitration in the case of Lisa Parisi, a former managing director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has been closely watched by employers seeking to avoid costly class action lawsuits and instead require individuals to pursue cases alone in private arbitrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see no reason to deviate from the liberal federal policy in favor of arbitration and conclude that the district court erred in denying the motion to compel arbitration," Circuit Judge Barrington Parker wrote for the three-judge panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parisi and two other female former Goldman employees sued the bank in 2010, accusing it of a pattern of discrimination against female managing directors, vice presidents and associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Klein, a lawyer for the women at Outten &amp; Golden, said he disagreed with the decision, but said it would have "limited impact" on the underlying case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parisi had signed an employment agreement that contained an arbitration clause when she was promoted to managing director in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two other plaintiffs, former vice president Christina Chen-Oster and former associate Shanna Orlich, did not sign arbitration agreements and are not affected by the ruling, Klein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parisi may now pursue her claims with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or the American Arbitration Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case followed a series of recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions making it easier for companies to force plaintiffs seeking to pursue class-action litigation to instead go individually into arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's appeal was supported by briefs from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 on Thursday won a U.S. court order allowing it to send a
former employee's gender discrimination claim to arbitration,
rather than being forced to defend against her claims in a class
action lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ruling for Goldman, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in New York reversed a lower court's 2011 ruling denying the
Wall Street bank's motion to compel arbitration in the case of
Lisa Parisi, a former managing director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has been closely watched by employers seeking to
avoid costly class action lawsuits and instead require
individuals to pursue cases alone in private arbitrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see no reason to deviate from the liberal federal policy
in favor of arbitration and conclude that the district court
erred in denying the motion to compel arbitration," Circuit
Judge Barrington Parker wrote for the three-judge panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parisi and two other female former Goldman employees sued
the bank in 2010, accusing it of a pattern of discrimination
against female managing directors, vice presidents and
associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Klein, a lawyer for the women at Outten &amp; Golden, said
he disagreed with the decision, but said it would have "limited
impact" on the underlying case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parisi had signed an employment agreement that contained an
arbitration clause when she was promoted to managing director in
2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two other plaintiffs, former vice president Christina
Chen-Oster and former associate Shanna Orlich, did not sign
arbitration agreements and are not affected by the ruling, Klein
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parisi may now pursue her claims with the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority or the American Arbitration Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case followed a series of recent U.S. Supreme Court
decisions making it easier for companies to force plaintiffs
seeking to pursue class-action litigation to instead go
individually into arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's appeal was supported by briefs from the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and the Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association. Parisi had support from the NAACP Legal
Defense and Education Fund and the National Women's Law Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This whole area is really developing and there is really
little circuit authority on it," Klein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO ENTITLEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parisi was fired in 2008, and Goldman moved to enforce the
arbitration clause in her employment agreement after the women
sued in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis in Manhattan ruled for
Parisi in 2011, and U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand later
upheld that ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing for the 2nd Circuit, Parker said the court agreed
with Goldman that private plaintiffs like Parisi had no
substantive right to sue in court over a pattern or practice of
discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, "there can be no entitlement to the ancillary
class action procedural mechanism," Parker wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Parisi v. Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, No. 11-5229.&lt;/p&gt;

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/96c7js/global_kidney) has announced
the addition of the "Global Kidney Cancer Drugs Market 2012-2016" report to
their offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Kidney Cancer Drugs market to grow at a
CAGR of 13.4 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors
contributing to this market growth is the growing demand in developing
economies. The Global Kidney Cancer Drugs market has also been witnessing an
increase in R activities. However, over-dependence of the market on the US
could pose a challenge to the growth of this market. 

This report has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis of the market
with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the Americas, and the EMEA
and APAC regions; it covers the Global Kidney Cancer Drugs market landscape and
its growth prospects in the coming years. The report also includes a discussion
of the key vendors operating in this market. 

Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Healthcare team said:
''The vendors in this market are investing heavily in R to develop kidney
cancer drugs from biological sources because this approach can increase the
efficacy of the drugs. Moreover, vendors are formulating effective injection
solutions that can help retain the efficacy of the drug molecule for a longer
period. For instance, Pfizer Inc. is increasingly focusing on enhancing the
efficacy of its kidney cancer drug Sutent. Moreover, vendors are increasing
their investment in the R of drugs that can be used for the treatment of more
than one type of cancer.'' 

According to the report, the US government has increased expenditure on
healthcare because of the prevalence of several diseases, which are largely due
to the changing lifestyles of individuals, environmental health hazards, and
genetic disorders. As a result, the use of therapeutic drugs for the treatment
of cancer has increased. Healthcare spending in the US has increased
significantly. Thus, the opportunity for revenue generation has increased, which
acts as a driver of the Kidney Cancer Drugs market in the US. Moreover, this
increase in healthcare expenditure is expected to increase the quality of
treatments as well as the number of R and D projects. This is one of the major
drivers contributing to the growth of the Global Kidney Cancer Drugs market. 

Further, the report states that the delay in diagnosing cancer is one of the
major challenges in the Global Kidney Cancer Drugs market.

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/f3whvb/global_mobile) has announced
the addition of the "Global Mobile Collaboration Market 2012-2016" report to
their offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Mobile Collaboration market to grow at
a CAGR of 11.95 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors
contributing to this market growth is the improved productivity of employees.
The Global Mobile Collaboration market has also been witnessing the easy
availability of cloud solutions. However, the increasing concern over data
security could pose a challenge to the growth of this market. 

This report has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs
from industry experts. The report covers the Americas, and the EMEA and APAC
regions; it covers the Global Mobile Collaboration market landscape and its
growth prospects in the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of
the key vendors operating in this market. 

Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Telecom team said: ''In
the present scenario, the mobile network is expanding significantly. As 3G and
4G networks undergo expansion, mobile collaboration will help service providers
to provide higher bandwidth. This will enhance the quality of communication
services and stimulate data transmission via mobile collaboration. Moreover, as
the mobile network grows, the use of mobile devices will increase and
connectivity will improve. This will lead to an increase in the acceptance of
mobile collaboration among end-users. Hence, the Global Mobile Collaboration
market is expected to grow significantly during the forecast period.'' 

According to the report, the need for easy and convenient access is one of the
major drivers in the Global Mobile Collaboration market. The rapid expansion of
the business environment is leading to an increase in the need for mobility,
which is in turn increasing the demand for easier and more convenient
communication mediums. The various services provided by mobile collaboration
providers such as instant messages, e-mails, and video conferencing on mobile
devices act as convenient communication mediums, increasing the operational
efficiencies of various organizations. 

Further, the report states that the uncertainty over return on investment is one
of the major challenges in the Global Mobile Collaboration market.

&lt;p&gt;* More refiners back in action after maintenance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Demand still falling sharply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Distillates fare better due to lower stocks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 21 (Reuters) - European oil refining margins
are likely to stay depressed this year after retreating in the
last month due to an increase in excess capacity, Goldman Sachs
said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said that gasoline cracks declined by $12.44 per
barrel, or 67 percent, from February highs by March 13, but have
rebounded $3.67 per barrel since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Goldman, around 530,000 barrels per day (bpd)
of refining capacity has been shut down on average each year
over the past three years, but that it expects a small cut in
refining capacity in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consequently, while European refining capacity has
stabilized since the beginning of the year, demand continues to
fall sharply, and as a result we expect that the wedge between
European refining capacity and European product demand will open
going forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further darkenning the outlook the report said that the
usual gasoline exports to the United States were unlikely to
support prices for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Higher exports are unlikely to sustainably help European
refiners as they suffer from much higher costs compared to their
U.S. peers," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European gasoline prices remain lower than the U.S.
benchmark RBOB price, leaving arbitrage profitable even after a
spike in U.S. ethanol blending credits, or RINs (Renewable
Identification Numbers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. refiners and blenders are required to blend ethanol
into gasoline. But an increase in required blending quotas and a
drop in gasoline demand have led to a spectacular rally in the
value of the RINs since the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a marginal cost of around 3 cents per gallon at the end
of last year, RINs prices rose to more than $1 a gallon earlier
this month, becoming a major drag on RBOB prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refiners will need to cut runs in order to prevent a glut in
stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"European refiners will need to reduce their output in order
to prevent product inventories from building, which would likely
create continued downward pressure on European product margins
over the medium term," the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman added that margins for distillates would be more
robust than those for gasoline, in part because of lower
stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this has been driven not only by distillate
inventory levels being even lower than those of motor gasoline
currently, but also by the expectation that this relative
tightness will persist going forward," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said that distillate demand has declined more slowly than
other products, down only 2.3 percent year-on-year in 2012,
compared to a 6.9 percent decline in gasoline demand, and that
the trend has contunued in January and February this year.&lt;/p&gt;

LONDON--(Business Wire)--
SharetheMatch today announces a deal with Latin America`s largest broadcaster,
Televisa, that will see the football-based social network launch in Mexico. 

Reaching over 90 million football fans from Televisa`s existing audience, the
global social network will be re-branded Vivafut for Mexico and will provide
supporters with a dedicated platform to come together and discuss the beautiful
game, wherever they are, via mobile, computer or smart TV. 

SharetheMatch enables fans to upload predictions, comments, photos and videos to
create live `fanstreams`, which can be shared with supporters all over the
world. In addition, there are live match updates with news of goals, cards and
substitutions as they happen. Users can also collect virtual badges and compete
to become their team`s Number 1 Fan. 

The latest version of SharetheMatch is free to download for iPhone and android
devices and covers every major professional football league in the world and is
translated into 12 languages. The breadth of coverage and the new deal with
Televisa makes SharetheMatch the most global football social media app
available. 

Televisa is a $15billion company and the world`s largest Spanish-language
broadcaster. Their coverage includes the exclusive rights to show more than 150
live games from Mexico`s Liga MX and Mexico National team. The deal brokered
gives SharetheMatch a three-year exclusive partnership for the territory. 

Commenting on the deal, Business Development Director Dominic Preston said: "Our
dream has always been to build the largest social network for football in the
world and this partnership with Televisa is a huge step towards realising that.
Mexico is home to some of the most passionate soccer fans on the planet and we
are excited to be channeling that passion with SharetheMatch/Vivafut."

Announcing the deal, Televisa chairman Emilio Azcarraga said: "We have achieved
the development of four of the most ten visited Facebook pages in M&#233;xico, and
now we are turning on a Football Social Network partnering with SharetheMatch,
from England." 

SharetheMatch is a VC-backed company and secured funding from London-based
private equity firm Talis Capital in June 2012. Talis Capital director and
co-founder Matus Maar said: "We are delighted to have been able to raise the
funding to support the development of SharetheMatch. The global potential of the
app was immediately obvious to us and we are pleased that Televisa have seen
that too."

&lt;p&gt;  ANDOVER, MA, Mar 21 (Marketwire) -- 
RAID Incorporated, an end-to-end customized solutions provider in HPC,
Big Data and Virtualized Environments, announced today the launch of
Scalable High Throughput NAS Solutions using Fusion-IO(TM) PCIe Based
Flash Storage and IBM(TM) GPFS(TM).

    Network attached storage solutions provide simplicity, manageability and
access. Until now, they have lacked scalability, high performance and
cost-effective fault tolerance, which have kept them from serving a role
beyond the departmental level. Companies have experimented to compensate
for this by adding NAS appliances, which leads to data fragmentation,
management nightmares, hot spots and poor performance.

    The response to these challenges is an IBM offering based on proven
clustered file-serving technology CNFS in the form of the General
Parallel File System (GPFS). GPFS is a high performance, shared-disk
clustered file system developed by IBM. GPFS distinguishes itself from
other cluster file systems by providing concurrent high-speed file access
to applications running on multiple nodes. In addition to providing file
system storage capabilities, GPFS provides tools for management and
administration of the GPFS cluster and allows for shared access to file
systems from remote GPFS clusters. It also supports information
life-cycle management features to simplify data management and enhance
administrative control.(1)

    Raid Inc.'s solution using IBM's GPFS and Fusion-IO PCIe SSD has several
key benefits:


--  High availability and resiliency
--  High performance and scalability
--  Economical entry and incremental growth
--  Compatibility with NFS clients

    

For more information on Scalable High Throughput NAS Solutions,
please visit our website or contact Bob Picardi, CEO RAID Inc.
(800-330-7335).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - Smithfield Foods Inc,
the largest U.S. hog producer, has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 to help it weigh options after a key shareholder urged
the company to break up, according to four people familiar with
the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continental Grain, an agribusiness company which controls
about 6 percent of Smithfield, said in a letter earlier this
month that Smithfield should hire an independent bank to help it
analyze options including splitting into three companies,
instituting a cash dividend or bringing on new board members and
executives with new skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smithfield, which has a market capitalization of roughly
$3.6 billion, said at the time that it would review the letter
in consultation with financial and legal advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The
sources asked not to be named because the matter is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continental Grain has called on Smithfield to split into
three businesses: selling pork and packaged meats, hog
production and international operations. Packaged meats is the
largest business segment, generating sales of $6 billion in
fiscal year 2012, or roughly 38 percent of the company's annual
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have said a break up of the company would improve
its trading multiple by freeing the high-margin packaged food
business from the capital-intensive hog production unit which is
also very volatile due to fluctuating feed costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Smithfield is valued at around 6 times earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), it may be
worth 6.9 times if the hog business is spun off, according to
Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow. The company's shares closed
Friday at $26.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continental Grain, formed in Belgium in 1813 as a grain
trading firm, is now a large agribusiness investing firm. It
became a major shareholder in Smithfield in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm's chief, Paul Fribourg, quit Smithfield's board in
September 2009 over a disagreement with the company's plan at
the time to issue $250 million of common stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear what the investment firm's next steps are,
but a source familiar with the way Continental does business,
predicted that the firm would be prepared to recommend its own
slate of new directors if necessary. Continental Grain declined
to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

million after the company lost $6.2 billion on derivatives in
the so-called "London Whale" trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board said the "strength and independence" of its
oversight had been demonstrated by actions the company took
after the trading debacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has since overhauled its risk controls and
replaced some of its top executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's total compensation, as presented according to the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission format, was $18.7
million in 2012, down from $23.1 million in 2011. Company and
SEC pay counts can differ with the timing of incentive
compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group analyst Carlos Macedo and his team cut the
price target on shares in clearinghouse Cetip SA Mercados

reflect a reduction in earnings estimates for the coming two
years. Macedo maintained a "buy" recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts said that early volumes for registration and

Cetip, despite an expected increase in activity in that segment

volumes have been weaker, there is limited evidence of market
share loss as of yet," he wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 11 times estimates earnings before interest, tax,

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/dh47dg/healthcare) has announced the
addition of Wintergreen Research, Inc's new report "Healthcare Decision Support
and IBM Watson: Market Shares, Strategies, and Forecasts, Worldwide, 2013 to
2019" to their offering. 

Worldwide healthcare cognitive computing markets are poised to achieve
continuing growth as the healthcare delivery system responds to new products.
Growth is achieved in response to changing technology, better analytics, and new
information systems that leverage natural language, and changing market
conditions. 

Healthcare decision support markets consist of traditional market participants
led by McKesson and Watson from IBM. IBM Watson offers structured and
unstructured data in combination. This represents a major breakthrough in what
kind of decision support can be offered. 

IBM Watson can provide a far more differentiated testing assessment. Watson
knows what tests are relevant to further characterize a particular patient
condition and what tests are not. It is a great help to physicians to have an
assistant that is able to have read the latest journal articles and is loaded
with medical information to recommend what tests may be relevant in a particular
situation. Wrong tests, tests that are not useful in a particular situation,
account for 30% of the costs of healthcare delivery in the US. This is a lot. To
have a new system available that addresses these issues is great. 

IBM Watson is initiating a new era of cognitive computing that extends the
tabulator and application program intensive enabling new market opportunities
based on cognitive performance. Watson is so powerful and so new that the uses
for it are not even defined yet. The tools and methods released by natural
language computing systems are remarkable. They are very exciting. 

Watson is comprised of a core engine. This engine is more powerful than anything
that has been designed by humans before. To the credit of IBM, the first purpose
that Watson has been put to is to improve healthcare delivery. To those analysts
following Watson, there is tremendous promise in the offing. 

IBM concentrates on building end to end systems that are able to adapt of market
changes. While this may make the IBM product set seem overly heavy in the short
run, in the long run, this is of enormous value to clients as proved by the
company market leading position in innovation software.

Deepwater projects are latest investment in strategic region
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) announced that its subsidiary Chevron Overseas
(Congo) Limited will proceed with the joint development of the Moho Bilondo
"Phase 1 bis" and Moho Nord projects as the company's latest deepwater
developments offshore the Republic of the Congo. 

"Moho Nord is among a strong queue of major capital projects that will provide
Chevron with future growth," said George Kirkland, vice chairman, Chevron
Corporation. "With the project, we will enhance our position in this prolific
deepwater basin." 

Situated approximately 46 miles (75 kilometers) offshore southwest of
Pointe-Noire in water depths ranging from 1,500 to 4,000 feet (450-1,200
meters), the Moho-Nord joint development is the largest-ever oil and gas project
in the Republic of the Congo. The Moho Bilondo "Phase 1 bis" project includes
wells tied back to an existing floating production unit with a processing
capacity of 40,000 barrels of oil per day. Production in the permit area began
in 2008 with the Moho Bilondo 1E development. The Moho Nord project involves a
tension leg platform, a floating production unit with a processing capacity of
100,000 barrels of oil per day, and a new 50-mile (80 kilometer) pipeline to the
onshore Djeno terminal. 

The project is expected to cost a total of $10 billion and achieve first oil
from the Moho Bilondo "Phase 1 bis" project in 2015 and first oil from the Moho
Nord project in 2016. The joint development will produce 140,000 barrels per day
of crude oil at its peak production in 2017. 

"We are proud to partner with the Republic of the Congo to develop the nation`s
offshore resource potential," said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and
Latin America Exploration and Production Company. "Moho Nord is further
indication of our commitment to West Africa where Chevron has made sizable
investments." 

Chevron Overseas (Congo) Limited has a 31.5 percent working interest along with
Total E Congo (53.5 percent interest and Operator) and the National Oil
Company, Soci&#233;t&#233; Nationale des P&#233;troles du Congo (15 percent). 

Chevron is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is driven by
the ingenuity and commitment of its employees and their application of the most
innovative technologies in the world. Chevron is involved in virtually every
facet of the energy industry. The company explores for, produces and transports
crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels
and other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;
generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy efficiency
solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future, including biofuels.
Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is

"intends," "plans," "targets," "forecasts," "projects," "believes," "seeks,"
"schedules," "estimates," "budgets," "outlook," "will supply," "will be

oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product
substitutes; technological developments; the results of operations and financial
condition of equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company's
joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development
activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from
existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential
delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the
potential disruption or interruption of the company's net production or
manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation networks due to war,
accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather or crude oil
production quotas that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments
under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant
investment or product changes under existing or future environmental statutes,
regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from pending or
future litigation; the company's future acquisition or disposition of assets and
gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government-mandated
sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, industry-specific taxes, changes in

under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting
bodies; and the factors set forth under the heading "Risk Factors" on pages 29
through 31 of the company's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, such
statements could be affected by general domestic and international economic and
political conditions. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in
this press release could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking
statements.

Leader in Rent-to-Own Industry Realizes Significant Results Across 4,000 Retail
Locations
SOMERS, N.Y. &amp; SAN MATEO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Coupa Software today announced that Rent-A-Center, Inc.
(NASDAQ: RCII), the nation`s largest rent-to-own operator, has achieved millions
in savings by optimizing and centralizing its purchasing process in the cloud.

With approximately 4,000 locations and 20,000 employees, Rent-A-Center was
challenged with a highly de-centralized and manual purchasing process with low
employee adoption. In addition, the onboarding of suppliers was extremely
time-consuming and complicated. As a result, the company was not efficient at
consolidating purchasing to influence pricing or optimizing its contract,
invoicing and supplier management processes. 

Tasked with revamping the entire procurement process for greater efficiency and
savings, Rent-A-Center relied on the combined power of procurement solutions
offered by IBM Smarter Commerce and Coupa to streamline its spending. 

As a result, between 2010 and 2012, the $3 billion rent-to-own retailer
increased visibility into spending by automating how it sources - or finds and
secures materials - for 90 categories of indirect spend, such as store office
supplies. From 2011 to 2012, the company consolidated its supply base, reducing
it by 10 percent, and decreased the number of invoices by 5 percent.
Rent-A-Center is currently saving, on average, 10 percent on the categories it
has automated. 

Mike Wilding, senior vice president of accounting, global controller and CPO for
Rent-A-Center, commented on the company`s success in transforming its
procurement processes, "The IBM and Coupa integration has been fundamental in
driving our positive results as we revamped our procurement efforts. A major
part of our transformation focused on increasing productivity by automating
manual processes like invoicing and contracts. We are very pleased with our
savings to date, and we are on track to achieve our savings targets over the
next few years." 

Using IBM Emptoris capabilities delivered via a software-as-a-service (SaaS)
model, Rent-A-Center has quickly reduced sourcing costs and cycle times and
increased accounts payable productivity. By subscribing to a SaaS model, the
company has been able to accelerate its cost savings and return on investment,
and easily increase capacity for large sourcing events and peaks in activity. 

The IBM Emptoris procurement suite is part of IBM`s Smarter Commerce initiative,
which is designed to help companies manage their supply and demand processes
through intelligent automation. The solutions, which can be deployed either on
premise or via SaaS or cloud delivery, are components of IBM`s growing
SmartCloud portfolio of more than 70 SaaS and Business Process-as-a-Service
(BPaaS) solutions. 

Through Coupa`s intuitive application, Rent-A-Center immediately captures
spending without having to install software at each of its thousands of
locations. The consumer-like online experience helps ensure broad adoption by
letting employees easily enter spending into the system. This provides
management with clearer visibility and control over spending across all its
locations. 

"IBM and Coupa have helped Rent-A-Center streamline and control supplier
management and reporting in one central solution," said Pat Quirk, vice
president, IBM procurement solutions. "Rent-A-Center is an example of how SaaS
can speed delivery of services and eliminate technical complexity found with
other solutions." 

"Our No. 1 focus is customer success," said Rob Bernshteyn, CEO of Coupa. "The
results that Rent-A-Center achieved are concrete examples of what can be done
when there is a common vision between our customers, our partners and ourselves.
Rent-A-Center reached all the goals we collectively hoped for - better
visibility into indirect spend, substantial cost savings and increased business
efficiencies. We look forward to seeing more customers unlock the value of spend
optimization with IBM and Coupa." 

Rent-A-Center is expanding into other countries and has opened 90 new stores in
Mexico between 2010 and 2012. The company uses Coupa and IBM`s procurement
software for local supplier sourcing and procurement in Mexico as well, which
helps minimize costs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sarah N. Lynch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - The top U.S securities
regulator is urging international market regulators to find a
compromise as they struggle to agree on how to apply new rules
for cross-border over-the-counter derivatives trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking via video conference at the Australian Securities
and Investment Commission's annual forum on Sunday, SEC Chairman
Elisse Walter pressed for a regime that would largely rely on
foreign regulation for cross-border trades, and would only apply
U.S. rules in cases where no comparable regulations existed. A
text of her remarks was released by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In my view, that happy medium has its foundation in an
approach that recognizes comparable foreign regulation to the
maximum extent possible, consistent with domestic policy goals,"
Walter said in prepared remarks, which were delivered on Monday
morning Australia time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This approach would permit a market participant to comply
with a set of domestic requirements in a particular arena -
capital or risk management, say - by complying with the
comparable foreign regulation," Walter said. "At the same time,
the domestic regulator would continue to have the ability to
apply certain key policy requirements of local law when foreign
law does not impose comparable requirements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter's comments on Monday strike a different tone than
those of Gary Gensler, her counterpart who heads the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two agencies won broad new powers to police the
over-the-counter market in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street
reform law, which imposes capital and margin charges on riskier
trades and forces many swaps to be traded on regulated platforms
and centrally cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFTC, which overseas the lion's share of the roughly
$650 trillion market, has been ahead of the SEC on many of its
rules. But the CFTC's aggressive proposal for how to apply U.S.
derivatives rules abroad has provoked strong criticism from
foreign regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFTC's proposal would force foreign banks to stick to
the same rules as their U.S. peers when dealing with a U.S.
person, which includes companies, if their swap trading volume
exceeds $8 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign regulators have said this could create duplicative
regulations, and have urged U.S. regulators to embrace a
framework that would largely allow banks to rely on the rules
imposed in each country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CFTC Chairman Gensler has said his agency would accept
substituted compliance, but to a lesser degree than what Walter
proposed on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the CFTC, the SEC is still working on a roughly
1,000-page draft for how it will apply its derivatives rules on
cross-border transactions. The agency is still awaiting the
confirmation of its next chairman, Mary Jo White, and is
currently split between two Democrats and two Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what view White will bring to the topic once
she takes the helm at the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the latest remarks, Walter said she hopes the U.S.
will avoid the two most extreme options -- either by being
overly broad in applying the rules and creating "overlap and
conflict," or by relying on foreign regulation so much that it
could lead to regulatory shopping by the banks and create a
"race to the bottom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Insistence on either extreme represents in my view a
resistance to reasonable and desirable cooperation among
regulators," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that U.S. rules that could potentially apply to
cross-border transactions included the SEC's public transparency
requirements, or business conduct standards designed to protect
less sophisticated swap investors like municipalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* U.S. coal miner squaring off with British activist fund&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Walter highlights insider trading case against nominee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Fund stands by its nominees, criticizes management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Allison Martell and Julie Gordon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 25 (Reuters) - Walter Energy Inc on Monday
struck back against the British hedge fund that wants to replace
half its board and said its campaign was a "hit and run"
designed to turn a quick profit by driving up Walter's share
price - something the fund denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. coal miner highlighted what it said were "serious
omissions" in Audley Capital Advisors LLP's proxy statement,
including an insider trading case against one of the fund's
nominees. It questioned the accuracy of another candidate's
biography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Audley is focused on short term gains at the expense of
other shareholders," said Walter in a letter to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was unable to reach either of the two nominees for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julian Treger, managing partner of Audley Capital, told
Reuters he stands by his nominees, and is not a short-term
investor: "We're not permanent shareholders...but we are
certainly, very much, medium-term holders," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treger said Audley, which now controls less than one percent
of Walter, would likely add to its investment if it wins the
proxy battle. Walter's annual meeting is set for April 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Walter, which produces metallurgical and some
thermal coal in Canada, the United States and the United
Kingdom, have fallen more than 50 percent in the last year, hurt
in part by low prices for metallurgical coal, which is used to
make steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares were down almost 5 percent on Monday at $28.01.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audley criticizes Walter for missing its own forecasts,
churning through chief executives and taking on too much debt at
punishing interest rates. In November, Walter priced $500
million in senior notes at 9.875 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter said it was focused on reducing debt levels, cutting
costs and "identifying alternatives for underperforming assets."
On Friday the company said it would idle a high-cost mine in
western Canada, and its shares rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INSIDER TRADING CASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter also criticized Audley for not disclosing a tipping
and insider trading case against one of its nominees, former
Grande Cache Coal Chief Executive Robert Stan, in its proxy
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a notice of hearing dated Dec. 5, 2011, the Alberta
Securities Commission accused Stan of sharing material
information with his wife, who then sold securities of Grande
Cache. It said he had also exercised options to buy securities
of Grande Cache during the same period. On the regulator's
website, the case is listed as "decision on merits pending".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treger said he does not think the issue is material and
Stan's experience building Grande Cache Coal, which agreed to a
C$1 billion ($970 million) takeover by two Asian traders in
October 2011, would be valuable to Walter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no substance to these allegations. He is convinced
that he will be entirely exonerated," said Treger. "We should
presume innocence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stan could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audley was a major shareholder in Western Coal when Walter
acquired the Canadian miner. After the combined company's CEO
resigned abruptly, Audley urged it to look for an acquirer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Walter, Treger sent a letter to the board on
July 17, 2011, went public on July 18, and sold about one third
of his stake between July 18 and July 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was part of a broader pattern of selling our shares,
because we were concerned about the direction the company was
taking, and in retrospect, rightly so," said Treger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AUDLEY FILES PROXY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy also questioned an element of Audley's
biography of nominee Edward Scholtz, noting that Audley's proxy
statement lists him as a director of Talon Metals Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scholtz, former chief executive of Talon, is not listed as a
director on the company's website, and a Talon management
information circular gives Feb. 8, 2012, as the date of his
departure from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter also disputed Audley's assertion that Scholtz was
chief operating officer of CIC Energy Corp from 2008 to 2012,
saying that role was held by someone else in 2007 through 2010.
CIC's annual disclosures show Tore Horvei was chief operating
officer from January 2007 to at least the end of February 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treger said he had not yet spoken to Scholtz, and could not
comment on the specific allegations. Scholtz could also not
immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audley said on Monday it had filed its definitive proxy
materials, and urged investors to vote for its nominees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy's major shareholders include J.P. Morgan Asset
Management, with a 6.9 percent stake as of Dec. 31, according to
Thomson Reuters data, and Harris Associates LP, with a 5.0
percent stake as of Dec. 31. The company's top 10 investors own
just over 40 percent of its outstanding shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

-- Delo 400 SAE 10W-30 Delivers Fuel Economy Savings in DD15 Engine --
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Today, Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, released a case
study highlighting the performance of Delo 400 LE SAE 10W-30 formulated with
ISOSYN Technology and Delo Extended Life Coolant (ELC) at R.E. West
Transportation. By using Delo products, R.E. West was able to extend service
intervals and improve fuel economy, resulting in significant bottom-line cost
savings for the company. 

R.E. West is a nationally recognized contract and dedicated truckload carrier
with a fleet of 120 trucks and 300 trailers. The company conducted a test using
Chevron`s lower-viscosity Delo 400 LE SAE 10W-30 engine oil in an effort to
evaluate the feasibility of switching its fleet to the fuel economy-focused
product, while also extending drain intervals. After comparing data, R.E. West
found the trucks running Delo 400 LE SAE 10W-30 delivered noticeable fuel
economy improvements versus similar trucks using SAE 15W-40 oil. Translated
across the entire fleet, these reductions in fuel consumption could represent
significant savings. 

Beyond improvements in fuel economy, R.E. West was also able to achieve 70,000
mile oil drain intervals using the Delo 400 SAE 10W-30 engine oils, creating
additional savings opportunities. 

Fuel Economy and Durability

After one of the Detroit Diesel DD15 engine used in the testing was torn down at
500,000 miles of service, R.E. West found its components to be in excellent
condition with minimal wear, thanks to the use of Delo 400 LE SAE 10W-30 and
Delo Extended Life Coolant. In addition to improved fuel economy and reduced
maintenance costs, the extended durability can help protect resale value - an
important consideration for any transportation business.

&lt;p&gt;March 25 (Reuters) - U.S. coal miner Walter Energy Inc
 struck back on Monday against the British hedge fund
that says it can improve the miner's performance by replacing
half of its board, citing "serious omissions" in Audley Capital
Advisors LLP's proxy statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to shareholders, Walter Energy said the hedge
fund's statement contains omissions regarding the background of
its nominees, and noted that one of Audley's candidates has been
implicated in an insider trading case. It said also that Audley
controls well under 1 percent of its shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audley said in February that it would nominate five
candidates for election to the coal miner's board, arguing that
poor management, not a tough market, has been behind the
company's poor financial results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Monday's letter, signed by Walter Energy Chairman Michael
Tokarz and Chief Executive Walt Scheller, the company said it
had reviewed Audley's nominees and that they lack the leadership
experience needed to be board members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said Audley failed to disclose that one of
its nominees, Robert Stan, is currently defending himself
against charges of insider trading and tipping when he was chief
executive of Grande Cache Coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a notice of hearing dated Dec. 5, 2011, the Alberta
Securities Commission accused Stan of sharing material
information with his wife, who then sold securities of Grande
Cache. It said he had also exercised options to buy securities
of Grande Cache during the same period. On the regulator's
website, the case is listed as "decision on merits pending".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy, which has operations in Western Canada, the
United States and the United Kingdom, mainly produces
metallurgical coal, used to make steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AUDLEY FILES PROXY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy also questioned Audley's representation of the
leadership roles held by nominee Edward Scholtz, noting that
Audley's proxy statement lists him as a current director of
Talon Metals Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scholtz, former chief executive of Talon, is not listed as a
director on the company's website, and a Talon management
information circular lists Feb. 8, 2012, as the date of his
departure from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter also disputed Audley's assertion that Scholtz was
chief operating officer of CIC Energy Corp from 2008 to 2012,
saying that role was held by someone else in 2007 through 2010.
CIC's annual disclosures show that Tore Horvei was chief
operating officer from January 2007 to at least the end of
February 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stan and Scholtz could not immediately be reached to comment
on the Walter Energy statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately on Monday, Audley said it had filed definitive
proxy materials, and urged shareholders to vote for its slate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We firmly believe that the inherent value in Walter Energy
is not reflected by the current share price, and remain
confident that our five highly qualified and experienced board
nominees possess the mining and public company experience
necessary to unlock the underlying near- and long-term value at
the company," Julian Treger, managing director of Audley
Capital, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy's major shareholders include J.P. Morgan Asset
Management, with a 6.9 percent stake as of Dec. 31, according to
Thomson Reuters data, and Harris Associates LP, with a 5.0
percent stake as of Dec. 31. The company's top 10 investors own
just over 40 percent of its outstanding shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The miner said it is working to reduce its debt and improve
liquidity, and that it is bringing down its cost of production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the coal producer fell 4.8 percent to $28.04 on
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down more
than 22 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - The private equity owners of
Spanish metal packaging firm Mivisa look set to pay
themselves a 185 million euro ($240.44 million) dividend just
two years after buying the company, bankers said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone and N+1 Private Equity bought Mivisa in 2011 for
$1.3 billion backed with 667.5 million euros of debt, according
to Thomson Reuters LPC data. They are now due to conduct a
dividend recapitalisation - a process that sees more debt added
to the existing borrowings and a dividend taken from it - after
overcoming opposition from lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal was initially opposed by a number of lenders
unhappy at the prospect of Blackstone and N+1 increasing
Mivisa's debt pile and taking money out of a Spanish business
during difficult market conditions. However they have since come
around as it looked unlikely that they would be able to get a
third of lenders to oppose the proposal - the level required to
block the deal, bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackstone and N+1, however, had to adjust the deal to make
it more palatable to lenders, including agreeing to maintain
ratings on the privately owned Mivisa and abolishing a plan to
shift its headquarters to Murcia from Barcelona, bankers added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays and Deutsche Bank are advising
on the deal and lenders have to submit final approvals by 1700
GMT on Monday when the deal will complete, bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Blackstone and N+1 will have a new term loan in
place totalling 145 million euros. They will use the new loan
and 40 million euros from Mivisa's balance sheet to pay
themselves a dividend, bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackstone and N+1 were not immediately available to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new 145 million euro term loan will pay an interest
margin of 450 basis points over Euribor with a 1.5 percent
Euribor floor and a 99.5 Original Issue Discount, bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dividend will take Mivisa's leverage to five times its
approximate 140 million euro EBITDA from a current level of
around 3.8 times, bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lenders always want a company's leverage to be lower and
pricing to be higher but this deal will go through because
Mivisa is a strong credit that deleverages well," one of the
bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1972, Mivisa is the third-largest European
manufacturer of metal packaging for the food canning industry,
according to its website. It has six factories in Spain and
three abroad.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 25 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said it struck oil
at a deepwater well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico just 12 miles (19
km) from another discovery announced last week by partners
Anadarko Petroleum Corp and ConocoPhillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said on Monday the Walker Ridge Block 98 well in the
Coronado prospect encountered more than 400 feet of net pay - or
the thickness of an oil reservoir that can produce hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron holds a 40 percent working interest in the prospect
and is the operator of the Coronado discovery well. The well is
located about 190 miles off the Louisiana coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other owners of Coronado are ConocoPhillips with 35 percent,
a unit of Anadarko with 15 percent and Venari Offshore LLC with
10 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday, Anadarko announced its discovery of a large
amount of oil at the Shenandoah-2 well nearby. Anadarko and
Conoco each hold 30 percent of that well, while Cobalt
International Energy LP has 20 percent and Marathon Oil
Corp and privately held Venari both hold 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Between the Coronado discovery, the potentially giant
Shenandoah discovery, and our recent high bids on remaining open
blocks in the Shenandoah/Coronado mini-basin, Venari is firmly
positioned for significant growth in a future production hub in
the Gulf," Venari Chief Executive Brian Reinsborough said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Conoco and Chevron shares were trading lower in Monday
morning trading, Anadarko shares were 1 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo analyst David Tameron noted that Anadarko had a
15 percent interest in the Yucatan prospect - also in the
Shenandoah mini-basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Aref Mohammed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BASRA, Iraq, March 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil has
allocated $1.65 billion to develop Iraq's West Qurna 1 oilfield
in 2013, up from $1.6 billion last year, the head of the joint
management committee for the field said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Iraqi oil ministry official said the budget indicated
Exxon's commitment to developing the southern field in 2013,
which it offered to sell out of last year after riling Baghdad
by signing six deals with the autonomous Kurdistan region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad rejects contracts granted by the northern enclave as
illegal and told Exxon it had to choose between the $50 billion
West Qurna-1 project and its Kurdish assets, offering the U.S.
major sweeter terms in a bid to keep in the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Under the work programme approved for 2013 by the oil
ministry, Exxon has set $1.65 billion to develop West Qurna 1,"
Madhi Abdul Razzaq of the management committee told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with Iraq's service contract terms, oil companies
must submit a work plan including development budget to the oil
ministry before the start of the year for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Exxon were not interested to keep working in West Qurna
then it will not spend a huge investment of $1.65 billion to
keep developing the field," the oil ministry official said on
condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to
the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia's Chief Economic Minister said earlier this month
the country's state-owned oil and gas firm Pertamina 
was in talks to buy 10-20 percent of Exxon stake in West
Qurna-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources also said Exxon was considering selling part of its
60 percent stake in the field to PetroChina 
, the listed arm of China National Petroleum Corp
(CNPC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production from West Qurna phase 1 is expected to reach
540,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) in mid-2013 and 600,000 bpd
by the end of the year, Abdul Razzaq said. The field is
currently producing 480,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Output from the field is planned to reach 900,000 barrels
per day by 2015," Abdul Razzaq said, attributing the increased
production to 36 newly drilled wells due to come onstream this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon is also pushing ahead with plans to step up
water-injection at the field to help raise extraction rates and
maintain reservoir pressure to overcome declines in production
at the fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have started water-injection operations in early 2012
with a capacity of 100,000 barrels of water per day, and for
this year we will add additional capacity of 25,000 barrels of
water," Razzaq said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy's Saipem SpA was picked up by Exxon to build
a $300 million water-injection project in the field with a
capacity to inject 300,000 barrels of water daily and expected
to be operational in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

Coronado prospect adds to Chevron`s deepwater portfolio in prolific Lower
Tertiary Trend
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) has announced an oil discovery at the Coronado
prospect in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 

The Walker Ridge Block 98 Well No. 1 encountered more than 400 feet (122 m) of
net pay. The well is located approximately 190 miles (308 km) off the Louisiana
coast in 6,127 feet (1,868 m) of water and was drilled to a depth of 31,866 feet
(9,713 m). 

"The Coronado discovery demonstrates how Chevron is achieving its strategy of
superior exploration performance," said George Kirkland, vice chairman, Chevron
Corporation. "The discovery adds to our global portfolio of high-quality
opportunities for future growth." 

"The Coronado discovery continues our string of exploration successes in the
Lower Tertiary Trend, where Chevron is advancing multiple projects," said Gary
Luquette, president, Chevron North America Exploration and Production Company.
"It also highlights the importance of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as a source
of domestic energy for the United States." 

The well results are still being evaluated, and additional work is needed to
determine the extent of the resource. Chevron, with a 40 percent working
interest in the prospect, is the operator of the Coronado discovery well. Other
owners are ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) with 35 percent, a subsidiary of Anadarko
Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: APC) with 15 percent and Venari Offshore LLC with
10 percent. 

Chevron is one of the largest leaseholders in the Gulf of Mexico and is
currently constructing the Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot projects, which are
scheduled to begin production in 2014. The company is also conducting appraisal
activities at its previously announced Buckskin and Moccasin discoveries, also
in the Lower Tertiary Trend. 

Chevron is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company is involved in
virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and lubricants; manufactures and sells petrochemical
products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy
efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future, including
biofuels. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ktk5dm/global_software) has
announced the addition of the "Global Software Testing Services Market in
Telecom Sector 2012-2016" report to their offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Software Testing Services market in the
Telecom sector to grow at a CAGR of 7.67 percent over the period 2012-2016. One
of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the increased
availability of testing applications. The Global Software Testing Services
market in the Telecom sector has also been witnessing a shifting focus toward
cloud-based testing. However, the difficulty of intellectual property protection
could pose a challenge to the growth of this market. 

Commenting on the report, an analyst said: 'Crowdsourcing involves outsourcing a
testing task to a group of people and leveraging their knowledge, awareness, and
access to the technology. The basic concept of crowdsourcing is that it makes
use of the combined intellect of a group of people to complete business-related
tasks that a company would have either carried out in-house or outsourced to a
third-party service provider. This disseminated problem-solving model works for
testing certain software products such as web pages or mobile apps, where a
group of people are invited to test web pages or mobile apps to expose loopholes
and recommend new ideas and concepts. Major IT giants such as Microsoft have
been using crowdsourcing for some time. The advancements in the present
technology have made it possible to enlist numerous non-technical people to
perform complex and innovative tasks at a considerably reduced cost. This trend
is expected to continue during the forecast period.' 

According to the report, the higher return on investment is one of the major
drivers in the Global Software Testing Services Market in the Telecom Sector.
The contracting of software testing services to a third party has proved
beneficial for firms that have already outsourced product development or
software development processes. When it comes to outsourcing a software testing
service, cost saving is not the only major benefit. The return on investment for
an outsourced software testing process saves time by reducing the amount of work
for the client, provides domain expertise at reduced cost, and reduces the
overall maintenance cost. 

Further, the report states that the lack of domain understanding is one of the
major challenges in the Global Software Testing Services Market in the Telecom
Sector.

The key vendors dominating this space are

Accenture plc, Amdocs Ltd., HP Co., and IBM Corp.

The other vendors mentioned in the report are

Tech Mahindra Ltd., Cap Gemini - Sogeti, TCS Ltd., Wipro Ltd., Cognizant
Technology Solutions Corp., and Infosys Ltd. 

Key questions answered in this report:

- What will the market size be in 2016 and what will the growth rate be? 

- What are the key market trends? 

- What is driving this market? 

- What are the challenges to market growth? 

- Who are the key vendors in this market space? 

- What are the market opportunities and threats faced by the key vendors? 

- What are the strengths and weaknesses of each of these key vendors?

Businesses 2012-2016" report to their offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Public Cloud market in Small and
Medium-sized Businesses to grow at a CAGR of 24.6 percent over the period
2012-2016. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the
increasing popularity of SaaS services among SMBs. The Global Public Cloud
market in Small and Medium-sized Businesses has also been witnessing the
increasing adoption of public cloud services among micro-SMBs. However, concerns
regarding data security could pose a challenge to the growth of this market. 

Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Data Center team said:
'Many countries across the globe are witnessing the introduction of
high-bandwidth communication services such as 3G and 4G. With the increased
bandwidth support, advanced applications such as G-talk, Skype, and BB Messenger
are being widely used by end-users. These applications are also supported on
smartphones and tablets, which creates a need to implement high-speed
communication networks. Many end-users are storing their data in the cloud
infrastructure and accessing voice- and video-based applications through the
cloud, which is one of the major trends in the market.' 

According to the report, the reduced investment cost is one of the major drivers
in the Global Public Cloud market in Small and Medium-sized Businesses. The
cloud service providers are providing solutions to small and medium-sized
businesses at a lower cost than that needed for internal provisioning of the
services in order to boost the growth of the market during the forecast period. 

Further, the report states that the latency in data transfer is one of the major
challenges in the Global Public Cloud market in Small and Medium-sized
Businesses.

Urges Stockholders to Sign, Date and Mail the GOLD Proxy Card Today
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Audley Capital Advisors LLP (including certain related funds and investment
vehicles, "Audley Capital") today announced that it recently filed definitive
proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection
with Audley Capital`s five nominees for election to the Board of Directors of
Walter Energy, Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT) ("Walter Energy" or "the Company") at
its upcoming 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April 25, 2013. 

Audley Capital is also sending a letter to Walter Energy stockholders urging
them to vote the GOLD proxy card for Audley Capital`s five highly-qualified and
experienced director nominees who are strong candidates to implement needed
financial and operational initiatives that can create lasting value at the
Company. 

Julian Treger, Managing Partner of Audley Capital, said, "We firmly believe that
the inherent value in Walter Energy is not reflected by the current share price,
and remain confident that our five highly-qualified and experienced Board
nominees possess the mining and public company experience necessary to unlock
the underlying near-and long-term value at the Company. We believe that voting
for the Company`s current director slate will only embolden the Board and
management to continue making strategic, financial and operational decisions
that are harmful to stockholder value. We urge stockholders to send a clear
message to Walter Energy`s Board and management by electing Audley Capital`s
Board candidates, who will work to execute a clear strategic plan to drive
long-term growth and value creation at the Company." 

The full text of the letter follows: 

CHANGE IS NEEDED AT WALTER ENERGY

Please Sign, Date and Mail the GOLD Proxy Card Today

Dear Fellow Walter Energy Stockholder, 

I write on behalf of Audley Capital Advisors LLP and related funds and
investment vehicles (collectively "Audley Capital") which own shares of Walter
Energy, Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT) ("Walter Energy" or "the Company"). On
February 19, 2013, we issued a press release announcing the nomination of five
highly-qualified director nominees for election to Walter Energy`s Board of
Directors at its Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April 25, 2013, in addition
to identifying a few areas that we believe to be of immediate concern with the
purpose of driving long-term growth at the Company. Expanding on that press
release, Audley Capital is now detailing below several proposals to
significantly enhance stockholder value over the next 12 to 24 months. 

Do Not Give the Current Board the Opportunity to Disappoint You Again
Now is the Time to Elect New Skilled and Experienced Directors

Importantly, Audley Capital believes there is substantial value in Walter Energy
that is not reflected by the current share price. Walter Energy has high-quality
metallurgical coal assets in established mining jurisdictions with scope for
significant growth, with a market position that should enable it to generate
substantial free cash flow going forward. 

A Reconstituted Board with Audley Capital`s Five Highly-Qualified and
Experienced
Board Nominees Will Work to Create the Value Stockholders Deserve

Despite Audley Capital`s confidence in the value of the metallurgical coal
assets, we have been dismayed by the way the business has been run in recent
years and the loss of stockholder value. For example, the share price has
underperformed major mining indices, with the share price of Walter Energy
falling 79% since its peak in April 2011 vs. only a 38% fall in the MSCI World
Metals and Mining Index in the same period. This share price weakness as
compared to the met coal average price decline reflects the uninspiring
management of the Company. 

Underperformance of Walter Energy Compared to Peers and the S 500

Audley Capital`s ultimate goal is to give stockholders the opportunity to elect
directors that can help management implement initiatives that should create
lasting value at Walter Energy. 

Timeline of Underperformance at Walter Energy

In that vein, we firmly believe that a reconstituted Board - including Audley
Capital`s director nominees - would be best placed to execute on these
value-enhancing steps. Audley Capital`s director nominees include individuals
with extensive experience in the metallurgical coal industry on an international
basis and possess the skills required to manage multi-jurisdictional coal
operations and their financing. We believe that they will bring a fresh, dynamic
and creative approach to the Walter Energy Board. 

Before outlining these initiatives, it is appropriate to address some recent
developments at the Company. 

How Walter Energy`s Board Has Disappointed Stockholders

Continued Lackluster Financial Performance Further Evidenced by Fourth Quarter
Earnings

We were once again disappointed with Walter Energy`s financial performance
reported on February 20, 2013. The Company again missed consensus earnings
estimates, which further underscores their ongoing unsatisfactory financial
performance. Walter Energy has missed consensus earnings expectations seven out
of the last nine quarters. Analysts noted: 

"Walter reported adjusted Q4/12 EPS of -US$1.06&#8230;below the Street`s -US$0.89."
- BMO; February 20, 2013

"Walter Energy, Inc. posted a weaker than expected 4Q12 adjusted operating loss
of $1.06 per share vs. our estimate of a loss of $0.95 and the Street's $0.89
via a greater loss from Canadian operations and increased interest expense,
partially offset by a sizable year-end tax benefit."
- KeyBanc; February 20, 2013

"Walter Energy reported adjusted operating EPS loss of $(1.06), below consensus
of a loss of $(0.92) and our estimate of a loss of $(0.82)."
- CLSA; February 21, 2013

We were further dismayed that first quarter 2013 earnings guidance will also be
below previous market expectations. 

Comparison of Historic EPS Development vs. Consensus EPS Forecast

Audley Capital is baffled that the Company consistently provides incorrect
quarterly earnings guidance to analysts. We would like to see the Board
undertake an urgent review of internal budgeting procedures, financial
disclosures and investor relations activities with a view to providing the
market with more accurate earnings guidance going forward. 

Underlying Valuation of Walter Energy Needs to Improve

We believe that Walter Energy should trade at a much smaller discount to its net
present value (NPV) valuation due to:

* It being the only NYSE-listed pure play met coal miner of substantial size; 
* A high proportion of sales of high margin metallurgical coal with scope for
significant price recovery vs. the structurally challenged US thermal coal
market with limited or no price recovery potential; 
* The potential for superior production growth over the next three years; and 
* It being a potential bid candidate for a strategic mining counterpart looking
to increase metallurgical coal exposure.

However, Walter Energy`s Price/NPV ratio has fallen from a peak of over 1.6x
during the first quarter of 2011 to the current 0.6x, vs. the 3-year average of
0.97x. While this may be endemic in the industry over the last twelve months,
Audley Capital maintains that this could have been alleviated in the Company`s
case and is largely due to the governance issues previously highlighted, the
Company`s increased financial leverage and disappointment with the Canadian
operations. 

Addressing the board level issues should provide stockholders with increased
confidence in the management of Walter Energy going forward. We believe that
Audley Capital`s director nominees will bring a fresh, dynamic and creative
approach to the Walter Energy Board. We believe that these new directors and
implementation of the initiatives detailed below should contribute to enhanced
investor confidence and prospects for the Company. 

Serious Lack of Director Accountability and High Turnover at CEO Level

We think that change is long overdue, and are disturbed that despite the loss of
stockholder value, we see the Board taking no accountability for questionable
strategic, operational and financial decisions. Further, the lack of consistent
executive leadership is an underlying signal of lack of stability where it
matters most. There have been four CEOs over the past five years (including the
current CEO and an "interim" CEO who served for more than a year). This is not
healthy corporate governance and is inarguably an issue of high concern. 

"We agree with Audley that the high turnover at Walter`s CEO position over the
past five years has been unsettling."
- Stifel Nicolaus; February 20, 2013

Stockholder Input, including Audley Capital`s, Has Been Ignored

This is not the first instance where Audley Capital has put forth
value-enhancing initiatives for consideration by the Company`s Board and
management team`s consideration, only to be stonewalled. 

In July 2011, when Walter shares traded well-above $100, Audley Capital sent a
letter to the Board urging the Board to initiate a managed sale process to
address the Company`s range of issues and achieve fair value for stockholders.
At the time, we believed Walter Energy`s fair value could be in excess of $150
per share, implying a market value of approximately $9.0 billion. Despite our
request, the Board elected not to pursue this course of action, but more
importantly, provided no explanation for its rationale and showed little
interest in engaging in productive communication. The Company`s market value
today is about $1.9 billion. 

Audley Capital has also engaged with the Company on several other smaller
strategic initiatives, such as spinning off the UK coal operations. Again,
constructive dialogue with the Board or management was not forthcoming. 

Feedback from other Walter Energy stockholders echoes Audley Capital`s
experience regarding interaction and dealings with the Board. Criticism from
some stockholders pins the Board as unresponsive to stockholder requests in
comparison to other similarly-sized mining companies. 

One Director Change is Not Enough - Company Must Address Board`s Lack of
Relevant Experience and Stagnancy

We believe that the Board has been dominated for too long by a clique of
long-time directors who have not worked in the best interest of stockholders.
While we were pleased to see the appointment of Mary R. Henderson and the
retirement of Howard Clark, we continue to believe that there is a substantial
lack of mining and public market experience among the current Board members,
including Chairman and Presiding Director Michael T. Tokarz, who has been a
director of the Company for 26 years and has served as non-executive Chairman
for more than 6 years. 

We propose that the following five directors resign or retire from the Board at
the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders: 

1) Mr. Michael T. Tokarz
2) Mr. Jerry W. Kolb
3) Mr. Joseph B. Leonard
4) Mr. Bernard G. Rethore
5) Mr. A.J. Wagner 

We believe these individuals have been on the Board for too long, with an
average tenure of 12 years, and lack relevant mining experience. Furthermore,
four of the five directors we oppose are members of a group of interlocking
directors with Mueller Water Products, Inc. (NYSE: MWA), including Mr. Tokarz,
and in our view lack a diversity of independent views. We believe these
longstanding Board members` on-going inability to reverse the serious loss of
stockholder value must come to an end, beginning with the resignation,
retirement or replacement of Chairman Michael T. Tokarz and Mr. Kolb, Mr.
Leonard, Mr. Rethore and Mr. Wagner. 

Audley Capital`s Five Highly-Qualified Nominees Can Help Company Regain
Credibility

Our proposed nominees have the necessary mining and public company experience
and qualifications to steer Walter Energy on the path towards long-term growth.
Audley Capital`s director nominees include individuals with extensive experience
in the metallurgical coal industry on an international basis and possess the
skills required to manage multi-jurisdictional coal operations and their
financing. We believe that they will bring a fresh, dynamic and creative
approach to the Walter Energy Board. 

As a result of Audley Capital`s proposed changes, the Board will be refreshed,
re-energized and more knowledgeable about the coal mining sector in addition to
managing a public company with a diverse stockholder base. 

We urge stockholders to vote for these director nominees by voting the GOLD
proxy card at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April 25, 2013.

Initiatives for a Reconstituted Board That Can Enhance Stockholder Value

While our immediate concern is addressing the shortcomings of the current Board,
we have identified a number of initiatives that we are confident can drastically
improve Walter Energy`s performance. Audley Capital proposes that the
restructured board focus on the following initiatives: 

REDUCE DEBT

Even before Walter Energy`s announcement of a new issuance of high yield debt on
March 22, 2013, we believe the Company was overleveraged with $2.3 billion of
debt. A net debt to book value of equity ratio of 228% for a mining company with
a high level of operational risk and a high level of commodity price risk is
totally unacceptable in our view. 

We understand that the majority of this debt was the result of the acquisition
of Western Coal, negotiated in November 2010 and completed in April 2011, for
C$3.1 billion, structured in part, we believe, to avoid a stockholder vote on
the matter. If stockholders of Walter Energy had had the opportunity to vote on
the transaction, we believe it is likely that a higher proportion of shares
would have been provided as consideration rather than the reduced number of
shares that were issued. This would have alleviated the need to "leverage up"
the balance sheet to the unprecedented levels of today. Going forward, we would
ask that the Board have a more constructive dialogue with major stockholders
when entering into M transactions in order to reduce financial risk. We
believe that Walter Energy should not enter into any transformational
transactions without a stockholder vote on the matter, and that the articles of
the Company should be amended to provide stockholders with the right to vote on
such transactions regardless of how they are funded. 

"We agree with Audley that Walter entered the current downturn with excessive
debt levels following the 2011 acquisition of Western Coal. In retrospect,
Walter would have been better served by using equity rather than debt to fund
the majority of the transaction, which was the approach taken by top met coal
competitor Alpha Natural Resources (ANR - Hold - $9.50) in its acquisition of
Massey Energy in 2011." - Stifel Nicolaus; 20 February 2013

While we understand the benefits of leverage, we are of the view that
stockholders would prefer to invest in a mining company with a net debt to book
value of equity ratio of less than 100% given the commodity price risk in the
current macro environment, and that a short-term objective of the Company should
be to reduce net debt to less than $1.0 billion. This should allow more
risk-averse investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, to
reinvest in Walter Energy, and for the business to ultimately pay dividends. We
believe the Company has the ability to generate well over $1.0 billion of free
cash flow over the next three years, which is approximately 50% of Walter
Energy`s current market cap, and should be directed towards reducing borrowings.


Walter Energy`s Outsized Net Debt / Stockholders` Equity Ratio

EXAMINE OPTIONS TO REDUCE COST OF DEBT

We believe the high yield debt fundraising of $500.0 million with a 9.875%
coupon in November 2012 was ill-timed and very poorly priced. The issue was
"priced to sell" and, in our view, provided a rich bonus to debt investors at
the expense of stockholders. Unsurprisingly, the bonds have traded up to a price
of $110.00 vs. the $99.30 issue price. If this deal was undertaken around the
time of the Western Coal acquisition and priced differently, we believe a
significantly lower interest rate would have been achieved with a better overall
debt maturity profile. We struggle to understand why cheaper sources of debt
funding were not pursued during the fourth quarter 2012. Collateral based loans,
typically priced at LIBOR + 300bps to 400bps, would have been substantially
cheaper. 

Alternatively, we believe sourcing new debt financing packages from leading
Asian banks where Walter Energy has an established customer base would have
likely yielded better results. These sources of funding can often be cheaper
than that provided by traditional U.S. lending banks. At the appropriate time,
the reconstituted Board should consider a refinancing of existing term loans
with a view to reducing the overall interest cost burden and increasing
financial flexibility. 

In our view, the Company`s recently announced issuance of $450 million of senior
notes due in 2021 with a coupon of 8.500% per annum reflects another case of
questionable financial judgment by the Board. The Company is locking in
expensive long-term debt, which reduces free cash flow to equity holders, and
allows the balance sheet to continue to deteriorate as the cost of annual
interest payments continues to rise. 

IN-DEPTH REVIEW OF SG AND COST CONTROL

Audley Capital believes that a thorough and disciplined review of the Company`s
SG costs should be undertaken promptly. Based on Audley Capital`s analysis,
SG costs at the Company are higher than Walter Energy`s U.S. peer group and
savings of at least $10.0 million per quarter and $40.0 million per year should
be targeted. 

SG in Q4 2012 (US$m)

"We believe some pressure from shareholders to cut costs and improve operations
could serve Walter well." - Stifel Nicolaus; February 20, 2013

EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE FINANCING SOLUTIONS

Evaluating alternative financing solutions, such as offtake
financing/prepayments and sale and leaseback of coal reserves, have the
potential to improve the Company`s overall cash position and help reduce
corporate debt. If pursued, such a transaction could improve overall financial
flexibility without necessarily incurring the major increases in the overall
cost of debt as when Walter Energy renegotiated debt covenants in the fourth
quarter of 2012 and issued the expensive $500.0 million 9.875% high yield bond.
Latest quarterly results showed interest expense increasing from $30.5 million
in third quarter 2012 to $49.6 million in fourth quarter 2012, a 63% increase.
We question if the Board even considered or solicited alternative financing
offers during fourth quarter 2012? In our view, the recently announced issuance
of $450 million of high yield debt only exacerbates the Company`s financial
position. 

EVALUATE COAL MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS

We believe that a review of coal marketing arrangements should be undertaken to
improve market share, pricing and volumes, and reduce sales and marketing costs.


We recommend that Walter Energy expands its customer base during this period of
coal market weakness in order to better position itself for a coal market
recovery. In particular, Walter Energy`s customers appear to be heavily
dependent on the Atlantic Basin, with approximately 44% of sales to Europe. We
would encourage Walter Energy to review the European marketing strategy with a
focus on increasing market share to higher growth end customers. 

Audley Capital recommends a review of long term offtake agreements particularly
with regard to pricing and volume commitments. We also recommend a review of
spot market sales. 

Furthermore, we urge Walter Energy to review sales and marketing costs, in
particular shipping arrangements, to determine if economies of scale can be
achieved by consolidating shipments. 

PLACE WILLOW CREEK ON CARE AND MAINTENANCE

Given the limited reserves at Willow Creek, we recommend and agree that the mine
should be put on care and maintenance to conserve reserves for stronger coal
markets, but that the mine should be restarted when hard coking coal prices
recover to over $200 per ton. 

SOLICIT A JOINT VENTURE PARTNER FOR BLUE CREEK

We understand that the Blue Creek property, with appropriate funding, could add
between 2mtpa and 3mtpa of hard coking coal production. Analysts estimate the
net present value of this project to be in the region of +$500.0 million based
on a $200.0/t coal price. We understand that capex of approximately $1.0 billion
would be required to bring the Blue Creek property into production. Given Walter
Energy`s indebtedness, it seems clear that the Company will be unable to do this
on its own. As a result, this new development would benefit from sharing the
capex burden with a strong joint venture partner. We are aware of several
strategic partners that could be interested in such an opportunity. 

EVALUATE TAX SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH REORGANIZING THERMAL COAL &amp; NATURAL GAS
ASSETS

Walter Energy could evaluate the tax savings associated with reorganizing the
energy assets, in particular profitable thermal coal and natural gas assets, by
placing them into a Master Limited Partnership structure. We believe that this
would provide significant tax savings in addition to allowing investors to
appropriately value these assets through improved financial disclosure. 

DIVEST UNDERPERFORMING AND NON-CORE ASSETS

We believe loss-making and breakeven thermal coal mines with limited scope for
recovery, as well as the UK anthracite coal mines, should be sold or spun off to
enhance value for Company stockholders. The result should be a company focused
on metallurgical coal with considerably greater production. 

UPGRADE RESERVES

We understand that there are substantial additional reserves and resources of
met coal at both the U.S. and Canadian operations that are not reflected in the
current reserve and resource statements, partly as the reserves were determined
several years ago in a much lower coal price environment, and due as well to the
Board`s lack of focus on replacing mined reserves. 

Given that several mines have reserves of less than 20 years - including Mine
No.7 and Wolverine properties - we recommend that the Board considers a review
of all coal reserves and resources, with limited exploration drilling where
required, to ensure stockholders and potential investors are fully aware of the
longevity of the coal mines. To be clear, we believe this analysis should only
be undertaken once Walter Energy`s cash position has improved. The market
appears to be of the opinion that the Company`s resources and reserves are
relatively limited. We believe this is incorrect. 

Without pursuing the sort of initiatives proposed by Audley Capital and Board
oversight by new, dynamic, experienced directors, it seems that the only options
the Company currently has are a highly dilutive capital raise or significantly
higher interest payments.

Substantial Underlying Value Needs to be Unlocked

We reiterate our view that there is substantial value in Walter Energy that is
not reflected by the current share price. We maintain that the initiatives
outlined above have the potential to significantly increase equity value over
the coming 12 to 24 months, and that the proposal to improve the governance of
Walter Energy can significantly reduce the Company`s discount to fair value.
More importantly, a newly constituted Board, operating efficiently, should make
more thoughtful decisions going forward to create lasting value for stockholders
in the future. 

Audley Capital`s Nominees Are Committed to Improving Walter Energy

As Walter Energy stockholders, we are extremely frustrated with the current
performance and direction of the Company. Simply stated, it is time for a change
at Walter Energy. Audley Capital is committed to making sure that the best
interests of all stockholders are represented on the Board, and would welcome
the opportunity to discuss our candidates and proposals with the Board and
management at their earliest convenience. 

To make our position clear, Audley Capital is not recommending the sale of
Walter Energy at the current time. We believe the balance sheet is weak, the
Board is not up to the task, and met coal prices are low. A sale should be
reviewed as part of a series of strategic options when appropriate; however, it
is Audley Capital`s view that the current Board will NEVER consider the sale of
Walter Energy. 

Audley Capital is urging stockholders to vote the GOLD proxy card to elect its
highly-qualified nominees at the upcoming Annual Meeting. They will bring a
fresh, dynamic and creative approach to the Walter Energy Board.

Emphasizes Ongoing Board and Management Focus on Enhancing Shareholder Value In
Letter to Shareholders


BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(Business Wire)--
Walter Energy, Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT) today issued a letter to its
shareholders raising serious concerns about Audley Capital`s slate of nominees
and highlighting the steps underway by the Company`s Board and new management
team to increase shareholder value. 

The letter from Chairman Michael T. Tokarz and CEO and Director Walter J.
Scheller III highlights "troubling aspects" about Audley`s campaign to replace
five of its nine independent directors, including the fact that Audley`s proxy
statement contains serious omissions regarding the background and history of its
nominees.These omissions include insider trading charges, deficient governance,
and misrepresentations of experience. 

Walter Energy said the Board`s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
reviewed the Audley slate and determined that individually and collectively they
lack the qualifications and experience to be suitable Board candidates. Walter
Energy has a balanced mix of experience and expertise on its Board, and four of
the 10 current directors have joined within the past two years. 

"We are intensely focused on enhancing shareholder value by reducing debt
levels, continuing to reduce SG expenses, and identifying alternatives for
underperforming assets," the letter states. "These initiatives are consistent
with our objective of optimizing our portfolio and ensuring that each of our
operations is cash flow positive and on a clear path to profitability under
current market conditions and outlook." 

The letter concludes: "Over the years your Board has created long term value for
all stockholders with judgment and integrity. We recognize and accept the
challenge of responding to the recent and dramatic decline in met coal pricing
that has affected every company in this industry. Your Board and management have
taken every reasonable step to respond to that trend and to position the Company
for future profitable growth as conditions improve. That work should accrue to
your benefit, not that of others. Now is not the time to reverse course." 

Text of March 25 letter from Messrs. Tokarz and Scheller to Walter Energy
shareholders: 

Dear Fellow Walter Energy Shareholders: 

We have been pleased to speak with many of you over the past few weeks and, as
always, we are appreciative of your insights and input. During our discussions,
we have reviewed the ways in which your Board and management are fully aligned
in positioning the Company for vigorous and profitable growth in anticipation of
the recovery of the met coal market. We have an experienced management team in
place that has safely increased production to a record level while curtailing
low margin tonnage, improving average met coal cost per ton of production as
well as reducing total SG expenses, tightening capital spending, improving
liquidity, and aggressively pursuing debt reduction. 

We are intensely focused on enhancing shareholder value by reducing debt levels,
continuing to reduce SG expenses, and identifying alternatives for
underperforming assets. These initiatives are consistent with our objective of
optimizing our portfolio and ensuring that each of our operations is cash flow
positive and on a clear path to profitability under current market conditions
and outlook. 

Your Board has provided invaluable oversight of our proactive approach to
portfolio and cost management. Moreover, our commitment to decisive change in
pursuit of value creation is reflected in the Board`s balance and composition.
Four of the 10 current directors have joined within the past two years, adding
important new perspectives and skills to historical knowledge and continuity of
leadership. 

With this backdrop, it is unfortunate that an offshore hedge fund, Audley
Capital, is seeking five out of nine independent Board seats at our April 25th
Annual Meeting of Shareholders - threatening to derail our new management team
and the important progress we have made thus far. 

Audley owns less than one-tenth of one percent of the Company`s shares, and only
one individual on Audley`s slate claims beneficial ownership of any shares. This
is not evidence of an alignment with and long-term commitment to your best
interests. We also want to bring to your attention other troubling aspects about
their campaign:

* Audley`s proxy statement contains serious omissions regarding the background
and history of its nominees - These include insider trading charges, deficient
governance, and misrepresentations of their experience. 
* Audley`s nominees lack the credentials we require of our directors - The
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of your Board has carefully
considered Audley`s slate and determined that, collectively and individually,
they lack the qualifications and experience to lead a multi-billion dollar New
York and Toronto Stock Exchange-listed company such as Walter Energy. 
* Audley is focused on short term gains at the expense of other shareholders -
The hedge fund`s prior track record with Walter Energy underscores in our view
its opportunistic, "hit and run" approach in driving up the stock price with
public statements in order to take immediate profits.

Audley offers no specific plan that differs from what your Board is already
doing, and its efforts to install an opposing slate could jeopardize our strong
operational momentum as our efforts gain traction. We encourage you to vote for
the Company`s nominees today by telephone, by Internet, or by signing and dating
the enclosed WHITE proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope
provided. 

YOUR BOARD AND MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN EXECUTING ON A COMPREHENSIVE BUSINESS PLAN;
AUDLEY IS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PROPOSE ANYTHING NEW

Audley`s plan to improve the Company offers nothing the Company is not already
doing. Its four elements - reducing debt, reviewing SG and cost control,
stabilizing senior management, and improving operational performance - are
already areas of intense focus for our Board and management where we either have
made real progress with further improvement already targeted or, in the case of
stabilizing senior management, have completed the task.

* Debt reduction underway. Our first priority is debt reduction and improving
our liquidity and debt maturity profile. To that end, last week we raised $450
million of new senior unsecured notes which will extend our debt maturities and
increase our liquidity. The issue was very well received, evidencing the credit
market`s favorable view of our progress, and priced at a lower interest rate
than our issue last November. 
* Significant cost improvements. In 2012 we reduced SG by 19%, and we have
targeted an additional reduction in SG expenses in 2013. We reduced average
met coal cash cost per ton by 6% compared to 2011, and by 16% in the fourth
quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. 
* Able and experienced management team in place. The Board named Walt Scheller
Chief Executive Officer in September 2011, and during 2012 we appointed to our
senior management team a mix of highly experienced external and internal
executives. 
* Strengthened operational performance. We safely increased production of met
coal by 35% to a record 11.7 metric tons in 2012, developed our capacity to
produce in excess of 15 million metric tons when market conditions warrant, and
curtailed production at low margin mines. Most recently we announced we will be
idling our Willow Creek mine in Canada and will be closing our North River mine
in Alabama ahead of schedule.

Audley offers no concrete ideas in any of these areas. 

AUDLEY`S NOMINEES ARE FLAWED AND LACK THE NECESSARY RECORDS OF SUCCESSFUL
STEWARDSHIP

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of Walter Energy`s Board
reviewed the qualifications of the Audley nominees as part of its established
nominee review process. The Committee concluded that the Audley nominees did not
meet the Company`s standards for directorship. The Audley nominees lack the
track record and credentials that would qualify them to be directors of a
company with Walter Energy`s financial, industrial, and market profile and
governance requirements. 

Material facts were also omitted from Audley`s proxy statement about these
nominees, all of which are important for you to know: 

Julian Treger: Questions about "hit and run" track record

Julian Treger has a history of opportunistic, short-term investing at the
expense of other shareholders. 

In September 2010, Mr. Treger put his obligations as a director of Western Coal
aside in the interest of a making a profit for Audley, resigning as a director
of Western Coal so that he could solicit offers for the large bloc of Western
Coal shares owned by Audley. He ultimately agreed to sell the bulk of this bloc
to Walter Energy for cash in November 2010. This was prior to and not
conditioned upon Western Coal entering into an acquisition agreement with your
Company, which did not occur until December 2010. 

Less than a year later, when he held shares of Walter Energy common stock in the
aftermath of the Company`s acquisition of Western Coal, Mr. Treger decided to
profit from self-created publicity at the expense of Walter Energy`s public
investors and at the risk of destabilizing the Company. 

On Sunday, July 17, 2011, Mr. Treger sent a letter marked "Private &amp;
Confidential" to your Board calling for the Company`s sale, asserting that the
Company was worth twice what it was trading for at the time and requesting a
response by August 5th. The next day, Monday, July 18, he publicly disclosed
that letter, without allowing the Company to consider or respond to it. To take
advantage of the sharp increase in our stock price following his disclosure,
Audley immediately began selling its shares of Walter Energy`s common stock and
continued to do so over the course of the first four days of that week --
selling 300,000 shares, or 33% of his holdings, between July 18 and July 21. By
the end of October 2011, Audley had sold nearly all of its remaining holdings in
Walter Energy. 

Audley`s proxy statement seeks to create the impression that its sales followed
a decision by your Board not to pursue a sale of the Company. However, the facts
tell a different story. Mr. Treger`s repeated episodes of opportunism are
directly contrary to the values of the Company and show a disregard of the
interests of you, its shareholders. 

Nor have Audley`s strategies led to sustained profit making at other companies.
The Audley proxy statement lists two public companies of which Mr. Treger is a
director, Whetstone Minerals Ltd. and Firestone Diamonds. Since he began his
tenure at Whetstone in 2011, that company`s stock price has declined by 50%.
Since he began his tenure at Firestone in 2012, Firestone`s stock price has
declined by 38%. 

Mr. Treger`s self-interested, profit-taking focus with respect to your Company
continues to this day. In its proxy statement, Audley disclosed a side agreement
with another hedge fund that may entitle Audley to fees to the extent that hedge
fund profits from undisclosed investments in Walter Energy stock. Audley has not
disclosed the terms of its deal, so we do not know how this aligns -- or
misaligns -- the interests of Audley and its nominees with other shareholders,
who have no such arrangement. 

Robert H. Stan: Questions about insider trading charges

Mr. Stan is currently defending himself against charges of insider trading, and
tipping his wife so she could engage in insider trading, in the stock of a
company of which he was Chairman and CEO. 

On December 5, 2011, the Alberta Securities Commission charged that Mr. Stan and
his wife engaged in transactions in the stock and options of Grande Cache Coal
Corporation at a time when they were aware that the company would fall short of
its forecasted sales by almost 40%. It alleged that their transactions occurred
"while they were in a special relationship with Grande Cache and with knowledge
of a material fact or change with respect to Grande Cache that had not been
generally disclosed," in violation of Alberta`s Securities Act. On September 19,
2012, a hearing panel denied Mr. Stan`s request for an order dismissing one of
the allegations against him. It is our understanding that these charges remain
unresolved. 

It is particularly troubling that Audley has not only failed to disclose the
existence of these pending charges when asking you to vote for Mr. Stan, but has
specifically held him out in its proxy statement as well-suited to "assist the
Board in its compliance and governance discussions and strategies." 

Audley`s promotion of Mr. Stan has little basis, even without regard to the
insider trading charges against him. Spruce Bluff Resource Ltd, of which the
proxy statement describes Mr. Stan as Chairman and Director, is a small entity
formed last year by Mr. Stan, in which he and his wife are the sole directors.
The proxy statement also lists Mr. Stan`s service on the board of directors of
Whetstone Minerals Ltd. (with Mr. Treger). However, during his time on the
board, the company`s stock price has fallen precipitously, losing more than 97%
of its value. 

Larry M. Clark, Jr.: Questions about lack of relevant experience

Larry M. Clark`s principal business experience is essentially working for a
hedge fund, Harbinger Capital Partners. To the best of our knowledge, he has no
substantial experience as a manager, director or leader of a coal company. 

The Audley proxy statement notes Mr. Clark`s experience as an investor. It omits
mention of his public acknowledgement that he was fired from a hedge fund job
after causing accounts he managed to lose $250 million dollars in 45 minutes. 

It is our understanding that, during Mr. Clark`s time at Harbinger, he
spearheaded Harbinger`s investment in African Medical Investments and served on
that company`s board of directors. That investment resulted in significant
losses for the fund. During Mr. Clark`s tenure on the board of African Medical
Investments, the company`s stock fell by approximately 70%. 

When he left Harbinger in 2011, Mr. Clark attempted to start a hedge fund,
Balantrove Management, LLC. He publicly stated a goal of raising between $500
million and $1 billion. However, he was able to raise only a small fraction of
that amount. Reportedly, Balantrove now has assets under management of $760,000
and currently describes itself as a "corporate advisory business catering to
small and middle-market resource and energy companies." 

Audley also lists Mr. Clark`s service on the board of directors of Ecometals
Ltd. as a qualification. However, he served on that board for only a month, from
November to December 2012, at which time he did not stand for re-election. This
unusually short stint as a director deserves an explanation, which the proxy
statement does not provide, and is certainly not a credential establishing his
Board experience. 

Mark H. Lochtenberg: Questions about lax corporate governance

Mr. Lochtenberg`s principal employment for the last eight years has been with
Cockatoo Coal Limited, an Australian mining company of which he has served as
managing director and, for the last year, executive chairman. 

Mr. Lochtenburg`s testimony in litigation in Australia concerning his activities
on behalf of Cockatoo Coal casts serious doubt on his qualifications in the area
of corporate governance. The litigation was brought by a minority shareholder in
a company, Baralaba Coal Property Ltd., in which Cockatoo owned the majority
interest. Mr. Lochtenberg was one of three directors of Baralaba appointed by
Cockatoo. The minority shareholder had two appointed directors. On
cross-examination Mr. Lochtenberg conceded that he had assumed the title of
managing director of Baralaba without being properly appointed by the board,
failed to hold directors meetings for nearly a year, failed to keep minutes of
the decisions made by the directors, and failed to provide operating information
requested by the minority directors. He was asked, "So when you say the affairs
of Baralaba are in disarray, that`s only because you [and the other two
Cockatoo-appointed directors] have chosen to ignore what would be basic rules of
corporate governance, correct?" He responded, "Correct." 

A command of and commitment to sound corporate governance should be a
pre-requisite to serve on your behalf on Walter Energy`s Board. An individual
who has admitted to ignoring the basic rules of corporate governance does not
meet this standard. 

In addition, the Audley proxy statement describes Cockatoo as "a publicly traded
metallurgical coal producer," the same business as Walter Energy. Yet the proxy
statement also claims that "Mr. Lochtenberg`s other activities in the coal
industry are not believed to be competitive with the business of the Company."
Shareholders of Walter Energy are entitled to an explanation of the basis for
this conclusion. 

Cockatoo Coal`s share price has not performed well during Mr. Lochtenberg`s
tenure. Since he joined that company as one of three managing directors in
January 2005, its stock price has declined by 59%. Since he became executive
chairman in April 2012, it has declined by 71%. 

Edward Scholtz: Questions about leadership credentials

The description of Mr. Scholtz`s experience in the proxy contains significant
inaccuracies with respect to his leadership positions. The proxy states that
"Mr. Scholtz also currently serves as a director of Talon Metals Corp., a
publicly traded mineral exploration company, where he serves on the audit
committee." That company`s website does not list Mr. Scholtz as a director or
committee member, and contains a news release stating that he left the company`s
employ on February 9, 2012. In fact, Mr. Scholtz served as the president and CEO
of Talon, but held that position for only eight months. During his brief tenure
at Talon, its share price dropped by 57%. 

Audley also represents that Mr. Scholtz served as the "Chief Operating Officer
of CIC Energy Corp., a publicly traded coal and energy company, from 2008 to
2012." That company`s disclosures indicate that this, too, is incorrect.
According to CIC`s annual reports, another individual held the position of COO
from January 2007 through December 2010. Mr. Scholtz was apparently the COO of a
division of CIC, not the parent public company, during this period. Finally,
Audley lists as a credential Mr. Scholtz`s time as COO of Jindal Africa. Jindal
purchased CIC, Mr. Scholtz`s employer, in 2012. His tenure at Jindal Africa
lasted only three months, after which Mr. Scholtz left the company. 

WALTER ENERGY NOMINEES ARE HIGHLY CREDENTIALED AND FOCUSED ON SHAREHOLDER VALUE
CREATION

Over the years your Board has created long term value for all stockholders with
judgment and integrity. We recognize and accept the challenge of responding to
the recent and dramatic decline in met coal pricing that has affected every
company in this industry. Your Board and management have taken every reasonable
step to respond to that trend and to position the Company for future profitable
growth as conditions improve. That work should accrue to your benefit, not that
of others. Now is not the time to reverse course. 

Your Board has put the Company on a path to greater long-term profitability as
market conditions improve. Replacing five out of nine independent members with
nominees who offer no new ideas to strengthen the Company, and whose past
records raise substantial doubts as to their suitability and qualifications for
the Board, would not be in your best interest. We urge you to vote for the
Board`s nominees. We also look forward to continuing our dialogue with you. 

Your vote is important in this election, and we urge you to vote TODAY so that
your voice is heard.To elect the Walter Energy Board`s nominees, we encourage
you to vote today by telephone, by Internet, or by signing and dating the
enclosed WHITE proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope
provided. We also urge you to discard any proxy card sent to you by Mr. Treger
or Audley Capital. 

Sincerely, 

Michael T. Tokarz, Chairman of the Board 

Walter J. Scheller, III, Chief Executive Officer and Director

MUNICH &amp; HANOVER, Germany--(Business Wire)--
Meru Networks (NASDAQ:MERU) can now announce that software giant Microsoft used
Meru`s MobileFLEX virtual WLAN architecture during CeBIT 2013, the largest IT
tradeshow and most contentious Wi-Fi environment on Earth. 

Meru`s Context-aware Application Layers (CALs) were utilized to cut through all
the other traffic at the show to provide access to the Microsoft staff, visitors
and journalists, who, at peak times, were using more than 600 mobile devices
including netbooks, tablets, smartphones and various other wireless devices from
many different manufacturers connected simultaneously. After experiencing
disappointing results the previous year with another wireless vendor, Microsoft
was very pleased with the reliability and predictability of the Meru technology
in this very challenging tradeshow environment. 

German systems integrator, M.S. IT-Services GmbH selected the Meru Networks
technology while planning the wireless network for the multi-level, 3000 m2
Microsoft stand. M.S. IT-Services GmbH, a company of the URANO Group, was
responsible for building up the network infrastructure on the stand which
included over 1,050 Ethernet ports, 24 physical and 260 virtual servers and
firewalls. Fifty Meru AP332e access points (APs) and two MC4200 controllers
deployed in redundant configuration were deployed in order to support over 600
clients. 

Monika Friedrich, CeBIT Project Manager, Microsoft, was very satisfied with the
high level of traffic on the Microsoft booth, saying, "In addition to the over
800 Microsoft staff members working on the stand we also hosted over 50 partners
who built up demonstration areas to showcase the Microsoft solutions. Already on
the first day of the tradeshow we had 400 devices connected over the wireless
LAN network. This year we had a huge number of visitors from around the world
and even hosted a number of VIPs including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel
and the Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk. 

"We showcased on a daily basis the Microsoft solutions in very demanding live
demonstrations on our centre stage," Frederich continued. "It is very important
for us that these live demos run smoothly and the pre-requisite for this if of
course reliable and high-speed WLAN connectivity. Last year we had major issues
to provide connectivity without a wired connection. This year, we are extremely
pleased with the performance of the Meru technology that worked without any
hitches throughout the entire show." 

Achim Scholz, Project Manager, M.S. IT-Services, who has been responsible for
the last three years for the IT infrastructure on the Microsoft stand added,
"This year we have 26 physical and 260 virtual servers on the stand that of
course all need to be connected up via a wired connection. In the previous
years, the WLAN on the Microsoft stand caused us a great deal of headaches. The
number of wireless devices that we have to connect has grown over the last few
years dramatically. This year, thanks to the Meru technology, we had no issues
and that is impressive given that the Microsoft stand is located in Hall 4 where
we have up to 70,000 visitors per day." 

"Hall 4 is a particularly harsh environment for wireless LAN, as in this hall we
have a number of very large exhibitors who are all competing to provide a stable
WLAN to their visitors and staff. Despite all of the interference in the air the
Meru WLAN technology had everything under control," added Heiner Sepeur,
Managing Director, URANO Informationssysteme GmbH. 

"That Meru`s MobileFLEX architecture was able to meet Microsoft`s needs at the
at CeBIT, the most challenging of venues, this year, demonstrates the efficacy
of the combination of Microsoft, Meru, and our valued partner, IT-Services
GmbH," said Srinath Sarang, Co-Founder and General Manager of Hospitality and
Entertainment at Meru. 

"The support of mobile devices on the stand worked perfectly. My colleagues and
I realized straight away that the WLAN was working very well. In all of the
previous years we never had such a reliable WLAN. During the entire show we
didn`t have a single issue," said Philip Xenos, Mobile Business Development

MUNICH &amp; HANOVER, Germany--(Business Wire)--
Meru Networks (NASDAQ:MERU) can now announce that software giant Microsoft used
Meru`s MobileFLEX virtual WLAN architecture during CeBIT 2013, the largest IT
tradeshow and most contentious Wi-Fi environment on Earth. 

Meru`s Context-aware Application Layers (CALs) were utilized to cut through all
the other traffic at the show to provide access to the Microsoft staff, visitors
and journalists, who, at peak times, were using more than 600 mobile devices
including netbooks, tablets, smartphones and various other wireless devices from
many different manufacturers connected simultaneously. After experiencing
disappointing results the previous year with another wireless vendor, Microsoft
was very pleased with the reliability and predictability of the Meru technology
in this very challenging tradeshow environment. 

German systems integrator, M.S. IT-Services GmbH selected the Meru Networks
technology while planning the wireless network for the multi-level, 3000 m2
Microsoft stand. M.S. IT-Services GmbH, a company of the URANO Group, was
responsible for building up the network infrastructure on the stand which
included over 1,050 Ethernet ports, 24 physical and 260 virtual servers and
firewalls. Fifty Meru AP332e access points (APs) and two MC4200 controllers
deployed in redundant configuration were deployed in order to support over 600
clients. 

Monika Friedrich, CeBIT Project Manager, Microsoft, was very satisfied with the
high level of traffic on the Microsoft booth, saying, "In addition to the over
800 Microsoft staff members working on the stand we also hosted over 50 partners
who built up demonstration areas to showcase the Microsoft solutions. Already on
the first day of the tradeshow we had 400 devices connected over the wireless
LAN network. This year we had a huge number of visitors from around the world
and even hosted a number of VIPs including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel
and the Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk. 

"We showcased on a daily basis the Microsoft solutions in very demanding live
demonstrations on our centre stage," Frederich continued. "It is very important
for us that these live demos run smoothly and the pre-requisite for this if of
course reliable and high-speed WLAN connectivity. Last year we had major issues
to provide connectivity without a wired connection. This year, we are extremely
pleased with the performance of the Meru technology that worked without any
hitches throughout the entire show." 

Achim Scholz, Project Manager, M.S. IT-Services, who has been responsible for
the last three years for the IT infrastructure on the Microsoft stand added,
"This year we have 26 physical and 260 virtual servers on the stand that of
course all need to be connected up via a wired connection. In the previous
years, the WLAN on the Microsoft stand caused us a great deal of headaches. The
number of wireless devices that we have to connect has grown over the last few
years dramatically. This year, thanks to the Meru technology, we had no issues
and that is impressive given that the Microsoft stand is located in Hall 4 where
we have up to 70,000 visitors per day." 

"Hall 4 is a particularly harsh environment for wireless LAN, as in this hall we
have a number of very large exhibitors who are all competing to provide a stable
WLAN to their visitors and staff. Despite all of the interference in the air the
Meru WLAN technology had everything under control," added Heiner Sepeur,
Managing Director, URANO Informationssysteme GmbH. 

"That Meru`s MobileFLEX architecture was able to meet Microsoft`s needs at the
at CeBIT, the most challenging of venues, this year, demonstrates the efficacy
of the combination of Microsoft, Meru, and our valued partner, IT-Services
GmbH," said Srinath Sarang, Co-Founder and General Manager of Hospitality and
Entertainment at Meru. 

"The support of mobile devices on the stand worked perfectly. My colleagues and
I realized straight away that the WLAN was working very well. In all of the
previous years we never had such a reliable WLAN. During the entire show we
didn`t have a single issue," said Philip Xenos, Mobile Business Development
Manager, Pica GmbH.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top securities regulator is urging international market regulators to find a compromise as they struggle to agree on how to apply new rules for cross border over-the-counter derivatives trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking via video conference at the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's annual forum on Sunday, SEC Chairman Elisse Walter pressed for a regime that would largely rely on foreign regulation for cross-border trades, and would only apply U.S. rules in cases where no comparable regulations existed. A text of her remarks was released by the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In my view, that happy medium has its foundation in an approach that recognizes comparable foreign regulation to the maximum extent possible, consistent with domestic policy goals," Walter said in prepared remarks, which were delivered on Monday morning Australia time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This approach would permit a market participant to comply with a set of domestic requirements in a particular arena - capital or risk management, say - by complying with the comparable foreign regulation," Walter said. "At the same time, the domestic regulator would continue to have the ability to apply certain key policy requirements of local law when foreign law does not impose comparable requirements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter's comments on Monday strike a different tone than those of Gary Gensler, her counterpart who heads the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two agencies won broad new powers to police the over-the-counter market in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, which imposes capital and margin charges on riskier trades and forces many swaps to be traded on regulated platforms and centrally cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFTC, which overseas the lion's share of the roughly $650 trillion market, has been ahead of the SEC on many of its rules. But the CFTC's aggressive proposal for how to apply U.S. derivatives rules abroad has provoked strong criticism from foreign regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFTC's proposal would force foreign banks to stick to the same rules as their U.S. peers when dealing with a U.S. person, which includes companies, if their swap trading volume exceeds $8 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign regulators have said this could create duplicative regulations, and have urged U.S. regulators to embrace a framework that would largely allow banks to rely on the rules imposed in each country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CFTC Chairman Gensler has said his agency would accept substituted compliance, but to a lesser degree than what Walter proposed on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the CFTC, the SEC is still working on a roughly 1,000-page draft for how it will apply its derivatives rules on cross-border transactions. The agency is still awaiting the confirmation of its next chairman, Mary Jo White, and is currently split between two Democrats and two Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what view White will bring to the topic once she takes the helm at the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the latest remarks, Walter said she hopes the U.S. will avoid the two most extreme options -- either by being overly broad in applying the rules and creating "overlap and conflict," or by relying on foreign regulation so much that it could lead to regulatory shopping by the banks and create a "race to the bottom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Insistence on either extreme represents in my view a resistance to reasonable and desirable cooperation among regulators," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that U.S. rules that could potentially apply to cross-border transactions included the SEC's public transparency requirements, or business conduct standards designed to protect less sophisticated swap investors like municipalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Eric Meijer; )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Pfizer's new lung
cancer pill Xalkori is too expensive to be worth using on
Britain's state health service, the country's health cost
watchdog said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
(NICE) said the drug, which works by blocking enzymes that can
stimulate tumour growth, could not be considered a
cost-effective use of National Health Service resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency's draft guidance on the drug - which costs 4,689
pounds ($7,100) for a 30-day supply - is now open for
consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xalkori won conditional approval from European health
regulators last October, following a green light in the United
States in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is designed to be used along with a companion diagnostic
to test for a gene mutation known as ALK, which occurs in about
4 percent of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, many of
them non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Warren Buffett has given up his chance to become Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) largest shareholder by converting his warrants into a smaller stake in the bank at no additional cost to his Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett received the warrants as part of a 2008 deal during the depths of the financial crisis, when his investment in Goldman was seen as a vote of confidence in the firm. Under that deal, Berkshire had the right to buy about 43.5 million Goldman shares - or a roughly 9 percent stake - at an exercise price of $115 per share, for $5 billion in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Goldman announced a new deal that would give Berkshire a much smaller stake, but would not require it to commit any capital to exercise the warrants: Berkshire would convert the warrants for Goldman shares equal in value to the difference between the warrants' exercise price and the average closing price for the 10 trading days up to October 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At current market prices, Buffett would receive 9.2 million shares, or a 2 percent stake, making him the ninth largest investor in Goldman, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's basically taking the profit that he would get without having to lay out the cash," said Gregory Warren, an analyst at Morningstar who covers Berkshire Hathaway. "He just takes the shares and sticks them in his portfolio."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Goldman, the deal was an opportunity to prevent the dilution that would have occurred had Buffett fully exercised the warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is "all good for Goldman," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura who covers the bank. "And who wouldn't want (Warren Buffett) as a larger, long term shareholder?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares rose 0.16 percent to $146.34 in late afternoon trading. Berkshire's widely held Class B stock rose 1.3 percent to $103.68, not far off all-time highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased that Berkshire Hathaway intends to remain a long-term investor in Goldman Sachs," Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett, in the same statement, affirmed that Berkshire intended to retain a "significant investment" in Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VOTE OF CONFIDENCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett's investment in Goldman in 2008 cost the bank dearly. In addition to the warrants, the bank had to give Berkshire preferred stock that paid dividends of $15 a second. Goldman repurchased those shares from Buffett at a premium in March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between that premium, the dividends the preferreds paid while he held them, a special dividend at the time of redemption, and the paper profit on the shares from the warrant deal, analysts said Buffett will potentially have made a profit of more than $3 billion on his original $5 billion investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, said it was a good time for Buffett to take a small stake in Goldman because the investment banking business was on the cusp of an upswing in activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We might be at the beginning of where investment banking and mergers-and-acquisitions and arbitrage and all those things that normally go on that Goldman Sachs makes money on - that have hardly existed over the last five years - exists again," said Smead, whose firm holds shares in Berkshire and until recently also had a position in Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He might have been biding his time," said Smead of Buffett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett has invested in other financial services firms in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2011, Berkshire Hathaway invested $5 billion in Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) when the No. 2 U.S. bank's shares were sinking amid concerns about its capital. In that deal, Berkshire received preferred shares as well as warrants to purchase 700 million Bank of America shares at $7.14 a share over a 10-year period. The shares closed Monday at $12.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Berkowitz in Boston, Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York and Rick Rothacker in Charlotte; Editing by Bernadette Baum, John Wallace, Tiffany Wu and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Buffett to get shares instead of cash
    * Deal avoids dilution risk for Goldman
    * Goldman, Berkshire shares rise


    By Ben Berkowitz and Lauren Tara LaCapra
    March 26 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett has given up his chance
to become Goldman Sachs Group Inc's largest shareholder
by converting his warrants into a smaller stake in the bank at
no additional cost to his Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
    Buffett received the warrants as part of a 2008 deal during
the depths of the financial crisis, when his investment in
Goldman was seen as a vote of confidence in the firm. Under that
deal, Berkshire had the right to buy about 43.5 million Goldman
shares - or a roughly 9 percent stake - at an exercise price of
$115 per share, for $5 billion in total. 
    On Tuesday, Goldman announced a new deal that would give
Berkshire a much smaller stake, but would not require it to
commit any capital to exercise the warrants: Berkshire would
convert the warrants for Goldman shares equal in value to the
difference between the warrants' exercise price and the average
closing price for the 10 trading days up to Oct. 1.
    At current market prices, Buffett would receive 9.2 million
shares, or a 2 percent stake, making him the ninth largest
investor in Goldman, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
    "He's basically taking the profit that he would get without
having to lay out the cash," said Gregory Warren, an analyst at
Morningstar who covers Berkshire Hathaway. "He just takes the
shares and sticks them in his portfolio."
    For Goldman, the deal was an opportunity to prevent the
dilution that would have occurred had Buffett fully exercised
the warrants. 
    The deal is "all good for Goldman," said Glenn Schorr, an
analyst at Nomura who covers the bank. "And who wouldn't want
(Warren Buffett) as a larger, long term shareholder?"    
    Goldman shares rose 0.16 percent to $146.34 in late
afternoon trading. Berkshire's widely held Class B stock rose
1.3 percent to $103.68, not far off all-time highs.
    
    "We are pleased that Berkshire Hathaway intends to remain a
long-term investor in Goldman Sachs," Goldman Sachs Chief
Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement.
    Buffett, in the same statement, affirmed that Berkshire
intended to retain a "significant investment" in Goldman.
        
    VOTE OF CONFIDENCE
    Buffett's investment in Goldman in 2008 cost the bank
dearly. In addition to the warrants, the bank had to give
Berkshire preferred stock that paid dividends of $15 a second.
Goldman repurchased those shares from Buffett at a premium in
March 2011. 
    Between that premium, the dividends the preferreds paid
while he held them, a special dividend at the time of
redemption, and the paper profit on the shares from the warrant
deal, analysts said Buffett will potentially have made a profit
of more than $3 billion on his original $5 billion investment.
    Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital
Management in Seattle, said it was a good time for Buffett to
take a small stake in Goldman because the investment banking
business was on the cusp of an upswing in activity.
    "We might be at the beginning of where investment banking
and mergers-and-acquisitions and arbitrage and all those things
that normally go on that Goldman Sachs makes money on - that
have hardly existed over the last five years - exists again,"
said Smead, whose firm holds shares in Berkshire and until
recently also had a position in Goldman. 
    "He might have been biding his time," said Smead of Buffett.
    Buffett has invested in other financial services firms in
recent years.
    In August 2011, Berkshire Hathaway invested $5 billion in
Bank of America Corp when the No. 2 U.S. bank's shares
were sinking amid concerns about its capital. In that deal,
Berkshire received preferred shares as well as warrants to
purchase 700 million Bank of America shares at $7.14 a share
over a 10-year period. The shares closed Monday at $12.40.

&lt;p&gt;By Antony Currie
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Warren Buffett have found a way to scratch each other&#8217;s backs  again. The mutual assistance started during the crisis when the Sage of Omaha stepped in with a $5 billion rescue investment in 2008 that provided him with a healthy 10 percent yield on Goldman preferred shares. Now, they&#8217;re amending terms of warrants granted to Buffett in the same deal that also works well both ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new agreement simplifies one entitling Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway to buy 43.5 million Goldman shares for $115 apiece. Based on the current share price of about $146, that would have left the conglomerate $1.4 billion in the money and as Goldman&#8217;s biggest shareholder with about a 9 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revised structure keeps Buffett in the black, assuming the stock doesn&#8217;t tank between now and October. Now, however, he isn&#8217;t obligated to shell out $5 billion to buy the stock. Instead, Berkshire will simply receive enough shares to cover the profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without any outlay, Buffett can brag of an infinite return on the warrants. More practically, by not tying up the cash in Goldman, he can keep it in reserve for another Heinz-like elephantine acquisition target. Following the co-purchase of the ketchup maker, his reserves will dip by almost a third to about $30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, meanwhile, escapes some irritating side effects of the investment. It will no longer dilute shareholders as much. Instead of issuing 9 percent of new stock, based on Tuesday&#8217;s price it should only need to issue about 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also means Goldman will suffer a lesser hit to its rate of return. The 43.5 million shares Buffett was due would have increased the bank&#8217;s common equity by 9.3 percent. Applied to expected 2013 earnings, as tallied by Thomson Reuters, the bank&#8217;s return on equity would have been primed to drop from 9.4 percent to an even more disappointing 8.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s one more benefit for the bank led by Lloyd Blankfein. It will now have 34 million fewer shares to worry about negotiating with the Federal Reserve for permission to buy back. For Goldman, Buffett&#8217;s aid keeps on giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish association representing open-source software users has filed a complaint against Microsoft Corp to the European Commission, in a new challenge to the Windows developer following a hefty fine earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 8,000-member Hispalinux, which represents users and developers of the Linux operating system in Spain, said Microsoft had made it difficult for users of computers sold with its Windows 8 platform to switch to Linux and other operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyer and Hispalinux head Jose Maria Lancho said he delivered the complaint to the Madrid office of the European Commission at 0900 GMT (4 a.m. EST) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its 14-page complaint, Hispalinux said Windows 8 contained an "obstruction mechanism" called UEFI Secure Boot that controls the start-up of the computer and means users must seek keys from Microsoft to install another operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group said it was "a de facto technological jail for computer booting systems ... making Microsoft's Windows platform less neutral than ever".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is absolutely anti-competitive," Lancho told Reuters. "It's really bad for the user and for the European software industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said UEFI was an industry standard aimed at improving computer security and the approach had been public for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are happy to answer any additional questions but we are confident our approach complies with the law and helps keep customers safe," Microsoft spokesman Robin Koch said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for EU Competition Chief Joaquin Almunia declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in written comments dated March 4 to a query from an European Parliamentary lawmaker, Almunia said his administration was aware of the Microsoft Windows 8 security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission is monitoring the implementation of the Microsoft Windows 8 security requirements. The Commission is however currently not in possession of evidence suggesting that the Windows 8 security requirements would result in practices in violation of EU competition rules," he said in the letter posted on the website of the European Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has fined Microsoft, the global leader in PC operating systems, 2.2 billion euros ($2.83 billion)over the past decade, making it the world's biggest offender of European Union business rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's relations with the EU executive have been tense since 2004, when the EU found that the company had abused its market leader position by tying Windows Media Player to the Windows software package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company took a more conciliatory approach in recent years, settling another antitrust investigation in 2009 related to the choice of a browser in its Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also lodged its own complaints to the Commission about the business activities of rival Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft broke its 2009 pledge and was fined 561 million euros by the EU Commission on March 6 for failing to offer users a choice of web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Teresa Larraz; Editing by Julien Toyer, Tom Pfeiffer and Clelia Oziel)&lt;/p&gt;

Veeam Disrupts Microsoft SharePoint Backup and Recovery Market; Registration for
Free Public Beta Now Available


BAAR, Switzerland--(Business Wire)--
Click to Tweet: Veeam announces free granular item recovery for Microsoft
SharePoint

News Facts:

* Veeam Software, innovative provider of backup, replication and virtualization
management solutions for VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V, today announced
Veeam Explorer for Microsoft SharePoint, a new capability that anyone may try
out in an upcoming free public beta. Registration to participate in the public
beta is now open. 
* In the past, IT had to procure expensive add-on tools for granular recovery of
items from Microsoft SharePoint backups. Veeam is disrupting this market. Veeam
Explorer for Microsoft SharePoint will be included at no additional charge in
both the next release of Veeam Backup Free Edition and in Veeam Backup &amp;
Replication v7, which will become generally available in the second half of this
year. 
* Microsoft SharePoint has become ubiquitous throughout business IT, from small
businesses to global enterprises. When an employee needs a file that`s been
corrupted or deleted, the help desk seldom has a quick solution because
recovering the file often requires restoring the entire SharePoint database.
Retrieving an individual item can take hours or even days. 
* When it comes to e-discovery, Veeam Explorer for Microsoft SharePoint enables
users to zero in on exactly the information required to quickly locate and
restore individual SharePoint items. 
* Veeam Explorer for Microsoft SharePoint gives IT an intuitive interface to
look inside SharePoint backups, all without the use of agents. Capabilities
include:

* Browsing SharePoint databases within compressed, deduplicated image-level
backups of SharePoint virtual machines (VMs) without having to restore the
entire database; 
* Searching for specific SharePoint items with rich search capability for
e-discovery purposes; 
* Recovering and exporting items directly to the original SharePoint server, or
sending items as email attachments to specific users; and 
* Support for SharePoint running on bothMicrosoft Hyper-V and VMware vSphere.

* Veeam Explorer for Microsoft SharePoint is the latest in a series of
innovations from Veeam that enable IT to browse, search and recover individual
items. Previously released features include:

* U-AIR (Universal Application Item Recovery): General purpose application
item-level recovery. Introduced in Veeam Backup &amp; Replication v5 in October
2010. 
* Veeam Explorer for Microsoft Exchange: Quickly find and restore individual
Exchange items directly from the backup file without the need for a full
restore. Introduced in Veeam Backup &amp; Replication v6.5 in October 2012. 
* Veeam Explorer for SAN Snapshots: Quickly restore any or all of a VM directly
from a SAN snapshot. Introduced in Veeam Backup &amp; Replication v6.5 in October
2012.

Quotes:

Robert Amatruda, Research Director, Data-Protection and Recovery, IDC

"Companies of all sizes have come to depend on Microsoft SharePoint to power
employee collaboration on critical files and other business content. If the help
desk cannot find and recover individual SharePoint items quickly from backup
files, it hurts productivity. Veeam Explorer for Microsoft SharePoint offers an
elegant solution to the problem." 

Ratmir Timashev, President and CEO, Veeam Software

"With Veeam Explorer for Microsoft SharePoint, finding and restoring individual
SharePoint items takes just a couple of minutes. It`s yet another example of
Veeam disrupting the market. Just as we did with Veeam Explorer for Exchange,
Veeam will include these new capabilities in Veeam Backup Free and Veeam Backup
&amp; Replication at no additional charge, enabling IT to replace expensive
SharePoint discovery tools that charge per user." 

Availability &amp; Pricing:

Veeam Explorer for Microsoft SharePoint will be available soon in public beta.
To register, please visit
http://go.veeam.com/microsoft-sharepoint-recovery-explorer.html. This capability
will be included in the new version of Veeam Backup Free Edition and in Veeam
Backup &amp; Replication v7 when they become generally available in the second half
of this year.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today announced that it has amended its
warrant agreement with Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and certain of its subsidiaries
(collectively, Berkshire Hathaway) from cash settlement to net share settlement.


"We intend to hold a significant investment in Goldman Sachs, a firm that I did
my first transaction with more than 50 years ago," said Warren Buffett, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of Berkshire Hathaway. "I have been privileged to
have known and admired Goldman's executive leadership team since my first
meeting with Sidney Weinberg in 1940." 

"We are pleased that Berkshire Hathaway intends to remain a long-term investor
in Goldman Sachs," said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
of Goldman Sachs. 

The warrant had provided Berkshire Hathaway the right to purchase 43,478,260
shares of Goldman Sachs' common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at an exercise
price of $115 at any time until October 1, 2013. Under the amended agreement,
Goldman Sachs will deliver to Berkshire Hathaway the number of shares of common
stock equal in value to the difference between the average closing price over
the 10 trading days preceding October 1, 2013 and the exercise price of $115
multiplied by the number of shares of common stock covered by the warrant
(43,478,260). 

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a leading global investment banking, securities
and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services
to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations,
financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. Founded in

financial centers around the world.

In this rich anthology, Kennedy presents poems that she loved as a child,
discovered more recently, or were shared with her by family and friends. Divided
into ten sections focusing on subjects such as nature, sports, monsters and
fairies, war and school, friendship and family, her choices reflect both classic
poets and new voices, little-known gems and standards that still stir today`s
new readers, like the young students at DreamYard, a school and arts program she
works with and admires. In a tribute to those young artists who have in turn
inspired her, their poem "Voices Rising" is included in the section called "I`m
Expecting You!" in a four-page spread. 

"Poetry announces us," Caroline Kennedy writes in one of her chapter
introductions. "It is the most personal and direct expression of who we are and
how we are feeling. In a world where it sometimes seems that no one is
listening, poetry can help us find our own voice and be heard. Growing up is
hard, but poems can protect, guide, and connect us to others. If we learn them
by heart, the emotion, the wisdom, and the power they contain can bring joy to
our lives and sustain us through difficult times." 

Kennedy`s chapter introductions offer a rich mix of insight and wit. She shares
memories of her own growing up, with smart observations about the poetry she`s
chosen and the history that infuses some of the pieces (including President
Lincoln`s Gettysburg Address). She weaves in stories on Seneca`s technique for
remembering his students` names, the lovely image of a memory-palace and where
that idea came from, as well as reflections on how one poem addresses the
elements of a meaningful life, and how another, when memorized, helped her son
keep nature close at hand while confined to a classroom. In an intimate and
conversational tone, Kennedy illuminates why poetry about elves and other
magical creatures has much to teach us about imagining other worlds, and how
nonsensical poems not only make us laugh but also take on more serious work of
language and artistry. At the end she includes an extra-credit section of poems
that, in their complexity and length, present the challenge of memorization
seriously. 

In support of the release of Poems to Learn by Heart, Kennedy will embark on an
eight-city U.S. tour with events at bookstores and libraries. She will also
serve as the honorary chair of National Library Week, which takes place April
14-20, 2013. A Common Core teachers guide for Poems to Learn by Heart is
available at Disney.com/PoemsbyHeart. 

Caroline Kennedy is an attorney and the author/editor of ten New York Times
best-selling books on constitutional law, American history, politics, and
poetry. She is President of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation and Chair of
the Senior Advisory Committee of the Institute of Politics at Harvard
University. A graduate of Harvard and Columbia Law School, she also serves on
the board of directors of New Visions for Public Schools and is Honorary Chair
of the American Ballet Theater. From 2002-2011, she was Vice Chair of the Fund
for Public Schools, which has raised over $300 million to support public school
reform and engaged a record number of New Yorkers to volunteer in New York City
schools. 

Jon J Muth is the author and illustrator of numerous inspiring and award-winning
books for children, including the Caldecott Honor Book Zen Shorts. He also
collaborated with Caroline Kennedy on the New York Times best seller A Family of
Poems, the companion to Poems to Learn by Heart. Born in Ohio, he now lives with
his family in New York State.

verticals in Europe.
* JPD posted 25% growth in European revenue over the last year.

"British Airways have worked with JPD since 2010. During that time JPD has recovered significant
sums of money on our behalf from various sources including open supplier credits, duplicate
payments and tax recoveries

reassuring to have JPD working as a safety net on our behalf actively uncovering and pursuing all
monies due," said Elaine Mozdzynski, Payment Services Manager for British Airways. "Renewing our
contract with JPD was an easy decision, as they respond quickly and efficiently to the frequent
changes that we experience in our business."

Nick Hunt, European Managing Director for JPD Financial commented, "We are pleased with our growth
in Europe, particularly when it is a result of both new client acquisition and existing such as
British Airways deciding to renew a multi-year contract."

"It is critical we have a strong international presence to properly support our growing global
customer base," said Dennis Donahue, JPD Financial President and COO. "JPD Financial's
international growth demonstrates that our approach to service delivery is working and that we are
not only attracting large new customers but more importantly, that renewing a contract with us is
an easy, clear-cut decision for our existing clients."

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigns final ratings to twenty-two classes of
mortgage pass-through certificates from J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust 2013-1, a
jumbo prime RMBS transaction. Concurrently we have withdrawn our preliminary
ratings on the certificates, which were assigned on March 20, 2013. 

The mortgage pool backing J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust 2013-1 is comprised of 752
first-lien mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of $616,260,382 as
of the cut-off date. The pool is divided into two sub-pools, one consisting
almost entirely of 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, the other consisting of a mix
of 30-year ARMs with 7 or 10-year fixed periods and 15-year fixed-rate
mortgages. The pool is characterized by substantial borrower equity in each
mortgaged property, as evidenced by the weighted average LTV (63%) and CLTV
(65%). The weighted average credit score of the mortgage pool is 769, which is
well within the "prime" mortgage range. 

KBRA`s analysis of the transaction included a loan-level analysis of the
mortgage pools using our Residential Mortgage Default and Loss Model, together
with a review of the transaction parties, results of loan file reviews performed
by independent third party firms and review of the legal structure and key
documentation. This analysis is further described in our U.S. RMBS Rating
Methodology.

(NICE) said on Thursday the new treatment was not a
cost-effective use of National Health Service resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision follows a similar rebuff for Pfizer's lung
cancer drug Xalkori on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the NICE recommendations are preliminary and
subject to further consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on Wednesday its executive pay would reflect certain incidents in 2012 as well as a financial performance that outpaced the U.S. oil company's peer group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Wall Street Journal, Chevron's board has trimmed equity awards by 11 percent and bonuses by at least 10 percent for Chief Executive John Watson and several other executives as a result of a string of accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman declined to comment beyond the statement, which said that despite the company's strong overall performance, it had some "operating incidents" during 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These incidents were reflected in Mr. Watson's and other senior executives' compensation awards," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few months after an oil leak off Brazil in late 2011, a fire burned for weeks at a Chevron well off the coast of Nigeria in early 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there was the fire at Chevron's oldest refinery in Richmond, California, which led to damage that has kept the plant operating at reduced capacity for more than six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The board's compensation actions reflect the fact that Chevron takes management accountability seriously," the company said. "Our leadership understands that there are consequences when it doesn't meet expectations, especially in areas as critical as process safety."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson earned total compensation of $24.7 million in 2011, including $5.1 million in stock, $7.2 million in option awards and $4 million in non-equity incentives, according to a filing last April with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The equivalent filing for 2012 is due from Chevron in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(Business Wire)--
Walter J. Scheller III, Chief Executive Officer of Walter Energy, Inc. (NYSE:
WLT) (TSX: WLT), today provided an update on the Company`s decision to curtail
production at its Willow Creek mine. 

"Over the past 18 months, since I became CEO, one of my key priorities has been
aggressive operational management," Mr. Scheller said. "While it is never easy
to curtail operations at a facility, our commitment to idle operations where
necessary is central to the Company`s operating plan. This plan has been
developed with the full support of our Board. 

"We greatly regret the impact this decision will have on many of our dedicated
employees," Mr. Scheller continued. "I would like to commend them for their work
in significantly improving our productivity and costs at the mine over the past
year. 

"The current price environment for met coal dictated that we curtail production
at Willow Creek in order to ensure we generate a sufficient economic return in
mining the high quality met coal reserves at the site. Given the tremendous
progress that has been made in the cost structure at the mine, when we see signs
of sustainable market pricing conditions we would expect to ramp up production,"
Mr. Scheller concluded. 

The mine, which will be curtailed in April, currently employs approximately 350
employees, of which approximately 250 will be affected by the decision to
curtail production. The Willow Creek mine will continue with limited operations
to support Walter Energy`s Brule mine. 

Willow Creek is the fifth mine Walter Energy has announced plans to curtail or
idle as part of its initiatives to address underperforming assets. Last week the
Company said it was accelerating the closure of its North River underground mine
in Alabama. In addition, the Company has also idled the Aberpergwm mine in South
Wales and the Gauley Eagle underground and surface mines in West Virginia, and
has curtailed production at its Maple underground mine, also in West Virginia. 

As previously disclosed, the Company expects to record a one-time cash charge of
approximately $7.5 million in severance costs in connection with its curtailing
production of the Willow Creek operations. The Company currently expects that
full year 2013 metallurgical coal production will be in line with production
levels in 2012. 

The Willow Creek surface mine, located near the town of Chetwynd in Northeast
British Columbia, produces metallurgical coal with production plans of one third
hard coking coal and two thirds low-volatile PCI coal over the mine's expected
20-year life. The Willow Creek mine had approximately 19.0 million metric tons
of recoverable coal reserves as of December 31, 2012.

The 'AAAsf' rating on the senior certificates reflects the 7.40% subordination
provided by the 2.50% class B-1, 1.50% class B-2, 1.25% class B-3, 0.85% class
B-4 and 1.30% class B-5. The $8,012,381 class B-5 certificate will not be rated
by Fitch. 

Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, the clear
capital structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by third party
underwriters. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will act as the master
servicer and U.S. Bank Trust N.A. will act as the Trustee for the transaction.
For federal income tax purposes, elections will be made to treat the trust as
one or more real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs). 

This transaction includes the use of Pentalpha Capital Group LLC (Pentalpha) as
representation &amp; warranties (R) breach reviewer for the benefit of the trust.
The securities administrator will instruct Pentalpha to review any loan that
satisfies the review trigger. Pentalpha will review the loan using the breach
determination review procedures outlined in the transaction documents to
identify failures with respect to one or more of the breach determination
procedures. If a failure exists, Pentalpha will determine whether or not the
failure is material, based on materiality conditions outlined in the transaction
documents. Pentalpha will then provide the final results of its review and
determination to the securities administrator. 

JPMMT 2013-1 will be J.P. Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Corp.'s first transaction
of prime residential mortgages since 2007. The certificates are supported by a
pool of prime fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans. The loans are
predominantly fully amortizing; however, 8.9% have a 10-year interest-only (IO)
period. The aggregate pool included loans originated from J.P. Morgan Chase Bank
(48.1%), First Republic Bank (40.7%), BMI Residential Mortgage Loan Trust 2010
(4.0%), Bank of Manhattan (3.9%), Johnson Bank (1.7%) and Dubuque Bank (1.6%). 

As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 752 loans with a total
balance of $616,260,382; an average balance of $819,495; a weighted average
original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 65.1%, and a weighted average
coupon (WAC) of 3.9%. Rate/Term and cash out refinances account for 53.8% and
11.6% of the loans, respectively. The weighted average original FICO credit
score of the pool is 768. Owner-occupied properties comprise 88.8% of the loans.
The states that represent the largest geographic concentration are California
(51.6%), New York (9.4%), and Massachusetts (7.1%) 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

High-Quality Mortgage Pool: The collateral pool consists of a mixture of 15-,
20-, and 30-year fixed rate mortgages (77%) and seven- and 10-year hybrid ARMs
(23%) to borrowers with strong credit profiles, full documentation, low
leverage, and significant liquid reserves. A 65.1% CLTV provides a significant
buffer against potential home price declines. Strong borrower quality is
reflected in the 768 weighted average (WA) FICO and $633,428 WA household
income. In addition, third-party due diligence was conducted on 100% of the pool
and the results indicated strong underwriting controls. 

Weak Representations and Warranties (R) Framework: While the transaction
benefits from strong rep providers, Fitch believes the value of the R
framework is significantly diluted by qualifying and conditional language that
substantially reduces lender loan breach liability and the inclusion of sunsets
for a number of provisions including fraud. While the agency believes that the
high credit quality pool and clean diligence results mitigate the R risks to
some degree, Fitch considered the weaker framework in its expected loss
estimation and credit enhancement analysis.

Strong Counterparties: The transaction benefits from strong counterparties with
88.8% originated by JPMCB and FRB, two entities with 'above average' origination
platforms and strong financial capacities to meet potential repurchase
obligations. With respect to servicing, Fitch maintains a 'RPS2+' servicer
rating on JPMCB and views FRB as an acceptable servicer. The transaction also
benefits from the participation of an experienced master servicer, Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. (rated 'RMS1').

Limited Alignment of Interests: While JPMCB will be providing R into the
transaction as the originator of 48.1% of the collateral pool, the sponsor, J.P.
Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Corp. (JPMMAC), does not anticipate retaining any
portion of the capital structure or associated credit risk. The lack of shared
risk between the issuer and investors is a divergence from recent transactions
that Fitch has rated. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

Fitch's analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how the
ratings would react to steeper market value declines (MVDs) than assumed at both
the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and national levels. The implied rating
sensitivities are only an indication of some of the potential outcomes and do
not consider other risk factors that the transaction may become exposed to or be
considered in the surveillance of the transaction. 

Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected lower
home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool. The model
currently projects sustainable MVDs (sMVDs) at the MSA level. For three of the
top 15 regions in the mortgage pool, Fitch's SHP model does not project declines
in home prices, and for another region in the top 15, the projected decline is
less than 5.00%. These regions include Chicago-Joliet-Naperville in Illinois
(5.6%), Boston-Quincy in Massachusetts (4.1%), Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale in Arizona
(2.3%), and Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown in Texas (1.7%). The sensitivity analyses
indicated no impact on ratings for all bonds in each scenario. 

Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings would
react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes MVDs of 10%,
20%, and 30%, in addition to the model projected 14% for this pool. The analysis
indicates there is some potential rating migration with higher MVDs, compared
with the model projection. 

Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the presale
report titled ' J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust, Series 2013-1', dated Mar. 20, 2013,
which is available on Fitch's web site, www.fitchratings.com. 

Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings.

* Two hundred teachers from 50 states to upgrade math and science teaching
skills 
* ExxonMobil partnered with PGA golfer Phil Mickelson to improve math and
science education 
* Academy has trained nearly 3,6000 teachers impacting more than 230,000
students

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Two hundred elementary school teachers from across the United States have been
selected to attend the 2013 Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy, a
professional development program designed to enhance math and science teaching
skills. Participants learn how to bring science, technology, engineering and
math (STEM) to life in the classroom, to inspire students to study and pursue
careers in the critical fields. 

"Today`s teachers and students must learn how to `speak science` to ensure we
remain competitive as a nation," said PGA golfer Phil Mickelson. "The Mickelson
ExxonMobil Teachers Academy encourages teachers to use real-world examples and
in-class experiments to build excitement about STEM learning, educating the next
generation of American innovators." 

The successful educators teach third through fifth grade and were chosen from
more than 1,500 applications submitted at www.sendmyteacher.com. Selection was
based on teacher qualifications, dedication to inspiring students at an early
age and overall commitment to enhancing the teaching profession. A panel of
educators from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the National
Science Teachers Association selected participants to attend the national
academy, held July 22-26, 2013, at Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New
Jersey. 

The academy is an intensive, one-week, all-expenses-paid program developed in
2005 when ExxonMobil partnered with Mickelson and his wife, Amy. Launched with
support from the National Science Teachers Association and Math Solutions, the
initiative has trained 3,600 teachers benefiting more than 230,000 students
nationwide. In addition to the 200 teachers attending this year`s national
academy in New Jersey, 400 more teachers will attend regional academies in
Louisiana and Texas. 

"The academy reaffirmed my belief that the classroom can and should be one of
the most exciting places a child visits," said Krissy Venosdale, a teacher from
St. Louis who attended in 2012. "Educators can reinvigorate their classrooms by
sharing real-world applications of science and technology - like our country`s
space program." 

Currently, U.S. students rank 17th and 25th globally in math and science,
respectively, according to results from the 2009 Programme for International
Student Assessment. Research from the National Science Foundation shows that
eight of the 10 fastest growing job sectors require math and science skills.
Professional development in these subjects builds confidence for educators to
become further advocates for STEM while igniting a passion in their students. 

"Today`s teachers are critical to ensuring students are ready to pursue STEM
related careers, and ExxonMobil recognizes the ongoing need to support these
professionals," said Suzanne McCarron, Exxon Mobil Corporation's general manager
of public and government affairs. "The academy equips teachers with the tools
and strategies needed to build enthusiasm about math and science and develop
future scientists and engineers." 

The Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers Academy is part of ExxonMobil`s long-term
commitment to education. The company supports initiatives that encourage
students to take an active interest in math and science careers, support the
professional development of highly qualified teachers and promote involvement by
women and minority students. 

For a complete list of teachers selected to attend the national 2013 Mickelson
ExxonMobil Teachers Academy, visit www.sendmyteacher.com. The application
process for the 2014 academy, which will celebrate the program`s 10th
anniversary, opens today.

Responds to Walter Energy`s Misleading and Flawed Accusations

Urges Stockholders to Sign, Date and Mail the GOLD Proxy Card Today
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Audley Capital Advisors LLP (including certain related funds and investment
vehicles, "Audley Capital") issued today the following letter to stockholders of
Walter Energy, Inc. (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT) ("Walter Energy" or "the Company") in
connection with Audley Capital`s five nominees for election to the Board of
Directors at the Company`s upcoming 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April
25, 2013. 

Audley Capital urges Walter Energy`s stockholders to vote the GOLD proxy card
for Audley Capital`s five highly-qualified and experienced director nominees. 

Julian Treger, Managing Partner of Audley Capital Advisors, said, "We are
disappointed with Walter Energy`s blatant attempts to cast a shadow on the
strong credentials of our five highly-qualified and experienced director
nominees. We believe that this is the Company`s attempt to divert attention from
its continued underperformance and distract stockholders from the value that
these accomplished professionals will bring to the Board. We continue to believe
that our director nominees can work to implement the changes necessary to
correct the financial and operational missteps of the current Board." 

The full text of the letter follows: 

CHANGE IS LONG OVERDUE AT WALTER ENERGY

Dear Fellow Walter Energy Stockholder, 

On March 25, 2013, Walter Energy issued a letter to its stockholders raising
purported concerns about the slate of director nominees put forward by Audley
Capital Advisors LLP (including certain related funds and investment vehicles,
"Audley Capital") for election to Walter Energy`s Board of Directors at its
Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April 25, 2013. Needless to say, we were very
disappointed by the current Board`s attempt to mislead Walter Energy
stockholders. The present directors have presided over aloss of more than $6
billion in stockholder value since 2011 and, in our view, have shown no
accountability or contrition. Perhaps they simply fail to grasp the financial
and operational initiatives that we think are needed to create lasting value at
the Company. We wonder whether they may be reduced to making misleading personal
accusations against our nominees because they cannot persuasively defend their
own record, or will not advance a program of change. 

What is abundantly clear to us is the Company`s significant and ongoing
underperformance. We firmly believe that a reconstituted Board - including
Audley Capital`s director nominees - would be best placed to execute on
value-enhancing initiatives at the Company.

We are urging stockholders of Walter Energy to vote the GOLD proxy card to elect
our highly-qualified director nominees at the upcoming Annual Meeting on April
25, 2013. Our goal is to give stockholders the opportunity to elect directors
that can help a newly constituted Board implement initiatives that should create
lasting value at the Company. 

Walter Energy`s Recent Letter Attempts to Distract Stockholders From the Truth:
The Blatant Underperformance of the Company

We believe that Walter Energy`s recent letter is a poor attempt to distract
attention from the obvious: the Company`s consistent underperformance at the
expense of all stockholders. As fellow Walter Energy stockholders, we are
frustrated with the current performance and direction of the Company. Regardless
of Walter Energy`s attempts to distract stockholders from the Company`s weak
underlying performance, we will continue to call attention to certain unarguable
facts:

* Walter Energy`s share price has fallen approximately 79% since its peak in
April 2011 vs. only a 38% fall in the MSCI World Metals and Mining Index in the
same period; 
* Walter Energy`s Price/NPV ratio has fallen from a peak of over 1.6x during the
first quarter of 2011 to the current 0.6x, vs. the 3-year average of 0.97x; 
* Walter Energy`s net debt/stockholders` equity ratio is 228% while its peers`
net debt/stockholders` equity ratios range from 47% to 144%; 
* SG costs are significantly higher than Walter Energy`s U.S. peer group - in
fact, Walter Energy`s SG expense is from 4x to 9x the SG cost per ton of
coal sold of those peer companies; 
* The Company has missed consensus earnings expectations for seven out of the
last nine quarters; and 
* In our view, the Company`s recently announced issuance of $450 million of new
high yield debt with a coupon of 8.500% per annum reflects another case of
questionable financial judgment by the current Board, locking in expensive
long-term debt and allowing the balance sheet to deteriorate further.

We Question Where the "Important Progress" Suddenly Claimed by the Company has
Been Made?

The facts do not lie. The Company is consistently underperforming and
disappointing stockholders. Billions of dollars in stockholder value have been
lost. We believe that change is urgently needed to reverse the ongoing financial
and operational missteps by the current Board. 

Audley Capital`s Five Highly-Qualified Nominees Can Restore Confidence in the
Company

Our director nominees have the necessary mining and public company
qualifications and experience to steer Walter Energy on the path towards
long-term growth and restore confidence in the direction of the Company. Our
director nominees include individuals with extensive experience in the
metallurgical coal industry on an international basis and possess the skills
required to manage multi-jurisdictional coal operations and their financing.
What`s more, our nominees, as a group, have created billions of dollars of
realized value for investors and/or stockholders. And, although their past
accomplishments in other situations are no guaranty, they will work hard to do
the same for the long-suffering stockholders of Walter Energy. The Company`s
criticisms of our nominees are entirely without merit:

* Julian Treger is a Managing Partner of Audley Capital Advisors, whose related
funds and investment funds are long-term financial investors in publicly listed
companies, with several investments being held for more than 5 years and very
few sold within 12 months of the initial investment. Despite Walter Energy`s
assertions, Mr. Treger played a very important role with respect to Western
Coal, a company in which Audley funds were invested for several years.

As Western Coal faced insolvency, Mr. Treger was instrumental in helping to
identify and appoint a new Chief Executive Officer and independent non-executive
directors, and implement a new growth plan - all of which led to Western Coal`s
ultimate sale to Walter Energy in 2010. Needless to say, we believe that the
sale of Western Coal was in the best interest of all stockholders as it created
more than $2.5 billion of stockholder value over the course of the investment
period. The alternative scenario was allowing poor corporate governance and a
lack of skill and experience to deteriorate the value of that company - a
scenario not so different than what we believe is currently transpiring at
Walter Energy.

Mr. Treger also has a longstanding knowledge of Walter Energy and Audley Capital
has been an investor in the Company for multiple years. He has engaged with
Walter Energy on numerous occasions putting forth what were believed to be
value-enhancing ideas, only to be stonewalled on his attempts. Having lost faith
in the direction of the Company, Audley Capital sold its stock in varying
increments, including a block of its stock in July 2011, when highly-regarded
CEO Keith Calder left the Company citing "differences of opinion concerning
management philosophy" after having only held the position for 3 months, and the
Company decided not to pursue a sale of the business at a time when the share
price was well-above $100. In retrospect, the sale of Walter Energy`s stock at
that time was the right decision for Audley Capital investors.

* Robert Stan brings over 30 years of experience in the western Canadian coal
business. He also has direct knowledge of the geographic area of Walter Energy`s
Canadian mining activities. Mr. Stan has held senior management positions with
several Canadian mining companies, including Fording Coal Limited, Westar Mining
Ltd, Teck Corporation and Smoky River Coal Limited (SRCL).

Similarly, he was appointed a director of Grande Cache Coal Corporation in July
2000, President in February 2001 and Chief Executive Officer in September 2002.
During his tenure, he implemented a value-enhancing strategy and oversaw a
number of strategic initiatives that ultimately led to the sale of the company
for C$1 billion in 2012 to Winsway Coking Coal and Japanese trading house
Marubeni Corporation.

Mr. Stan served two terms as Chairman of the Coal Association of Canada until
June 2012, and was recently reappointed for a further 3 year term as the
Canadian representative on the IEA Clean Coal Center`s Coal Industry Advisory
Board. Walter Energy`s recent letter tries to undercut Mr. Stan`s robust
credentials by dredging up a pending allegation of insider trading. Both Audley
Capital and Mr. Stan believe that the allegation is completely without merit and
will ultimately be withdrawn.

* Lawrence M. Clark, Jr. serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of JW
Resources, Inc., a private operator of thermal coal assets in Central Appalachia
(a position in the coal industry which Walter Energy conveniently omits in its
criticism), and as Managing Member of BalanTrove Management, LLC, a corporate
advisory business catering to small and middle market resource and energy
companies. Mr. Clark brings strong industry and financial expertise that we
believe will be very beneficial to Walter Energy`s Board, including having
actively participated in numerous financial restructurings. At Harbinger Capital
Partners, he played an instrumental role in overseeing dozens of investments
that generated hundreds of millions of dollars of profit for investors. 
* Mark Lochtenberg currently serves asExecutive Chairman and was one of the
founding Executive Directors of Cockatoo Coal Limited, an Australian
metallurgical coal producer that operates in different geographic regions than
Walter Energy. He previously served as co-head of Glencore International AG`s
worldwide coal division, and spent 13 years at Glencore`s commodity trading
concern, overseeing a range of trading activities including the purchase and
aggregation of the coal project portfolio that would later become Xstrata Coal.
We believe that Mr. Lochtenberg would bring an immensely valuable in-depth
understanding of the sectors in which Walter Energy operates. Despite his strong
credentials, the Company`s recent letter questions an obscure legal proceeding
between Cockatoo and a minority stockholder in that company, Baralaba Coal Pty
Ltd. In fact, the two parties settled their legal proceedings in October 2010
when the Supreme Court of New South Wales dismissed the proceedings. Walter
Energy blatantly ignores Mr. Lochtenberg`s strong credentials to instead
highlight opaque particulars in what we believe is an attempt to confuse
stockholders. 
* Eddie Scholtz brings over 40 years of experience in the mining industry,
primarily in South America and Africa. He previously served in various
managerial capacities at BHP Billiton, including overseeing one of the largest
coal businesses in the world. Throughout his tenure at BHPBilliton SA, he helped
increased profitability, reduce costs and bolster the Company`s safety record.
During his time as President and Chief Operating Officer, he oversaw operations
producing 80 million tons per annum.

Mr. Scholtz was also one of two COO`s at CIC Energy Corp., a junior miner listed
on the TSX with assets in Botswana. He was charged with exploration and mine
planning and oversaw the recording of a 2.7 billion ton resource of which 90%
was in the measured category in terms of the TSX rules. In addition, if Walter
Energy had reviewed and described the record properly, Mr. Scholtz had merely
assisted Talon Metals for a period of eight months, while still in the employ of
CIC Energy, with the consent of all board members of CIC.

We believe that the Company again attempts to mislead stockholders regarding Mr.
Scholtz`s strong reputation by calling attention to obscure and incorrect items
regarding his accomplished track record.

Walter Energy Is Grasping For Arguments When They Should Be Focused On Change

We were baffled that the Company would choose to disparage what we believe are
value-enhancing initiatives and talented, professional and independent director
nominees who could help bring substantial long-term value to the Company. The
present Board and management`s attempt to belittle efforts to drive stockholder
value at the Company seems to us to be a poor excuse to cover the Company`s weak
performance. 

We believe that Walter Energy simply has an indefensible track record. The time
for change is now. We are presenting all stockholders with an alternative - to
support new director nominees who have a proven track record of operational and
financial success. 

Vote "FOR" Audley Capital`s Director Nominees to Help Unlock Long-Term Value

We believe that these new directors and implementation of our previously
detailed initiatives should contribute to enhanced investor confidence and
prospects for the Company. We have outlined a comprehensive plan that should
create long-term value for ALL stockholders. 

We ask stockholders to please sign, date and mail the GOLDproxy card today to
elect Audley Capital`s director nominees who will work to execute a clear
strategic plan to drive long-term growth and value creation. 

We appreciate all the positive feedback we have received from our fellow
stockholders and thank you for your support. 

If you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares, please call our
proxy solicitor Okapi Partners LLC at (877) 208-8903.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has pushed hard in recent years to become a fixture in the American living room &#8212; most notably via the XBox 360. A lesser-known part of its living-room play is its MediaRoom IPTV unit,&#160;which has been adopted by the likes of AT and Deutsche Telekom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it appears Microsoft may be gearing up to sell its MediaRoom business to Ericsson, Bloomberg reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MediaRoom&#8217;s IPTV technology lets phone companies offer TV service together with voice and broadband, allowing them to compete with entrenched cable companies like Comcast. Microsoft describes MediaRoom as the &#8220;world&#8217;s #1 IPTV platform,&#8221; but even so, there may not be much room left for the company to grow the business, Exane BNP Paribas analyst Alexander Peterc tells Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most consumers likely don&#8217;t even know that MediaRoom exists, which is another reason the company may want to let go of the unit. As a business-to-business play, it would be far more at home at Ericsson, which is primarily focused on providing enterprise telecommunication equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT uses the technology to power its U-Verse service, which has 4.5 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would likely be better off figuring out more ways to make the Xbox 360 (and its successor, which is expected to debut this year) an integral part of the living room. MediaRoom actually allows the Xbox 360 to be used as a TV receiver, but that integration came after years of delays.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Deals, Media, VentureBeat&lt;/p&gt;

EMERYVILLE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
KineMed Inc. (www.kinemed.com) today announced the renewal of a non-exclusive
research collaboration with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) for the advancement of novel
approaches towards metabolic disease, in particular Type II Diabetes. The
collaboration will employ KineMed`s unique dynamic proteomics technology
platform to map the impact of potential drug candidates on specific metabolic
pathways. 

Diabetes is an emerging global healthcare epidemic with an estimated 347 million
people affected, according to the WHO. Diabetes is predicted to become the
seventh leading cause of death in the world by the year 2030 and total deaths
from diabetes are projected to rise by more than 50% in the next 10 years. 

In the United States Type II diabetes affects over one quarter of Americans over
the age of 65. Diabetes is a major cause of heart disease and stroke, and is now
also the leading cause of kidney failure, non-traumatic lower-limb amputations
and new cases of blindness among adults. 

Despite 50 years of drug research, over 60% of patients remain unresponsive to
current therapies, requiring novel approaches to address fundamental metabolic
processes in diabetes. 

"We are very pleased to announce the renewal of this ongoing partnership in an
important area of medicine that affects so many Americans. Powerful discovery
and investigative abilities of novel disease pathways are key strengths of our
translational platform," said Dr. Scott Turner, Executive Vice-President, R at
KineMed. "We look forward to continuing to work with Pfizer to accelerate and
rapidly de-risk the advancement of novel compounds in pre-clinical and clinical
trials." 

About KineMed, Inc.

KineMed has created a broadly enabling proprietary technology that is
potentially transformative in drug development and personalized medicine. Our
Proteome Dynamics and Virtual Biopsy techniques provide a unique marriage of
broad screening capacity (hypothesis-free "-omics" interrogation of living
systems) with functional significance (translational interpretability).
KineMed`s biomarkers are fully translational from animal to man, seamlessly
harmonizing data across pre-clinical and clinical phases of development, through
to the diagnosis and management of diseases including fibrotic,
neurodegenerative, metabolic, cardiovascular disease and cancer. 

KineMed has developed the first practically-useful systems biology technology
that can be used directly in humans, with applications not only in drug
discovery and development, but also in clinical diagnosis, personalized medicine
and therapeutic monitoring. Over the past few years our advances in Proteome
Dynamics and Virtual Biopsies have changed both textbook thought about diseases
and the development path of several drug candidates. Notable accomplishments
include:

* Developing a "tachometer" of reverse cholesterol transport and metrics of
plasma lipid dynamics 
* Transforming the pathogenic model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
* Developing the first blood-based biomarker of tissue fibrogenesis in humans 
* Generating the first accurate laboratory biomarker of muscle mass in humans 
* Creating the first diagnostic tests of disease-modifying processes in a
neurodegenerative disease (Parkinson`s Disease)

CALGARY, Alberta--(Business Wire)--
The first sentence of the second paragraph should read: During the 2012 year,
the Partnership recognized revenue of $14,639,728, cost of sales of $12,726,508,
other income of $9,154 and other expenses of $860,925 resulting in a net income
of $1,061,449 (sted: ... resulting in a net loss of $1,061,449). 

The corrected release reads as follows: 

WALTON BIG LAKE DEVELOPMENT L.P. REPORTS FISCAL YEAR-END AND Q4 2012 RESULTS

Walton Big Lake Development L.P. (the "Partnership") announced today the
Partnership`s results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 and for the
fourth quarter of 2012. 

Fiscal Year-End and Fourth Quarter Financial Results 

During the 2012 year, the Partnership recognized revenue of $14,639,728, cost of
sales of $12,726,508, other income of $9,154 and other expenses of $860,925
resulting in a net income of $1,061,449. The revenue earned during the 2012 year
was in respect of the sale of 107 of the 162 lots in Phase 1. The revenue
recognition was triggered by the completion of onsite roads for the committed
lots and payment of second deposits for those lots. During the fourth quarter of
2012, the Partnership generated total revenues of nil and total expenses of
$319,377 resulting in a net loss of $319,337. 

Highlights for the Fiscal Year Ended December, 31, 2012 

During 2012, the Partnership accomplished the following milestones:

* Submitted the subdivision plan for Phase 1 for registration. The plan was
subsequently registered in the second quarter; 
* Building permits for constructing houses in Phase 1 were released by the City
of Edmonton. Construction of showhomes commenced; 
* Completed construction of the offsite utilities, including the water line and
sanitary sewer, and the paving of onsite roads in Phase 1 and offsite roads; 
* Submitted the applications for zoning and subdivision of Phase 2 to the City
for approval. 
* Single-family and semi-detached showhomes were opened to the public; and 
* Issued the second cash distribution of $4.8 million to limited partners in the
amount of $2.29 per unit. This follows a cash distribution of $1.00 per unit
made in 2011.

The completion dates for many of the milestones for Phase 1 are behind the times
initially anticipated by management. These delays were primarily the result of: 

i. approvals to initiate construction engineering drawing approvals from the
City of Edmonton taking longer than anticipated; 

ii. rezoning and subdivision approvals from the City of Edmonton for Phase 1
taking longer than anticipated; and 

iii. adverse weather slowing contractor production or halting construction
activities due to site conditions. 

While the delays extended the completion dates for Phase 1 of the project,
management expects that the overall five-year project time frame, as disclosed
in the prospectus, will be unaffected and the Partnership remains on track for
achieving its investment objectives. 

Additional Information 

Launched in 2010, the Partnership owns a 136.5-acre residential project in
northwest Edmonton, Alberta. The project is being developed in three phases and
marketed under the name "Hawk`s Ridge at Big Lake." 

The Partnership is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the development
of the properties is managed by Walton Development and Management (Alberta) LP,
both of which are members of the Walton Group. 

Walton is a multinational group of real estate investment and development
companies headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. As one of North America`s

&lt;p&gt;* Class action lawsuit allowed to proceed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer said to hide cardiovascular risks of pain drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has failed to
persuade a federal judge to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit
accusing the company of fraudulently misrepresenting the safety
of its Celebrex and Bextra pain-relieving drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dismissing some of the claims, U.S. District Judge
Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan said a reasonable jury could
find that Pfizer and several top executives intended to mislead
shareholders about the drugs' cardiovascular risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The record is replete with evidence that defendants
recognized that Celebrex and Bextra had associated
cardiovascular risks, that such risks would be considered
material by investors, and that defendants nonetheless
misrepresented and actively concealed these risks," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs are led by the Teachers' Retirement System of
Louisiana and a class was certified on July 5, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swain scheduled a final pre-trial conference for July 12 and
directed both sides to meet with a federal magistrate judge or
an outside mediator to work on a settlement before then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in a statement: "We appreciate the court's
decision narrowing the claims, and look forward to presenting
our case at trial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about the safety of Celebrex and Bextra began to
mount following the release of medical studies in late 2004,
when rival Merck &amp; Co withdrew its own Vioxx drug from
the market because of associated cardiovascular risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrex sales totaled $3.3 billion and Bextra sales totaled
$1.29 billion in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pfizer pulled Bextra from the U.S. market in April 2005
at the recommendation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
and sales of Celebrex fell by nearly half that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in 2009, Pfizer agreed to pay $2.3 billion to settle a
U.S. Department of Justice probe into the marketing of Bextra
and other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company still sells Celebrex, which is
intended to treat arthritis pain and inflammation, as well as
acute pain, and whose sales totaled $2.72 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Pfizer won a patent extension giving it
marketing exclusivity over the drug, whose chemical name is
celecoxib, until December 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit covers investors who bought Pfizer stock between
Oct. 31, 2000 and Oct. 19, 2005, a period in which the company's
share price fell by roughly half and its market value tumbled by
well over $100 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several big investors, including the California pension
funds Calpers and Calstrs, "opted out" of the class last year,
enabling them to sue on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer bought Pharmacia Corp, which originally developed
Celebrex and Bextra, in April 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares closed up 22 cents at $28.86 on the New York
Stock Exchange. Swain released her opinion after U.S. markets
closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re: Pfizer Inc Securities Litigation, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 05-md-01688.&lt;/p&gt;

CALGARY, Alberta--(Business Wire)--
Walton Edgemont Development Corporation (the "Corporation") announced today the
Corporation`s results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, and for the
fourth quarter of 2012. 

Fiscal Year-End and Fourth Quarter Financial Results 

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, the Corporation generated total
revenues of $42,732, total expenses of $1,049,467, and a net loss before tax of
$1,006,735. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Corporation generated total
revenues of $4,489, total expenses of $348,380, and a net loss before tax of
$343,891. The nature and amount of the expenses incurred by the Corporation
during both the 2012 fiscal year and the fourth quarter of 2012 were consistent
with management`s expectations. The overall net loss incurred by the Corporation
during both the 2012 fiscal year and the fourth quarter of 2012 were also
consistent with management`s expectations because the Corporation is not
expected to generate significant revenue, except during periods when the sale of
lots is completed. 

Highlights for the Fiscal Year Ended December, 31, 2012 

During 2012, the Corporation accomplished the following milestones:

* In February, the Corporation received zoning approval from the City of
Edmonton for Phase 1 of the project; 
* In April, the Corporation received approval for the subdivision of the
Property; 
* In April, building permits for eight showhomes were released by the City of
Edmonton; 
* In August, the Corporation commenced underground utility construction for
Phase 1 of the project; 
* In September, the Corporation issued its first payment on the debentures. The
total amount of interest paid by the Corporation was $1,722,455; 
* In October, the Corporation completed underground utility construction for the
majority of committed lots in Phase 1; 
* In October, submitted zoning and subdivision application for Phase 2 to the
City of Edmonton; and 
* In November, surface work for the committed lots was substantially completed
in Phase 1.

Subsequent to the year-end, more than 800 people visited Woodhaven Edgemont on
Saturday, March 2, 2013, to view the showhomes and participate in the grand
opening of the Corporation`s development in southwest Edmonton. 

In comparison to the anticipated completion dates for the Phase 1 milestones as
disclosed in the Corporation`s prospectus dated June 27, 2011, (the
"Prospectus"), the completion date and anticipated completion date for several
of the Phase 1 milestones are slightly behind schedule. These delays are not
expected to affect the ability of the Corporation to complete the project within
the approximate six-year time frame disclosed in the Prospectus, and remain on
track for achieving an internal rate of return of 13.5%. 

Additional Information 

Launched in 2011, the Corporation owns a 201.5-acre residential project in
southwest Edmonton, Alberta. The project is being developed in four phases and
marketed under the name "Woodhaven Edgemont." 

The Corporation is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the development
of the properties is managed by Walton Development and Management (Alberta) LP,
both of which are members of the Walton Group.

CALGARY, Alberta--(Business Wire)--
Walton Westphalia Development Corporation (the "Corporation") announced today
its results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 and for the fourth
quarter of 2012. 

Fiscal Year-End and Fourth Quarter Financial Results

For the period January 4, 2012 to December 31, 2012, the Corporation recognized
revenues of $3,771,118, cost of sales of $3,771,118, other income of $41,275,
other expenses of $1,049,513 and a comprehensive loss of $1,029,897. The
revenues earned by the Corporation during the period from January 4, 2012 to
December 31, 2012, were comprised of the proceeds from the land sale to Walton
Westphalia Europe, LP ("WWE") of $3,771,118 with a corresponding cost of sales
of $3,771,118. The other expenses for the period January 4, 2012, to December
31, 2012, primarily consisted of $452,576 in costs incurred for the preparation
of the initial public offering and private placement and $336,602 in costs for
the management of the Corporation. 

During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Corporation generated total revenues of
$888,999, cost of sales of $888,999, other income of $17,117, other expenses of
$277,143 and a comprehensive loss of $281,685. The revenues earned by the
Corporation were comprised of the proceeds from the land sale to WWE of $888,999
with a corresponding cost of sales of $888,999. The other expenses for the
fourth quarter primarily consisted of $58,465 in costs incurred for the Private
Placement and $135,074 in costs incurred for the management of the Corporation. 

The nature and amount of the expenses incurred by the Corporation for the
year-to-date period from January 4, 2012 to December 31, 2012, were consistent
with management`s expectations for the period. The net loss incurred by the
Corporation for the year-to-date period from January 4, 2012 to December 31,
2012 was also consistent with management`s expectations because the Corporation
is not expected to generate significant revenue, except during periods when the
sale of lots is completed. 

Highlights for the Fiscal Year Ended December, 31, 2012

Corporation achieved the following milestones during 2012:

* Completed its initial public offering and private placement.

County which received approval in Q4 2012.

* Received approvals from county and state agencies on its detailed site plan,
technical specifications for water and sewer construction, and concept plan for
an interchange to a primary state highway. Approval of the detailed site plan by
the County was the critical step to initiating site work. The steps remaining to
start site work are administrative in nature.

Subsequent to the year-end, the Corporation announced on March 4, 2013, it had
participated, along with other companies in the Walton Group of Companies, in
submitting a response to a Request for Information from the United States
General Services Administration in relation to a new headquarters facility for

CALGARY, Alberta--(Business Wire)--
Walton Big Lake Development L.P. (the "Partnership") announced today the
Partnership`s results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 and for the
fourth quarter of 2012. 

Fiscal Year-End and Fourth Quarter Financial Results 

During the 2012 year, the Partnership recognized revenue of $14,639,728, cost of
sales of $12,726,508, other income of $9,154 and other expenses of $860,925
resulting in a net loss of $1,061,449. The revenue earned during the 2012 year
was in respect of the sale of 107 of the 162 lots in Phase 1. The revenue
recognition was triggered by the completion of onsite roads for the committed
lots and payment of second deposits for those lots. During the fourth quarter of
2012, the Partnership generated total revenues of nil and total expenses of
$319,377 resulting in a net loss of $319,337. 

Highlights for the Fiscal Year Ended December, 31, 2012 

During 2012, the Partnership accomplished the following milestones:

* Submitted the subdivision plan for Phase 1 for registration. The plan was
subsequently registered in the second quarter; 
* Building permits for constructing houses in Phase 1 were released by the City
of Edmonton. Construction of showhomes commenced; 
* Completed construction of the offsite utilities, including the water line and
sanitary sewer, and the paving of onsite roads in Phase 1 and offsite roads; 
* Submitted the applications for zoning and subdivision of Phase 2 to the City
for approval. 
* Single-family and semi-detached showhomes were opened to the public; and 
* Issued the second cash distribution of $4.8 million to limited partners in the
amount of $2.29 per unit. This follows a cash distribution of $1.00 per unit
made in 2011.

The completion dates for many of the milestones for Phase 1 are behind the times
initially anticipated by management. These delays were primarily the result of: 

i. approvals to initiate construction engineering drawing approvals from the
City of Edmonton taking longer than anticipated; 

ii. rezoning and subdivision approvals from the City of Edmonton for Phase 1
taking longer than anticipated; and 

iii. adverse weather slowing contractor production or halting construction
activities due to site conditions. 

While the delays extended the completion dates for Phase 1 of the project,
management expects that the overall five-year project time frame, as disclosed
in the prospectus, will be unaffected and the Partnership remains on track for
achieving its investment objectives. 

Additional Information 

Launched in 2010, the Partnership owns a 136.5-acre residential project in
northwest Edmonton, Alberta. The project is being developed in three phases and
marketed under the name "Hawk`s Ridge at Big Lake." 

The Partnership is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the development
of the properties is managed by Walton Development and Management (Alberta) LP,
both of which are members of the Walton Group. 

Walton is a multinational group of real estate investment and development

CALGARY, Alberta--(Business Wire)--
Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 (the "Partnership") and its general partner Walton
Ontario Land 1 Corporation (the "General Partner") announced today the
Partnership`s results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 and for the
fourth quarter of 2012. 

Fiscal Year-End and Fourth Quarter Financial Results

For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Partnership realized a net income of
$8,128,816 compared to a net loss of $937,288 for the year ended December 31,
2011. Of the $9,066,104 increase year over year, $9,038,458 was a direct result
of the gross margin realized on the sale of the Alliston Property. Excluding the
gross profit from the land sale, the net loss of the Partnership was comparable
to the year ended December 31, 2011. This was consistent with management`s
expectations because the Partnership is not expected to generate significant
revenues, except during periods when either property is sold. The Partnership`s
expenses are also expected to remain fairly constant throughout the life of the
Partnership because the most significant expenses of the Partnership, being the
management fees, servicing fees and director fees, are fixed over the life of
their respective contracts. 

During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Partnership realized a net income of
$8,819,016 compared to a net loss of $235,625 during the fourth quarter of 2011.
The transition from net loss in 2011 to net income in 2012 was a result of the
sale of the Alliston Property in October 2012, with $9,038,458 of gross margin
on the sale contributing to the fourth quarter`s income. The nature and amount
of the expenses incurred by the Partnership during the fourth quarter were
consistent with management`s expectations. The overall net income realized by
the Partnership for the fourth quarter of 2011 was also consistent with
management`s expectations because the Partnership is expected to generate
significant revenue during periods when property is sold. Overall, the
Partnership performed as expected by management during the fourth quarter of
2012. 

Highlights for the Fiscal Year Ended December, 31, 2012

Alliston Property
The Partnership closed the sale of its Alliston Property and subsequently issued
its first distribution of $6.00 per Unit to Unitholders. 

Ottawa Property
The second stage of the Ontario Municipal Board ("OMB") hearing regarding the
City of Ottawa`s Official Plan Amendment ("OPA") No. 76 to determine the
location of 620 hectares (1,532 acres) to be added to the City`s urban boundary,
delivered its ruling in August 2012. 

Under the ruling, the Ottawa Property was not included in the expanded urban
area boundary. The Partnership will now focus its efforts on participating in
the 2014 Official Plan review process to support and position the Ottawa
Property for inclusion in future expansions of Ottawa`s urban boundary. The
exclusion of the Ottawa Property from the urban area boundary at this time is
not anticipated to impact investment objectives and management assumptions. 

Overall, the Partnership is performing as expected by management and consistent
with the Partnership`s intention of holding its interest in the Properties as an
investment until time of sale. 

Additional Information

Launched in January 2010, the Partnership`s objective is to maximize returns to
limited partners through the acquisition, management, concept planning, and
eventual sale of two properties in Ontario; the Alliston Property, sold in
November 2012 and which consisted of two parcels totaling 154.93 acres near the
Toronto area in Alliston, and the Ottawa Property, which consists of 300 acres
adjacent to the southwest boundary of Ottawa. 

The Partnership is managed by Walton International Group Inc., part of the
Walton Group. 

Walton is a multinational group of real estate investment and development
companies headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. As one of North America`s
leading land-based real estate investment and development firms, our expertise

&lt;p&gt;March 28 (Reuters) - Pioneering journalist Barbara Walters
plans to retire in May 2014 after more than five decades as one
of the most prominent figures on U.S. television, a source
familiar with her plans said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walters, 83, is expected to announce her retirement to
viewers herself in the coming weeks, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was very much her decision. I think she will best
explain it herself," the source told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC News executives declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters, the creator and host of ABC's all-women talk show
"The View," had suffered health issues recently, including
fainting and hitting her head in January, and then was diagnosed
with chicken pox, causing her to miss more than a month of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters is best known as one of the top interviewers on U.S.
television, counting an array of world leaders as subjects,
including Cuba's Fidel Castro, Britain's Margaret Thatcher,
Saddam Hussein of Iraq and every U.S. president since Richard
Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She got her start in television journalism in 1961 as a
writer on NBC's "Today," a show that she would later co-anchor.

Borland Returns to Previous Role as Executive-In-Residence with the Organization
LAS VEGAS &amp; RENO, Nev.--(Business Wire)--
The Nevada Institute for Renewable Energy Commercialization (NIREC) today
announced that Walt Borland is resigning as its President and CEO effective
March 31, 2013.

Borland will maintain an ongoing relationship with NIREC as an
Executive-In-Residence as he had in the past and will actively support the
organization and its initiatives in this role going forward. 

Borland has been involved with NIREC since 2010 in a variety of significant
roles, and has served as its President and CEO and an Ex-Officio Trustee since
2011. He has been responsible for managing NIREC`s relationships with the Nevada
Governor`s Office of Economic Development, the U.S. Economic Development
Administration within the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Department
of Energy, among others. 

"Walt has been instrumental in developing new programs at NIREC while actively
pursuing innovation-based economic development efforts for the state," said Ian
Rogoff, Chairman of NIREC`s Board of Trustees. "Although he will certainly be
missed, NIREC will continue playing a role in Nevada`s economic diversification
efforts through its statewide innovation, commercialization and acceleration
activities." 

Borland has also been instrumental in developing NIREC`s next generation of
programs since joining the organization, including Project Vesto, The Spark and
Young Professionals in Energy&#8722;Nevada. Additionally, he has led NIREC into
partnerships with the Cleantech Open, SciTech Hookup and Startup Weekend and
provided staff support and financial assistance to other non-profit
organizations throughout Nevada. 

"NIREC has expanded its statewide mission well beyond renewable energy
commercialization," said Borland. "Advancing innovation and commercialization
efforts within the Nevada System of Higher Education, encouraging
entrepreneurial activity statewide and building a more robust private equity
network in Nevada have been the leading organizational priorities during my
tenure with NIREC." 

Prior to working with NIREC, Borland spent more than 30 years in the private
sector where he served as the President and CEO of seven venture-backed emerging
growth companies. His personal interest in helping transform Nevada`s economy
initially led him into accelerating the development of a clean energy economy in
the state and subsequently into advocating broader innovation and
commercialization initiatives. 

"It has been a tremendous pleasure to work with so many talented and passionate
individuals within NIREC and throughout the state of Nevada," said Borland.
"Stepping down as the full-time President and CEO of NIREC will again allow me
to invest my time and energy into a broader portfolio of charitable and
entrepreneurial activities." 

About NIREC

independent nonprofit organization actively involved in igniting innovation,
driving commercialization and fueling acceleration as a innovation intermediary

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Taxable PUTTERs and Taxable
DRIVERs of the J.P. Morgan Taxable PUTTERs/Taxable DRIVERs Trust series listed
below: 

--Series T0020 Taxable PUTTERs 'AA /F1'; Positive Outlook; 

--Taxable DRIVERs 'AA'; Positive Outlook. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

The long-term 'AA'; Positive Outlook ratings assigned to the series T0020
Taxable PUTTERs and Taxable DRIVERs are based on the rating that Fitch has
assigned to the New York State Urban Development Corporation State Personal
Income Tax Revenue Bonds (General Purpose), Series 2013B (rated 'AA'; Positive
Outlook) that have been deposited in the trust. 

The 'F1' short-term rating assigned to the Taxable PUTTERs is based on the
liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (rated 'A/F1'; Stable
Outlook). The short-term rating will expire on Dec. 30, 2013, the expiration
date of the liquidity facility, unless such date is extended or earlier
terminated. 

RATING SENSITIVITIES 

The short-term rating assigned to the Taxable PUTTERs reflects the short-term
rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and will be
adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term rating of the
bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the underlying bond deposited
in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned to the Taxable PUTTERs and Taxable
DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness of the underlying bonds
deposited in the trust and will reflect all changes to that rating. 

Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings.

Agreements to supply 1 million tons annually from Wheatstone Project for 20
years
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced that its Australian subsidiaries
have signed binding long-term Sales and Purchase Agreements (SPAs) with Chubu
Electric Power Company Inc. (Chubu) for liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the
Wheatstone Project in Western Australia. 

Under the agreements Chevron, together with Apache Energy and Kuwait Foreign
Petroleum Exploration Company, will supply Chubu with 1 million tons per annum
(MTPA) of LNG for up to 20 years. 

Joe Geagea, president, Chevron Gas and Midstream, said, "Chubu, one of the
world's leading LNG customers, is now a partner and customer of the
Chevron-operated Gorgon Project. We are pleased to expand the strong partnership
between our two companies with these SPAs for Wheatstone LNG." 

Roy Krzywosinski, managing director, Chevron Australia, said, "More than 80
percent of Chevron's equity LNG from Wheatstone is covered under long-term
off-take agreements with customers in Asia. The agreements demonstrate that
Wheatstone is well-placed geographically to meet the Asia Pacific region's
growing demand for a safe, reliable and cleaner-burning source of energy." 

The Chevron-operated Wheatstone Project is located at Ashburton North, 7.5 miles
(12 kilometres) west of Onslow in Western Australia. The project will consist of
two LNG trains with a combined capacity of 8.9 million tons per annum and a
domestic gas plant.

Chevron (64.14%), Apache Energy (13%), Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration
Company (7%), Shell (6.4%), and Kyushu Electric Power Company (1.46%), together
with PE Wheatstone Pty Ltd. (part owned by Tokyo Electric Power Company, 8%). 

Chevron also holds an 80.17 percent equity interest in the Wheatstone and Iago
fields that provide 80% of the feedgas to the Wheatstone Project. The partners
in the fields are Australian subsidiaries of Shell (8%) and Kyushu Electric
Power Company (1.83%) together with PE Wheatstone Pty Ltd (part owned by Tokyo
Electric Power Company, 10%). 

Chevron is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company is involved in
virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for, produces and

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical Technology Licensing LLC, an affiliate of ExxonMobil
Chemical Company, (NYSE:XOM), has signed an agreement to license its tubular
process technology to Sasol North America for a new low density polyethylene
(LDPE) plant in Lake Charles, La. The new 420 thousand tonnes per year plant is
expected to be completed in late 2016. 

Sasol Polymers, a division of Sasol Chemical Industries, also licensed the
ExxonMobil Chemical tubular process for its LDPE plant in Sasolburg, South
Africa, that opened in 2005. "LDPE producers continue to choose our tubular
process technology for its broad grade-slate capabilities, high reactor uptime
and lower total cost compared with commercial gas-phase reactors," said Jennifer
Dunphy, vice president, ExxonMobil Chemical Technology Licensing. 

"The performance of our LDPE plant in Sasolburg and the experience of working
with ExxonMobil Chemical before, during and after that facility came online
helped convince us that the ExxonMobil Chemical tubular process was also the
best choice for our Lake Charles plant," said Mike Biesheuvel, managing
director, Sasol Polymers International Investments. "The demonstrated
performance of other ExxonMobil Chemical LDPE process licensees in plants with
400 thousand tonnes per year capacities was another important factor in our
selection." 

Used worldwide by ExxonMobil Chemical and its licensees, the company`s
high-pressure tubular process has been in operation since 1968 and has a long
history of improvements and capacity expansion. The company also licenses
autoclave technology for producing LDPE.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/63wbz3/global_next) has announced
the addition of the "Global Next Generation Telecom Application Server Market
2012-2016" report to their offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Next-Generation Telecom Application
Server market to grow at a CAGR of 15.05 percent over the period 2012-2016. One
of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the increasing demand
for multimedia services. The Global Next-Generation Telecom Application Server
market has also been witnessing increasing demand for IP-based services.
However, the system integration issues could pose a challenge to the growth of
this market. 

Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Telecom team said: ''The
demand for IP-based services is increasing significantly because of the
increasing usage of communication devices. Moreover, IP-based networks are
scalable and can easily adapt to any changes made at the network level. In this
respect, next generation TAS facilitates services with the help of IP-based
signaling protocols. Moreover, since a next generation TAS can manage these
devices in a more efficient manner, the adoption of these devices and of TASs is
expected to increase in the next few years''. 

According to the report, the demand among consumers for higher data speeds is
one of the major drivers in the Global Next Generation TAS market. This has
provided an opportunity for telecom operators to increase their revenue by
providing value-added services with a view to increasing the use of the internet
among consumers. Hence, telecom operators are upgrading their networks to meet
the demand for high-speed mobile broadband services with the help of next
generation TASs. 

Further, the report discusses that the technological advancements have led to
the development of mobile devices with numerous capabilities. This enhanced
efficiency has led to an increase in the demand for various applications, but
the vendors are unable to meet this demand. This may deter CSPs from installing
next generation TASs, and thus hinder the growth of the Global Next Generation
TAS market.

The key vendors dominating this market space are

Oracle Corp., BroadSoft Inc., IBM Corp., and Comverse Technologies Inc.

The other vendors mentioned in the report are

Alcatel-Lucent SA, Avaya Inc., Cisco System Inc., Ericsson AB, Huawei
Technologies Co. Ltd., Microsoft Corp., Nokia Siemens Networks B.V, and ZTE
Corp. 

Key questions answered in this report:

- What will the market size be in 2016 and what will the growth rate be? 

- What are the key market trends? 

- What is driving this market? 

- What are the challenges to market growth? 

- Who are the key vendors in this market space?

to sell 5 percent of its stake in Iraq's West Qurna-1 oilfield
to Abu Dhabi's state-run investment fund Mubadala, part of the
U.S. major's moves to reduce its exposure there, Iraqi oil
officials said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any sale of a part of West Qurna would follow Exxon's
decision last year to sell its stake in the $60 billion field
after upsetting Iraq's central government by signing deals with
the country's autonomous Kurdistan region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq's central government had told the U.S. oil company it
would have to choose between West Qurna and the Kurdistan oil
deals, but Baghdad still offered Exxon sweeter terms in an
attempt to keep it working in the southern oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon is staying in West Qurna-1 at least until next year,
but at same time the company is moving ahead to cut its share in
the West Qurna project to shift focus to other projects," said
one Iraqi oil official without giving details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the United Arab Emirates fund and Exxon were
not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two Iraqi oil officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the media,
said Exxon's allocation of $1.65 billion to develop the field in
2013 indicated it planned to stay until next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks with Mubadala follow negotiations with other
companies for part of West Qurna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia's state-owned oil and gas firm Pertamina is in
talks to buy 10-20 percent of the Exxon stake and industry
sources have also said China's National Petroleum Corp is
willing to join Exxon with part of West Qurna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. announced today that the European Commission (EC) has granted
conditional marketing authorization for BOSULIF (bosutinib) in the European
Union (EU) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase (CP),
accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP) Philadelphia chromosome positive
chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph+ CML) previously treated with one or more
tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) (TKIs) and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and
dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options.1

"I`m delighted the EC has approved BOSULIF as a new addition to the CML
treatment landscape in Europe," said Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, MD, Professor
of Internal Medicine at the University of Milano Bicocca in Italy, Director of
the Clinical Research Unit, Section of Hematology at S. Gerardo Hospital in
Monza, Italy, and a lead investigator in the BOSULIF clinical study. "It`s
critical to have additional treatment options for CML patients, because each
patient responds to therapy differently and has unique needs. Based on my
experience with BOSULIF, I believe this once-daily treatment, with its distinct
safety profile, offers an important new alternative." 

Conditional marketing authorizations in the EU are granted to medicinal products
with a positive benefit/risk assessment that address unmet medical needs and
whose availability would result in a significant public health benefit. A
conditional marketing authorization is renewable annually. As part of the
conditional approval, Pfizer is committed to generating additional efficacy and
safety data for BOSULIF in patients with Ph+ CML previously treated with one or
more TKIs not suitable for imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib, and will submit
the findings to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Following review of the
data by the EMA`s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the EC
will consider converting the conditional marketing authorization to a full
marketing authorization. 

The EC decision was based on data from Study 200, a global, single-arm,
open-label, multi-cohort, Phase 1/2 study of BOSULIF in more than 500 patients
with Ph+ CML who had previously been treated with at least one TKI. The study
included separate cohorts for patients with chronic, accelerated and blast phase
disease. Data on 52 patients were considered as main evidence for the
conditional marketing authorization, as these patients were identified as having
an unmet medical need because other TKIs were not considered appropriate
treatment options for them due to disease resistance or the risk of severe side
effects. 

"The approval of BOSULIF reflects the progress that is being made to address the
unmet needs of CML patients in Europe and exemplifies Pfizer`s commitment to
bringing meaningful new medicines to patients living with hematologic
malignancies," said Andreas Penk, Regional President of Europe for the Pfizer
Oncology Business Unit. 

About BOSULIF (bosutinib)

BOSULIF is an oral, once-daily, kinase inhibitor, which limits cancer cell
growth by inhibiting the Abl and Src signaling pathways.2 The recommended dose
of BOSULIF is 500 mg, orally, taken once daily with food.1 BOSULIF was first
approved in the U.S. in September 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with
chronic, accelerated or blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance, or intolerance, to
prior therapy.3

Important BOSULIF (bosutinib) U.S. Safety Information

Contraindication: Hypersensitivity to BOSULIF. Anaphylactic shock occurred in
less than 0.2% of treated patients. 

Gastrointestinal Toxicity: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can
occur. In the clinical trial, median time to onset for diarrhea was 2 days,
median duration was 1 day, and median number of episodes per patient was 3
(range 1-221). Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including
antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and/or fluid replacement. Withhold, dose reduce, or
discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. 

Myelosuppression: Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia can occur. A
complete blood count should be performed weekly for the first month and then
monthly or as clinically indicated. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue
BOSULIF as necessary. 

Hepatic Toxicity: Twenty percent of patients experienced an increase in either
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Liver enzyme
elevation usually occurs early in treatment. Perform monthly hepatic enzyme
tests for the first 3 months and as clinically indicated. In patients with
transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Drug-induced
liver injury has occurred. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as
necessary. 

Fluid Retention: Fluid retention can occur and may cause pericardial effusion,
pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema. Monitor and manage
patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF
as necessary. 

Embryofetal Toxicity: BOSULIF may cause fetal harm when administered to a
pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential
hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving BOSULIF. 

Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions observed in greater than
20% of patients in the Phase 1/2 safety population (N=546) were diarrhea,
nausea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, anemia, pyrexia, and
fatigue. 

The most common Grade 3/4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities
observed in greater than 10% of patients were thrombocytopenia, anemia, and
neutropenia. 

Drug Interactions: Avoid concurrent use with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors
or inducers. 

Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs): Consider using short-acting antacids or H2
blockers instead of PPIs. Separate antacid or H2 blocker dosing and BOSULIF
dosing by more than 2 hours. 

Substrates of P-glycoprotein: BOSULIF may increase the plasma concentrations of
drugs that are P-gp substrates, such as digoxin. 

Nursing Mothers: Given the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing
infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or BOSULIF. 

Hepatic Impairment: Treat with a dose of 200 mg daily in patients with any
baseline hepatic impairment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has again rebuffed claims by copper fabricators that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's planned exchange traded fund backed by physical copper would tighten supplies of metal used in plumbing and wiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a filing dated March 28 and posted on the SEC website on Friday, the regulator upheld its December 14 decision to approve the controversial fund, rejecting concerns among copper users that the fund would distort supply and inflate prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial users fear the funds would cut off supplies of copper, used in wiring and plumbing, and boost prices since they will use physical copper cathode as collateral against shares of the fund, effectively removing a chunk of metal from the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no new evidence to suggest that the JPM XF Physical Copper Trust would lead to a scarcity of particular grades or brands of copper, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The commission does not believe that ... as a result of the trust, it is much more likely that brand-sensitive end-users of copper will not be able to obtain their desired brands of copper at their desired locations," the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest missive came after a last-ditch effort by a consortium of copper users to get the SEC to reverse its decision. Their attorney Robert Bernstein with law firm Eaton &amp; Van Winkle LLP asked the regulator in a letter dated January 9 to block the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, two firms from the group, Southwire Co and Encore Wire Corp, said they were preparing to fight the ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consortium, which represents half the annual copper demand of the United States, has also opposed another, similar fund, the iShares Copper Trust, planned by BlackRock Inc. The SEC gave its seal of approval for that product last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week's filing also rejected concerns raised in the January letter that long lines in some warehouses would delay investors getting their metal if they redeemed their shares in the trust for physical material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said it expected that metal would be transferred to the relevant investor's account within three days of redemption, which it did not consider to be a "significant" delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remained unclear when JPM may launch the fund after two years of work to get the approval in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and BlackRock have said fears about rising prices and supply squeezes are unfounded because the funds would be miniscule compared with the 20-million-tonne global market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Josephine Mason; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

fabricators that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's planned exchange
traded fund backed by physical copper would tighten supplies of
metal used in plumbing and wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a filing dated March 28 and posted on the SEC website on
Friday, the regulator upheld its Dec. 14 decision to approve the
controversial fund, rejecting concerns among copper users that
the fund would distort supply and inflate prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial users fear the funds would cut off supplies of
copper, used in wiring and plumbing, and boost prices since they
will use physical copper cathode as collateral against shares of
the fund, effectively removing a chunk of metal from the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no new evidence to suggest that the JPM XF Physical
Copper Trust would lead to a scarcity of particular grades or
brands of copper, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The commission does not believe that ... as a result of the
trust, it is much more likely that brand-sensitive end-users of
copper will not be able to obtain their desired brands of copper
at their desired locations," the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest missive came after a last-ditch effort by a 
consortium of copper users to get the SEC to reverse its
decision. Their attorney Robert Bernstein with law firm Eaton &amp;
Van Winkle LLP asked the regulator in a letter dated Jan. 9 to
block the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, two firms from the group, Southwire Co and
Encore Wire Corp, said they were preparing to fight the
ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consortium, which represents half the annual copper
demand of the United States, has also opposed another, similar
fund, the iShares Copper Trust, planned by BlackRock Inc
. The SEC gave its seal of approval for that product last
month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week's filing also rejected concerns raised in the
January letter that long lines in some warehouses would delay
investors getting their metal if they redeemed their shares in
the trust for physical material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said it expected that metal would be transferred to
the relevant investor's account within three days of redemption,
which it did not consider to be a "significant" delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remained unclear when JPM may launch the fund after two
years of work to get the approval in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and BlackRock have said fears about rising prices
and supply squeezes are unfounded because the funds would be
miniscule compared with the 20-million-tonne global market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil has shut
a crude oil pipeline after it ruptured near Mayflower, Arkansas,
spilling "thousands" of barrels of oil, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-inch Pegasus pipeline ruptured on late Friday
afternoon and a few thousand barrels of oil had been observed, 
Exxon said in a statement. Exxon was preparing a response for a
spill of more than 10,000 barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had categorized the
spill as a "major spill", Exxon said. Clean-up crews had
recovered approximately 4,500 barrels of oil and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pipeline carries crude oil from Patoka, Illinois to the
Gulf Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil on Sunday continued cleanup of a pipeline spill that spewed thousands of barrels of heavy Canadian crude in Arkansas as opponents of oil sands development latched on to the incident to attack plans to build the Keystone XL line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said on Sunday that crews had yet to excavate the area around the pipeline breach, a needed step before the company can estimate how long repairs will take and when the line might restart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't speculate on when it will happen," Jeffers said. "Excavation is necessary as part of an investigation to determine the cause of the incident."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's Pegasus pipeline, which can carry more than 90,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Patoka, Illinois to Nederland, Texas, was shut after the leak was discovered late Friday afternoon in a subdivision near the town of Mayflower. The leak forced the evacuation of 22 homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon also had no specific estimate of how much crude oil had spilled, but the company said 12,000 barrels of oil and water had been recovered - up from 4,500 barrels on Saturday. The company did not say how much of the total was oil and how much was water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Dodson, Faulkner County judge who is the top executive for the county where the spill occurred, told Reuters in an interview on Sunday that the smell of crude was less potent on Sunday as cleanup efforts continued, saying it was weaker than the smell of fresh asphalt laid on a road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The freestanding oil on the street has been removed. It's still damp with oil, it's tacky, like it is before we do an asphalt overlay," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said it staged the response to handle 10,000 barrels of oil "to ensure adequate resources are in place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) also were on site to investigate the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen vacuum trucks remained on the scene for cleanup, and 33 storage tanks were deployed to temporarily store the oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pipeline was carrying Canadian Wabasca Heavy crude at the time of the leak. An oil spill of more than 1,000 barrels into a Wisconsin field from an Enbridge Inc pipeline last summer kept that line shuttered for around 11 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 848-mile pipeline used to transport crude oil from Texas to Illinois. In 2006 Exxon reversed it to move crude from Illinois to Texas in response to growing Canadian oil production and the ability of U.S. Gulf Coast refineries to process heavy crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arkansas spill drew fast reaction from opponents of the 800,000 bpd Keystone XL pipeline, which also would carry heavy crude from Canada's tar sands to the Gulf Coast refining hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmentalists have expressed concerns about the impact of developing the oil sands and say the crude is more corrosive to pipelines than conventional oil. On Wednesday, a train carrying Canadian crude derailed in Minnesota, spilling 15,000 gallons of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether it's the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, or ...

&lt;p&gt;March 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil on Sunday continued

&lt;p&gt;* Exxon shuts Pegasus pipeline after thousands of barrels
spilled&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Twenty-two homes evacuated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Second spill in the United States involving crude from
Canada this week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Matthew Robinson and David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil was
working to clean up thousands of barrels of oil in Mayflower,
Arkansas, after a pipeline carrying heavy Canadian crude
ruptured, a major spill likely to stoke debate over transporting
Canada's oil to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon shut the Pegasus pipeline, which can carry more than
90,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Pakota, Illinois,
to Nederland, Texas, after the leak was discovered on Friday
afternoon, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, hit with a $1.7 million fine by regulators this week
over a 2011 spill in the Yellowstone River, said a few thousand
barrels of oil had been observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company spokesman confirmed the line was carrying Canadian
Wabasca Heavy crude. That grade is a heavy bitumen crude diluted
with lighter liquids to allow it to flow through pipelines,
according to the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA),
which referred to Wabasca as "oil sands" in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spill occurred as the U.S. State Department is
considering the fate of the 800,000 bpd Keystone XL pipeline,
which would carry crude from Canada's oil sands to the Gulf
Coast. Environmentalists, concerned about the impact of
developing the oil sands, have sought to block its approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters say Keystone will help bring down the cost of
fuel in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arkansas spill was the second incident this week where
Canadian crude has spilled in the United States. On Wednesday, a
train carrying Canadian crude derailed in Minnesota, spilling
15,000 gallons of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon expanded the Pegasus pipeline in 2009 to carry more
Canadian crude from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast refining hub
and installed what it called new "leak detection technology".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said federal, state and local officials were on site
and the company said it was staging a response for a spill of
more than 10,000 barrels "to be conservative". Clean-up crews
had recovered approximately 4,500 barrels of oil and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The air quality does not likely present a human health
risk, with the exception of the high pooling areas, where
clean-up crews are working with safety equipment," Exxon said in
a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. media said the spill was in a subdivision. Mayflower
city police said the oil had not reached Lake Conway nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency categorized the
rupture as a "major spill," Exxon said, and 22 homes were
evacuated following the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Department of Transportation confirmed
that an inspector from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration had been sent to the scene to determine
what caused the failure. The Environmental Protection Agency is
the federal on-scene coordinator for the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some environmentalists argue that oil sands crudes are more
corrosive than conventional oil, although a CEPA report, put
together by oil and gas consultancy Penspen, argued diluted
bitumen is no more corrosive than other heavy crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Transportation earlier this week
proposed a fine of 1.7 million for Exxon over pipeline safety
violations relating to a 2011 oil spill in the Yellowstone
River. Exxon's Silvertip pipeline, which carries 40,000 barrels
per day of crude in Montana, leaked about 1,500 barrels of oil
into the river in July 2011 after heavy flooding in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1989, the Exxon Valdez supertanker struck a reef in
Prince William Sound off Alaska and spilled 250,000 barrels of
crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;
