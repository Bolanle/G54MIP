&lt;p&gt; (Adds that company is in talks with other agencies.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Oct 1 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) said on Monday that
it will set up a joint venture company that will run services
for two counties in South West England, handling areas from
computer systems to human resources, procurement and finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  International Business Machines said it will initially
book the deal at about 200 million pounds ($409 million), but
altogether it expects the contract with the Somerset County   
Council and Taunton Deane Borough Council to be worth about 400
million pounds over its 10-year life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The joint venture company, which will be called South West
One, will offer its services to more than 30 other public
sector organizations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is in talks with a local police force in the area, which
would become England's first to receive shared services through
a joint venture agreement if it participates.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Sunday it plans to introduce new software services targeted at corporate customers willing to pay a monthly subscription instead of license fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new services, announced on Sunday, are Microsoft's first major attempt at delivering software over the Internet as a "service" to its bread-and-butter corporate customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it will start to offer over the next few months e-mail, instant messaging and collaboration software to companies with more than 5,000 workers. Those applications will run on computer servers inside Microsoft's data centers and then be delivered to customers over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new strategy is a departure from Microsoft's current business model of selling licenses for software that runs locally on a customer's own computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll look back on this announcement and say that's when Microsoft really started to provide software plus services," said John Rymer, senior analyst at Forrester Research. "It's the first step and there is so much more to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with competition from Salesforce.com Inc. and Google Inc., Microsoft is attempting to roll out services to large organizations without jeopardizing the corporate agreements that underpin many of its businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some companies like Salesforce see services eventually replacing traditional software, but Microsoft is pushing a "software plus services" strategy with the promise that this option combines the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said its new Office Live Workspace is an example of the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Live Workspace, also unveiled on Sunday, allows workers to share Word documents, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations on the Web for free. In the Workspace, people can invite others to view and comment on documents even if they don't own Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can save more than 1,000 Office documents on Workspace and access them through any Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOSS OF CONTROL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's rivals have seen some success with selling software services to corporate customers, but Microsoft said technology administrators in large organizations are concerned about losing control over security or other features with a move to software services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other services Microsoft plans to introduce is Exchange Online, Office SharePoint Online and Office Communications Online. Exchange is Microsoft's e-mail application, SharePoint is its collaboration software and Communications allows for instant messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The products, according to Microsoft, will work the same as existing offerings but the software will run on Microsoft's computer servers. Microsoft said administrators will maintain nearly the same level of control as if the software was on their own computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has invested billions in building mammoth data centers filled with computers and storage so it can offer services to both regular consumers and customers in large organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said some organizations will not want Microsoft hosting their e-mail or other critical software and those customers can continue to pay licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other customers may opt to pay for services, because it will be less expensive than running and maintaining the software themselves due to the scale and efficiency of Microsoft's data centers, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said improvements in profit margins from its services business will also rely on how efficiently it can run those facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI Oct 1 (Reuters) - Indian gas importer Petronet
LNG Ltd (PLNG.BO) has signed a draft agreement with Exxon Mobil
Corp (XOM.N) to buy liquefied natural gas from Australia's
Gorgon project, Petronet's chief executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Prosad Dasgupta, who is also Petronet's managing director,
said the two companies agreed early last month on all details
but pricing, and the deal should cover purchases of 2.5 million
tonnes of LNG a year for a period of 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are meeting them in November to discuss pricing and then
in January ... Preferably by June 30, 2008, we hope to finalise
the deal," Dasgupta told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp (CVX.N) holds a 50 percent stake in the
project, while Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) each
have 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The supply of gas from Gorgon is expected to begin from the
end of 2012, Dasgupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the LNG would be regasified at the firm's 5 million
tonnes a year Kochi terminal in southern Kerala state, expected
to be commissioned by mid-2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petronet has been seeking LNG to secure energy supplies as
demand grows in Asia's third largest consumer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is also talking to Chevron about buying LNG from its
share of gas from Gorgon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dasgupta said that delays in awarding Gorgon environmental
clearance had invalidated earlier agreements between operators
and prospective customers, opening the door for Petronet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sept. 7, Chevron finally won environmental approval for
the project from the government of Western Australia and said
key Japanese customers could take minority stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They include Tokyo Gas (9531.T), Chubu Electric Power
(9502.T) and Osaka Gas (9532.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides buying from the spot markets, Petronet recently
signed a deal to buy 1.25 million tonnes of LNG from RasGas of
Qatar before the end of March 2008 with an option to extend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RasGas is also supplying India with 5 million tonnes a year
of LNG under a long-term contract and the quantity will be
raised to 7.5 million tonnes a year from 2009.

&lt;p&gt;KANO, Nigeria (Reuters) - A court case brought by Nigeria 
against Pfizer resumes on Wednesday with the U.S. drug maker 
saying it answered a call for help to save the lives of African 
children during a meningitis epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nigeria alleges Pfizer deceived patients and caused the 
death of 11 children in 1996 when it performed clinical trials 
for a new drug. With the northern state of Kano, it is suing 
the company for $8.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The meningitis outbreak killed more than 12,000 children in 
six months near Kano, a predominantly Muslim metropolis with a 
history of conflict with the West. Meningitis is an infection 
of the nervous system that can kill in hours if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ngozi Edozien, managing director of Pfizer in West Africa, 
said the company brought the experimental drug, Trovan, to 
Nigeria in response to an international plea for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There was a compelling reason to look at Trovan because it 
was an oral formulation, it was known to have shown efficacy in 
meningitis and was a five-day treatment so it was perfect for 
an epidemic setting," she told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The test involved 200 children, half of whom received 
Trovan while the other half received a proven meningitis 
treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria alleges Pfizer was responsible for the deaths of 11 
children and permanent health problems for many others. It says 
it failed to obtain all the required approvals for the test and 
did not get proper consent from the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer rejects all the charges. It says Trovan saved lives 
and the alleged victims were affected by meningitis, not the 
drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case was first brought in the United States, but thrown 
out in 2005 by a judge who said it should be heard in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, Pfizer will be in two courts for civil and 
criminal proceedings brought by the Kano state government. The 
federal government has also brought civil and criminal charges.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TESTING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trovan had already been tested on 5,000 people before it 
was used in Nigeria, Edozien said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
for use on adults a few months after the Kano trial, and 
briefly became one of Pfizer's top-selling drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the authorities imposed severe restrictions on its 
use three years later when it was found to cause serious liver 
injuries in some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mustapha Maisekili, the father of two alleged victims in 
the Kano trial, said his two daughters were walking and talking 
when he took them to the Infectious Diseases Hospital suffering 
from flu-like symptoms typical of meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They died a few weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Most of the victims lost hope of getting any form of 
justice on the issue," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we are compensated through the court judgment we shall 
be relieved somehow. Most of us are living hand-to-mouth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer faces a hostile reception in Kano, a focus of 
Islamic radicalism in Nigeria with a history of religious 
bloodshed and rejection of Western medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state government banned vaccines against polio for nine 
months in 2003, alleging they contained HIV and were spreading 
infertility. The Kano boycott fuelled a resurgence of the 
crippling virus across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Civil rights groups say they are planning demonstrations 
against Pfizer in the city next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Tom Ashby in Lagos)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORKOct 1 (Reuters) - Recent volatility and slumping
returns in the hedge fund industry have not dampened the
appetite for new funds founded by former investment bankers
from firms such as JPMorgan Chase to Merrill Lynch  Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The new funds are evidence that investors continue to flock
to the fast-growing, $1.8 trillion hedge fund industry, which
promises investment returns in up markets or down, but does not
always deliver. Hedge funds in aggregate lost 1.3 percent in
August, according to Hedge Fund Research, an industry tracker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the highest profile is Robson Ventures LLC, a firm
founded by Phil Duff, the former Morgan Stanley (MS.N) senior
executive who co-founded multi-strategy hedge fund group
FrontPoint Partners but left after his alma mater bought the
firm late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robson is set to unveil a hedge fund and private equity
strategy in October with "substantially more" than $300 million
to finance acquisitions, fund company growth and make other
investments, according to sources. Robson describes itself as
"the next generation investment management company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Duff declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And slated for a launch early next week is Pent Water
Capital, a Chicago-based multi-strategy hedge fund that is
expected to lure around $1 billion in investments, sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pent Water was founded by Matthew Halbower, who managed
"event-driven" investment strategies until last December at
Deephaven Capital, the investment unit of Knight Capital Group
NITE.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EX-MERRILL GLOBAL MARKETS HEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Halbower, who has signed up Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and
UBS as prime brokers, could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another fund set to roll out in coming months is a
distressed debt hedge fund co-founded by Jonathan Katz, a
partner in JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) Special Situations
Investing fund, which trades distressed bank and high-yield
debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katz, who leaves the bank today, expects a wave of
opportunities in coming months to buy attractive bank and bond
debt that was written in recent years when credit markets were
more robust, both for company refinancings and leveraged
buyouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In a down market environment, we would expect a third to a
half of this highly leveraged paper will have to be
restructured," said Katz in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katz declined to say what he is naming the fund or how much
he plans to raise. A source familiar with the firm said it
would likely be around $250 million and launch early next year.
JPMorgan declined to comment
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also early next year, Dow Kim, former president of Merrill
Lynch  Co Inc's MER.N global markets and investment banking
group, is expected to launch his new global multi-strategy fund
called Diamond Lake Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kim announced in May he would leave the bank to set up a
new multi-strategy fund, which sources said will aim to raise
between $1.5 billion to $3 billion and invest in a variety of
long-short equity and credit strategies. He is now a senior
executive advisor to Merrill, which has said it plans to be an
initial client of Kim's new firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Oct 1 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (XOM.N) has offered
80,000-90,000 tonnes of October-loading high-viscosity fuel
oil, amid a tight Middle East market that has seen three
consecutive parcels sold into the region at high prices,
traders said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The 650-centistoke (cst) parcel is for Oct. 20-22 loading
from its joint-venture Samref refinery in the Red Sea port of
Yanbu, on free-on-board (FOB) basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bids are expected by late Monday and a deal is expected by
the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would expect this cargo to be sold into the Fujairah
bunkers market at similarly high prices comparable to the
previous three parcels. Competition for the parcel will be
quite keen," a Singapore-based Middle East trader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FAL Oil, the largest bunker supplier in Fujairah, bought
the last Yanbu cargo at a discount of around $13.50 a tonne
below Singapore spot quotes, FOB. It has also bought the last
two parcels, both for September lifting, at similar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fujairah marine fuels market, the world's second
largest with volumes of 10-11 million tonnes last year, has
been tight since second-half August on supply disruptions from
Iran.
 Traders said September and October supplies from Iran has been
slashed by as much as half, forcing bunker suppliers in
Fujairah to seek alternatives, including from non-conventional
sources such as Europe and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prices for the 380-cst bunkers grade in Fujairah were at
near all-time high levels of $416-$417 a tonne on Friday but
its differential to Singapore cargo values have narrowed to
below $20 a tonne, compared to $20-$30 earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The supply tightness could be easing towards November, but
even at plus $10 a tonne, the differentials are very high
because typical levels are below Singapore bunker prices, which
are now in discount to cargo values," another Middle East
trader said.

&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Wash. Oct 2 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O)
new lineup of Zune digital media players will be made by

instead of Japan's Toshiba Corp (6502.T), which made the first
Zune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; J Allard, a Microsoft corporate vice president, said on
Tuesday in an interview with Reuters that the company opted to
go with Toshiba's 30-gigabyte player last year because it
needed to rush to market with its first product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year, it decided to bring all the design in-house and
selected Flextronics for the manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "To build this product, we really needed to think about it
end-to-end," said Allard, who runs the Zune business. "It also
brings with it cost advantages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it will start selling three new Zune models
in mid-November. The 4-gigabyte, 8-gigabyte and 80-gigabyte
Zunes will all come with a new feature that allows a user to
wirelessly and automatically sync media via a WiFi network from
a PC to the Zune when its battery is charging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi, editing by Braden

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Disney Channel drew more viewers 
than CNN or any other prime-time cable staple in the third 
quarter, setting a record for that period of the year, thanks 
to TV movie "High School Musical 2" and series "Hannah Montana" 
and "The Suite Life of Zack  Cody."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Walt Disney Co-owned kids channel also turned in the 
second-largest prime time cable audience for any quarter ever 
behind sister cable network ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the first time, the Disney Channel bested top-rated 
rival Nickelodeon among kids ages 6 to 11 in both prime and 
total day ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Channel, which is not ad supported, shows "Hannah 
Montana," about a high school girl's secret life as a rock 
star, and "The Suite Life of Zack  Cody" about twin boys who 
live in a five-star hotel, tied for No. 1 basic cable series 
for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ratings victories over basic cable networks aimed at 
adults such as ESPN, Lifetime and Fox News Channel, put the 
kids network into a new realm, said Rich Ross, president of 
Disney Channel Worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The amazing thing that we accomplished was not only did we 
succeed across kids ... the message is we are for kids and 
families," Ross said. "Consumers voted with their remote 
controls."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Disney Channel has steadily climbed to the top of cable 
ratings starting about five years ago on the strength of

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Oct 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said a
1-hour, 22-minute upset on a delayed coking unit at its 563,000
barrel per day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery on Tuesday had no
impact on production, according to a notice filed with state

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court took up the racially divisive issue on Tuesday of whether U.S. judges who disagree with federal sentencing guidelines can impose lighter prison sentences for selling crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question has been a concern for more and more trial judges because the harsher sentences usually go to mostly black defendants convicted of selling crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of the nine justices appeared supportive of the argument that judges can disregard the guidelines that require lighter prison terms for the sale of powder cocaine, a drug more popular with whites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 25,000 defendants a year are sent to prison for crack cocaine crimes, and blacks account for about 80 percent of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disparity dates back to a 1986 anti-drug law that was approved out of concern over a crack cocaine and crime epidemic then sweeping many U.S. cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law gives first-time offenders convicted of selling five grams of crack cocaine the same five-year mandatory prison sentence as dealers of 500 grams of powder cocaine. The sentencing guidelines incorporated the 100-to-1 ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics have called the disparity unfair and racially biased, leading to claims of inconsistency in the nation's judicial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia appeared skeptical of government arguments that judges must follow the 100-to-1 ratio. Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben said any change must be made by Congress, not by federal judges around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact remains the guidelines are only guidelines," Scalia said. "The guidelines are just advisory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts, one of President George W. Bush's two conservative appointments to the high court, said Congress has only provided vague guidance about what the U.S. Sentencing Commission should do, and did not give a specific ratio for the two types of cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Nachmanoff argued on behalf of Derrick Kimbrough, who is black. His lighter sentence of 15 years in prison was overturned by a U.S. appeals court that ruled judges cannot impose sentences below the guidelines because they disagree with the disparity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest supporter for the guidelines appeared to be liberal Justice Stephen Breyer. He asked whether the court could find a path between forcing judges to follow the guidelines and allowing them to totally disregard them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decision in the case is expected early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banks will likely be reluctant to make new business loans if tight credit conditions persist, hampering capital spending and the economy in the coming months, according to Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credit turmoil led to a surge in business lending since August with the growth rate of commercial and industrial loans on commercial bank balance sheets running at a 50.2 percent annualized rate, its fastest in more than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher commercial and industrial lending typically signals economic strength, but that has not been the case in recent weeks, Goldman Sachs's chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a research report published late on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hatzius reckoned neither more corporate  demand nor bank willingness has led to the swell in business loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the jump in lending was fallout from a combination of factors stemming from the credit turmoil: investors shunning debt instruments that fund business operations and investment like commercial paper; liquidation of some collateral held by asset-backed commercial paper programs and banks holding on to bridge loans issued for leveraged buyout deals, according to Hatzius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since August, U.S. commercial paper outstanding shrank by $370 billion, with roughly a quarter coming from unsecured commercial paper. This type of short-term debt is often supported by bank credit lines to hedge against the kind of market turbulence seen recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hatzius estimated at least some of the $100 billion decline in unsecured commercial paper has appeared on bank balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a macroeconomic perspective, unplanned balance sheet expansion is likely to constrain banks' willingness to make loans to borrowers that do not have prearranged liquidity lines," Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transfer of liabilities from the capital market to the bank system will be temporary if credit conditions continue to improve in the wake of the Federal Reserve's massive liquidity infusion, including a half-percentage-point interest rate cut on September 18, according to Hatzius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if credit conditions tighten again, it may become tougher for corporations to fund projects, Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such a financing constraint could weigh on capital spending and real GDP growth in 2008," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LISBON Oct 2 (Reuters) - Brazil's state-run energy company
Petrobras (PETR4.SA)(PBR.N) is evaluating Exxon Mobil Corp's
(XOM.N) assets in Latin America but has not made any offer to
buy them, Petrobras international operations director Nestor
Cervero said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Brazilian press has speculated recently that Petrobras
is preparing to bid for Exxon's Esso unit in Argentina, which
includes a refinery and several hundred service stations, and
possibly elsewhere in Latin America, including Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are evaluating, as part of our development plan. We
have a big investment plan and we have big synergies in all
Latin America," Cervero told reporters in Lisbon. Earlier,
Cervero confirmed Exxon's interest in selling its assets in
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The evaluation is being made but so far there is no offer,
we are also assessing other opportunities," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has been mum on the possible sell-out. Sector
analysts say it may be seeking to withdraw from Latin America
altogether after its pullout from Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon quit Venezuela earlier this year during a
nationalization drive by President Hugo Chavez. Venezuela's
state oil company PDVSA has said it may also be interested in
Exxon's assets in Argentina.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp softened its criticism of Google Inc's planned $3.1 billion acquisition of online advertiser DoubleClick, which it had claimed earlier would give the search engine group a dominant position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The question is not for Microsoft to have specific views (on this deal) ...

&lt;p&gt;LISBON Oct 2 (Reuters) - Governments need to clarify their

investments, Chevron's (CVX.N) chief economist said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Edgard Habib said the rising cost of oil production is an

Habib told an energy conference in Lisbon. "This is paramount

rise is the result of a demand, not a supply, shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Habib said he does not expect the world economy to enter a
recession following the recent turmoil in the U.S, credit
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't see a recession looming. Bernanke's decision on
rates changed the course of things and we might see a slowdown
but not a sharp fall in the economy," he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N),
which recently said it saw opportunities in the beaten-down
mortgage industry, is in talks to buy the subprime servicing
business of Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization
LLC, people familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sources said the talks were at an early stage and a deal
was not guaranteed. Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month Radian Group Inc (RDN.N) terminated a merger
agreement with MGIC Investment Corp (MTG.N), citing weakening
conditions in U.S. mortgage markets. Radian and MGIC, the joint
owners of C-BASS, said they would still pursue a previously
announced sale of their venture, which had plunged in value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has its eye on Litton Loan Servicing LP, a
Houston-based servicing unit of C-BASS and the 12th-largest
U.S. subprime servicer. Litton makes changes to mortgages that
can help struggling borrowers pay their debt, a business that
would do well as delinquency rates rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litton could be fetch about $500 million, based on recent
valuations for similar businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A number of investors are picking through the wreckage of
the once-booming subprime business, which melted down this year
after housing markets cooled and loan defaults among the
riskiest borrowers began to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creditors began to pull back, and investors stopped buying
subprime loans and securities. As a result, loan volumes
plummeted and asset values fell, forcing dozens of firms to
sell out, abandon the business or go bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet mortgage servicers, which send out bills and collect
payments on loans, are considered more attractive because they
are less vulnerable to credit cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross last month offered to pay
$435 million for the servicing business of American Home
Mortgage Investment Corp AHMIQ.PK, which is in bankruptcy.
Hedge fund Carrington Capital Management bought the servicing
business of bankrupt New Century Financial Corp NEWCQ.PK for
$184 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N), even while cutting 600 mortgage
jobs, is expanding its Saxon Capital servicing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's hunt for mortgage assets comes long after rivals
like Lehman Brothers Inc LEH.N, Merrill Lynch  Co Inc
MER.N, Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N and Morgan Stanley
snapped up lenders. These firms could underwrite their own
loans and package them into various asset-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which already owns residential mortgage servicer
Avelo Mortgage, stuck to the sidelines until February, when it
bought tiny South Carolina mortgage lender Senderra Funding for
undisclosed terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The downturn in mortgages has created a new opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, discussing
Goldman's third-quarter results, predicted that the mortgage
market "was closer to the bottom" and told investors the bank
saw opportunities to invest in the mortgage business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are certainly going to be opportunities to buy
distressed assets," Viniar said last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C-BASS, which buys discounted subprime mortgages and
repackages them into securities, in August hired Blackstone
Group (BX.N), the private equity giant and merger advisory
firm, to help raise capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C-BASS burned through cash as defaults in loans that backed
bonds soared. MGIC and Radian recently warned their stakes in
C-BASS, worth $1 billion as recently as June, may no longer
have any value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Milwaukee-based MGIC and Philadelphia-based Radian each own
46 percent of C-BASS, with the rest held by management.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said on Wednesday it plans to turn 21 acres of oceanfront property on the Hawaiian island of Oahu into its first mixed-use luxury family resort outside its theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resort is scheduled to open in 2011 with more than 800 units, including hotel rooms and villas for Disney's timeshare business, Disney Vacation Club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said it would pay $144 million for the land, which will be paid in installments over several years as the resort is built.

Linda Lingle and Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hanneman said in the statement they welcomed Disney to the island. The company's ABC television network currently shoots the hit TV show "Lost" in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney rose 6 cents to $34.72 in after hours electronic trade on Wednesday after the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO Oct 3 (Reuters) - Four Canadian banks said on
Wednesday that they expect to post fourth-quarter gains
reflecting the restructuring of credit card company Visa Inc,
but they did not say how large the gains might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM.TO),
Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO), Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) and
Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS.TO) said they will receive Visa shares
for their interests in Visa Canada Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The restructuring of Visa, the world's largest credit card
network, closed on Wednesday and the company plans to go public
next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIBC said it expects to book a "material gain" because of
its "leadership position" in the Canadian credit card market,
but said the exact amount has yet to be finalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa Canada, Visa U.S.A. and Visa International have become
subsidiaries of Visa Inc, based in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Independent valuations of the Canadian banks' Visa stakes
are under way, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The banks' fiscal fourth quarters end on Oct. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TD Bank expects to release quarterly results on Nov. 29,
while Royal Bank plans to issue its results on Nov. 30. CIBC
and Scotiabank will release their numbers on Dec. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) and National Bank of
Canada (NA.TO) recorded gains resulting from the initial public
offering of MasterCard (MA.N).

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Oct 3 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said a
compressor failure on a continuous catalytic reformer Wednesday
triggered flaring at the company's 260,000 barrel-per-day (bpd)
Los Angeles-area refinery in El Segundo, California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The reformer was expected to be repaired soon, said
spokeswoman Lily Craig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect there will be no effect on the normal supply of

&lt;p&gt; (Wraps in Chevron development)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Maria Golovnina and Raushan Nurshayeva&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALMATY/ASTANA Oct 3 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan slapped a fine
of more than half a billion dollars on an oil venture run by
Chevron (CVX.N) on Wednesday but softened its rhetoric in a
parallel row with a separate group of Western oil majors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreign investors in the Central Asian state are already
increasingly wary in the wake of Kazakhstan's dispute with an
Eni-led (ENI.MI) consortium over cost overruns and production
delays at the huge Kashagan oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bringing another key oil deposit into the frame, Kazakh
Ecology Minister Nurlan Iskakov said the government imposed a
$609 million fine on the Chevron-led (CVX.N) Tengizchevroil
(TCO) oil venture developing the Tengiz oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Any company that does not fulfil ecological requirements
will be dealt with in the harshest way," Iskakov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the fine was due to various violations including
what the government saw as Tengizchevroil's slow progress in
dealing with vast sulphur stocks at Tengiz. Iskakov said the
matter was being handled by a Kazakh court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like in Tengiz, Kashagan operators have been accused of
violating ecological rules, also over sulphur stocks. Kazakhstan
has threatened to strip Eni, an Italian energy company, of its
leading role at Kashagan, the biggest oil find in three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But addressing oil investors separately in Almaty, Energy
Minister Sauat Mynbayev struck a less aggressive tone over
Kashagan, saying both sides should work out a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Let's accept a compromise decision: after the date of
commercial production is set, we will demand a plan on sulphur
stocks by that date," he said, adding that he would sign a
special memorandum with the consortium on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we sign this memorandum, nothing should prevent work at
the project from continuing in its present form," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the government also seeks financial compensation of
more than $10 billion for the delays in production at Kashagan
-- a topic Mynbayev did not touch on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SULPHUR?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Tengiz and Kashagan are at the heart of Kazakhstan's
booming oil industry and ambitious plans to become one of the
world's top crude suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although inert, piles of yellow sulphur the size of several
soccer fields have been frequently cited as an environmental
concern by the government at domestic oilfields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp could not be reached for comment but it had
previously rejected criticism of its environmental record in the
former Soviet state and said it operated its sulphur stocks in a
safe manner consistent with Kazakhstan's laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its venture was previously fined $71 million for open air
sulphur storage, but that was reduced on appeal in 2003 to $7
million by the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source familiar with the Kashagan talks said the two sides
were currently looking for a suitable compromise. "The Kazakh
side has clearly softened the tone," said the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the change in stance over Kashagan, Mynbayev,
speaking at the Almaty oil conference, repeated concerns about
the oilfield's ballooning costs and said the government had
hired consultants to look into the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "How the cost managed to rise in a year-and-a-half from $57
billion to $136 billion raises certain questions," he said. "The
interest of both sides have been severely violated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks are due to run until an Oct. 22 deadline. Kazakh
officials have said they may take the matter to arbitration
should the talks end in no suitable agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Kashagan consortium also includes Royal Dutch Shell
(RDSa.L), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Total (TOTF.PA),
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Japan's Inpex (1605.T).

&lt;p&gt;Oct 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its price targets
for three gaming equipment stocks, saying that a slowing U.S.
economy will encourage individual states to expand gaming
operations, and international markets are likely to roll out
new casinos to promote tourism and convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised its price target on slot machine maker
International Game Technology (IGT.N) to $48 from $46, and
maintained its "buy" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It raised WMS Industries (WMS.N) to $36 from $26. On Bally
Technologies (BYI.N), it raised price target to $42 from $25.
Both the stocks are rated "neutral" by Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said in a research note that International Game
Technology should benefit from any expedited additions to 2008
slot floors given its market leader position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, however, removed IGT from its "conviction
list," citing the list's short-term focus and IGT's recent
price performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman added that WMS and Bally are direct beneficiaries
of the broader slot trends and given the stocks' volatility, it
would consider being more aggressive on the shares at lower
valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Economics Research forecasts a deceleration
in GDP growth, and also recently suggested that tax receipts at
the local level will be under pressure, the brokerage said.

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA (Reuters) - A Nigerian court allowed the federal government on Wednesday to serve a summons on U.S.-based drug maker Pfizer Inc to defend itself against a $6.5 billion lawsuit over a drug trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal government and the northern Nigerian state of Kano are suing Pfizer for a combined $8.5 billion in damages over the 1996 trial of Trovan, a new drug tested on children during a meningitis epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria alleges Pfizer was responsible for the deaths of 11 children and permanent health problems for dozens of the 200 children involved in the Trovan trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer says Trovan saved lives and the alleged victims were affected by meningitis, not Trovan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 12,000 Nigerian children died in six months from the 1996 epidemic of meningitis, an infection of the nervous system that can kill in hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Leave is hereby granted for the prosecution to serve ... the defendants," said Babs Kuewumi of the Federal High Court in the Nigerian capital, listing Pfizer Inc and four other defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adjourned the case to Oct 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trovan had been tested on 5,000 people before it was used in Nigeria. It was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use on adults a few months after the Kano trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It briefly became one of Pfizer's top-selling drugs, with 300,000 prescriptions per month. But authorities imposed severe restrictions on its use three years later when it was found to cause serious liver injuries in some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal lawsuit was first filed in the United States, but was thrown out in 2005 by a judge who said it should be heard in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kano state government's $2 billion civil suit against Pfizer also came up on Wednesday, but was adjourned until December 5 to allow both sides more time to study the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A criminal case based on the Trovan trials and brought by Kano state was also heard and adjourned to November 6 to enable the defendant to be served a court summons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorney general of Kano state, Aliyu Umar, said he would be leading a delegation to hold talks with Pfizer on November 17 in the United States with a view to a possible out-of-court settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Mike Oboh in Kano)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Washington (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) introduced on Tuesday three new models of its Zune digital media player that wirelessly and automatically update their music, photos and videos when placed near a user's computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They mark the second generation of Microsoft's answer to Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPod, which has sold more than 100 million units in various shapes and sizes since its 2001 launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Microsoft joined the fray last year with a single 30-gigabyte Zune model and has sold 1.2 million units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Zunes will come in 4-gigabyte, 8-gigabyte and 80-gigabyte models. All will come with a feature that allows a user to automatically sync media via a WiFi network from a PC to the Zune when its battery is charging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also aims to tap the social-networking phenomenon with Zune Social, a Web site for users to display music they like, share playlists and find friends with similar tastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new devices, set to go on sale in mid-November, are equipped with a circular navigational pad that allows a user to both "flick" through options like on a touch screen or "click" through choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 4-GB model will go on sale at $149, the 8-GB Zune will cost $199 and the 80-GB model will sell for $249. Those prices are the same as similar-sized iPods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the next-generation Zunes are necessary to keep existing users happy, though the new devices are not enough to close the gap on Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see Microsoft gaining market share on Apple, but it may gain share against the other also-rans," said Van Baker, analyst at research firm Gartner, noting SanDisk Corp (SNDK.O) and Creative Technology Ltd (CREA.SI) may be vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, Apple had 81.3 percent of the digital media player market by dollar volume, according to NPD Group. SanDisk was second at 5.8 percent while Microsoft had 4.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market share thing is the easy thing to discuss and write about, but it's such a bad measure," said J Allard, a Microsoft corporate vice president in charge of the Zune business. "Talk to me in six or seven years about market share. Talk to me this year about the experience we are creating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's top brass plans to provide Zune with a three- to four-year window to gain the necessary scale and reach to become a legitimate rival to Apple. The company has also said it does not expect Zune to post a profit in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very committed to this space. There is a lot we can do," Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and chairman, told reporters at a briefing about the new Zune line-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates said ceding an early lead to rivals and closing the gap over time was a recurring theme in his company's history, whether it was productivity software or PC operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the same kind of thing in terms of persistence and innovation can apply in this connected entertainment area," Gates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zunes will automatically import TV shows recorded to Microsoft's Windows Media Center, built into most new Windows Vista operating systems. Zune Marketplace, a digital music store, only sells music videos and offers video podcasts free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it would add more than 1 million MP3 songs free of digital rights management onto Marketplace, declining to identify music labels it planned to work with on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company completely redesigned software that runs on the Zune and linked PC to make it easier to navigate and search for new music. It also brought the player's design in-house, using contract manufacturer Flextronics International Ltd (FLEX.O) instead of Toshiba Corp (6502.T), which made the first Zune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Scott Hillis in San Francisco, editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Washington (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) new lineup of Zune digital media players will be made by contract manufacturer Flextronics International Ltd (FLEX.O) instead of Japan's Toshiba Corp (6502.T), which made the first Zune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J Allard, a Microsoft corporate vice president, said on Tuesday in an interview with Reuters that the company opted to go with Toshiba's 30-gigabyte player last year because it needed to rush to market with its first product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, it decided to bring all the design in-house and selected Flextronics for the manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To build this product, we really needed to think about it end-to-end," said Allard, who runs the Zune business. "It also brings with it cost advantages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will start selling three new Zune models in mid-November. The 4-gigabyte, 8-gigabyte and 80-gigabyte Zunes will all come with a new feature that allows a user to wirelessly and automatically sync media via a WiFi network from a PC to the Zune when its battery is charging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi, editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASTANA Oct 3 (Reuters) - Kazakh Ecology Minister Nurlan
Iskakov said on Wednesday the government had imposed a $609
million fine on the Chevron-led (CVX.N) Tengizchevroil (TCO) oil
venture over ecological and other violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fine comes at a time the Kazakh government is locked in
a dispute with a separate group of Western oil majors led by
Italy's Eni (ENI.MI) at another oilfield in the Central Asian
state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As you know we also have big claims over Tengizchevroil,"
Iskakov told reporters. "We have put forward a fine of 74.4
billion tenge or $609 million."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iskakov said the fine was imposed due to various violations
including what the government saw as the company's slow progress
in dealing with vast sulphur stocks at the Tengiz onshore
oilfield in western Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Any company that does not fulfil ecological requirements
will be dealt with in the harshest way," Iskakov said, adding
that the matter was being handled by a regional court in the
oil-rich part of Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp could not be reached for comment but it had
previously rejected criticism of its environmental record in the
former Soviet state and said it operated its sulphur stocks in a
safe manner consistent with Kazakhstan's laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TCO was previously fined $71 million for open air sulphur
storage, but that was reduced on appeal in 2003 to $7 million by
the Supreme Court.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds news conference with Kroes, Visa appeal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Huw Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Oct 3 (Reuters) - The European Commission fined
Visa 10.2 million euros ($14.5 million) on Wednesday for
refusing to let investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N) join its
payment card system in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it would appeal, adding that the EU's time
would be better spent making a single payments market work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Union's executive body said in a statement that
Visa refused to admit the U.S. bank from March 2000 to September
2006 without objective justification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brussels is trying to inject more competition into a sector
dominated by Visa and arch-rival MasterCard (MA.N). One out of
every nine euros spend in Europe is spent using a Visa card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The payment cards industry plays a key role in the creation
and functioning of the single market in payments," EU
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Commission will not tolerate anticompetitive behaviour
and will intervene if companies are illegally refused membership
of payment card networks," Kroes added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said it would challenge the fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not believe that Visa Europe infringed EU competition
law. There is no value as a precedent to this decision," Visa
Europe Chief Executive Peter Ayliffe said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa, owned by 4,500 European banks, said Morgan Stanley was
a competitor, a view dismissed by the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa reached a settlement with Morgan Stanley in September
last year and admitted the U.S. bank as a member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission said it decided to impose a fine even though
Morgan Stanley withdrew its complaint. The bank was excluded
from the UK market for six and a half years, including more than
two years after the Commission started action against Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are over 320 million Visa cards in Europe which were
used to make purchases and cash withdrawals worth over 1.2
trillion euros in the year ending September 2006, the company
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INTERCHANGE WAIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, the Commission struck an agreement with Visa in
2002, forcing it to cut interchange fees by the end of 2007 in
return for not being subject to the full thrust of EU antitrust
rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interchange fees refer to the charge a retailer's bank pays
the card issuer's bank, a percentage of each purchase, to
process card-based transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retailers want Kroes to scrap such fees altogether, a step
Kroes signalled earlier this year she was not minded to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kroes said on Wednesday action could be taken regarding Visa
after the end of the year once the agreement has expired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will just think over it and find out what has to be done
and you can be sure, anyhow, I have the feeling that something
should be done," Kroes told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said the Commission has been pondering the future of
interchange fees for over a decade but "has yet to provide the
certainty desperately needed to allow Europe's banks to invest
in developing a true internal market in payments".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kroes is due to report shortly on her study into interchange
fees charged by MasterCard (MA.N), an outcome may affect what
happens to Visa.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts lead)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Muklis Ali&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Oct 3 (Reuters) - Indonesia's biggest oil find in
a decade may be even larger than partner Exxon Mobil estimates,
but could cost at least $800 million more than initially
expected to develop, officials at state-run Pertamina said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The giant onshore Cepu block, located between Central and
East Java provinces, ranks among the major's top 10 projects
worldwide, and Indonesia is hoping that it will provide a big
boost for the country's domestic oil and gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pertamina said it estimates oil reserves in the main Banyu
Urip field in the Cepu block at 350 million barrels, above
Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) initial assessment of 250 million
barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cost of developing the Banyu Urip oilfield is also
expected to rise from initial estimates of $1.2 billion, said
Hestu Bagyo, Pertamina's head for the Cepu project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pertamina estimates recoverable reserves of 350 million
barrels in Cepu's Banyu Urip field only," Hestu Bagyo,
Pertamina's head for the Cepu project, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Because of higher drilling costs and land clearing, the
development cost of Banyu Urip will be higher than the initial
project estimated cost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deva Rachman, Exxon Mobil Indonesia's spokeswoman,
reiterated that the total cost of developing the whole Cepu
block was about $2.6 billion, although the cost for Banyu Urip
alone would be revised up from its initial estimate of $1.2
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Pertamina official, who declined to be identified, said
the cost of developing the Banyu Urip field could be as much as
$2 billion or even more, a revision in line with soaring costs
on energy projects worldwide amid a shortage of rigs and
personnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, OPEC's second-smallest producer and the only
member which is a net importer of oil, has struggled to
maintain output as it has failed to tap new oilfields fast
enough to compensate for older ones as they become less
productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil and Pertamina are jointly developing the Cepu
block, which includes seven other fields such as Alas
Dara/Kemuning, Jambaran and Cendana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Indonesian government initially estimated that Cepu had
potential reserves of 600 million barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bagyo said production from Banyu Urip was expected to start
at the end of 2008 or early 2009, even though Pertamina Deputy
President Director Iin Arifin Takhyan said in August that early
production had been delayed by about nine months to October
2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are still on target to begin production with about
10,000 to 20,000 barrels per day at the end of 2008 or early
2009," Bagyo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Indonesian government hopes that a quick development of
Cepu will help reverse the country's shrinking oil output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil has said it wants to produce oil as soon as
possible from Cepu block, but complex problems are throwing it
off schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia's energy watchdog, BPMIGAS, which is authorised
to control and manage oil contractors working in Indonesia, has
said that Cepu faced problems securing ownership of the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia's crude oil production fell to 827,400 bpd in
September from 834,700 bpd in August.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Disney Channel drew more viewers 
than CNN or any other prime-time cable staple in the third 
quarter, setting a record for that period of the year, thanks 
to TV movie "High School Musical 2" and series "Hannah Montana" 
and "The Suite Life of Zack  Cody."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Walt Disney Co-owned kids channel also turned in the 
second-largest prime time cable audience for any quarter ever 
behind sister cable network ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the first time, the Disney Channel bested top-rated 
rival Nickelodeon among kids ages 6 to 11 in both prime and 
total day ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Channel, which is not ad supported, shows "Hannah 
Montana," about a high school girl's secret life as a rock 
star, and "The Suite Life of Zack  Cody" about twin boys who 
live in a five-star hotel, tied for No. 1 basic cable series 
for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ratings victories over basic cable networks aimed at 
adults such as ESPN, Lifetime and Fox News Channel, put the 
kids network into a new realm, said Rich Ross, president of 
Disney Channel Worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The amazing thing that we accomplished was not only did we 
succeed across kids ... the message is we are for kids and 
families," Ross said. "Consumers voted with their remote 
controls."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Disney Channel has steadily climbed to the top of cable 
ratings starting about five years ago on the strength of 
original TV movies and TV series such as "Lizzie McGuire" and 
"That's So Raven" that chronicle kids' everyday experiences 
with a bit of fantasy thrown in, Ross said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The network's fortunes reached their pinnacle this year 
with the release of the TV movie "High School Musical 2," which 
became the highest-rated cable program ever among all audiences 
at its August 17 release, with 17.2 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE Oct 5 (Reuters) - Australian food and beverages
firm Golden Circle said it had rejected a takeover offer from
Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCL.AX) because it was too low, in favour
of a private equity offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Amatil said last week it was in talks with
unlisted Golden Circle, in a deal worth about A$195 million
($173 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Golden Circle is owned by around 850 shareholders, mainly
pineapple farmers, who supply more than 180,000 tonnes of fruit
and vegetables each year for processing. It is best known for
producing canned pineapple, juices and fruit salads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Coca-Cola's proposal for 100 percent of the company at A$1
(per share) offer price was highly conditional and we did not
believe it was superior," said Golden Circle Chairman Ern Pope,
adding it was Coca-Cola Amatil's second offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the board of Golden Circle had decided to stick
with its recommendation of an earlier offer from private equity
firm Anchorage Capital Partners, financially backed by
Macquarie Bank MBL.AX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pope said Coca-Cola Amatil's offer undervalued the upside
potential of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the Anchorage recapitalisation, shareholders will
retain ownership of 65 percent of the company, with the
possibility of floating Golden Circle on the Australian Stock
Exchange after two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anchorage will pay A$35.5 million for 44.3 million Golden
Circle shares, or 35 percent of the firm, at a price of 80
cents per share, and about A$120 million of debt will be
refinanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Golden Circle shareholders are due to vote on the Anchorage
offer at a meeting on Oct. 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Coca-Cola Amatil, which is 30 percent owned
by The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), was not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Amatil was keen on Golden Circle to combine with
its SPC Ardmona fruit processing business, as part of its
long-running push to diversify out of fizzy drinks. It bought
Ardmona in 2005 for A$500 million.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Thursday that its "Halo 3" video game racked up worldwide sales of $300 million in its first week, making it one of the year's best sellers and helping to more than double sales of its Xbox 360 console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news builds on Microsoft's previous announcement that the final chapter in its series of alien-battling shooting games did $170 million in sales in the first 24 hours after its September 25 debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game is crucial to Microsoft's efforts to establish dominance in the $30 billion global video game industry that has been dominated by Sony Corp the past few years. Microsoft also competes against Nintendo Co Ltd's Wii console, which has enjoyed stronger sales this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Initial reports from retailers worldwide show console sales have more than doubled compared with the weekly average before the launch of 'Halo 3,'" Microsoft said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not elaborate, but industry figures show that the company sold 277,000 Xbox 360 units in the United States in August and just over 11,000 units in Japan in that month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said "Halo 3," which lets people play the game together or battle each other over the Internet, had spurred a "record number" of people to sign up for its paid Xbox Live online service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said all three "Halo" games had sold more than 20 million copies. Earlier this year, Microsoft said the first two games had sold 14.8 million copies, which could mean "Halo 3" has sold as many as 5.2 million copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Microsoft rose 0.9 percent to close at $29.71 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;ALMATY (Reuters) - A Chevron-led oil venture in Kazakhstan 
denied on Thursday it was violating environmental laws and said 
that it will fight a $609 million fine imposed on it by the 
government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The move against Chevron alarmed investors working in 
Kazakhstan where the government is locked in a parallel row 
with an Italian-led consortium developing another oilfield, 
Kashagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Environmental Protection Minister Nurlan Iskakov announced 
the fine after accusing the Chevron-led project of making slow 
progress in removing open air sulfur stocks at the huge Tengiz 
oilfield in the west of the Central Asian state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the venture, Tengizchevroil, denied violating 
legislation and said it would challenge the accusation in 
court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am not going to speculate on the Kazakh government 
position or on their motivations," Todd Levy, Tengizchevroil 
general director, said on the sidelines of an energy 
conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With regard to sulfur, we store it completely in line with 
international standards, completely in alignment with 
environmental legislation. ... We disagree with the claim. And 
we are fighting it aggressively."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Kazakhstan has piled pressure on the Eni-led 
Kashagan consortium over cost and schedule overruns, in a 
campaign that has also included accusations of ecology 
breaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts are watching both cases closely, already alarmed 
by last month's legislative moves to allow the government to 
cancel contracts if it saw a threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some compared Kazakhstan to a case in Russia where Royal 
Dutch Shell lost control of a big energy project in a dispute 
with the government last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a concern," Joel Benjamin, a partner with Denton 
Wilde Sapte law firm, said on the sidelines of the same energy 
conference in Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Look at Venezuela, too. You might argue the trend is 
worldwide. But I think it's probably case by case. I think 
Kazakhstan looks to Russia in some way as an example."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SULFUR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The oil from Tengiz contains toxic hydrogen sulfide which 
is processed into huge piles of inert yellow sulfur and stored 
near the oil wells before the crude is transported by pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture sells some of the by-product. Although the 
sulfur market is limited, Levy said that last year, for the 
first time, the company sold more sulfur than it had made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maria Karazhigitova, a Tengizchevroil spokeswoman, said 
earlier the company would challenge the claim in court, adding 
a case related to the fine had been filed in a regional court 
in July. Neither side had previously reported the fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tengizchevroil was previously fined $71 million for open 
air sulfur storage, but that sum was reduced on appeal in 2003 
to $7 million by the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Tengiz venture also includes Exxon Mobil, LUKOIL, and 
Kazakh energy firm KazMunaiGas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Kazakhstan-watchers said there was no immediate risk of 
a major investor exodus, even though small investors may be 
putting some of their projects on hold due to uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Regardless of what they (Kazakhs) do investors are still 
going to be coming to this country," said Benjamin. "Oil is 
trading at $80-$90 a barrel. You are not going to stop people 
having the interest while it's that high."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp launched on Thursday a Web site that lets people store medical information online, moving into a consumer health care business targeted by Google Inc and other technology players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's HealthVault stores medical information for free in an encrypted database and provides the user with the option of what information goes into the record and who sees that information. It is being launched only in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Web site also incorporates HealthVault Search, a specialized medical search engine to tap into the growing base of consumers who are increasingly turning to the Web to find health information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology and health companies for years have promised to change the industry by cutting waste and linking providers, insurance companies and patients in technologically safe ways. But without widely agreed standards or even a broad move toward electronic records, most offices are still filled with paper, frequently frustrating patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declared its health care intentions last year when it bought Azyxxi, a software system developed by a hospital to collect and display real-time patient data from a variety of sources. This year, it bought a start-up company that develops Web search technology for medical information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web search leader Google also has designs to be a player in health information products, but specific plans have been slow to materialize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculation from Google watchers has centered on ideas ranging from a health information search service to a way for allowing Google users to create a personal medical record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it plans to reach out to doctors, hospitals and health services companies to build Web applications to work with HealthVault. It's a strategy similar to how it encouraged other technology companies to build applications on top of its Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds lawyer quotes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Maria Golovnina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALMATY Oct 4 (Reuters) - A Chevron-led (CVX.N) oil venture
in Kazakhstan denied on Thursday it was violating environmental
laws and said that it will fight a $609 million fine imposed on
it by the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move against Chevron alarmed investors working in
Kazakhstan where the government is locked in a parallel row with
an Italian-led consortium developing another oilfield, Kashagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Environmental Protection Minister Nurlan Iskakov announced
the fine after accusing the Chevron-led project of making slow
progress in removing open air sulphur stocks at the huge Tengiz
oilfield in the west of the Central Asian state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the venture, Tengizchevroil, denied violating
legislation and said it would challenge the accusation in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am not going to speculate on the Kazakh government
position or on their motivations," Todd Levy, Tengizchevroil
general director, said on the sidelines of an energy conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With regard to sulphur, we store it completely in line with
international standards, completely in alignment with
environmental legislation. ... We disagree with the claim. And
we are fighting it aggressively."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Kazakhstan has piled pressure on the Eni-led
Kashagan consortium over cost and schedule overruns, in a
campaign that has also included accusations of ecology breaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts are watching both cases closely, already alarmed by
last month's legislative moves to allow the government to cancel
contracts if it saw a threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some compared Kazakhstan to a case in Russia where Royal
Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) lost control of a big energy project in a
dispute with the government last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a concern," Joel Benjamin, a partner with Denton Wilde
Sapte law firm, said on the sidelines of the same energy
conference in Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Look at Venezuela, too. You might argue the trend is
worldwide. But I think it's probably case by case. I think
Kazakhstan looks to Russia in some way as an example."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SULPHUR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The oil from Tengiz contains toxic hydrogen sulphide which
is processed into huge piles of inert yellow sulphur and stored
near the oil wells before the crude is transported by pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture sells some of the by-product. Although the
sulphur market is limited, Levy said that last year, for the
first time, the company sold more sulphur than it had made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maria Karazhigitova, a Tengizchevroil spokeswoman, said
earlier the company would challenge the claim in court, adding a
case related to the fine had been filed in a regional court in
July. Neither side had previously reported the fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tengizchevroil was previously fined $71 million for open air
sulphur storage, but that sum was reduced on appeal in 2003 to
$7 million by the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Tengiz venture also includes Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), LUKOIL
(LKOH.MM), and Kazakh eneryg firm KazMunaiGas [KMG.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Kazakhstan-watchers said there was no immediate risk of
a major investor exodus, even though small investors may be
putting some of their projects on hold due to uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Regardless of what they (Kazakhs) do investors are still
going to be coming to this country," said Benjamin. "Oil is
trading at $80-$90 a barrel. You are not going to stop people
having the interest while it's that high."

&lt;p&gt;Oct 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Hansen Natural
Corp HANS.O, the parent of energy-drink maker Hansen Beverage

"Americas Buy List."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the stock's recent appreciation, the current price
fairly reflects the potential for growth from new products and
expansion into new markets, the brokerage said in a note to

Goldman's Americas Buy list in June, against a 1.1 percent gain
in the SP 500 Index .SPX, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman analyst Andrew Sawyer, who has a price target of
$60 on the stock, sees four key growth drivers for Hansen,
including its non-carbonated dairy-based coffee drink Java
Monster and the Anheuser-Busch distribution deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hansen is likely to announce a European distribution
arrangement before the year-end and could take a broad price
increase on its 16-ounce line-up by early next year, bolstering
gross margin, Sawyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the Corona, California-based company fell 5
percent in early electronic trade Thursday, after closing at
$59.0 Wednesday on the Nasdaq.

MXIM.PK in its conviction buy list, and said it expects
Maxim's earnings growth to substantially accelerate in calendar
year 2008.
 National's distributors are continuing to lower inventories,

key catalyst for the stock, driving its removal from the list,
the brokerage said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman retained its "buy" rating and a $30 price target on
National Semiconductor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which raised Maxim to "buy" from "neutral,"
said the stock's delisting from Nasdaq, stemming from its stock
option backdating investigation, created an attractive entry

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said on 
Wednesday it plans to turn 21 acres of oceanfront property on 
the Hawaiian island of Oahu into its first mixed-use luxury 
family resort outside its theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The resort is scheduled to open in 2011 with more than 800 
units, including hotel rooms and villas for Disney's timeshare 
business, Disney Vacation Club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said it would pay $144 million for the land, which 
will be paid in installments over several years as the resort 
is built. The company did not disclose the project's total 
cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has forecast domestic capital expenditures for the 
parks division "meaningfully" below $1 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Groundbreaking is expected in the second half of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The development on the island's western side in the Ko 
Olina Resort  Marina is expected to create 1,000 jobs, Disney 
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jay Rasulo, chairman of Disney Parks  Resorts, said Hawaii 
was one of the most requested destinations for the Vacation 
Club's 350,000 members aside from the company's theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rasulo told investors in February that the parks division 
was working on a concept to locate non-theme park properties in 
popular family vacation spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rasulo said at that time that expanding beyond theme parks 
could help the company get a greater share of the hotel 
business and increase the frequency at which families visit a 
Disney property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said on Wednesday that beach vacations are the most 
popular trips for families, and Hawaii is the top destination 
for prospective timeshare buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney is expected to unveil plans for the new resort by 
early 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Resorts operates 38 resort hotels with more than 
35,000 hotel rooms worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hawaii Gov. Linda Lingle and Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hanneman 
said in the statement they welcomed Disney to the island. The 
company's ABC television network currently shoots the hit TV 
show "Lost" in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Disney rose 6 cents to $34.72 in after hours 
electronic trade on Wednesday after the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds byline, cost of land) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Gina Keating &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LOS ANGELES, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said on Wednesday it plans to turn 21 acres of oceanfront property on the Hawaiian island of Oahu into its first mixed-use luxury family resort outside its theme parks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The resort is scheduled to open in 2011 with more than 800 units, including hotel rooms and villas for Disney's timeshare business, Disney Vacation Club. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney said it would pay $144 million for the land, which will be paid in installments over several years as the resort is built. The company did not disclose the project's total cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney has forecast domestic capital expenditures for the parks division "meaningfully" below $1 billion annually.    Groundbreaking is expected in the second half of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The development on the island's western side in the Ko Olina Resort &amp; Marina is expected to create 1,000 jobs, Disney said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Jay Rasulo, chairman of Disney Parks &amp; Resorts, said Hawaii was one of the most requested destinations for the Vacation Club's 350,000 members aside from the company's theme parks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rasulo told investors in February that the parks division was working on a concept to locate non-theme park properties in popular family vacation spots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rasulo said at that time that expanding beyond theme parks could help the company get a greater share of the hotel business and increase the frequency at which families visit a Disney property.  Disney said on Wednesday that beach vacations are the most popular trips for families, and Hawaii is the top destination for prospective timeshare buyers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney is expected to unveil plans for the new resort by early 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney Resorts operates 38 resort hotels with more than 35,000 hotel rooms worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Hawaii Gov. Linda Lingle and Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hanneman said in the statement they welcomed Disney to the island. The company's ABC television network currently shoots the hit TV show "Lost" in Hawaii. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Disney rose 6 cents to $34.72 in after hours electronic trade on Wednesday after the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by by Toni Reinhold; Reuters Messaging: gina.keating.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 213 955 6776)) Keywords: DISNEY EXPANSION/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with army saying cocaine seized, no one killed) MEXICO CITY, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Mexican soldiers seized at least 10 tons of cocaine after a gunbattle with drug smugglers at a northern port town on Friday, the army said. The shootout happened during an anti-drugs operation in Tampico in Tamaulipas state, territory of the Gulf Cartel, one of the two most powerful Mexican drug gangs. The army denied earlier government and media reports that up to 15 people had been killed in the shootout, but said at least 10 tons of cocaine had been seized from a tractor-trailer in the steamy Gulf of Mexico town. They attacked the troops with firearms, but the aggression was repelled without losses on either side, the Defense Ministry said in comments reported by the Mexican state news service. President Felipe Calderon has deployed thousands of troops across Mexico to attack the dominant Gulf and Sinaloa cartels since taking office in December. Among the offensive's recent successes, police last week arrested Sandra Avila, reputedly a top trafficker nicknamed the Queen of the Pacific. But more than 2,000 people have been killed this year in violence involving rival drug gangs and the government. Seven men were arrested in Friday's raid after a tip-off led the soldiers to the traffickers, who were unloading bales of cocaine from the truck, the army said. The haul was being weighed and could be bigger than initially thought, it said. Mexican newspapers reported on their Web sites that up to 15 people were killed in the fighting. A government official also said several people were killed. Calderon, visiting Tamaulipas on Friday, spoke of his clampdown on the violent and wealthy gangs who smuggle huge amounts of cocaine, amphetamines and marijuana to the United States. Last month a private jet with nearly 4 tons of cocaine aboard crashed into a southern Mexican jungle. Some reports say the army forced the plane to crash-land.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Scott Hillis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Oct 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
said on Friday that Bungie, the crown jewel of its video game
unit behind the hit "Halo" franchise, will become a separate
company, opening the possibility that it could make titles for
Microsoft rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it will retain a stake in the new company,
to be called Bungie LLC, and will continue to publish future
"Halo" games and other titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now that they're free they can come up with something else
and address the whole market," Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael
Pachter said, adding he expected Microsoft would have a window
of exclusive rights to new Bungie games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declined to give any details of the separation,
which follows days of speculation triggered by a reader blog on
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Web site that Bungie was set to
split from its corporate parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is common in the $30 billion video game industry for
star developers or teams of people to leave a game publisher to
work on new, unrelated projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Faced with losing key talent, Microsoft made sure the split
was amicable, Pachter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What's unusual is the umbilical cord, they kept a linkage.

development efforts in preparation to launch its Xbox gaming
console the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Halo 3," which was released on Sept. 25, has already
topped $300 million in worldwide sales, and put Microsoft's
money-losing entertainment division on track to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is keeping the rights to the "Halo" franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As far as anybody should be concerned, it's business as

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Oct 5 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said a hydrogen
unit at its 150,000 barrel per day Los Angeles-area refinery in Torrance,
California, was back at planned production on Friday after being shut on
Wednesday by a malfunction, according to a spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Gasoline prices weakened 2 cents per gallon in the Los Angeles market
Friday morning, traders said, as four Los Angeles refineries recovered from
malfunctions, including the full shutdown of two plants, on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gasoline sold at a 28-cent premium to the NYMEX November RBOB gasoline
contract on Friday, traders said. Gasoline shot up 9 cents to 30 cents over
NYMEX November RBOB in the two days following the Wednesday upsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valero Energy Corp's (VLO.N) 135,000-bpd total-throughput-capacity
refinery in the Los Angeles industrial suburb of Wilmington, California,
continued restarting units Friday after a Wednesday plantwide shutdown due
to a loss of electrical power from the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wilmington plant of the ConocoPhillips (COP.N) 139,000 bpd Los
Angeles refining complex was also restarting on Friday. The plant was
knocked off-line by the same power outage that hit the Valero refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Conoco and Valero have said they expect the refineries to be a
full production sometime this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All units at Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) 260,000 bpd Los Angeles-area
refinery in El Segundo were operating normally on Thursday after a
malfunction in the continuous catalytic reformer Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon continues an overhaul of a crude unit and a coking unit at the
Torrance refinery. The overhaul began on Aug. 20 and was expected to last
two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP Plc's 265,000 bpd Los Angeles-area refinery in Carson, California,
began a three-week overhaul on a crude unit and a coking unit on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conoco's Los Angeles refining complex does initial crude oil refining
at a Carson plant and then sends the products via a 5-mile (8 km) pipeline
to the Wilmington plant for processing into motor fuels like gasoline,
according to information on the company's Web site.

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch customs officers found 100 dead beetles stuffed with cocaine while examining a parcel from Peru, Dutch authorities said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little drug couriers' bodies had been slit open and filled with a total of 300 grams of cocaine, with an estimated street-value of 8,000 euros ($11,270).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a very striking method of smuggling. We have never seen anything like this before," said government spokesman Kees Nanninga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers decided to open the parcel after scanning it and seeing what appeared to be insects inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALMATY (Reuters) - A Chevron-led oil venture in Kazakhstan 
denied on Thursday it was violating environmental laws and said 
that it will fight a $609 million fine imposed on it by the 
government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The move against Chevron alarmed investors working in 
Kazakhstan where the government is locked in a parallel row 
with an Italian-led consortium developing another oilfield, 
Kashagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Environmental Protection Minister Nurlan Iskakov announced 
the fine after accusing the Chevron-led project of making slow 
progress in removing open air sulfur stocks at the huge Tengiz 
oilfield in the west of the Central Asian state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the venture, Tengizchevroil, denied violating 
legislation and said it would challenge the accusation in 
court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am not going to speculate on the Kazakh government 
position or on their motivations," Todd Levy, Tengizchevroil 
general director, said on the sidelines of an energy 
conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With regard to sulfur, we store it completely in line with 
international standards, completely in alignment with 
environmental legislation. ... We disagree with the claim. And 
we are fighting it aggressively."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Kazakhstan has piled pressure on the Eni-led 
Kashagan consortium over cost and schedule overruns, in a 
campaign that has also included accusations of ecology 
breaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts are watching both cases closely, already alarmed 
by last month's legislative moves to allow the government to 
cancel contracts if it saw a threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some compared Kazakhstan to a case in Russia where Royal 
Dutch Shell lost control of a big energy project in a dispute 
with the government last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a concern," Joel Benjamin, a partner with Denton 
Wilde Sapte law firm, said on the sidelines of the same energy 
conference in Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Look at Venezuela, too. You might argue the trend is 
worldwide. But I think it's probably case by case. I think 
Kazakhstan looks to Russia in some way as an example."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SULFUR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The oil from Tengiz contains toxic hydrogen sulfide which 
is processed into huge piles of inert yellow sulfur and stored 
near the oil wells before the crude is transported by pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture sells some of the by-product. Although the 
sulfur market is limited, Levy said that last year, for the 
first time, the company sold more sulfur than it had made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maria Karazhigitova, a Tengizchevroil spokeswoman, said 
earlier the company would challenge the claim in court, adding 
a case related to the fine had been filed in a regional court 
in July. Neither side had previously reported the fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tengizchevroil was previously fined $71 million for open 
air sulfur storage, but that sum was reduced on appeal in 2003 
to $7 million by the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Tengiz venture also includes Exxon Mobil, LUKOIL, and 
Kazakh energy firm KazMunaiGas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Kazakhstan-watchers said there was no immediate risk of 
a major investor exodus, even though small investors may be 
putting some of their projects on hold due to uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Regardless of what they (Kazakhs) do investors are still 
going to be coming to this country," said Benjamin. "Oil is 
trading at $80-$90 a barrel. You are not going to stop people 
having the interest while it's that high."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst, company comments, byline, share price) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Ransdell Pierson &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Thursday named Martin Mackay, one of its senior research executives, as its new research chief, and selected a Merck &amp; Co Inc (MRK.N) research officer to head clinical development of its medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest drugmaker, which has been unable in recent years to launch many big-selling drugs despite an annual $7 billion research budget, also said it is setting up a stand-alone biotherapeutics center in California to discover new biotech medicines and technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said the new biotherapeutics unit will be headed by Corey Goodman, a member of the National Academy of Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are also today launching a new biotherapeutics and bioinnovation center with a unique structure to discover, license and acquire more new product candidates that we can put into development," Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Jeff Kindler said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mackay, a 12-year veteran of the company, has until now been second in command of global research and development. He is replacing John LaMattina, who in May said he would retire by year-end as president of R after 30 years with the drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said its new head of clinical development, Briggs Morrison, most recently was senior vice president of research planning and integration at Merck. Previously, he was Merck's head of clinical development, the stage of research when medicines are tested in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Revenues at Pfizer, whose shares are trading at levels seen in 1997, have fallen in the past two years due to generic competition for former blockbuster Pfizer drugs such as anti-depressant Zoloft and blood pressure treatment Norvasc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company badly needs new medicines to return to the strong earnings growth of past years and satisfy frustrated stockholders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Meanwhile, promising drugs have failed clinical trials, approved products have failed to generate impressive sales and Pfizer is girding for generic competition as soon as 2010 for its $13 billion-a-year Lipitor cholesterol drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Patent expirations will follow in 2012 on impotence treatment Viagra, Geodon for schizophrenia and Detrol for overactive bladder, cautions Moody's analyst Michael Levesque. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We expect 32 percent of Pfizer's current revenues to be threatened by generics in 2011 and another 8 percent in 2012," said Levesque. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer's biggest hope of new revenues to offset those expected sales declines had been torcetrapib, a promising cholesterol drug whose development was scrapped last year on safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Levesque declined to speculate whether Mackay, as an insider, can galvanize Pfizer's struggling laboratories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We wouldn't conclude that, just because they've chosen someone in-house to head R, that he won't be effective," Levesque said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Company spokesman Andy McCormick said Mackay has been "driving change, particularly in the last couple of years," at Pfizer and that the addition of Goodman and Morrison would strengthen research efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said on Thursday it aims to "dramatically raise the bar" on productivity within its research laboratories, and has begun to streamline and consolidate its operations, with hundreds of scientists having been relocated to different sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In July 2006, Pfizer ousted CEO Hank McKinnell and replaced him with Kindler, the company's general counsel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer shares closed up 22 cents to $25.30 on Thursday, in line with moderate gains for the drug sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Oct 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Thursday that its "Halo 3" video game racked up worldwide sales of $300 million in its first week, making it one of the year's best sellers and helping to nearly triple sales of its Xbox 360 console. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The news builds on Microsoft's previous announcement that the final chapter in its series of alien-battling shooting games did $170 million in sales in the first 24 hours after its Sept. 25 debut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The game is crucial to Microsoft's efforts to establish dominance in the $30 billion global video game industry that has been dominated by Sony Corp (6758.T) the past few years. Microsoft also competes against Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS Wii console, which has enjoyed stronger sales this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Initial reports from retailers worldwide show console sales have nearly tripled compared with the weekly average before the launch of 'Halo 3,'" Microsoft said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft did not elaborate, but industry figures show that the company sold 277,000 Xbox 360 units in the United States in August and just over 11,000 units in Japan in that month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft also said "Halo 3," which lets people play the game together or battle each other over the Internet, had spurred a "record number" of people to sign up for its paid Xbox Live online service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said all three "Halo" games had sold more than 20 million copies. Earlier this year, Microsoft said the first two games had sold 14.8 million copies, which could mean "Halo 3" has sold as many as 5.2 million copies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares in Microsoft rose 0.9 percent to close at $29.71 on Nasdaq. Over the past year, the stock has risen 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Scott Hillis) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Gary Hill; San Francisco Newsroom, e-mail: scott.hillis@reuters.com, +1 415 677 2505)) Keywords: MICROSOFT HALO3/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and fund management firm Aetos Capital plan to take over property investor Simplex Investment Advisors Inc 8942.T in a $1.4 billion deal in what may be a harbinger of more acquisitions in Japan's property market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Aetos will offer 215,000 yen per Simplex share, the two said on Friday, representing a 65 percent premium over Simplex's Thursday closing price of 130,000 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Simplex rose on Friday to 150,000 yen, up the daily limit of 20,000 yen or 15.4 percent, after Reuters reported that the Simplex sales were up for sale.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts throughout, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Taro Fuse and Mayumi Negishi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Oct 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and fund
management firm Aetos Capital plan to take over property
investor Simplex Investment Advisors Inc 8942.T in a $1.4
billion deal in what may be a harbinger of more acquisitions in
Japan's property market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and Aetos will offer 215,000 yen per Simplex share,
the two said on Friday, representing a 65 percent premium over
Simplex's Thursday closing price of 130,000 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Simplex rose on Friday to 150,000 yen, up the
daily limit of 20,000 yen or 15.4 percent, after Reuters
reported that the Simplex sales were up for sale. Trading was
later suspended after sources told Reuters that Goldman planned
to launch the bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Share prices of real estate firms have fallen steeply, as a
global liquidity squeeze ended a five-year bull run in Japan's
$40 billion property trust market, where the likes of Morgan
Stanley (MS.N), Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Goldman Sachs have
invested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simplex and Nikko Cordial 8603.T, Simplex's top
shareholder with a 42.5 percent stake, said they agreed to
Goldman's offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the deal, which values Simplex at 157 billion yen
($1.35 billion), a special purpose vehicle set up by Japan units
of Goldman and Aetos would acquire at least 80 percent of
Simplex shares for a minimum 124.7 billion yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the bid, to run from Oct. 12 to Nov. 8, the vehicle
will buy up any remaining Simplex shares, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters reported late on Thursday that Yoshihiro Mikami, a
major shareholder in Simplex and a former Salomon Brothers bond
trader, was looking to sell his 29 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nikko Cordial said it expected to post a special profit of
44 billion yen in the business year to March 2008 on the share
sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simplex has three main business segments: asset management
of real estate funds in Japan, property development and property
marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Alison Tudor)

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Oct 5 (Reuters) - Brazil's state oil company
Petrobras (PETR4.SA)(PBR.N) has entered the final stages of
talks to acquire an Exxon Mobil group (XOM.N) refinery in
Okinawa, Japan, the Yomiuri Shimbun daily reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil's TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK (5012.T) declined on
Friday to comment on the report, which did not identify its
sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It would be inappropriate to discuss or speculate on any
particular opportunities that we may or may not be considering,"
an ExxonMobil spokeswoman in Tokyo told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petrobras has been negotiating to buy the 100,000 barrels
per day Nishihara refinery operated by Nansei Sekiyu KK in the
southern Japanese island of Okinawa, industry sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nansei Sekiyu is 87.5 percent owned by TonenGeneral while
Japanese trader Sumitomo Corp. (8053.T) owns the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The daily reported that Petrobras is likely to acquire all
of the 87.5 percent stake in Nansei held by TonenGeneral for
several billion yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Petrobras official declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil traders have been closely following the development of
the deal since it first emerged about about a year ago. One
trader said last week that the two companies were likely to have
entered the final stages of negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petrobras Director Nestor Cervero said last month that talks
were continuing but declined to speculate if and when a deal
might be sealed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Oct 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) launched on Thursday a Web site that lets people store medical information online, moving into a consumer health care business targeted by Google Inc (GOOG.O) and other technology players.  Microsoft's HealthVault stores medical information for free in an encrypted database and provides the user with the option of what information goes into the record and who sees that information. It is being launched only in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Web site also incorporates HealthVault Search, a specialized medical search engine to tap into the growing base of consumers who are increasingly turning to the Web to find health information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Technology and health companies for years have promised to change the industry by cutting waste and linking providers, insurance companies and patients in technologically safe ways. But without widely agreed standards or even a broad move toward electronic records, most offices are still filled with paper, frequently frustrating patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft declared its health care intentions last year when it bought Azyxxi, a software system developed by a hospital to collect and display real-time patient data from a variety of sources. This year, it bought a start-up company that develops Web search technology for medical information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Web search leader Google also has designs to be a player in health information products, but specific plans have been slow to materialize.  Speculation from Google watchers has centered on ideas ranging from a health information search service to a way for allowing Google users to create a personal medical record. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft said it plans to reach out to doctors, hospitals and health services companies to build Web applications to work with HealthVault. It's a strategy similar to how it encouraged other technology companies to build applications on top of its Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi, editing by Richard Chang; Reuters Messaging: daisuke.wakabayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 206 652 2326)) Keywords: MICROSOFT HEALTH/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Oct 4 (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments said on Thursday it has appointed the head of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) securities services business to lead its newly created institutional services business group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Fidelity, the world's biggest mutual fund firm with assets under management of $1.5 trillion, said Michael Clark will join as president of Fidelity Institutional Services, the umbrella organization created to serve institutional clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Clark, 50, was chief executive overseeing JPMorgan's $15 trillion worldwide securities services business.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Friday 
that Bungie, the crown jewel of its video game unit behind the 
hit "Halo" franchise, will become a separate company, opening 
the possibility that it could make titles for Microsoft rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it will retain a stake in the new company, 
to be called Bungie LLC, and will continue to publish future 
"Halo" games and other titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now that they're free they can come up with something else 
and address the whole market," Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael 
Pachter said, adding he expected Microsoft would have a window 
of exclusive rights to new Bungie games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declined to give any details of the separation, 
which follows days of speculation triggered by a reader blog on 
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Web site that Bungie was set to 
split from its corporate parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is common in the $30 billion video game industry for 
star developers or teams of people to leave a game publisher to 
work on new, unrelated projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Faced with losing key talent, Microsoft made sure the split 
was amicable, Pachter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What's unusual is the umbilical cord, they kept a linkage. 
Credit Microsoft that they knew they were going to lose a super 
talented group of people," Pachter said. "They turned what 
could have a big loss into a manageable, fair split of labor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose 0.8 percent to $29.95 in early 
afternoon trading on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bungie said Microsoft's Xbox 360 would be its "primary 
focus," though executives added they had no immediate plans to 
develop for Sony Corp's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Co Ltd's 
Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Xbox has given us lot of success so, for now, our eyes 
are set on the Xbox 360," Bungie spokesman Brian Jarrard said. 
"We're not in a situation where we're running out the door and 
grabbing Wii and PS3 development kits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's not a real intention to do that unless something 
changes down the road," Jarrard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft bought Bungie in 2000 as it beefed up its game 
development efforts in preparation to launch its Xbox gaming 
console the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Halo 3," which was released on September 25, has already 
topped $300 million in worldwide sales, and put Microsoft's 
money-losing entertainment division on track to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is keeping the rights to the "Halo" franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As far as anybody should be concerned, it's business as

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/QUITO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) asked an Ecuador court on Monday to drop an environmental lawsuit the oil giant said had turned into a "judicial farce."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its petition to an Ecuador Superior Court, Chevron cited several examples of interference in the case by the executive branch of the government, judicial misconduct and misconduct by the plaintiffs lawyers, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said the court failed to recognize the "overwhelming volume" of evidence and legal defenses that would exonerate the company, as well as the court's lack of jurisdiction, due process and bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now find ourselves in a situation where the court is abandoning any sense that this is going to be conducted under the rule of law," Chevron General Counsel Charles James told Reuters. "This puts them on notice that any ruling that is adduced through this process will have no validity whatsoever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 30,000 residents of the Amazon jungle, including the Cofan Indian tribe, accuse Chevron's Texaco subsidiary of dumping 18 billion gallons of oil-polluted water from 1972 to 1992. They are seeking $6 billion in damages from the San Ramon, California-based company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Donziger, one of the plaintiff's lawyers, classified Chevron's request for a dismissal as "a strategy that already has been tried and failed in multiple occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are confident that the evidence in the court up to this point is overwhelmingly favorable to us," Donziger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs have received the public support of leftist Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa, who has said that Chevron has done irreversible damage to the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chevron denies the claims against it and has been fighting the litigation. Earlier this year, the company threatened to take the case outside of Ecuador to an international tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every instrumentality of the court is under a tremendous amount of pressure," said Chevron's James. "With the executive branch exhorting everyone in this country to find Texaco liable, it's very unclear to us that anyone can withstand that pressure and act independently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James said the company would continue to fight the case until it is vindicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron asserts it is being persecuted for damage that was done by state oil company Petroecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the oil fields in question have been owned and operated by Petroecuador for more than 17 years and that the Ecuadorean company had not fulfilled its remediation obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petroecuador has also operated the fields in a manner that has caused numerous environmental problems, including frequent spills, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Ecuador ordered foreign oil companies to give the state nearly all their extra revenue generated by high oil prices. Correa has also said he wants to renegotiate their contracts to increase Ecuador's share in oil projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Matt Daily in New York and Ankur Relia in Bangalore)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has given investors plenty to worry about throughout the year, but they have shrugged off his cautionary remarks and embraced his couched reassurances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be time to reconsider Dimon's cautionary side after Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N unveiled a $5.5 billion credit implosion last week. Merrill's shocker -- a money-losing third quarter -- once again demonstrates how Wall Street firms and analysts have woefully underestimated exposure to risky subprime mortgages, leveraged loans and collateralized-debt obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts expect JPMorgan to take at least a few billion dollars in write-downs when it reports third-quarter results next week. But those estimates came before Friday's bad news from Merrill, once seen by some as the least exposed to the vagaries of the fixed-income market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, for example, Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo predicted JPMorgan should have about $2 billion in leveraged loan write-downs before fees and hedges. JPMorgan, which declined to comment for this story, also has exposure to the subprime and CDO markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at CreditSights, an independent fixed-income research firm, said most large U.S. banks, when they reported second-quarter results in July, also expected a solid second half. Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most expectations for a solid second half have been thrown out the window by the mortgage meltdown, which turned into a full-blown credit crunch, and possibly the first steps toward any economic slowdown or recession," CreditSights analysts said last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Dimon labeled the subprime mortgage lending business as "possibly ugly" in his annual letter to shareholders. But in the second quarter, it was home-equity loans to people with solid credit that hurt the bank's profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan set aside $1.53 billion for loan losses, up from $493 million a year earlier. About one-third of the increase resulted from higher loss estimates on home-equity loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, JPMorgan's Chase Home Finance originated $3.3 billion in subprime loans in the second quarter, No. 6 among U.S. lenders, and 15 percent more than the year-earlier period, according to National Mortgage News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares are down 2 percent this year. But that is still better than the 14 percent decline in Citigroup (C.N) shares and Merrill's 20 percent drop. The Dow Jones Titans Bank Index .DJTBAK is off 1.6 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan may have to set aside more for mortgage-related losses as the U.S. housing market continues to slump. Mayo said in his September 30 note that he expects continued reserve building at the bank, but at a slower pace than previous quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a July conference call, Dimon conceded JPMorgan was involved in a couple of hung leveraged buyout deals and exposed to leveraged loans without covenants. The credit markets have deteriorated even more since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's nothing that's on our balance sheet we're particularly concerned about, but if you see this continue you will see the street taking on a lot of bridge loans and more aggressive pricing of those things," Dimon said on the July conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reassure analysts and investors, Dimon also said that JPMorgan underwrites every loan as if it might end up owning it. He threw in a bit of caution, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the loan side ... I am less comfortable because I can't predict the outcome of the market," Dimon said in July. "But like I said, the way we look at it -- and obviously we don't expect to happen -- is if all of it ended up on our balance sheet, we'd be OK. We might have to take some markdowns and take some reserves, but we already have a lot of loan loss reserves."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We don't comment on rumors or market speculation," a spokesman for Pfizer in New York said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've nothing to say -- we don't comment on market rumors," a Sanofi spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil company Total (TOTF.PA) and cosmetics firm L'Oreal (OREP.PA), which jointly own about 23 percent of Sanofi's share capital, have previously made it clear they do not consider their stakes strategic.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) jumped 3 percent in a weaker market on Monday on rumors Pfizer (PFE.N) was looking to buy stakes in the group from Sanofi's major shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move, if confirmed, could be seen as a prelude to a full bid for Sanofi by U.S.-based Pfizer, which is already the largest pharmaceutical manufacturer in the world but has seen its growth flag recently on slowing sales of older medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquiring Sanofi, whose fortunes have also been hit recently by product setbacks, would be a huge deal as Sanofi's market capitalization is around 83 billion euros ($117 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil company Total (TOTF.PA) and cosmetics firm L'Oreal (OREP.PA), which jointly own about 23 percent of Sanofi's share capital, have previously made it clear they do not consider their stakes strategic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total said in August that it would sell its 13 percent stake in Sanofi-Aventis progressively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L'Oreal said in June the sale of its stake of around 10 percent in Sanofi was not imminent and its position had not changed after Sanofi won a U.S. patent trial on its blockbuster bloodthinner drug Plavix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at Pfizer, Sanofi, L'Oreal and Total all declined to comment on what they said was market speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk of Pfizer's interest in Sanofi is not new. The New York group was rumored to have approached Total about its stake in Sanofi four years ago, before Sanofi swooped on Aventis to create today's enlarged company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would seem to make sense from a therapeutic perspective," commented Mark Purcell, an industry analyst at Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cardiovascular franchise would sit quite nicely with that of Pfizer and the CNS (central nervous system) business fits in with where Pfizer's research is trying to re-emerge. It makes sense -- but it's just a rumor at the moment and it would be a very large acquisition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, shares in Total were down 0.5 percent and L'Oreal rose 0.4 percent. Pfizer shares were 0.7 percent weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sitaraman Shankar and Blaise Robinson, with Nick Antonovics in Paris and Bill Berkrot in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

interesting exploration opportunity, an analogue to the nearby
Ringhorne Field and in the same Paleocene play model as our
recent Storskrymten discovery," Pertra said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pertra said it would operate one exploration well on the
prospect, with a likely start-up of drilling from the Bredford
Dolphin rig in the second quarter of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;As Indian companies became more global, they were investing a lot on information technology infrastructure and that was good for Microsoft, Ravi Venkatesan, chairman of Microsoft Corporation India, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say that India is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world for Microsoft ... the strength is there in a very secular way," he said, but declined to give financial details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, it's exciting times, like it is for most companies, and the next few years look at least as exciting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft already sells its software in several Indian languages and offers technology services to manufacturing, retail and financial services companies in Asia's third-largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft set up in India in 1990 and employs more than 5,000 people in the country.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are expected to disclose losses of about $3 billion in mortgage securities and leveraged loans when they report earnings this month, the Financial Times reported, citing an analyst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is likely to report mark-to-market losses on leveraged loans of about $1.4 billion and an additional $700 million in write-downs of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, according to Howard Mason, analyst with Sanford Bernstein, the paper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mason estimated Bank of America will take write-downs of $700 million for leveraged loans and mortgage write-downs of $300 million, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other banks have already taken losses on the value of their holdings in mortgage-backed securities and leveraged loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the biggest U.S. bank, took a pretax write-down of $1.4 billion as of the end of the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns said last month it was writing down its $7.6 billion portfolio by about $250 million, or 3.2 percent.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Friday 
that Bungie, the crown jewel of its video game unit behind the 
hit "Halo" franchise, will become a separate company, opening 
the possibility that it could make titles for Microsoft rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it will retain a stake in the new company, 
to be called Bungie LLC, and will continue to publish future 
"Halo" games and other titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now that they're free they can come up with something else 
and address the whole market," Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael 
Pachter said, adding he expected Microsoft would have a window 
of exclusive rights to new Bungie games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declined to give any details of the separation, 
which follows days of speculation triggered by a reader blog on 
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Web site that Bungie was set to 
split from its corporate parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is common in the $30 billion video game industry for 
star developers or teams of people to leave a game publisher to 
work on new, unrelated projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Faced with losing key talent, Microsoft made sure the split 
was amicable, Pachter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What's unusual is the umbilical cord, they kept a linkage. 
Credit Microsoft that they knew they were going to lose a super 
talented group of people," Pachter said. "They turned what 
could have a big loss into a manageable, fair split of labor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose 0.8 percent to $29.95 in early 
afternoon trading on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bungie said Microsoft's Xbox 360 would be its "primary 
focus," though executives added they had no immediate plans to 
develop for Sony Corp's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Co Ltd's 
Wii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Xbox has given us lot of success so, for now, our eyes 
are set on the Xbox 360," Bungie spokesman Brian Jarrard said. 
"We're not in a situation where we're running out the door and 
grabbing Wii and PS3 development kits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's not a real intention to do that unless something 
changes down the road," Jarrard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft bought Bungie in 2000 as it beefed up its game 
development efforts in preparation to launch its Xbox gaming 
console the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Halo 3," which was released on September 25, has already 
topped $300 million in worldwide sales, and put Microsoft's 
money-losing entertainment division on track to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is keeping the rights to the "Halo" franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As far as anybody should be concerned, it's business as 
usual with Bungie. The only difference is that they are now 
employees of Bungie, not employees of Microsoft," Shane Kim, 
head of Microsoft Game Studios, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan Private Bank is looking to increase front-line staff in Asia by up to 50 percent in the coming year, as it battles to win more business from the region's new wealthy, its Asia chairman said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unit of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N), which focuses on customers worth US$25 million or more, could expand its team of private bankers and investment advisers to 180 from 120 as it seeks out newly minted entrepreneurs, added Michael Fung, who heads the firm's Asian private banking operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Asian markets now expanding so much and becoming much more mature, we decided to notch it up and expand a little bit faster," he told Reuters ahead of the Reuters Wealth Management Summit on Oct 8-10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The tycoons are our clients. But the next couple of levels, some of them (are) very low key, we don't know who they are. Some of them are in manufacturing. They're not listed companies. I think we're not there. I want to be there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fung said much of that hiring is likely to be done at business schools rather than from rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of wealthy individuals in Asia -- people with more than $1 million in financial assets excluding their homes -- grew 8.6 percent to 2.6 million in 2006, according to a report by Merrill Lynch and consultants Capgemini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wealth of this group grew 10.5 percent last year to $8.4 trillion, topping a growth rate of 10.3 percent in North America and 7.8 percent in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Private Bank has taken aim at the top tier of this market and estimates it has relationships with about 70 percent of the individuals on the most recent Forbes list of the 40 richest people in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the world's fifth largest wealth management firm, according to the most recent ranking by Scorpio Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOUBLE-DIGIT SALES GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powered by the region's booming economies and soaring markets, Fung said the Asian operation has seen stronger-than-expected revenue growth of 30 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the private banking veteran is forecasting more modest 15 to 20 percent rise in sales next year because he does not want to bank on a repeat of the big boost the firm has received from the Asian equity market rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This year the wind is behind us. The economy is doing well. China is a big story," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether we can do more next year, it's possible, but I don't want to count on it," he said, adding that the firm had advised clients to lighten risk in their portfolios in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fung, who previously ran Morgan Stanley's Asia Pacific private wealth management business, said the banking sector was also the most competitive he had ever seen it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, staff turnover has risen to around 20 percent. But he said there has been little leakage of assets because clients are managed on a more sophisticated team model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of the major relationships, they are very much institutionalized. That means that the client, the relationship, belongs to the bank, not necessarily belongs to the banker," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Asian operation, based in Hong Kong and Singapore, accounted for just under a fifth of the US$440 billion of JPMorgan Private Bank's total client assets under management at the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fung said that percentage should increase, but is unlikely to rise above 25 percent for some time. While Asia's economies are booming, he said this means many of the region's wealthy are pumping capital back into their businesses rather than hand it over to professional managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "age" of Asia's wealth is also much younger than in developed markets, where the chances of families coming into a windfall by selling off businesses they've owned for generations is greater, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I still do not see in Asia there's that much opportunity where that quickly you can bring in billions of dollars of new money from a relationship. But I see that quite commonly in Europe, in America," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

The Tokyo Stock Exchange then suspended trade in the issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    An announcement is expected to be made later in the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman owned 0.42 percent of Simplex stock as of March 31. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On Thursday, sources told Reuters a major shareholder in Simplex, Yoshihiro Mikami, would put his 29 percent stake up for sale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Simplex has three main business segments: asset management of real estate funds in Japan, development and marketing of property. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Taro Fuse, editing by Hugh Lawson;     Reuters Messaging: aiko.hayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    +81-5473-3714; aiko.hayashi@reuters.com)) Keywords: SIMPLEX GOLDMAN/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on Tuesday it expects its third-quarter net income to be significantly below the $5.4 billion it earned in the second quarter due to a sharp drop in its refining margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second largest U.S. oil and gas company said in an interim report that one-time items also should hurt third-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refining margins are expected to be a drag on third-quarter earnings for integrated oil and gas producers as well as independent refiners as refining margins dropped by more than half from second quarter levels in some U.S. regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said international benchmark margins also were considerably lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the amount of oil Chevron processed at its U.S. refineries fell about 8 percent to 812,000 barrels per day, mostly due to planned and unplanned shutdowns at its El Segundo Calif., and Pascagoula, Miss., refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crude unit at the Pascagoula refinery has been out since an August 16 fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company processed 1.04 million barrels of oil per day at its international refineries, up from 942,000 barrels in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's worldwide production for the first two months of the quarter fell about 1 percent from the second quarter to 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's crude oil prices during the period rose nearly 15 percent to $67.44 a barrel from second-quarter levels. Its international liquids prices rose over 9 percent to $65.26 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the company said it expects earnings at its exploration and production unit would be lower than the second quarter, as higher oil prices would be more than offset by lower U.S. natural gas prices, declining production and one-time charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. natural gas prices fell 12 percent to $5.75 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) during July and August. International gas prices rose to $3.75 per mcf from $3.64 per mcf in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron expects to post $700 million in charges during the quarter, offset slightly by a $260 million gain from the sale of marketing assets in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts were expecting the company to post third-quarter earnings of around $2.17 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. It had posted second-quarter earnings, excluding one-time items, of $2.37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's $5.4 billion second-quarter result included a $680 million one-time gain as well as losses of $160 million from debt reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron fell 2.9 percent to $90.12 in after-the-bell trading on Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the third largest U.S. oil company, said last week that profit from its refineries would be significantly lower, but gains from asset sales would bolster its profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) -- a smaller competitor -- also issued an interim report on Tuesday. It said it expected its production to rise nearly 10 percent in the quarter, but also sees its refining and wholesale margins to be about half last year's level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds new details throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on
Tuesday it expects its third-quarter net income to be
significantly below the $5.4 billion it earned in the second
quarter due to a sharp drop in its refining margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second largest U.S. oil and gas company said in an
interim report that one-time items also should hurt
third-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Refining margins are expected to be a drag on third-quarter
earnings for integrated oil and gas producers as well as
independent refiners as refining margins dropped by more than
half from second quarter levels in some U.S. regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said international benchmark margins also were
considerably lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, the amount of oil Chevron processed at its U.S.
refineries fell about 8 percent to 812,000 barrels per day,
mostly due to planned and unplanned shutdowns at its El Segundo
Calif., and Pascagoula, Miss., refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A crude unit at the Pascagoula refinery has been out since
an Aug. 16 fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company processed 1.04 million barrels of oil per day
at its international refineries, up from 942,000 barrels in the
second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's worldwide production for the first two months of
the quarter fell about 1 percent from the second quarter to 2.6
million barrels of oil equivalent per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's crude oil prices during the period rose
nearly 15 percent to $67.44 a barrel from second-quarter
levels. Its international liquids prices rose over 9 percent to
$65.26 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the company said it expects earnings at its
exploration and production unit would be lower than the second
quarter, as higher oil prices would be more than offset by
lower U.S. natural gas prices, declining production and
one-time charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. natural gas prices fell 12 percent to $5.75 per
thousand cubic feet (mcf) during July and August. International
gas prices rose to $3.75 per mcf from $3.64 per mcf in the
second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron expects to post $700 million in charges during the
quarter, offset slightly by a $260 million gain from the sale
of marketing assets in Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts were expecting the company to post third-quarter
earnings of around $2.17 a share, according to Reuters
Estimates. It had posted second-quarter earnings, excluding
one-time items, of $2.37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's $5.4 billion second-quarter result included a
$680 million one-time gain as well as losses of $160 million
from debt reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Chevron fell 2.9 percent to $90.12 in
after-the-bell trading on Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the third largest U.S. oil company,
said last week that profit from its refineries would be
significantly lower, but gains from asset sales would bolster
its profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) -- a smaller competitor -- also
issued an interim report on Tuesday. It said it expected its
production to rise nearly 10 percent in the quarter, but also
sees its refining and wholesale margins to be about half last
year's level.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY Oct 10 (Reuters) - The Australian government has
approved U.S. energy major Chevron's (CVX.N) massive Gorgon
liquefied natural gas (LNG) project off the nation's western
coast, paving the way for a final investment decision, local
media reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Australian daily, citing documents seen by the
newspaper, said Federal Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull
has already approved the Gorgon project, subject to conditions
relating to dredging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither Chevron nor the Environment Ministry could be
immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the Western Australia state government approved the
project in September, the national government has yet to give
the final go-ahead. Three years ago Chevron estimated the
Gorgon project, which has certified gas reserves of over 40
trillion cubic feet, would cost around A$11 billion ($9.9
billion) to develop, though analysts have said the final cost
could be almost double that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron had scrapped a 2006 deadline for approving the
project after environmental groups protested against plans for
an LNG plant to handle the project's gas on Barrow Island, a
nature reserve off Western Australia which is home to a rare
species of turtle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is the operator of the project and holds a 50
percent stake. Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Shell (RDSa.L) each have
25 percent.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 9 (Reuters) - Shares of Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
fell 2.9 percent to $90.12 in extended trade on Tuesday after
warning that its third-quarter profit will be significantly
lower than what it earned in the previous quarter.

&lt;p&gt;Co says, "The lower projected earnings are mainly the result of a sharp decline in refined-product margins for the downstream business and the impact of nonrecurring items. In Q2, nonrecurring items included a benefit of $680 mln from the co's sale of its common stock investment in Dynegy. Third quarter results are expected to include an approximate $260 mln gain on the sale of the co's marketing assets in the Benelux countries. Nonrecurring net charges in Q3 are projected to be ~$700 mln. These charges include asset impairments, environmental remediation provisions, income tax adjustments, asset retirement obligations, and severance provisions. Co also provides an operational update: Worldwide daily oil-equivalent production for the first two months of the third quarter declined about 1% from 2.63 million barrels per day in the second quarter. U.S. crude realizations improved by $8.55 per barrel -- in line with the increase in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and California heavy crude prices. International liquids realizations were higher by $5.35 per barrel, slightly more than the increase in Brent spot prices. U.S. natural gas realizations decreased $0.81 per thousand cubic feet, reflecting similar reductions in bid week pricing.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) shares surged 5.4 percent on Tuesday to an all-time high as the U.S. investment bank's recent third-quarter performance looks even better amid credit implosions at rival banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares closed up $12.24 at $239.20 on the New York Stock Exchange, eclipsing their previous record of $233.97 set on May 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Goldman, the largest securities firm in the world by market capitalization, reported a 79 percent rise in third-quarter profit. Since then, some of its rivals, including Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N, have stumbled badly. Merrill last week shocked investors when it said it would take $5.5 billion in write-downs and post a loss in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's market capitalization now stands at $102 billion, putting the investment bank ahead of American icons such as Boeing Co (BA.N) ($80 billion), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) ($69 billion) and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) ($68.4 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tim McLaughlin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors should remain bullish on stocks even after the recent run to record highs, with the Federal Reserve likely to cut U.S interest rates again, said a fund manager at JPMorgan Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best opportunities lie in Asian stocks, natural resources and technology shares, said London-based Jonathan Lowe, head of a fund of funds team that manages about $8 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowe said an aggressive rate cut by the Fed in September had been a very positive signal and was likely to help steer the U.S. economy away from a possible recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank on September 18 slashed both the benchmark fed funds rate and discount rate by 50 basis points to 4.75 percent and 5.25 percent respectively to help cushion the U.S. economy from a housing slump and financial turbulence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That aggression they demonstrated in cutting rates suggest to us there is still further upside in equity markets," Lowe told the Reuters Wealth Management Summit on Tuesday in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the rate action, global equity markets have rallied to record highs. The MSCI's All-Country World Index jumped more than 10 percent from the August trough to an all-time peak on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowe, who manages the JPMorgan Evergreen Fund, a vehicle which places bets on other JPMorgan equity, fixed-income and alternative investment funds, increased equity exposure to 55 percent from 40 percent immediately after the Fed move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased equity weighting included a Southeast Asian equity fund, a natural resource fund and a U.S. technology fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lowered the cash position to 15 percent from 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've raised our equity positions, we've not cut back as yet. Obviously markets don't go up in a straight line and I have to say I'm nervous about the reaction of some markets like the Asian markets. But I don't think it's over yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Evergreen fund uses tactical asset allocation to try to maximize gains in a rising market and limit the downside in a falling market, while keeping volatility down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund seeks to deliver absolute returns in all market conditions and is not benchmarked to any index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It rose 17 percent in the past 12 months to end-September, compared with a 25 percent rise for global equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lowe noted its 200-day volatility was just 7- percent versus 12.3 percent for global equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US$40 million fund currently holds about 15 funds, with a U.S. dollar bond fund, an Asian equity fund and a market neutral U.S. equity hedge fund among the top three holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund charges a 50 basis point asset allocation fee on top of the fees of the underlying funds. He said this gave it a total expense ratio of about 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowe said he thinks some Asian markets are still likely to outperform and that U.S. stocks look set fare better than their European peers over the next 12 months, with a weak dollar helping boost profits for some firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the U.S. market, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was also worth looking at because "the technology bust has lasted now for seven years and I think that is long enough," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, Lowe said the likelihood that the Fed will cut borrowing costs by another 25 basis points at the next policy-setting meeting later in October is one of the main factors making him bullish on equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From that point of view we want to maintain a fully invested position," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bias is definitely towards equities and within that there is a relative high beta concentration with Asia, Southeast Asia, natural resources and technology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - It would be the biggest drugs deal ever. But could the world's top drugmaker realistically swallow the third largest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) being interested in buying stakes in Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA) from its two major shareholders fuelled another jump of up to 3 percent in the French group's shares on Tuesday, after a 1.8 percent rise on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet many industry analysts are wary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If true, such a move might be a prelude to a full bid for Sanofi, which has a market capitalization of some $120 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanofi has a major presence in vaccines and cancer drugs, both priority areas for Pfizer and there would also be huge scope in a takeover for cost-cutting, something Pfizer has exploited in the past by buying Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a large chunk of Sanofi does seem to be in play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil firm Total SA (TOTF.PA) and cosmetics group L'Oreal (OREP.PA) jointly own some 23 percent and have made clear they do not consider their stakes strategic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But looming over any possible deal is the figure of French president Nicholas Sarkozy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Sarkozy who, as finance minister in 2004, opposed a planned bid by Novartis AG (NOVN.VX) for Franco-German drugs firm Aventis and helped broker its sale to Sanofi-Synthelabo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts do not believe he would smile on a U.S. takeover of the enlarged group three years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions between Sarkozy and Total apparently flared up in August, according to French weekly magazine Challenges, which reported that Sarkozy had asked the oil giant not to sell its Sanofi holding. Total countered that it was a private company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One London-based analyst said he believed Total would have little hesitation in selling its stake of around 13 percent at above 70 euros a share. On Tuesday Sanofi's shares were up 1.8 percent by 9:58 a.m. EDT at 63.3 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLOBAL CHAMPION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might tempt Pfizer, which was rumored to have approached Total about its Sanofi shares four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But barriers to a Pfizer takeover would remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any move would have to get past the French government, which could be difficult given they seem very interested in having a global champion within the industry," Mike Ward, an industry analyst at Nomura Code Securities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can never say never, given that Pfizer is under a lot of pressure at present with patent expiries on a number of products, but they could potentially be stuck in a halfway house, with just a 20-odd percent stake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oddo Securities analysts are also skeptical, given the French government's strategic interest in pharmaceuticals, particularly vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also question whether Sanofi would really fix Pfizer's problems, since the French drugmaker faces similar patent expiry threats after 2012 and the recent rejection by U.S. experts of Sanofi's obesity drug Acomplia has tarnished its image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also greater skepticism today about the value of scale in the pharmaceuticals industry than in the 1990s, which could make biotechnology a more natural hunting ground for Pfizer than "big pharma" rivals, some analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philippe Lanone and colleagues at Natixis share concerns about political difficulties, especially since France still accounts for 29 percent of Sanofi's workforce, despite the company's global reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Lanone sees Sanofi as a plausible target for Pfizer, since its sheer size would dilute the looming patent expiry for cholesterol blockbuster Lipitor in 2011, while synergies could be more than $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at Pfizer, Sanofi, L'Oreal and Total have all declined to comment on what they describe as market speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

He said this gave it a total expense ratio of about 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowe said he thinks some Asian markets are still likely to outperform and that U.S. stocks look set fare better than their European peers over the next 12 months, with a weak dollar helping boost profits for some firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the U.S. market, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was also worth looking at because "the technology bust has lasted now for seven years and I think that is long enough," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, Lowe said the likelihood that the Fed will cut borrowing costs by another 25 basis points at the next policy-setting meeting later in October is one of the main factors making him bullish on equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From that point of view we want to maintain a fully invested position," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bias is definitely towards equities and within that there is a relative high beta concentration with Asia, Southeast Asia, natural resources and technology."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund firm Winton Capital Management said on Monday that a new fund run by Goldman Sachs had bought a 9.99 percent stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stake, which the Goldman fund took at the end of July, is a passive investment and does not give the fund a seat on the board or influence in fund management decisions, Winton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman Sachs, the world's largest securities firm by market capitalization, is investing in Winton through a new, more than $500 million (250 million pound) fund that will purchase stakes in the general partnerships of hedge funds, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's fund is being run by Jonathan Sorrell, son of Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP Group, the second largest advertising company in the world, according to the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Winton spokesman declined to say how much the Goldman fund had paid for its stake and said Winton was not planning to allow the fund to increase its stake further. Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winton's funds include the flagship $4.5 billion Winton Futures fund and the $400 million Evolution fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, British hedge fund firm Brevan Howard Asset Management said that reinsurer Swiss Re had agreed to buy a 15 percent stake in the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

first overseas mutual fund next week to help its clients to
invest in Asia-Pacific stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China International Fund Management Co., the Shanghai-based

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief 
Executive Jamie Dimon has given investors plenty to worry about 
throughout the year, but they have shrugged off his cautionary 
remarks and embraced his couched reassurances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It might be time to reconsider Dimon's cautionary side 
after Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N unveiled a $5.5 billion 
credit implosion last week. Merrill's shocker -- a money-losing 
third quarter -- once again demonstrates how Wall Street firms 
and analysts have woefully underestimated exposure to risky 
subprime mortgages, leveraged loans and collateralized-debt 
obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts expect JPMorgan to take at least a few 
billion dollars in write-downs when it reports third-quarter 
results next week. But those estimates came before Friday's bad 
news from Merrill, once seen by some as the least exposed to 
the vagaries of the fixed-income market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, for example, Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo 
predicted JPMorgan should have about $2 billion in leveraged 
loan write-downs before fees and hedges. JPMorgan, which 
declined to comment for this story, also has exposure to the 
subprime and CDO markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts at CreditSights, an independent fixed-income 
research firm, said most large U.S. banks, when they reported 
second-quarter results in July, also expected a solid second 
half. Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Most expectations for a solid second half have been thrown 
out the window by the mortgage meltdown, which turned into a 
full-blown credit crunch, and possibly the first steps toward 
any economic slowdown or recession," CreditSights analysts said 
last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, Dimon labeled the subprime mortgage lending 
business as "possibly ugly" in his annual letter to 
shareholders. But in the second quarter, it was home-equity 
loans to people with solid credit that hurt the bank's profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan set aside $1.53 billion for loan losses, up from 
$493 million a year earlier. About one-third of the increase 
resulted from higher loss estimates on home-equity loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, JPMorgan's Chase Home Finance originated $3.3 
billion in subprime loans in the second quarter, No. 6 among 
U.S. lenders, and 15 percent more than the year-earlier period, 
according to National Mortgage News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares are down 2 percent this year. But that is 
still better than the 14 percent decline in Citigroup (C.N) 
shares and Merrill's 20 percent drop. The Dow Jones Titans Bank 
Index .DJTBAK is off 1.6 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But JPMorgan may have to set aside more for 
mortgage-related losses as the U.S. housing market continues to 
slump. Mayo said in his September 30 note that he expects 
continued reserve building at the bank, but at a slower pace 
than previous quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During a July conference call, Dimon conceded JPMorgan was 
involved in a couple of hung leveraged buyout deals and exposed 
to leveraged loans without covenants. The credit markets have 
deteriorated even more since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's nothing that's on our balance sheet we're 
particularly concerned about, but if you see this continue you 
will see the street taking on a lot of bridge loans and more 
aggressive pricing of those things," Dimon said on the July 
conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To reassure analysts and investors, Dimon also said that 
JPMorgan underwrites every loan as if it might end up owning 
it. He threw in a bit of caution, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On the loan side ... I am less comfortable because I can't 
predict the outcome of the market," Dimon said in July. "But 
like I said, the way we look at it -- and obviously we don't 
expect to happen -- is if all of it ended up on our balance 
sheet, we'd be OK. We might have to take some markdowns and 
take some reserves, but we already have a lot of loan loss 
reserves."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - A group of infrastructure funds led by JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) agreed to buy UK water company Southern Water from Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) for about 1.3 billion pounds ($2.7 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan -- which beat a rival group led by Goldman Sachs (GS.N), according to sources -- partnered with Australia's Challenger Infrastructure Fund CIF.AX and other funds to buy the company, which provides water to more than 2 million people in southern England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including about 2.8 billion pounds in debt, the deal valued Southern Water at 4.195 billion pounds, the bidders said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water companies and other utilities are attractive to investors such as pension funds because of their stable, secure cash flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sydney-based Challenger was advised by Australia's Macquarie Bank Ltd MBL.AX which last year bought Britain's Thames Water for 8 billion pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Southern Water has significant real per annum growth rate, double the industry average ... and that's what made it so attractive to us," Challenger Chief Executive Steve Bickerton told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are significant operating efficiency gains to be had out of this company," he said, refusing to rule out job cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will pay 360 million pounds for a 32 percent stake in Southern Water and Challenger 300 million pounds for 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other investors are a group of seven Australasian pension funds advised by Access Capital, which will have an 18 percent stake, UBS (UBSN.VX) with 18 percent, Hermes 4 percent and Consensus Business Group 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finance package also includes the potential to syndicate 156 million pounds of equity in the next 12 months, Challenger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland, which bought a controlling stake in Southern Water in 2003, put the firm up for sale earlier this year. RBS is leading a consortium which is currently buying Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS for more than $100 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRONG INTEREST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southern Water provides water and wastewater treatment in southern England counties including Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bickerton said the deal valued Southern Water at 9.2 times current year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources told Reuters last month one of the rival bidders included the infrastructure arm of U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs, as well as Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) investment fund RREEF, Australian infrastructure investor Babcock and Brown Ltd BNB.AX, the U.S.'s GE (GE.N) and British insurer Prudential (PRU.L)'s MG unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utilities are viewed as relatively safe assets in an economic downturn so are more isolated than most from the global credit crunch, initially sparked by concerns over U.S. subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bickerton said the global credit squeeze had not impacted fund-raising for the deal. "At that quality end of the market there is still a huge amount of appetite," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenger said it would fund its investment through a A$494 million ($441.9 million) drawdown against its acquisition debt facility and the issue of 97.9 million pounds in redeemable preference securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenger shares were trading 0.5 percent firmer at A$3.88 at 11:23 p.m. EDT (0326 GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=0.4918 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=1.118 Australian Dollar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/QUITO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) asked an 
Ecuador court on Monday to drop an environmental lawsuit the 
oil giant said had turned into a "judicial farce."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In its petition to an Ecuador Superior Court, Chevron cited 
several examples of interference in the case by the executive 
branch of the government, judicial misconduct and misconduct by 
the plaintiffs lawyers, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also said the court failed to recognize the 
"overwhelming volume" of evidence and legal defenses that would 
exonerate the company, as well as the court's lack of 
jurisdiction, due process and bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We now find ourselves in a situation where the court is 
abandoning any sense that this is going to be conducted under 
the rule of law," Chevron General Counsel Charles James told 
Reuters. "This puts them on notice that any ruling that is 
adduced through this process will have no validity whatsoever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nearly 30,000 residents of the Amazon jungle, including the 
Cofan Indian tribe, accuse Chevron's Texaco subsidiary of 
dumping 18 billion gallons of oil-polluted water from 1972 to 
1992. They are seeking $6 billion in damages from the San 
Ramon, California-based company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steven Donziger, one of the plaintiff's lawyers, classified 
Chevron's request for a dismissal as "a strategy that already 
has been tried and failed in multiple occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are confident that the evidence in the court up to this 
point is overwhelmingly favorable to us," Donziger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs have received the public support of leftist 
Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa, who has said that Chevron 
has done irreversible damage to the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Chevron denies the claims against it and has been 
fighting the litigation. Earlier this year, the company 
threatened to take the case outside of Ecuador to an 
international tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Every instrumentality of the court is under a tremendous 
amount of pressure," said Chevron's James. "With the executive 
branch exhorting everyone in this country to find Texaco 
liable, it's very unclear to us that anyone can withstand that 
pressure and act independently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James said the company would continue to fight the case 
until it is vindicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron asserts it is being persecuted for damage that was 
done by state oil company Petroecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the oil fields in question have been owned and 
operated by Petroecuador for more than 17 years and that the 
Ecuadorean company had not fulfilled its remediation 
obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petroecuador has also operated the fields in a manner that 
has caused numerous environmental problems, including frequent 
spills, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Ecuador ordered foreign oil companies to give 
the state nearly all their extra revenue generated by high oil 
prices. Correa has also said he wants to renegotiate their 
contracts to increase Ecuador's share in oil projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Matt Daily in New York and Ankur

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has
raised the estimated percentage of credit losses on its
mortgage-backed securities portfolio, the U.S. investment bank
disclosed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman's anticipates credit losses of 4.5 percent on $2.92
billion in mortgage-backed securities as of August, the company
said in a quarterly filing with U.S. regulators. Its previous
anticipated credit loss estimate was 3.8 percent on $3.5
billion in mortgage-backed securities as of May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, the value of the New York-based investment
bank's stake in mortgage-backed securities and pools of loans,
or collateralized-debt obligations, has declined 35 percent to
$4.77 billion from $7.3 billion since May. Goldman Sachs and
other Wall Street banks have had to write down the value of
these assets amid a global credit squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs produced stellar profits in the third
quarter, showing a 79 percent gain, while rivals such as Bear
Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N and Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N
stumbled from poor risk management and wrong-way bets on
securities tied to mortgages given to people with weak credit.
Merrill said last week it expects to lose money when it reports
third-quarter results next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As defaults on U.S. mortgages continue to escalate,
pensions, hedge funds and insurance companies are no longer
keen to buy securities backed by homeowner loan payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, for example, packaged and sold, or
securitized, only $23 billion in residential mortgages to
investors during the nine months ended in August. That is down
from $55.20 billion in the year-earlier period, the investment
bank said in its quarterly filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs also said the value of Level 3 assets, whose
worth is largely pegged to management assumptions, stands at
$72 billion, or 7 percent of the investment bank's total
assets. The assets, which include corporate debt and subprime
mortgages, are seen as risky because they trade infrequently,
preventing companies from gathering reliable market prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the second quarter, Goldman Sachs held $54.1 billion in
Level 3 assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tim McLaughlin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co(JPM.N) is creating a distressed debt fund which will be offered to the No. 3 U.S. bank's deep-pocketed clients, the head of its U.S private bank said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's actually in process right now," JP Morgan Private Bank Chief Executive Catherine Keating told the Reuters Wealth Management Summit, declining to provide additional details of the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund is being created as the private bank encourages its clients to lessen their exposure to MA arbitrage funds, which posted big returns amid the takeover boom of recent years, and consider various forms of investing in credit, Keating said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're talking about corporate bonds, mezzanine investing, distressed investing, either outright or most likely through funds that do that," she said. "Our clients will have a variety of things to choose from, some managed by JPMorgan and some managed by other managers on the street."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Keating acknowledged that caution was the watchword with regard to such funds, after the recent subprime meltdown caused steep declines in the prices of collateralized debt obligations and leveraged loans in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all about being careful about the sectors you invest in," she said. "It comes down to securities selection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan already has a fund called the Special Situations Investing fund, which trades distressed bank and high-yield debt.

&lt;p&gt;   (recasts throughout with new material, sources)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tom Bergin and Jonathan Cable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 10 (Reuters) - Britain's BP (BP.L) will on
Thursday announce cuts to management layers and standardisation
of procedures to address poor performance, but no cost savings
targets will be set, sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It will be more of the Exxon model," one source said,
referring to the world's largest non-government controlled oil
company by market value, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N). BP ranks
number three by this measure, behind Royal Dutch Shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon employees report along functional lines and the
company insists on standardised safety and operating procedures
across the organisation, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under former CEO John Browne, BP gave greater independence
to operational units. Browne felt this encouraged and helped
managers of large fields or units to maximise profits and cut
costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current CEO Tony Hayward feels this model has led to
duplication of efforts, with people doing things in different
ways in different units, raising costs and not allowing the firm
to refine procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayward also feels this has led to excessive layers of
management, which he plans reduce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The changes should lead to cost savings, but no targets will
be set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It will be an outcome, not a diktat," the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Browne was criticised for setting ambitious cost reduction
targets without consulting junior staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the past two years, BP has gone from being one of the
most admired companies in the world to one of the most
criticised, after a fatal refinery explosion that killed 15
workers, oil spills in Alaska, big delays on key projects and
probes into oil market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the CEO told staff in Texas that the company's
current performance was "terrible".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The overhaul of BP's organisation will not be achieved
within a set time scale and will involve asking BP staff lower
down the management chain how things can be improved, the
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Tony is a very different man .. he's going to be much more

re-allocation of personnel from financial roles to operational
posts, but that there will be no wide-reaching cost saving
programme based on the restructuring," analysts at Citigroup
said in a research note, citing BP's investor relations
department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;MONTERREY, Mexico Oct 10 (Reuters) - A new company formed
by Coca-Cola Co and Mexican bottler Coca-Cola Femsa (KOF)
launched a $370 million tender offer for juice maker Jugos del
Valle on Wednesday, KOF said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KOF (KOFL.MX) (KOF.N), the world's second-largest Coke

in Mexico and Brazil to join the business once the new company,

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Fayen Wong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY Oct 10 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's (CVX.N)
$10-billion-plus Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project
cleared its final regulatory hurdle on Wednesday with an
environmental green light from the Australian government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The national government's approval after four years of
stringent scrutiny and consultations will shift the focus to
Chevron and its partners Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch
Shell (RDSa.L), who will grapple with the expected doubling in
costs for tapping the country's biggest gas field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three years ago Chevron said Gorgon would cost about A$11
billion ($9.9 billion) to develop, but analysts say soaring
labour and equipment costs may double that number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a very expensive project and the returns could be
too low for it to be viable," said Deutsche Bank's John Hirjee.
"Strategy-wise, it is in their interest to go ahead and
monetise the resources but investment-wise, that might not work
out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has yet to announce a final decision to proceed
with the project, one of the company's top five globally, a
move that analysts expect to happen in the next one to two
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The partners have already agreed to sell Gorgon's 10
million tonnes per year LNG output to customers in Japan, China
and India, with half of those deals agreed last month in a move
that appeared likely to ensure the project's progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long-term contract prices for LNG -- natural gas frozen to
a liquid state for tanker transport -- have trebled in the last
five years to around $10 per million British thermal units
(mmBtu) as consumers seek cleaner fuel to power their
economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Company spokesman Scott Walker said optimisation studies
would take several more months to complete, and declined to
give a timeframe for a final investment decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron were forced to scrap a 2006 approval deadline after
environmental groups protested against plans for an LNG plant
to handle the project's gas on Barrow Island, a nature reserve
off Western Australia which is home to a rare species of
turtle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project was first expected to deliver gas in 2010, but
analysts now say a 2015-2016 timeframe was more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said in a statement on Wednesday it would
incorporate the environmental conditions tied to the approval
into its plans for the Gorgon project, located off Australia's
west coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are doing as much work as possible to ensure
Australia's largest known gas resource is developed in an
effective, efficient, responsible and internationally
competitive manner," Colin Beckett, Chevron Australia General
Manager for the Gorgon project, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Chief Executive David O'Reilly said last month that
could eventually double in capacity to about 20 mtpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Gorgon gas fields, first discovered in 1981, have
certified gas reserves of over 40 trillion cubic feet -- enough
to power a city of one million people for 800 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is the operator of the project and holds a 50
percent stake. Exxon Mobil and Shell each have 25 percent.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) shares
surged 5.4 percent on Tuesday to an all-time high as the U.S.
investment bank's recent third-quarter performance looks even
better amid credit implosions at rival banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs shares closed up $12.24 at $239.20 on the New
York Stock Exchange, eclipsing their previous record of $233.97
set on May 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Goldman, the largest securities firm in the
world by market capitalization, reported a 79 percent rise in
third-quarter profit. Since then, some of its rivals, including
Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N, have stumbled badly. Merrill
last week shocked investors when it said it would take $5.5

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on Tuesday 
it expects its third-quarter net income to be significantly 
below the $5.4 billion it earned in the second quarter due to a 
sharp drop in its refining margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The second largest U.S. oil and gas company said in an 
interim report that one-time items also should hurt 
third-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Refining margins are expected to be a drag on third-quarter 
earnings for integrated oil and gas producers as well as 
independent refiners as refining margins dropped by more than 
half from second quarter levels in some U.S. regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said international benchmark margins also were 
considerably lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, the amount of oil Chevron processed at its U.S. 
refineries fell about 8 percent to 812,000 barrels per day, 
mostly due to planned and unplanned shutdowns at its El Segundo 
Calif., and Pascagoula, Miss., refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A crude unit at the Pascagoula refinery has been out since 
an August 16 fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company processed 1.04 million barrels of oil per day 
at its international refineries, up from 942,000 barrels in the 
second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's worldwide production for the first two months of 
the quarter fell about 1 percent from the second quarter to 2.6 
million barrels of oil equivalent per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's crude oil prices during the period rose 
nearly 15 percent to $67.44 a barrel from second-quarter 
levels. Its international liquids prices rose over 9 percent to 
$65.26 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the company said it expects earnings at its 
exploration and production unit would be lower than the second 
quarter, as higher oil prices would be more than offset by 
lower U.S. natural gas prices, declining production and 
one-time charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. natural gas prices fell 12 percent to $5.75 per 
thousand cubic feet (mcf) during July and August. International 
gas prices rose to $3.75 per mcf from $3.64 per mcf in the 
second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron expects to post $700 million in charges during the 
quarter, offset slightly by a $260 million gain from the sale 
of marketing assets in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts were expecting the company to post third-quarter 
earnings of around $2.17 a share, according to Reuters 
Estimates. It had posted second-quarter earnings, excluding 
one-time items, of $2.37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's $5.4 billion second-quarter result included a 
$680 million one-time gain as well as losses of $160 million 
from debt reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Chevron fell 2.9 percent to $90.12 in 
after-the-bell trading on Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the third largest U.S. oil company, 
said last week that profit from its refineries would be 
significantly lower, but gains from asset sales would bolster 
its profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) -- a smaller competitor -- also 
issued an interim report on Tuesday. It said it expected its 
production to rise nearly 10 percent in the quarter, but also 
sees its refining and wholesale margins to be about half last 
year's level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Michael Erman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said on Thursday it was cutting an unspecified number of jobs across its fixed-income division as investors brace for a multibillion-dollar write-down next week on the bank's leveraged loans and other assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The No. 3 U.S. bank said the job cuts include structured credit and leveraged finance positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are making modest staff reductions in areas where we expect lower volumes going forward, including leveraged finance and structured credit," JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts are expected to be less than 10 percent in the affected areas, according to people familiar with the situation. And no senior executives are expected to lose their jobs, unlike what has happened at rival banks such as Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N and Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job losses in the leveraged finance group, among the first announced on Wall Street, indicate casualties from the credit crunch and the pullback in private equity deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leveraged finance groups arrange the debt packages attached to private equity deals. Frothy debt markets and low interest rates fed a two-year private equity deal boom, where buyout firms took part in more than $1 trillion worth of deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buyout boom kept leveraged finance desks busy. But the credit crunch that hit this summer spooked debt investors and left banks with more than $350 billion in loans stuck on their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sparked a severe slowdown in private equity dealmaking, leaving leveraged finance desks with few deals to arrange or syndicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo predicted JPMorgan should have about $2 billion in leveraged loan write-downs before fees and hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is expected to post lower profit when it releases third-quarter results October 17 as the global credit squeeze disrupts fixed-income trading. This summer, two hedge funds run by Bear Stearns collapsed, tarnishing the investment bank's image while leading to the ouster of co-president Warren Spector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N shocked investors last week when it said it would write-down $5.5 billion in assets in the third quarter and report a loss. Merrill also ousted Osman Semerci, global head of fixed income, currencies and commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reported having 179,664 total employees in July. About 25,400 jobs are in the investment banking division, which includes fixed-income operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares are down 3 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michael Flaherty in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)

 Oct 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs started coverage of the
railroad and the trucking sectors with a "neutral" rating,
saying freight demand has been falling for more than a year for
truckers and nine months for railroads and the demand will
continue to be sluggish in a fragile US economy.

 The brokerage also started Canada's No. 2 railway Canadian
Pacific Railway (CP.TO) (CP.N) with a "sell" rating.

 Goldman said in a research note that railroads should
continue to benefit from improved efficiency, freight share
gains from truckers, and strong pricing.

 But valuation is not over-compelling currently and the
stocks are are likely to trade sideways as earnings growth
moderates amid weak demand.

 Truck freight demand does not appear to have picked up
ahead of the coming holiday season and current overcapacity
should further pressure pricing, it added.

six-month price target on some transportation stocks:

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has
raised the estimated percentage of credit losses on its
mortgage-backed securities portfolio, the U.S. investment bank
disclosed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman's anticipates credit losses of 4.5 percent on $2.92
billion in mortgage-backed securities as of August, the company
said in a quarterly filing with U.S. regulators. Its previous
anticipated credit loss estimate was 3.8 percent on $3.5
billion in mortgage-backed securities as of May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, the value of the New York-based investment
bank's stake in mortgage-backed securities and pools of loans,
or collateralized-debt obligations, has declined 35 percent to
$4.77 billion from $7.3 billion since May. Goldman Sachs and
other Wall Street banks have had to write down the value of
these assets amid a global credit squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs produced stellar profits in the third
quarter, showing a 79 percent gain, while rivals such as Bear
Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N and Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N
stumbled from poor risk management and wrong-way bets on
securities tied to mortgages given to people with weak credit.
Merrill said last week it expects to lose money when it reports
third-quarter results next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As defaults on U.S. mortgages continue to escalate,
pensions, hedge funds and insurance companies are no longer
keen to buy securities backed by homeowner loan payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, for example, packaged and sold, or
securitized, only $23 billion in residential mortgages to
investors during the nine months ended in August. That is down
from $55.20 billion in the year-earlier period, the investment
bank said in its quarterly filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs also said the value of Level 3 assets, whose
worth is largely pegged to management assumptions, stands at
$72 billion, or 7 percent of the investment bank's total
assets. The assets, which include corporate debt and subprime
mortgages, are seen as risky because they trade infrequently,
preventing companies from gathering reliable market prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the second quarter, Goldman Sachs held $54.1 billion in
Level 3 assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tim McLaughlin)&lt;/p&gt;

credit markets may be the calm that precedes the storm as the

&lt;p&gt; "Even though we think that the downturn is still not
imminent, we may be one step closer," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companies will struggle as they "may well be further down
the road of distress when the trigger occurs," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bankers, analysts and credit specialists forecast an
increase in credit defaults as ailing companies find it more
difficult to access capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Default rates remain at historic lows this year as an
abundance of credit had helped them refinance, avoiding
insolvency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Bankruptcies are intrinsically linked to the availability
of credit, and turbulence in the financial markets will
ultimately impact credit quality," JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With a large supply of leveraged loans still to be placed,
marginal credits are finding it more difficult to raise funds."

confirmed on Friday its 150,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los
Angeles-area refinery in Torrance, California, is planning to
restart next week a crude distillation unit and a coking unit

Oct. 16 and Oct. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A refinery spokeswoman said the filing was related to the
planned restart of the units at the end of the overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spokeswoman Carolin Keith said the filing reported to the
South Coast Air Quality Management District the possiblity the
refinery will have to use the safety flare system between Oct.
16 and 20 as it finishes the overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon began the overhaul on Aug. 16. The Torrance refinery
is one of four refineries in the Los Angeles area with units
shut for planned maintenance overhauls or unplanned repairs.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 12 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities raised its price
target on Altria Group Inc (MO.N), the parent of Philip Morris
USA and Philip Morris International, saying Altria's two units
could buy back $30 billion worth of shares after the
international tobacco company's planned spin-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In late August Altria said it plans to spin off the Philip
Morris International tobacco unit but that it would not give
details on the timing of the spin-off until January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Erik Bloomquist said Altria's current share price
was undervalued, and did not factor in the benefit of the $30
billion cumulative buyback and the value of the company's stake
in SABMiller (SAB.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bloomquist, who has an "overweight" rating on the stock,
raised his price target to $90 from $83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that an announcement on the timing of the spin-off
in January and the actual date of the completion, likely March
28, would serve as catalysts for the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bloomquist expects Philip Morris International to buy back
$21 billion worth of shares and Altria/Philip Morris USA $9
billion, over the first four years.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has joined the ranks of advisers helping Hungarian energy company MOL MOLB.BU to fight off the attentions of Austrian suitor OMV (OMVV.VI), said people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-based investment bank, known for it bid defense work, was hired partly because of its understanding of Brussels as the situation heads towards a possible showdown between Hungary and the EU, said the people on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former EU commissioners Mario Monti and Karel van Miert both work as international advisers for the investment bank, which is joining UBS and Morgan Stanley in the MOL camp in providing strategic advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, European Union Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy wrote to the Hungarian government threatening to extend action against the country if a new law prevented companies from other EU states buying into MOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Hungary's parliament approved the law, which many investors say is designed to protect MOL from being taken over by OMV and which has been criticized by the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOL and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OMV plans to offer 32,000 forints ($181) per MOL share if MOL removes a 10 percent voting right cap and if the 40 percent stake in MOL that its board and friendly institutions control is cancelled or neutralized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOL and the Hungarian government have resisted the offer and MOL's shares were trading at 27,800 forints -- substantially below the potential bid price -- at 1034 GMT on Friday, showing the market believes there is a strong chance OMV will fail in its attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Austrian company may call an extraordinary meeting of MOL shareholders to try to repeal MOL management's ability to use 40 percent of MOL shares to block any bid, a person familiar with the matter said earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vienna-based company or other MOL investors could call such a meeting as early as next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOL is allowed to own 10 percent of its own stock directly, but analysts estimate that over 40 percent of the stock is held directly and indirectly by MOL and allied institutions via a variety of stock lending schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds figures on job cuts) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Tim McLaughlin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N)  said on Thursday it was cutting jobs across its fixed-income business as investors brace for a multibillion-dollar write-down next week on the bank's leveraged loans and other assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The No. 3 U.S. bank said the job cuts include structured credit and leveraged finance positions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are making modest staff reductions in areas where we expect lower volumes going forward, including leveraged finance and structured credit," JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    People familiar with the situation said 100 jobs were being cut across the bank's global credit markets, or about 10 percent of that group's head count. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    And no senior executives are expected to lose their jobs, unlike what has happened at rival banks such as Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co Inc MER.N.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Job losses in the leveraged finance group, among the first announced on Wall Street, indicate casualties from the credit crunch and the pullback in private equity deals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Leveraged finance groups arrange the debt packages attached to private equity deals. Frothy debt markets and low interest rates fed a two-year private equity deal boom, where buyout firms took part in more than $1 trillion worth of deals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The buyout boom kept leveraged finance desks busy. But the credit crunch that hit this summer spooked debt investors and left banks with more than $350 billion in loans stuck on their balance sheets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    That sparked a severe slowdown in private equity dealmaking, leaving leveraged finance desks with few deals to arrange or syndicate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo predicted JPMorgan should have about $2 billion in leveraged loan write-downs before fees and hedges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan is expected to post lower profit when it releases third-quarter results Oct. 17 as the global credit squeeze disrupts fixed-income trading. This summer, two hedge funds run by Bear Stearns collapsed, tarnishing the investment bank's image while leading to the ouster of co-president Warren Spector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Merrill Lynch &amp; Co Inc MER.N  shocked investors last week when it said it would write-down $5.5 billion in assets in the third quarter and report a loss. Merrill also ousted Osman Semerci, global head of fixed income, currencies and commodities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan reported having 179,664 total employees in July. About 25,400 jobs are in the investment banking division, which includes fixed-income operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan shares are down 3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Michael Flaherty and Faris Khan in New York) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Tim McLaughlin, editing by Leslie Gevirtz/Deborah Cohen;  Reuters messaging: tim.mclaughlin.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6033)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: JPMORGAN LAYOFFS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

and Elan have the right to buy Biogen's rights to those drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe Genentech has both the motivation and the
resources to gain full control over Rituxan," said Bret Holley,
an analyst at CIBC World Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given that we expect Rituxan to continue to be a major
revenue driver for Biogen, we believe the loss of rights to
this product would significantly diminish Biogen's value to a
potential acquirer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Biogen's announcement late on Friday comes four years after
it was acquired by Idec Pharmaceutical for $6.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it hired Goldman Sachs  Co and Merrill
Lynch  Co to help find a buyer and that it has already
received "expressions of interest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One interested party is billionaire investor Carl Icahn,
who recently took control of ImClone Systems Inc IMCL.O and
has increased his stake in Biogen to about 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Jeffrey Goldfarb in Vienna and

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS Oct 15 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said
operations were as planned on Monday at its 260,000 barrel per
day (bpd) Los Angeles market refinery in El Segundo,
California, after a brief power outage on a unit Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Spokeswoman Lily Craig said she didn't have the name of the
unit immediately available, but said the electrical power loss
did not affect refinery production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Everything's running fine," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery is carrying a planned two-month overhaul on a

&lt;p&gt;RIGA Oct 15 (Reuters) - The EU has no need to act against
Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom (GAZP.MM) as the company
does not have the same dominance as the bloc's antitrust target
Microsoft (MSFT.O), Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Gazprom's growing influence on the market has aroused
concerns as it supplies one quarter of the European Union's gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Piebalgs said on Monday that its market share was
relatively small compared with that of software maker Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Do we treat Gazprom as we treat Microsoft? Yes we do. The
difference is that Microsoft has 100 percent of the market,"
Piebalgs told a conference in the Latvian capital Riga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That is why we do not take measures against Gazprom, there
is no need. They do not play a big enough role in the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Commission this year won a decisive court
battle against Microsoft for abusing a dominant market position
to crush rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other speakers at the conference expressed fears of Russia's
increased use of its energy resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One worry has been the building of a pipeline under the
Baltic Sea by a Gazprom-led consortium, which includes Germany
BASF BASF.DE and E.ON EONG.DE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This has worried Poland in particular, which fears the
pipeline currently carrying Russian gas to the West will be
bypassed. Piebalgs had no such reservations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I have no difficulties with this project as it stands," he
said, adding that he regretted the political difficulties
surrounding it. "We should look at it on its own merits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Piebalgs said the answer to worries about suppliers like
Gazprom was the power of the European Union as a consumer with
500 million inhabitants, the rules of the internal market and
further diversification of energy sources.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 15 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the
second-largest U.S. oil and gas company, said on Monday it plans
to build a major processing unit at its refinery in Pascagoula,
Mississippi, that will boost the plant's gasoline output by 10
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The construction of the continuous catalyst regeneration
unit, estimated to cost around $500 million, is due to begin in
early 2008 with completion anticipated by mid-2010, the company
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gasoline production at the plant will increase by about 10
percent, or about 14,285 barrels per day, when the project is
completed, Chevron said. The project will replace two older
reformer units at the 320,000 barrel-per-day refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is also considering building a new crude
processing unit at the Pascagoula plant that would increase its
overall capacity by some 200,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are still reviewing options to increase the scope and
scale of the refinery," said Chevron spokeswoman Stephanie
Price. She said Chevron was expecting to make an investment
decision on the crude unit in the first half of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bet on the refining sector comes as other oil companies
have slashed some 500,000 barrels per day of planned refinery
capacity expansion in the United States since mid-2006 amid
rising costs and doubts over future fuel demand, according to
the U.S. Energy Information Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Saudi Arabia's state oil
company announced Sept. 21 they would go ahead with a $7 billion
expansion of a jointly owned refinery in Port Arthur, Texas,
that will add 325,000 barrels per day of capacity.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on financial services, CFO comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Philipp Gollner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Oct 16 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) posted a 6
percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday on strength in its
services businesses, but profit margins narrowed and hardware
sales fell on weaker demand from U.S. financial services
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in the world's largest technology services company
slipped about 1 percent as the report, in line with Wall Street
targets, also showed IBM's revenue gain was largely due to a
weaker dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge told analysts on a
conference call that Wall Street's fourth-quarter target of 15
percent earnings-per-share growth was "reasonable" and that the
U.S. financial services issue did not suggest broader spending
decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I do think we had a financial-services slowdown," he said.
"I would not look at this and say this is a general economic
decline," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Third-quarter net income rose to $2.36 billion, or $1.68
per share, from $2.22 billion, or $1.45 per share, a year
earlier. Revenue increased 6.6 percent to $24.1 billion from
$22.6 billion, but rose 3 percent excluding currency-related
gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The per-share profit and revenue results matched analysts'
average expectations, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gross profit margin in the third quarter narrowed to
41.3 percent from 42.0 percent a year earlier, due mainly to
slips in software and global financing division margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The services business "is certainly going to be the
highlight of the quarter as an upside surprise," said Bob
Djurdjevic, president of industry researcher Annex Research
Inc. "The downside surprise was a sharp drop in the mainframe
revenues and shipments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares fell to $118.21 in extended trading
following the earnings report after closing up 1.3 percent at
$119.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp has improved
year-over-year profitability over the last 12 consecutive
quarters, as it spent more than $5 billion in 2006 on
acquisitions, mainly software companies, to expand its most
profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has been selling more software in its services segment,
which accounts for more than one-half of revenue, as well as
cutting jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue in IBM's global services division rose 14 percent
and the company signed services contracts totaling $11.8
billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue from the software business rose 7 percent to $4.7
billion. The systems and technology business, which includes
server computers, data storage gear and microchips, had revenue
of $4.9 billion, down 10 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of mainframe computers, refrigerator-sized machines
used by banks and insurers for heavy-duty computing, slumped 31
percent from a year earlier, when they rose 25 percent.
Loughridge attributed the decline partly to a number of large
deals that did not close before the quarter's end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A slowdown in spending by U.S. financial services clients,
among the biggest buyers of mainframe computers, cost IBM a
percentage point of revenue growth in the third quarter,
Loughridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Third-quarter earnings per share "were not outstanding,"
American Technology Research analyst Shaw Wu said. "Some people
were expecting better, including us at $1.70, but results were
still in line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect earnings before certain items to rise to
$2.61 per share from $2.26 in the fourth quarter, according to
Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares, up 21 percent so far this year, trade at 16.9
times expected 2007 earnings per share, compared with a
multiple of 17.9 for Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and 20.6 for
Dell Inc DELL.O.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) posted a 6 percent 
rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday on strength in its services 
and software businesses, but profit margins narrowed and 
hardware sales fell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Its shares dropped about 1 percent as the report, in line 
with Wall Street targets, also showed IBM's revenue gain 
largely due to a weak dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge told analysts the 
company experienced a slowdown with financial services 
customers in September, but that analysts' fourth-quarter 
target of 15 percent earnings per share growth was 
'reasonable.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Third-quarter net income rose to $2.36 billion, or $1.68 
per share, from $2.22 billion, or $1.45 per share, a year 
earlier. Revenue increased 7 percent, to $24.1 billion from 
$22.6 billion, but rose 3 percent excluding currency-related 
gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The per-share profit and revenue results matched analysts' 
average expectations, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gross profit margin in the third quarter narrowed to 
41.3 percent from 42.0 percent a year earlier, due primarily to 
slips in software and global financing division margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think that overall (services) is certainly going to be 
the highlight of the quarter as an upside surprise," said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research. "The downside 
surprise was a sharp drop in the mainframe revenues and 
shipments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares fell to $118.21 in extended trading 
following the earnings report after closing up 1.3 percent at 
$119.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp has improved 
year-over-year profitability over the last 12 consecutive 
quarters, as it spent more than $5 billion in 2006 on 
acquisitions, mainly for software companies, to expand its most 
profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has been selling more software in its services segment, 
which accounts for more than one-half of revenue, as well as 
cutting jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue in IBM's global services division rose 14 percent 
and the company signed services contracts totaling $11.8 
billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue from the software business rose 7 percent to $4.7 
billion. The systems and technology business, which includes 
server computers, data storage gear and microchips, had revenue 
of $4.9 billion, down 10 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Technology Research analyst Shaw Wu said the 
earnings per share "were not outstanding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some people were expecting better, including us at $1.70, 
but results were still in line," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect adjusted earnings to rise to $2.61 per 
share from $2.26 in the fourth quarter, according to Reuters 
Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares, up 21 percent so far this year, trade at 16.9 
times expected 2007 earnings per share, compared with a 
multiple of 17.9 for Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and 20.6 for 
Dell Inc DELL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston; editing by

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's antitrust regulator said on Wednesday it has agreed to allow Microsoft (MSFT.O) to drop its appeal against the agency's landmark ruling, ending a two-year dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) ruled in 2005 that Microsoft had abused its dominant market position, fining it 32.5 billion won ($35.43 million) and ordering it to separate its instant messaging program from the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission rejected Microsoft's appeal in May 2006, and then the company took the case to the Seoul High Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the court rejected a stay, Microsoft said last year it had made changes to its Windows Vista operating system to meet all of the commission's demands, and last week it told the court it wants to abandon the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have decided to agree to Microsoft's request to drop the appeal, given that the company has acted on our request (to separate the instant messaging program)," the regulator said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also suffered a decisive antitrust defeat in September when a European Union court upheld a landmark ruling that the world's largest software maker had abused its dominant market position to crush rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-highest EU court dismissed the company's appeal on all key points against the 2004 European Commission ruling and upheld a record 497 million euro ($704.3 million) fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it has not decided whether to appeal the EU case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co is planning to spend $1.1 billion over five years to overhaul its California Adventure theme park, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Journal, which cited people familiar with Disney's plan, the company's board has recently approved the investment in the California-themed park located near the famed Disneyland park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is hoping to boost attendance at California Adventure by making it more like Disneyland, with more references to company founder Walt Disney, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new-look park will also be expanded by about 12 acres and will include attractions associated with animated Pixar movies such as "Cars" and "Toy Story," the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney official was not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Martinne Geller)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Oct 16 (Reuters) - International Business Machines
Corp (IBM.N) said on Tuesday that weaker sales to U.S. financial
services customers cost it a percentage point of growth in the
third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Financial services, mainly banks and insurers, typically
account for 7 percent to 8 percent of IBM's total revenue and
contributed to a sharp decline in computer hardware sales in the
third period, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total revenue at IBM rose 6.6 percent to $24.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sector accounted for about 1 point of growth in the first
half of 2006, and held back growth by about the same proportion in
the third quarter, Loughridge told analysts on a conference call
after IBM reported third-quarter earnings on Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Litton CEO comment. previous NEW YORK)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone and Al Yoon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BOSTON Oct 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) has emerged as the final bidder for Litton Loan
Servicing LP, the subprime mortgage servicing unit of
Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization LLC, and a deal
could close in 60 days, people familiar with the situation said
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, the world's largest investment bank by
market value, has been in talks with C-BASS, a subprime
mortgage investment venture jointly owned by MGIC Investment
Corp (MTG.N) and Radian Group Inc (RDN.N), for about a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Negotiations surrounding the complex transaction could
still break down. Obstacles to reaching the finish line include
getting approval from C-BASS creditors and ultimately from
every state mortgage regulator where Houston-based Litton does
business, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litton, which serviced $6.58 billion of loans at the end of
June, is expected to fetch $400 million to $500 million in a
sale, one person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and C-BASS declined to comment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said
last month that the recent turmoil had created opportunities to
buy mortgage assets. Previously Goldman Sachs had shied away
from mortgage accusations. Viniar also predicted the beaten
down U.S. mortgage market "was closer to a bottom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MGIC in September terminated a merger agreement with
Radian, citing weakening conditions in mortgage markets. At the
time, the companies said they were still pursuing a previously
announced sale of C-BASS, though the venture had plunged in
value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expenses at Litton have risen 32 percent year-over-year,
said its chief executive, Larry Litton Jr, who was part of a
credit crisis discussion at the Mortgage Bankers Association's
annual conference in Boston on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet servicing businesses remain in demand because they are
less vulnerable to swings in credit cycles and tend to produce
steadier results. Litton sends out bills, collects payments and
handles escrow accounts for home borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Servicing companies also can be a counter-cyclical
business. The 12th-largest U.S. subprime servicer also
negotiates changes to mortgages, helping struggling borrowers
pay their debts, and handling foreclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) Saxon Mortgage Services on Tuesday
acquired the mortgage servicing rights and advances of NovaStar

Capital Management bought the servicing business of bankrupt
New Century Financial Corp NEWCQ.PK for $184 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman bought residential servicer Avelo Mortgage, and in
February acquired South Carolina lender Senderra Funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C-BASS, which buys subprime mortgages and repackages them

C-BASS stakes worth $1 billion in June, probably had no value.

Revenues were a bit better and I think the upside is sales in the service area continue to grow. I think that's key."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did see the stock immediately sold down a point or so. I think it takes a little time to sort out IBM's earnings."&lt;/p&gt;

1552 ET 16Oct2007-Option players take the defensive in Yahoo-analysts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) reports quarterly earnings after the bell and a look at
the afternoon option action shows traders positioning defensively against
another earnings downside surprise, said Interactive Brokers Group equity
option analyst Rebecca Engmann Darst. Late in the session, puts outpaced calls
by a factor of 1.3, she said. It also appears traders are closing out positions
in the Oct and Nov $30 calls that may have been opened when Yahoo was the
subject of spinoff scuttle a week or so ago. "Elsewhere, we were intrigued by
selling in the April $25 puts (early in the session) on a volume more than four
times the existing open interest and with a 10 percent gain in premiums," she
said. "The position may be a wager that Yahoo will have its act together by Q1
2008."

1544 ET 16Oct2007-GS analysts suggest remain long with low-cost SPX hedges
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 With more than 30 percent of the market cap of the SP 500 index SPX
reporting earnings over the next week, a team of Goldman Sachs strategists
suggest staying long with low-cost hedges to capture potential volatility if
earnings season disappoints. "Equity markets are near highs despite potential
risks ahead," they said in a report on Monday. Investors cannot afford to be on
the sidelines or to pay out large hedge premiums. They highlight two potential
low-cost ways to either hedge SPX exposure through year-end or position for a
short term increase in macro volatility through earnings. One is the SP 500
Dec-07 100/95 percent of spot put spreads to take advantage of the elevated
skew. Another way is the SP 500 Dec-07 at the money puts with a knockout down
10 percent for investors who think the worst is behind them.

 John Praveen, chief investmment strategist at Prudential International
Investment Advisers, upgraded U.S. equities to a "modest" portfolio overweight
on expected strong returns after the Fed's 50 bps rate cut seemed to have eased
credit and recession jitters. He cites in a research report that stocks earned
solid gains in the 3, 6 and 12 months after a Fed rate cut in 12 of the 14 rate
cut cycles since 1974. At the same time, he recommended trimming overweight in
U.K. stocks.

1430 ET 16OCT2007-Players bet on earnings-related volatility play in Intel
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hotly anticipated after-the-bell earnings from chipmaker Intel Corp
(INTC.O) has more than 191,000 option contracts in play in afternoon trade,
according to Track Data. With Intel shares up 4 cents to $25.79, volume
distribution shows about 1.7 calls moving for every put, said Rebecca Engmann
Darst, equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers Group. Heaviest volume has
been seen on either side of the at-the-money Oct $25 line as traders look to
capture up- or-down moves post-earnings report in the waning days of the
October contract. She noted traders also sold Oct $27.50 calls and bought the
same strikes in the November contract before October options expire on Friday.
A move past $27.50 would imply a return to December 2005 price levels for Intel
stock, Darst said.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Option bears were out in force in PNC Financial ServicesGroup Inc. (PNC.N),
one day after Citigroup (C.N), the largest U.S. bank, reported a 57 percent

results on Oct. 18, dipped 2.4 percent to $66.80 in afternoon trade. The put
activity is lighting up, said Pete Najarian, co-founder of optionmonster.com.
Particularly notable are the Oct $65 puts as investors are either protecting
long stock positions or anticipating a negative event. "The aggressive nature
of the buying combined with the short-term time frame of these PNC Oct $65 puts
smells like another disappointment may be in the works from the financial
community," he said. Earlier, the Oct $65 put buyers paid up to 45 cents for
nearly 6,000 lots.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds byline, quotes from Bill Gates, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Oct 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
said on Tuesday it expects its unified communications product
-- the company's effort to link e-mail, instant messaging and

which had revenue growth of 13 percent in fiscal 2007, Jeff
Raikes, president of the business division said in an interview
without offering specific figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates joined Raikes at an event to
introduce its Office Communications Server 2007, which allows
users to e-mail, instant message, video conference or make
Web-based phone calls from within the company's Office
applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The multibillion dollar transition of office phone systems
to Internet protocol networks has the world's largest software
maker headed for a showdown with network equipment leader Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft sees software at the center of that transition,
while Cisco wants to cash in on years of experience making
telecommunications equipment such as switches and routers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Customers don't care about the fact that you are changing

Communicator software application that runs with it also will
transform communications and the industry at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is just like the computer industry was before the
personal computer came along," said Gates, referring to how PCs
dramatically changed a computer market dominated by large
mainframe manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gates said the telecommunications industry was becoming
more specialized much in the same way the computer industry had
divided into companies focused on different types of parts and
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Microsoft co-founder said personal computers and mobile
phones have taken huge technological strides in recent years,
but that office telephones have not kept pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said its offering is less expensive than those of
rivals because it adds to and uses functions in existing
products such as Exchange e-mail server and its Active
Directory service used by IT administrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked how a possible slowdown in technology spending
could affect demand for the new unified communications
products, Raikes said he expects a slowdown not to have any
effect because the product can save companies money in travel
and phone implementation costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raikes, who said Microsoft's business division is doing
well, declined to comment on the overall outlook for technology
spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft rose 30 cents to $30.34 in late

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - Investment bank JP Morgan reexamined
long-standing market speculation that French banks BNP Paribas
(BNPP.PA) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) could merge, saying
now might be a good time for such a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "With earnings potentially at risk in European banking over
the next two-three years, we think now is a good time for
shareholders to consider a merger-of-equals between Societe
Generale and BNP Paribas to create a European banking
powerhouse," JP Morgan said in a research note published on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors have often speculated that France's two biggest
listed banks might one day merge, ever since SocGen escaped a
takeover bid by BNP Paribas in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, both banks have constantly rejected the merger
talk. BNP Paribas Chief Executive Baudouin Prot has repeatedly
said this year that he is not considering any deal with SocGen
as the execution risk would be too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In June, SocGen reiterated it was under no pressure to do a
"transformational" deal, amid speculation linking it to BNP and
to Italy's UniCredit (CRDI.MI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts have said the French government might be
against a BNP/SocGen merger due to the risk of job cuts, but JP
Morgan disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe an in-market transaction would have the support
of the government, creating a national champion with a market
capitalization of $181 billion at current levels, which would
make it the 5th largest bank globally, generating over 15.6
billion euros of estimated net profits by 2010," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BNP Paribas shares were down 1.1 percent at 77.62 euros in
mid-morning trade, giving France's biggest listed bank a stock
market capitalization of around 70 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SocGen shares were down 1.5 percent at 118.24 euros, giving
it a stock market value of around 55 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on partners; updates share activity) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Ben Hirschler and Toni Clarke &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LONDON/BOSTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O), which has put itself up for sale, may get bids of around $25-30 billion from several of the world's top drugmakers keen to expand in the hot area of biotech medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) could all use the U.S. company to gain scale in protein and antibody drug manufacturing, sales and research, bankers and industry analysts said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX), however, may be less interested &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- despite its collaboration with Biogen on cancer drug -- despite its collaboration with Biogen on cancer drug MabThera/Rituxan -- since it already has a major presence in biotech medicine production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L), another player with a potential appetite, is also probably not in the running, as it focuses on other priorities, some industry experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Roche's Swiss rival, Novartis AG (NOVN.VX), has been seen by some analysts as a possible buyer, but it has a competing presence in multiple sclerosis which could rule it out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Officials at all the firms declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "A number of big companies have said recently they don't think they are big enough in biotech yet, so I would think there will be quite a lot of interest," said Paul Diggle of Nomura Code Securities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Acquiring Biogen will not be cheap, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The unexpectedly rich price of $15.6 billion paid for U.S. biotech firm MedImmune by AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) earlier this year -- equivalent to 11 times annual sales -- showed big pharma's appetite for biotech assets. That same high valuation would value Biogen at about $34 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In practice, analysts believe threats to Biogen's core multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise from new products and the risk of biogeneric competition to its established MS drug Avonex in the years ahead mean a lowlier rating is justified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    TYSABRI WILD CARD &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On the plus side, new MS drug Tysabri is now seen by some analysts as a potential multibillion-dollar-a-year seller. Biogen collaborates on the drug with Elan Corp ELN.I. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The key variable in the take-out price is the outlook for Tysabri," said Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, who sees Biogen fetching $85 to $100 a share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Investors are clearly anticipating a keen tussle, with Biogen shares rising 18.8 percent on Nasdaq on Monday to $82.51, valuing the business at around $23 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The prize offered Biogen is a bridgehead into the biological medicines market, where growth is faster and margins higher than in traditional pharmaceuticals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "A lot of people want biological capacity. Those who have it already probably won't be bidders, so I guess you can probably count out Roche and AstraZeneca," said Ben Yeoh, an industry analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    France's Sanofi-Aventis, the world's third-largest drugmaker, said last month it was looking for acquisitions in biotechnology -- particularly in manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, the global No. 1 in pharmaceuticals, has also trumpeted its determination to be a leader in biotech. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Sanofi is looking for more biological products and Pfizer is doing the same," said Tim Race of brokerage ING. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    There are possible obstacles in place. Biogen has a partnership with Genentech Inc DNA.N for Rituxan, as well as with Elan for Tysabri. Under a change of ownership Genentech and Elan have the right to buy Biogen's rights to those drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe Genentech has both the motivation and the resources to gain full control over Rituxan," said Bret Holley, an analyst at CIBC World Markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Given that we expect Rituxan to continue to be a major revenue driver for Biogen, we believe the loss of rights to this product would significantly diminish Biogen's value to a potential acquirer." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Biogen's announcement late on Friday comes four years after it was acquired by Idec Pharmaceutical for $6.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said it hired Goldman Sachs &amp; Co and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co to help find a buyer and that it has already received "expressions of interest." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One interested party is billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who recently took control of ImClone Systems Inc IMCL.O and has increased his stake in Biogen to about 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Additional reporting by Jeffrey Goldfarb in Vienna and Jessica Hall in Philadelphia) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Writing by Ben Hirschler; editing by Sue Thomas, Richard Chang; email: ben.hirschler@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: ben.hirschler.reuters.com@reuters.net; +44 20 7542 5082)) Keywords: BIOGEN/BIDDERS  Keywords: BIOGEN/BIDDERS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

expected strong first-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which has a target price of $37 on the stock, said
it raised its estimates a week ago to reflect the positive
impact from the aQuantive acquisition and out-performance in
Halo 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other catalysts include the upcoming Windows Server 2008
launch, Christmas Xbox 360 sales, and a strong balance sheet
for buybacks, the brokerage said.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, paragraph 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 16 (Reuters) - The first shipment of Exxon
Mobil's (XOM.N) new Mondo crude in Angola is expected to load at
the end of December, trade sources said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The offshore terminal, located 90 miles from the coast of
northern Angola, is seen shipping around 500,000 barrels on Dec.
30-31, according to Angola's monthly loading programmmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon officials were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mondo production was expected to begin in December, with
output eventually reaching around 100,000 barrels per day,
according to the company website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The grade is marketed as a sweet crude with an API gravity
of 30.3 degrees and a sulphur content of 0.39 percent, according
to its assay. Its sulphur level is similar to that of Angola's
Girassol, Plutonio and Kissanje grades.

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has told a South 
Korean court it wants to drop its appeal against a landmark 
Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) antitrust ruling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft has sought to withdraw its appeal," the company 
said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are working with the KFTC and the Seoul High Court, but 
because the matter is pending before the court we cannot

high court of Microsoft's decision to drop its appeal. A 
spokesman said the commission was undecided on its next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commission ruled in 2005 that Microsoft had abused its 
dominant market position, fining it 32.5 billion won ($35.41 
million) and ordering it to separate its instant messaging 
program from the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The commission rejected Microsoft's appeal in May 2006, and 
then the company took the case to the Seoul High Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the court rejected a stay while the software company 
challenged the ruling, Microsoft said in October 2006 that it 
had made changes to its Windows Vista operating system to meet 
all of the commission's demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft suffered a decisive antitrust defeat in September 
when a European Union court upheld a landmark ruling that the 
world's largest software maker had abused its dominant market 
position to crush rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-highest EU court dismissed the company's appeal 
on all key points against the 2004 European Commission ruling 
and upheld a record 497 million euro ($705.7 million) fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has repeatedly said it had not decided whether to 
appeal the EU case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Kelly Blatz has landed a

Just last month, he was tapped to star on "Aaron Stone."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Blatz now has been cast in "Sky Runners," a comedy 
described as a modern-day "Odd Couple" with a UFO twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It revolves around two brothers who encounter a UFO one

&lt;p&gt;The $6 billion project is attempting to double capacity at the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a pipeline which runs from Kazakhstan to the Black Sea, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Russian government, which holds a 24 percent stake in the venture through its state-owned pipeline monopoly OAO Transneft, has blocked the expansion, arguing that Russia should receive more revenue, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Chevron could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

billion in the Gulf of Thailand Bongkot field to maintain its
production at 630 mcfpd to be sold to its parent PTT, they
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The statement did not say how much PTTEP would have to pay
the government in total, but the Energy Ministry officials said
in July it would have to pay up to $500 mllion in fees.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MILAN Oct 15 (Reuters) - The world's biggest drinks maker Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Italian premium coffee roaster illycaffe said they have agreed to set up a joint venture as they aim to expand in a $10 billion ready-to-drink (RTD) coffee market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The joint venture would focus on the premium RTD coffee segment, but the details of brands and distribution were yet to be finalised as the two companies aim to sign the final deal by the end of 2007, they said in a joint statement on Monday.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co Inc (JPM.N)
reported slightly higher quarterly profit on Wednesday as gains
from private-equity investments helped offset $1.64 billion in
write-downs on leveraged loans and collateralized debt
obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's performance is a vindication for Chairman and
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who joined the bank after his
career path was blocked at rival Citigroup (C.N). Profit at
Citigroup plunged 57 percent in the third quarter amid calls
for the ouster of CEO Chuck Prince.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Jamie Dimon is a smart cookie," said Meg McMullen, chief
of New England Research  Management, which oversees about $200
million but does not own JPMorgan shares. "He's ahead of the
pack here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But escalating losses on home equity loans are a problem
being watched closely by analysts. The bank said it now expects
quarterly losses of up to $270 million on home equity loans
over the next several quarters. Its previous estimate was $150
million to $160 million per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon blamed slumping home values and problems with loans
where borrowers put little money down. To combat escalating
delinquencies, the bank has tightened underwriting standards
several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, the third-largest U.S. bank, said third-quarter
net income was $3.4 billion, or 97 cents a share, up from $3.3
billion, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's stock, down 4 percent this year, was up 95
cents, or 2.1 percent, to $46.06 in afternoon trade on the New
York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeff Harte said enthusiasm for
JPMorgan's performance may be muted because of the size of its
gain from private equity investments. Analysts sometimes
minimize such large contributions because they are not seen as
a recurring event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan recorded gains of $766 million from private-equity
investments, up from $226 million a year earlier. The bank's
write-down on leveraged loans, used for corporate takeovers,
was less than what some analysts had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity gains, along with profit growth in asset
management and treasury services, helped beat analysts' average
earnings forecast of 90 cents a share, according to Reuters
Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's performance stands in sharp contrast to that of
most other Wall Street firms, which saw profits plunge in the
third quarter. Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N expects to lose
money in the quarter on $5.5 billion in write-downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's investment banking profit fell 70 percent in the
quarter to $296 million, primarily because of markdowns of $1.3
billion, after fees, on leveraged lending commitments, and
markdowns of $339 million on collateralized debt obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank recently cut about 100 jobs in the investment
banking division, and Dimon told the conference call there will
be more trimming in hard-hit areas. But he said the bank will
add jobs in growth areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tim McLaughlin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N) 
executive who was fired after being accused of holding 
unauthorized talks to sell the company has sued JPMorgan Chase 
 Co (JPM.N), which he said did not disclose its role in the 
buyout discussions to Dow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Romeo Kreinberg, who headed Dow's specialty chemicals 
businesses, was fired by the company in April for allegedly 
engaging in "business activity that was highly inappropriate." 
He and Dow have launched legal actions against each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kreinberg, in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in 
Michigan that is part of his ongoing dispute with Dow, said 
JPMorgan had held discussions with Omani investors and private 
equity groups about a buyout of Dow. However, the complaint 
said JPMorgan had chosen not to disclose its activity to Dow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, Dow in a court filing said it had 
obtained information regarding Dow employees participating in 
the buyout talks from JPMorgan's Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kreinberg's complaint contends that JPMorgan 
representatives approached him at a meeting in London and the 
bank's representatives inquired about how Dow might react to a 
bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kreinberg claims he replied that Dow "would circle the 
wagons," adding that he did not share any confidential company 
information with the bank's representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The complaint further states that "JPMorgan was intimately 
aware - and in fact acted as the driver of - leveraged buyout 
efforts targeting Dow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti said: "The claims are 
factually and legally unfounded, and we're confident they will 
be dismissed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kreinberg and his lawyer Stanley Arkin declined to comment 
on the complaint against JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow spokesman Chris Huntley said that "Kreinberg was 
terminated for improper conduct in April ... it is unfortunate 
that he's chosen to attack his former employer and now others 
for a decision that was brought about by his own conduct."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The third-party complaint against JPMorgan Chase is 
absurd," he added. "It's clearly a vain effort to spread blame 
to others and deflect responsibility for his own actions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kreinberg has denied any role in the buyout talks. However, 
his complaint against JPMorgan says that if Dow proves its 
claims against him, then the bank should be held accountable 
too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Should Dow somehow meet its burden on this claim ... 
JPMorgan ... should be held accountable for its share of harm 
caused to the company," states Kreinberg's complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Euan Rocha)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Nordstrom Inc

Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to Conviction List Buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised its share price target on Wal-Mart to
$51 from $48, and cut its target on Nordstrom to $46 from $54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Nordstrom, Goldman said the upscale department store
chain had already reduced third-quarter earnings outlook due to
inventory builds, and a tough macro backdrop and continued warm
weather could create further downside over the next several
quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wal-Mart, the brokerage said the top retailer's
defensive sales mix, cheap valuation, and relative earnings
sustainability offer a compelling near-term hiding ground until
greater macro visibility emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wal-Mart's analyst meeting next week might be a positive
catalyst for the stock, the brokerage added.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to early afternoon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Kristina Cooke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 17 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq rose on Wednesday,
after earnings from tech bellwethers Intel Corp (INTC.O) and
Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) topped Wall Street's forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the SP 500 and the Dow industrials surrendered their
early gains to trade lower, after a disappointing outlook from
United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and lackluster hardware sales
from IBM (IBM.N) tempered the profit outlook for the broader
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price of oil soared to a new high of $89 a barrel as
investors fretted over possible military action in northern
Iraq and a potential supply crunch this winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among sectors "doing the best is technology ... and the
strong earnings reflect that," said Brian Gendreau, investment
strategist at ING Investment Management, in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But the market is holding up surprisingly well, given
that oil prices are at records and the Turkish parliament has
approved troops to enter northern Iraq."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 51.29
points, or 0.38 percent, at 13,861.65. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX was down 2.60 points, or 0.17 percent, at
1,535.93. But the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 12.26
points, or 0.44 percent, at 2,776.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of chip maker Intel climbed 4.2 percent to $26.54
on the Nasdaq, while shares of Yahoo, an Internet media
company, jumped 6.9 percent to $28.54. Several brokerages
raised their price targets on the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But shares of diversified manufacturer United Technologies
dropped 4.3 percent to $76.25, while those of technology
services company International Business Machines Corp slid 2.6

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM/LONDON Oct 17 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc
(RDSa.L) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) have put some Dutch North Sea
fields up for sale, adding to plans to sell UK North Sea assets,
as the oil majors focus on exploring regions offering more
potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shell said in a statement on Wednesday that its NAM joint
venture with Exxon was selling a number of producing fields in
the NOGAT area on the Dutch continental shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Anglo-Dutch oil major said the fields being offered for
sale produced around 5.4 million cubic metres of gas and 1,700
barrels of oil per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The North Sea was a vital production area for oil majors
like Shell after they lost rich fields in the Middle East
through nationalisations in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, in recent years the big international oil companies
have shifted their focus to areas such as Angola which offer
greater potential for discovering large amounts of oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shell said the sale would not lead to a reduction in overall
employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In June, Shell said it and Exxon planned to sell fields in
the UK North Sea producing 25,000 to 30,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day of oil and gas.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co Inc (JPM.N) on Wednesday said it expects significantly higher losses on home equity loans amid slumping U.S. housing prices and escalating mortgage payment delinquencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said quarterly losses on home equity loans could climb as high as $270 million. That's higher than the company's previous quarterly estimate of $150 million to $160 million&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, who made his remarks on a conference call, said the losses have forced the company to set aside more money for losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has responded to higher losses by tightening underwriting standards on loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's the sixth time in the course of the recent quarters of tightening up of underwriting standards across the consumer lending books," Cavanagh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tim McLaughlin, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Kelly Blatz has landed a 
starring role in his second live-action pilot for Jetix, the 
action-adventure programming block that airs on Toon Disney. 
Just last month, he was tapped to star on "Aaron Stone."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Blatz now has been cast in "Sky Runners," a comedy 
described as a modern-day "Odd Couple" with a UFO twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It revolves around two brothers who encounter a UFO one 
night after football practice. While they are divided on what 
to do with the UFO at first, they end up keeping it after 
learning that their new "toy" can fly them anywhere they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In "Aaron Stone," Blatz stars as an ordinary 16-year-old 
whose life is altered when a rich recluse wants him to take his 
video game alter ego on for real because he believes that 
Charlie has what it takes to save the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's understood that if Disney executives like both 
projects, they would choose one to order to series. Jetix

&lt;p&gt; (Adds interview details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Oct 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O)  said on Tuesday it expects its unified communications product &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- the company's effort to link e-mail, instant messaging and -- the company's effort to link e-mail, instant messaging and phone systems over Internet networks -- to become one of the fastest-growing segments of its $16 billion business division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Revenue growth from unified communications will outpace "by a multiple" that of the overall Microsoft business division, which had revenue growth of 13 percent in fiscal 2007, said Jeff Raikes, president of the business division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Raikes did not offer specific figures during an interview ahead of a launch event for its Office Communications Server 2007, which allows users to e-mail, instant message, video conference or make Web-based phone calls from within the company's Office applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "When you can integrate voice and video into the fundamental Office productivity work that you do, it really changes things," said Raikes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft and Cisco Systems Inc.

"You change the plumbing only for what you bring in terms of new value and that comes with software and that's where our strength is." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    When asked how a possible slowdown in technology spending could affect demand for the new unified communication product, Raikes said he expects a slowdown not to have any effect because the product can save companies money in travel and phone implementation costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Raikes, who said Microsoft's business division is doing well, declined to comment on the overall outlook for technology spending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi, editing by Brian Moss) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reuters Messaging: daisuke.wakabayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 206 652 2326)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for:  * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com      * BridgeStation: view story .134                          For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: MICROSOFT UNIFIEDCOMMS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, changes dateline from SAN FRANCISCO) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Oct 16 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp, (IBM.N) the largest technology services company, reported higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by improved profitability in its services business and acquisitions, though its profit margin narrowed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Third-quarter net income rose to $2.36 billion, or $1.68 per share, from $2.22 billion, or $1.45 per share, a year earlier. Revenue increased to $24.1 billion from $22.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The per-share profit and revenue results matched analysts' average expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The gross profit margin narrowed to 41.3 percent in the quarter from 42.0 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The shares fell 1 percent to $118.40 in extended trading following the earnings report after closing up 1.3 percent at $119.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM, led by Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano, has improved year-over-year profitability over the last 12 consecutive quarters, as it spent more than $5 billion in 2006 on acquisitions, mainly for software companies, to expand its most profitable business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM has been selling more software in its services segment, which accounts for more than one-half of revenue, as well as cutting jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM shares, up 21 percent so far this year, trade at 16.9 times expected 2007 earnings per share, compared with a multiple of 17.9 for Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and 20.6 for Dell Inc DELL.O. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Jim Finkle in Boston and Philipp Gollner in San Francisco, editing by Jeffrey Benkoe) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((+1 415 677-2547, philipp.gollner@reuters.com) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available  for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com  * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on  Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: IBM RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Thursday the company aims to pursue an independent path, focusing on up to 20 smaller acquisitions of $50 million to $1 billion each annually rather than mega-deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with a cash pile of $23 billion, Microsoft has been rumored to be targeting acquisitions like Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), or social networking phenomenon Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, Ballmer would not comment directly on any potential acquisitions, but he said Microsoft's current focus is the "independent path."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If at some point it makes sense, maybe then it makes sense. But that's not where we are going. We are driving in an independent direction," said Ballmer in a question-and-answer session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO of the world's largest software maker said it is logical for people to speculate that main rivals would join forces to take on an industry leader. In this case, Ballmer was referring to dominant Web search leader Google Inc. (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft historically has shunned costly acquisitions, opting to purchase lots of less expensive companies. But company watchers saw this year's $6 billion acquisition of digital advertising company aQuantive Inc as a change in strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due in part to the aQuantive acquisition, Microsoft CFO Chris Liddell has said the company will spend more this fiscal year in acquisitions than on research and development for the first time in the company's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it bought 23 companies in the 2007 fiscal year ended in June. Of those, it reported 13 acquisitions valued at a total of $1.34 billion, including an $800 million purchase of voice recognition technology company Tellme Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll probably buy 20 companies a year consistently for the next five years," said Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who joined Microsoft in 1980 at the request of his Harvard classmate Bill Gates, took the stage a day after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who like Gates is a Harvard dropout turned technology wunderkind, spoke to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both men were reserved in response to questions about reports that Microsoft is in talks to buy up to 5 percent of Facebook in a deal that could value the social networking company at $10 billion or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg and Ballmer both said: "We'll see." Ballmer also emphasized that the two companies have a "great" partnership in advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also restated the company's commitment to building a powerful Web advertising business and acknowledged that attracting users to its Windows Live search engine will be an important aspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft placed third in the U.S. Web search market with a 10.3 percent share in September versus 57 percent for Google and 23.7 percent for Yahoo, according to comScore Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most valuable advertising real estate, in a sense, comes out of search," said Ballmer. "You're never going to grow a big advertising base, never going to attract a critical mass of advertisers if you can't be credible in search."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another critical aspect of building a Web advertising power, according to Ballmer, is to build software that allows advertisers and Internet publishers to create a market where they can buy and sell advertising on video or mobile phones or on Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AQuantive gives Microsoft an important leg-up in that strategy, Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft rose 8 cents to $31.16 in Nasdaq trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michele Gershberg in San Francisco)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 18 (Reuters) - Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR.O)
on Thursday said it was given no advance notice about Pfizer
Inc's decision to "walk away" from their shared Exubera inhaled
insulin drug and said it was disappointed in Pfizer's
performance in marketing the unpopular medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We first learned this morning of Pfizer's decision to walk
away from Exubera from their press release," Nektar Chief
Executive Officer Howard Robin said in a company statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer has publicly acknowledged its organizational
difficulties and resulting poor performance in launching
Exubera," Robin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials at New York-based Pfizer (PFE.N) said it was
unable to inform the tiny partner it was parting ways until
Pfizer had already made the announcement public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Because of Securities and Exchange Commission rules we
could not reach out to them until this morning, which we did,"
said Pfizer spokesman Andy McCormick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McCormick said Pfizer withheld the news from Nektar until
then because it was "material information" related to Pfizer's
quarterly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier Thursday, Pfizer said it would return the rights to
the drug to Nektar. Exubera was approved in the United States
in January 2006, after years of delays and difficulties
developing the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's first form of inhaled insulin has been dogged
by poor sales, posting revenue of only $12 million for the
first nine months of 2007 despite a national direct-to-consumer
advertising campaign over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By contrast, cholesterol fighter Lipitor -- Pfizer's
biggest product -- has racked up sales of $9.2 billion so far
this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nektar shares closed down $1.41, or 17.5 percent, to $6.67
on Nasdaq, while Pfizer slipped 1 cent to $24.54 on the New
York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, took a $2.8 billon
charge in the third quarter to end its involvement with
Exubera. Moreover, Pfizer said it had halted development of
second-generation forms of inhaled insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer is considered one of the industry's most aggressive
marketers, having built Lipitor and many other drugs into
blockbuster brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But its marketing machine sparked and sputtered in efforts
to get Exubera off the ground, in part because the canister
used to administer its powdered clouds of insulin was
considered clunky and bulky.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer (PFE.N), the world's largest drug maker, took a $2.8 billion charge to cut its ties to the inhaled insulin drug Exubera, a sensational failure of a product once touted as a can't-miss blockbuster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Exubera charge, Pfizer's results were hurt by restructuring expenses tied to cost-reduction initiatives and competition from cheaper generic medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.VX), which was also hit by competition from cheaper versions of its medicines and saw a 12 percent drop in net profit, appears to be heading down a similar path as it announced 1,260 job cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher sales of Wyeth's WYE.N drugs were offset by charges tied to productivity initiatives and its third-quarter profit fell slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the quartet reporting on Thursday, Lilly (LLY.N) stood out as its once-flagging top-seller Zyprexa for schizophrenia grew by 8 percent, sales of the anti-depressant Cymbalta jumped 47 percent and the company raised it full-year earnings per share forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding a one-time charge related to insurance recoveries, Lilly earned 91 cents per share, topping analysts' average expectations by 4 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's revenue fell 2 percent and net earnings fell sharply to $761 million from $3.36 billion a year ago. Excluding special items, however, Pfizer's profit topped analysts' diminished expectations by 6 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While slashing its 2007 net earnings forecast, Pfizer slightly raised the low end of its outlook, excluding special items. And it maintained its 2008 earnings forecast, excluding items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're delivering on their guidance, which can be viewed as a meaningful positive considering all the challenges the company is facing," said Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth matched Wall Street expectations of 90 cents per share, excluding items, as sales of its Prevnar vaccine to prevent childhood infections and the arthritis drug Enbrel jumped 24 percent and 39 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone in large cap pharma is benefiting from foreign exchange," said Oppenheimer  Co analyst Scott Henry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Lilly investors are likely to remain on the sidelines as the company awaits important data on experimental drugs that could dramatically affect the share price one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock is probably reacting more neutral than it would have because the focus now shifts to the data," Henry said. "The good numbers are now in the rear view mirror."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly shares were down 6 cents to $56.89, Wyeth shares were up 66 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $47.01 and Pfizer shares rose 7 cents to $24.62, all on the New York Stock Exchange. Novartis shares were off slightly in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson, Lewis Krauskopf and Ed Tobin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Shares of Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR.O) fell as much as 17 percent in Thursday trade after its partner Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) pulled the plug on their inhaled diabetes drug Exubera amid sluggish sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exubera, which was developed by Nektar and Pfizer, was approved by U.S. regulators in January 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding waistlines are fueling a rise in global diabetes rates and investors were betting Exubera would quickly become a blockbuster because it allowed diabetics to control their blood sugar by inhaling insulin rather than injecting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite our best efforts, Exubera has failed to gain the acceptance of patients and physicians," Pfizer Chief Executive Jeff Kindler said in a statement. "We have therefore concluded that further investment in this product is unwarranted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it would return its worldwide Exubera rights to Nektar and work with doctors over the next three months to switch Exubera patients to other diabetes treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howard Robin, Nektar's president and chief executive, said the company learned of Pfizer's decision to abandon Exubera from a press release this morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nektar has been very disappointed in Pfizer's performance in marketing Exubera. Pfizer has publicly acknowledged its organizational difficulties and resulting poor performance in launching Exubera," Robin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin said Nektar is evaluating its options with respect to Pfizer's decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of the move by Pfizer did not come as a shock to some analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were not surprised by this decision, as prescriptions to date continue to be weak," Friedman, Billings, Ramsey  Co. analyst Jim Reddoch said in a client note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarter-to-date Exubera prescription numbers were flat, suggesting another $4 million quarter for the drug, Reddoch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts speculated the bulky canister device used to administer the powdered drug was a turn-off to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reddoch, who maintained a market perform rating on the stock, lowered his price target on Nektar to $6 from $8. He said he sees little opportunity for shares to appreciate over the next year due to the company's early-stage pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he maintained his estimate for a 2007 loss of $1.20 per share and his call for a loss of 27 cents per share in 2008, Reddoch cut his 2008 revenue target to $142 million from $165 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in MannKind Corp (MNKD.O), which is also developing an inhaled insulin, fell just over 5 percent, or 58 cents, to $10.22 in afternoon trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other companies, including Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) as well as partners Eli Lilly (LLY.N) and Alkermes Inc (ALKS.O) are developing inhaled insulin products. Alkermes shares were down 14 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $16.90 on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nektar's shares fell to $6.30 in electronic trading before the market opened from a close of $8.08 on Wednesday on Nasdaq. Shares were down nearly 16 percent, or $1.26, to $6.82 in late trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Toni Clarke in Boston, Ransdell Pierson in New York and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 18 (Reuters) - Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR.O)
on Thursday said it was given no advance notice about Pfizer
Inc's decision to "walk away" from their shared Exubera inhaled
insulin drug and said it was disappointed in Pfizer's
performance in marketing the unpopular medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer has publicly acknowledged its organizational
difficulties and resulting poor performance in launching
Exubera," Nektar said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer earlier on Thursday said it would return Nektar
rights to the drug, which was approved in the United States in
January 2006 and has been dogged by surprisingly poor sales.
The world's first form of inhaled insulin has posted sales
during the first nine months of 2007 of only $12 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nektar shares fell as much as 17 percent on the Nasdaq,
while New York-based Pfizer rose 1 percent in afternoon trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, took a $2.8 billon
charge in the third quarter to end its involvement with
Exubera. Moreover, Pfizer said it had halted development of
second-generation forms of inhaled insulin.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Thursday the company aims to pursue an independent path, focusing on up to 20 smaller acquisitions of $50 million to $1 billion each annually rather than mega-deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with a cash pile of $23 billion, Microsoft has been rumored to be targeting acquisitions like Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), or social networking phenomenon Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, Ballmer would not comment directly on any potential acquisitions, but he said Microsoft's current focus is the "independent path."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If at some point it makes sense, maybe then it makes sense. But that's not where we are going. We are driving in an independent direction," said Ballmer in a question-and-answer session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO of the world's largest software maker said it is logical for people to speculate that main rivals would join forces to take on an industry leader. In this case, Ballmer was referring to dominant Web search leader Google Inc. (GOOG.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft historically has shunned costly acquisitions, opting to purchase lots of less expensive companies. But company watchers saw this year's $6 billion acquisition of digital advertising company aQuantive Inc as a change in strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due in part to the aQuantive acquisition, Microsoft CFO Chris Liddell has said the company will spend more this fiscal year in acquisitions than on research and development for the first time in the company's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it bought 23 companies in the 2007 fiscal year ended in June. Of those, it reported 13 acquisitions valued at a total of $1.34 billion, including an $800 million purchase of voice recognition technology company Tellme Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll probably buy 20 companies a year consistently for the next five years," said Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who joined Microsoft in 1980 at the request of his Harvard classmate Bill Gates, took the stage a day after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who like Gates is a Harvard dropout turned technology wunderkind, spoke to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both men were reserved in response to questions about reports that Microsoft is in talks to buy up to 5 percent of Facebook in a deal that could value the social networking company at $10 billion or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg and Ballmer both said: "We'll see." Ballmer also emphasized that the two companies have a "great" partnership in advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell 6 cents to $31.02 in mid-day Nasdaq trade.&lt;/p&gt;

"Nektar has been very disappointed in Pfizer's performance in marketing Exubera. Pfizer has publicly acknowledged its organizational difficulties and resulting poor performance in launching Exubera. This has culminated in their announcement today. We are evaluating all of our options with respect to Pfizer's Exubera announcement to protect the interests of Nektar. We continue to believe Exubera is an important advancement for diabetic patients."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, CEO comments, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters)- Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on
Thursday third-quarter earnings fell sharply due to a $2.8
billion charge to end its involvement with the poorly selling
inhaled insulin drug Exubera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But excluding one-time charges, profit at the world's
biggest drugmaker beat analysts' estimates as overall revenue
fell 2 percent, less than Wall Street had expected. Cholesterol
fighter Lipitor lost ground, and sales of several other
important Pfizer drugs plunged due to competition from cheaper
generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said Pfizer's
abandonment of Exubera, with revenues so far this year of only
$12 million, was irrelevant from a financial perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They tested the patient (Exubera) and there was no pulse,
so it's going from zero to zero," she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer earned $761 million, or 11 cents per share, in the
third quarter, compared with $3.36 billion, or 46 cents per
share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding special items, profit was 58 cents per share,
topping the average analyst target of 52 cents, according to
Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to the Exubera charge, Pfizer said results were
hurt by restructuring expenses tied to cost-reduction
initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total revenue fell to $11.99 billion but was $270 million
higher than the average Wall Street estimate. Pfizer said
positive foreign exchange factors boosted revenue by $300
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PFIZER EXHALES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(Exubera) has simply not found the acceptance of doctors
and patients," Chief Executive Jeff Kindler told analysts on a
conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will carefully evaluate what happened here," Kindler
said, referring to the unpopularity of the product. Moreover,
he said Pfizer will halt further research on second-generation
forms of inhaled insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exubera, developed in partnership with Nektar Therapeutics
(NKTR.O), was approved by U.S. regulators in January 2006 and
made history as the first form of inhaled insulin. Other
companies are trying to develop similar products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based Pfizer said it would return its worldwide
Exubera rights to Nektar, and work with doctors over the next
three months to switch Exubera patients to other diabetes
treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After being launched, many investors assumed Exubera would
become a sure-fire blockbuster on the theory that diabetics
would prefer an inhaled form of insulin over traditional
injectable forms of the hormone used to control blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, Exubera became a dud, with paltry sales. Some
analysts speculated the bulky canister device used to
administer the powdered drug was a turn-off to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In view of the hefty Exubera charge, Pfizer slashed its
2007 net earnings forecast. But excluding special items, it
issued a slightly improved outlook of $2.10 to $2.15 per share,
due in part to lower expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For 2008, it still expects earnings, excluding special
items, of $2.31 to $2.45 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank's Ryan said Pfizer's earnings report was
encouraging, given the company's financial forecasts for this
year and next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They're delivering on their guidance, which can be viewed
as a meaningful positive, considering all the challenges the
company is facing," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global sales of Pfizer's array of medicines fell 4 percent
in the third quarter, hurt by recent patent expirations on its
Zoloft anti-depressant and Norvasc medicine for high blood
pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zoloft sales plunged 73 percent to $124 million, while
sales of Norvasc fell 47 percent to $640 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lipitor sales fell 5 percent to $3.17 billion, hurt by
competition from a generic form of Merck  Co Inc's (MRK.N)
cholesterol drug Zocor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer now expects full-year Lipitor sales to fall 3
percent to 5 percent, a more cautious view than its prior
forecast of flat to 5 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bright spots in the quarter included Pfizer's Lyrica
treatment for neuropathic pain, with sales surging 37 percent
to $465 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares rose 1.4 percent to $24.89 in afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Nektar were down $1.32,
or 16 percent, to $6.76 in heavy trading on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 18 (Reuters) - DSG International DSGI.L, Europe's largest specialist electrical goods retailer, said total group like-for-like sales rose 5 percent in the first half, held back by a poor performance in Italy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Whilst profits in the first half will be down year-on-year, the next 3 months inclue the important Christmas peak season ...

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 18 (Reuters) - Higher food prices in Brazil,
Russia, India and China are seen keeping their inflation
pressures on the boil, with effects filtering through into other
consumer goods and services, Goldman Sachs said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Structural factors behind rising food prices in the
so-called BRICs nations, including higher incomes and demand for
alternative energy sources, is expected to sustain rises in
prices for grain, meat, eggs and dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Basic prices for agricultural commodities have spiked
sharply in developed and emerging markets in recent months, with
wheat prices alone more than doubling in the United States and
Europe to hit record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gains have been driven by a combination of robust global
demand -- particularly in Asia -- and worries over the weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grains are also being increasingly used to make biofuels,
producing the "food, feed and fuel" effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Thus far, higher food prices have not pushed core inflation
significantly higher, though they are starting to feed through
into other consumer goods and services," Goldman said in its
monthly BRICs report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank noted central banks in China, Brazil and India had
voiced concerns about the lasting impact of high food prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this month the
country had felt the influence of high international prices for
food after top officials acknowledged that inflation rates could
return to double digits this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Food price inflation is now visible across many emerging
markets, notably including the BRICs. In China, food
price inflation ran at 18 percent year-on-year in August -- the
highest rate in a decade," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If inflation was contained, Goldman said the higher
agricultural prices could support rural incomes, particularly in
India and China where large percentages of their respective
labour forces are employed in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agricultural commodities also figured highly in Merrill
Lynch's assessment of commodities on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's monthly survey of 209 fund managers across the
world found that 19 percent of respondents were now moderately
overweight in commodities in October compared with 12 percent in
September. Most of the increase in overweight positions came
from those who had been neutral previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commodities were seen reflecting the feel-good factor
rippling through emerging market economies, which have benefited
at the euro area's expense. For the overall Merrill Lynch

Analysts' average forecast was 52 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Exubera charge, Pfizer said results were hurt by restructuring expenses tied to cost-reduction initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell to $11.99 billion but was $270 million higher than the average Wall Street forecast. Pfizer said positive foreign exchange factors boosted revenue by $300 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite our best efforts, Exubera has failed to gain the acceptance of patients and physicians," Chief Executive Jeff Kindler said in a press release. "We have therefore concluded that further investment in this product is unwarranted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exubera, developed in partnership with Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR.O), was approved by U.S. regulators in January 2006 and made history as the first form of inhaled insulin. Other companies are trying to develop similar products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer said it would return its worldwide Exubera rights to Nektar and work with doctors over the next three months to switch Exubera patients to other diabetes treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being launched, many investors assumed Exubera would become a sure-fire blockbuster, on the theory that diabetics would prefer an inhaled form of insulin over traditional injectable forms of the hormone used to control blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Exubera became a dud, with paltry sales. Some analysts speculated the bulky canister device used to administer the powdered drug was a turn-off to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In view of the hefty Exubera charge, Pfizer slashed its 2007 net earnings forecast. But excluding special items, it issued a slightly improved forecast of $2.10 to $2.15 per share, thanks in part to lower expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 2008, it said it still expects earnings, excluding special items, of $2.31 to $2.45 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank's Ryan said Pfizer's earnings report was encouraging, given the company's financial forecasts for this year and next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're delivering on their guidance, which can be viewed as a meaningful positive considering all the challenges the company is facing," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global sales of Pfizer's array of medicines fell 4 percent in the third quarter, hurt by recent patent expirations on its Zoloft anti-depressant and Norvasc medicine for high blood pressure. The end of patent protection opened the door to competition from cheaper generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoloft sales plunged 73 percent to $124 million, while sales of Norvasc fell 47 percent to $640 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipitor sales fell 5 percent to $3.17 billion, hurt by competition from a generic form of the Merck  Co (MRK.N) cholesterol drug Zocor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it now expects full-year sales of Lipitor to fall 3 percent to 5 percent, a more cautious view than its prior forecast that sales could be flat to 5 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bright spots in the third quarter included Pfizer's Lyrica treatment for neuropathic pain, whose sales surged 37 percent to $465 million, and schizophrenia drug Geodon, which rose 13 percent to $228 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthritis drug Celebrex continued to rebound following sales declines related to safety concerns. Third-quarter sales rose 8 percent to $577 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from impotence treatment Viagra rose 6 percent to $450 million, while revenue from relatively new cancer drug Sutent more than doubled to $151 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Edward Tobin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 18 (Reuters) - Companies worldwide face a
looming leadership crisis due to the retirement of baby boomers
and rapid growth in Asia with half fearful they cannot develop
the skills they need, a study released on Thursday said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The survey by IBM's (IBM.N) consulting arm interviewed 400
human resources executives from 40 countries and suggests
companies are putting growth strategies at risk if they cannot
identify and develop the next generation of leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baby boomers will drain companies of valuable knowledge
when they retire, while multinational firms need to find people
to lead their businesses in booming markets such as India and
China, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You've got this perfect storm of leadership crisis that is
hitting the mature and maturing markets," said IBM's Eric
Lesser, one of three co-authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Companies are really crunched both in terms of their
current capacity of leadership and also their ability to
develop leaders in the future. Three-quarters of the people who
responded said this was a significant workplace issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study found 88 percent of companies in the Asia Pacific
region are most concerned with their ability to develop future
leaders, followed by Latin America (74 percent); Europe, Middle
East and Africa, (74 percent); Japan (73 percent); and North
America (69 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fifty-two percent of human resources executives say their
organizations may be unable to rapidly develop skills to meet
current or future business needs. The study also found 36
percent of firms said employee skills fail to meet company
priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With competition for talent on the horizon, younger job
applicants might want to list online gaming skills on their
resumes, Lesser said. Many can be translated to realities of
the new workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It requires using virtual communication techniques,
everything from voice over IP to instant messaging to e-mail,"
Lesser said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with analysts' estimate, volume, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 17 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) said on Wednesday that its quarterly net profit rose a better-than-expected 13 percent, helped by strong sales of noncarbonated drinks and the weak dollar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest beverage company said net income rose to $1.65 billion, or 71 cents per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 28, up from $1.46 billion, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts on average were expecting 68 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A 3 cent per share restructuring charge in the quarter was offset by a 3 cent per share gain, mostly from the sale of a portion of its Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCL.AX) holdings, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Net operating revenue rose 19 percent to $7.69 billion, helped by higher sales of its beverage concentrate, acquisitions of certain bottlers, the weak dollar, higher pricing and a greater ratio of more expensive products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The weak dollar boosts the value of sales in other currencies when they are converted to dollars for inclusion on the company's income statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Worldwide case volume rose 6 percent, with increases of 4 percent for carbonated drinks and 14 percent for noncarbonated beverages, such as Powerade and Dasani bottled water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Volume rose 1 percent in North America and more than 4 percent in Japan, but fell 2 percent in Europe, hurt in part by unfavorable weather. The company said it saw double-digit volume growth in some key emerging markets, including China, Turkey, Russia and India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coca-Cola has increasingly relied on developing markets for growth, since its soft drink sales in North America have slowed as health-conscious consumers have cut down on sugary soft drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coke shares, which closed on Tuesday at $57.76 on the New York Stock Exchange, have gained about 9 percent over the last three months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    At Tuesday's close, Coke shares were trading near their highest level in more than 6 years. Their price-to-earnings ratio was about 22, a slight premium to rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), which had a multiple of 21.2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (See here for "Shop Talk" -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Martinne Geller) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Derek Caney and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co Inc (JPM.N)
reported slightly higher quarterly profit on Wednesday as gains
from private-equity investments helped offset $1.64 billion in
write-downs on leveraged loans and collateralized debt
obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's performance is a vindication for Chairman and
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who joined the bank after his
career path was blocked at rival Citigroup (C.N). Profit at
Citigroup plunged 57 percent in the third quarter amid calls
for the ouster of CEO Chuck Prince.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Jamie Dimon is a smart cookie," said Meg McMullen, chief
of New England Research  Management, which oversees about $200
million but does not own JPMorgan shares. "He's ahead of the
pack here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But escalating losses on home equity loans are a problem
being watched closely by analysts. The bank said it now expects
quarterly losses of up to $270 million on home equity loans
over the next several quarters. Its previous estimate was $150
million to $160 million per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon blamed slumping home values and problems with loans
where borrowers put little money down. To combat escalating
delinquencies, the bank has tightened underwriting standards
several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, the third-largest U.S. bank, said third-quarter
net income was $3.4 billion, or 97 cents a share, up from $3.3
billion, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's stock, down 4 percent this year, was up 95
cents, or 2.1 percent, to $46.06 in afternoon trade on the New
York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeff Harte said enthusiasm for
JPMorgan's performance may be muted because of the size of its
gain from private equity investments. Analysts sometimes
minimize such large contributions because they are not seen as
a recurring event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan recorded gains of $766 million from private-equity
investments, up from $226 million a year earlier. The bank's
write-down on leveraged loans, used for corporate takeovers,
was less than what some analysts had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity gains, along with profit growth in asset
management and treasury services, helped beat analysts' average
earnings forecast of 90 cents a share, according to Reuters
Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's performance stands in sharp contrast to that of
most other Wall Street firms, which saw profits plunge in the
third quarter. Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N expects to lose
money in the quarter on $5.5 billion in write-downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's investment banking profit fell 70 percent in the
quarter to $296 million, primarily because of markdowns of $1.3
billion, after fees, on leveraged lending commitments, and
markdowns of $339 million on collateralized debt obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank recently cut about 100 jobs in the investment
banking division, and Dimon told the conference call there will
be more trimming in hard-hit areas. But he said the bank will
add jobs in growth areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tim McLaughlin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to additional subscribers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY Oct 18 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on
Thursday it has shut down the diesel production unit at its
Altona refinery in Australia's Victoria state due to technical
issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We shut down the unit a few days ago ... we expect
production to be back up by middle of next week," said Exxon's
spokesman Alan Bailey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bailey said the refinery has not been supplying diesel to
the market and has put customers on reduced allocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Altona refinery produces about 13 million litres of
refined products each day, with petrol and diesel accounting
for 50 and 25 percent of production respectively. Jet fuel,
bitumen and liquefied petroleum gas makes up the rest.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects to "lower-margin unit" from higher in paragraph 12)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi and Michele Gershberg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Oct 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
said its $6 billion acquisition of aQuantive will fill out its
Internet advertising technology and make it as competitive as
Google Inc (GOOG.O) in that market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The August purchase of the digital advertising firm
positions Microsoft as one of the few companies with the money
and technology know-how to be a major force in an industry
expected to grow to $80 billion by 2010, said Brian McAndrews,
former aQuantive CEO who is leading Microsoft's advertising
efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our goal is to have a significant amount of the revenue in
the industry going through our technology, our platform," said
McAndrews, who spoke to Reuters this week on the sidelines of
the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco. "All parts of our business
will be bigger and more profitable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AQuantive's Atlas technology allows advertisers and
publishers to buy and sell digital advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft still needs to be able to sell "contextual"
advertising to target specific visitors of a Web site, but
McAndrews expects that it can introduce that capability next
year, providing a full suite of advertising tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McAndrews is at the vortex of Microsoft's major push into
Web advertising technology. Threatened by Google, the company
is working to build a major business to be a pillar of earnings
alongside its main Windows and Office software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft made its biggest-ever acquisition when it bought
aQuantive and handed the keys to its advertising business to
McAndrews. The executive ranked No. 11 in Business 2.0
magazine's "50 Who Matter Now," ahead of even his Microsoft
bosses, who include CEO Steve Ballmer and Chairman Bill Gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; '1 + 1 = 3'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McAndrews, who is senior vice president at Microsoft's
advertiser and publisher services group, said the benefits of
the acquisition would increase over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Absolutely, one plus one equals three, but not on day
one," he said. "I would say something like one plus one equals
two and a quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's acquisition of aQuantive is part of a $10
billion consolidation spree in the online advertising market,
centered mostly around deep-pocketed players. Google agreed to
pay $3.1 billion for DoubleClick, while Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O)
snatched up the rest of Right Media for $680 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There just aren't going to be very many companies that can
invest the kind of money it's going to take to build these
platforms and have the technology expertise," said McAndrews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For now, AQuantive's Avenue A/Razorfish interactive ad
agency will remain in Microsoft. Wall Street analysts had
earlier speculated the lower-margin unit, which accounts for
nearly 60 percent of aQuantive's revenue, may be sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McAndrews explained that Avenue A had also been a key link
between its advertiser clients and the part of aQuantive that
specializes in ad-serving and tracking technologies. AQuantive
has also profited from its technology ties with traditional ad
agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Agencies are a critical part of the ecosystem," McAndrews
said. "They aren't going away, they shouldn't go away and,
frankly, if there is a technology company trying to
disintermediate them, then I think that's a mistake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google has sought to extend its auction-based technology
for efficiently selling Web search advertising to traditional
media, from television to radio and print. While the company
said it did not plan to replicate the ad agency model, many in
the industry fear it might eventually offer a wider range of
advertising services, including creating campaigns.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) handling of its decision to dump its poorly selling inhaled insulin could taint its allure as a marketing partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rivals could get a leg up on Pfizer in gaining favor with biotech companies, which are constantly being courted by big drug makers for rights to sell prospective medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the world's No. 1 drug maker announced on Thursday it would exit Exubera, its partner, Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR.O), said it only learned of Pfizer's decision from Pfizer's press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nektar issued a scathing statement, saying it was "very disappointed" in Pfizer's marketing of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analyst Jami Rubin said in a research note she was surprised at how Pfizer delivered the news to Nektar: "Such tactics can't be good for your 'partner of choice' reputation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said on Thursday it withheld the news from Nektar until it put out its press release because it was material financial information related to Pfizer's quarterly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Natixis Bleichroeder analyst Jon LeCroy said, "If it's your partner, it's financially material to both. I just find that an odd explanation of how you could leave your partner out of the loop like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dent to Pfizer's reputation would come at a particularly bad time, as it tries to replace revenue from medicines that have lost or will lose patent protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Jeff Kindler has recently completed his first year at Pfizer's helm, and the drug maker has recently named a new research and development chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LeCroy noted that Pfizer also abandoned its sleep-drug partnership with Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX.O) in June 2006 after U.S. regulators rejected a form of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Neurocrine hit their lowest level in nearly seven years after Pfizer dropped the partnership on the drug, indiplon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're a small biotech and you've seen how they've treated their tiny partners, I would argue that, yeah, you probably wouldn't want to partner with Pfizer right now, and that's not what they need with the weakness in their pipeline," LeCroy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these setbacks, Pfizer still can boast of many sales representatives to put behind a product and extensive capital for consumer advertising that makes them attractive, Edward Jones analyst Linda Bannister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there are a lot of companies that have products in development who would be willing to strike a deal with Pfizer because they know Pfizer has a lot of marketing muscle," Bannister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is eager to stockpile potential products before Lipitor, its mammoth-selling cholesterol drug, loses U.S. patent protection in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation became more dire late last year, when the company halted the development of another promising cholesterol treatment because of safety reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their pipeline right now isn't that strong internally," said LeCroy, who rates Pfizer shares as "hold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In general, things are looking very bleak for them so they really need to in-license more things," LeCroy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Brian Moss)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 19 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on
Friday revised Pfizer's (PFE.N) rating outlook to negative from
stable after the drug maker reported a sharp drop in
third-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A negative outlook indicates there is greater chance of a
rating downgrade over the next 12 to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer on Thursday said earnings fell to $761 million in
the third quarter, down from $3.36 billion a year earlier,
after a $2.8 billion charge to end its involvement with the
poorly selling insulin drug Exubera. For details, see
[ID:nL19450519].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's now rates Pfizer "Aa1," the second-highest
investment-grade rating. Pfizer was one of only a handful of
industrial companies to carry top "Triple-A" ratings from
Moody's before it was downgraded last December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The negative outlook reflects the write-down for Exubera,
continuing pressure on U.S. sales of cholesterol fighter
Lipitor, and the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Lipitor in either
2010 or 2011, Moody's said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although Moody's expectations for Exubera had already been
tempered by slow market acceptance, the disappointment
represents a key strategic setback, and also highlights the
challenges faced by the branded pharmaceutical industry," the
rating agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer still has a strong balance sheet, but it will face
challenges in improving shareholder value as patents expire
between 2010 and 2012, Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's 6.6 percent bonds due in 2028 traded on Thursday
at 105 basis points over Treasuries, according to MarketAxess.
There were no significant trades of those bonds on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 19 (Reuters) - Global speculative-grade default
rates will double to 3 percent by the end of 2008, European
high-yield bond investors said in a survey conducted by
investment bank JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The survey showed that participants thought default rates
would rise above the current 1.5 percent, with answers ranging
between 1.8 and 5 percent, averaging out at 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Only one investor thought the rate would return to or
surpass the long-term average of around 4.5 percent," analysts
at the bank wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Default rates have remained at historic lows this year as
"junk"-rated companies have enjoyed unprecedented access to
refinancing. But the credit crisis of the summer means that 
access to financing may be more limited in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Estimates of default rates for 2008 vary widely, with
Barclays Capital forecasting last week that they could rise as
high as 5.5 percent by mid-2008 due to tighter lending standards
and slower economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite an expected rise in possible defaults, the
percentage of those who said they were "very short" or "slightly
short" in CCC debt remained unchanged -- at 44 percent -- from
the last survey at the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors increased their holdings of high-yield bonds, JP
Morgan said, with the number of those describing their holdings
as "very long" rising to 12 percent from 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sixteen percent of respondents said they were looking to
decrease their high-yield bond holdings in the next three
months, versus none in the previous survey, while 44 percent
said they were still looking to add. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The survey also showed that returns for high-yield
investments are expected to rise from 2.1 percent year-to-date
to 3.6 percent in 2008, although 20 percent of respondents
thought returns would be zero or negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cable and telecoms topped the poll as the sector thought
likely to prove most profitable.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its rating on
solar-panel maker Suntech Power Holdings Co Ltd STP.N to

Chinese solar companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Cheryl Tang, who raised her price target on Suntech

Chinese solar companies is compelling, performance has not
always matched expectations.
 Shares of Suntech were trading down 1.5 percent at $46 in
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Oct 19 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster
Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N) said on Friday it was looking into
buying a medium-sized cable company in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa is branching out of the broadcasting business it
dominates in Mexico by trying to buy large stakes in cable
firms Cablemas and TVI, which both operate in the north of the

sights as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are still possibilities in terms of acquisitions of
medium-sized cable companies in Mexico. We're looking into
those," Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said in a
conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angoitia also said Televisa's television advertising
revenue would not be materially affected by a recent electoral
reform that forbids political parties from buying air time,
because such sales represent only a small part of its
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The law requires radio and TV broadcasters to give free air
time to political parties in election campaigning.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters)- Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) said on Thursday third-quarter earnings fell sharply, hurt by a $2.8 billion charge to end its involvement with its poorly-selling Exubera inhaled insulin drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Results were also hurt by declining sales of cholesterol fighter Lipitor and generic competition for many of Pfizer's other medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's biggest drug maker earned $761 million, or 11 cents per share, compared with $3.36 billion, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Excluding special items, profit was 58 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 52 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Despite our best efforts, Exubera has failed to gain the acceptance of patients and physicians," Chief Executive Jeff Kindler said in a release. "We have therefore concluded that further investment in this product is unwarranted." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Exubera, developed in partnership with Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR.O), was approved by U.S. regulators in January 2006 and made history as the first form of inhaled insulin. Other companies are trying to develop similar products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    New York-based Pfizer said it would return its worldwide Exubera rights to Nektar and work with doctors over the next three months to switch Exubera patients to other diabetes treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    After being launched, many investors assumed Exubera would become a sure-fire blockbuster, on the theory that diabetics would much prefer an inhaled form of insulin than traditional injectable forms of the hormone used to control blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Instead, Exubera became a dud, with paltry sales. Some analysts speculated the bulky canister device used to administer the powdered drug was a turn-off to patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Edward Tobin) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Derek Caney; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER RESULTS/   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Ransdell Pierson &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR.O) on Thursday said it was given no advance notice about Pfizer Inc's decision to "walk away" from their shared Exubera inhaled insulin drug and said it was disappointed in Pfizer's performance in marketing the unpopular medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We first learned this morning of Pfizer's decision to walk away from Exubera from their press release," Nektar Chief Executive Officer Howard Robin said in a company statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Pfizer has publicly acknowledged its organizational difficulties and resulting poor performance in launching Exubera," Robin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Officials at New York-based Pfizer (PFE.N) said it was unable to inform the tiny partner it was parting ways until Pfizer had already made the announcement public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Because of Securities and Exchange Commission rules we could not reach out to them until this morning, which we did," said Pfizer spokesman Andy McCormick.  McCormick said Pfizer withheld the news from Nektar until then because it was "material information" related to Pfizer's quarterly earnings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier Thursday, Pfizer said it would return the rights to the drug to Nektar. Exubera was approved in the United States in January 2006, after years of delays and difficulties developing the product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's first form of inhaled insulin has been dogged by poor sales, posting revenue of only $12 million for the first nine months of 2007 despite a national direct-to-consumer advertising campaign over the summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By contrast, cholesterol fighter Lipitor -- Pfizer's biggest product -- has racked up sales of $9.2 billion so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nektar shares closed down $1.41, or 17.5 percent, to $6.67 on Nasdaq, while Pfizer slipped 1 cent to $24.54 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, took a $2.8 billon charge in the third quarter to end its involvement with Exubera. Moreover, Pfizer said it had halted development of second-generation forms of inhaled insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer is considered one of the industry's most aggressive marketers, having built Lipitor and many other drugs into blockbuster brands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But its marketing machine sparked and sputtered in efforts to get Exubera off the ground, in part because the canister used to administer its powdered clouds of insulin was considered clunky and bulky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, editing by Jeffrey Benkoe; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: NEKTAR PFIZER/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

We are driving in an independent direction," said Ballmer in a question-and-answer session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO of the world's largest software maker said it is logical for people to speculate that main rivals would join forces to take on an industry leader. In this case, Ballmer was referring to dominant Web search leader Google Inc. (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft historically has shunned costly acquisitions, opting to purchase lots of less expensive companies. But company watchers saw this year's $6 billion acquisition of digital advertising company aQuantive Inc as a change in strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due in part to the aQuantive acquisition, Microsoft CFO Chris Liddell has said the company will spend more this fiscal year in acquisitions than on research and development for the first time in the company's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it bought 23 companies in the 2007 fiscal year ended in June. Of those, it reported 13 acquisitions valued at a total of $1.34 billion, including an $800 million purchase of voice recognition technology company Tellme Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll probably buy 20 companies a year consistently for the next five years," said Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who joined Microsoft in 1980 at the request of his Harvard classmate Bill Gates, took the stage a day after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who like Gates is a Harvard dropout turned technology wunderkind, spoke to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both men were reserved in response to questions about reports that Microsoft is in talks to buy up to 5 percent of Facebook in a deal that could value the social networking company at $10 billion or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg and Ballmer both said: "We'll see." Ballmer also emphasized that the two companies have a "great" partnership in advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer also restated the company's commitment to building a powerful Web advertising business and acknowledged that attracting users to its Windows Live search engine will be an important aspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft placed third in the U.S. Web search market with a 10.3 percent share in September versus 57 percent for Google and 23.7 percent for Yahoo, according to comScore Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most valuable advertising real estate, in a sense, comes out of search," said Ballmer. "You're never going to grow a big advertising base, never going to attract a critical mass of advertisers if you can't be credible in search."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another critical aspect of building a Web advertising power, according to Ballmer, is to build software that allows advertisers and Internet publishers to create a market where they can buy and sell advertising on video or mobile phones or on Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AQuantive gives Microsoft an important leg-up in that strategy, Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft rose 8 cents to $31.16 in Nasdaq trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michele Gershberg in San Francisco)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW Oct 20 (Reuters) - Talks between Kazakhstan and oil
companies developing the giant Kashagan field have stalled as
U.S Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) is blocking the expansion of the state's
share in the project, Interfax news agency said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The agency quoted unidentified sources as saying all other
foreign members of the Kashagan group had agreed on a
preliminary deal under which state energy firm KazMunaiGas would
raise its stake in the project from 8.33 percent now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed compromise, under which all group members would
proportionally reduce their stakes, could settle a dispute over
cost overruns and delays at Kashagan, one of the world's largest
oilfield developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interfax said KazMunaiGas's stake could double if Exxon were
given the final nod. Kazakh officials and the oil companies
could not be reached for comment on the report from Astana,
capital of the Central Asian state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has 18.52 percent of Kashagan, alongside project
leader Eni (ENI.MI) as well as Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and
Total (TOTF.PA), which have stakes of similar size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smaller stakes belong to ConocoPhilips (COP.N), with 9.26
percent, and Japan's Inpex (1605.T), with 8.33 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many partners, including Total, have called for a swift
resolution, saying a deal should be reached by the end of the
year. Eni has said the group is discussing the idea of
increasing Kazakhstan's project role but has given few details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have compared the development to similar moves by
Russia, which last year ousted Shell from the leading role in
the giant Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas project. Shell and
its partners sold control to state-controlled Gazprom (GAZP.MM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan has threatened to strip Eni of its leading role
in Kashagan, the biggest oil find in three decades, as it
negotiates a new budget, which may exceed $100 billion, and
timetable for pumping crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan has said securing a bigger stake in Kashagan is
not its main goal but it simply wants the field to come on
stream as soon as possible as the country seeks to triple its
oil production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kashagan's startup has been repeatedly postponed and is not
expected before 2011 or 2012. The field is due to produce about
1 million barrels per day when it reaches peak output several
years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This month, Kazakhstan said it had been forced to revise the
country's total output forecast downwards and it would not
achieve the projected target of 3 million bpd by 2015.

&lt;p&gt; MIAMI (Billboard) - Wisin  Yandel, the reggaeton duo with 
an uncanny knack for delivering hit singles, will become the 
first act to get its own customized Zune player, Billboard has 
learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The limited-edition Wisin  Yandel Zune device will hit 
Wal-Mart stores nationwide October 29, before the release of 
the duo's new album, "Los Extraterrestres," November 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Featuring the new album, videos, exclusive pictures and 
customized packaging, the MP3 player is but one aspect of a 
multiplatform Microsoft promotion that targets a new Latin 
consumer at the same time it promotes a hip Latin act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wisin  Yandel are Juan Luis Morera Luna (Wisin) and 
Llandel Veguilla Malave. Their breakthrough album, 2005's "Pa'l 
Mundo" (Machete), has sold nearly 600,000 copies in the United 
States, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and more than 1 million 
worldwide, according to their label. In the digital realm, 
they've sold more than 1 million mobile and digital tracks 
combined, according to SoundScan, and are Machete's top-selling 
digital act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2006, the duo became the first act to place four singles 
in the top 10 of Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new album's first single, "Sexy Movimiento," is gaining 
traction beyond reggaeton stations and is expected to reach the 
top five of Hot Latin Songs by release week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I sing reggaeton, that's what I do," Wisin said. "But we 
do fuse many rhythms, and we have evolved enormously in the 
past two years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Los Extraterrestres," he said, features live instruments 
on many tracks, as well as fusions that go from reggae roots to 
pop, and seven collaborations that range from Fat Joe and Eve 
to Don Omar and Franco De Vita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The choice to go Latin for its first customized device "is 
a statement," Zune multicultural marketing manager Javier 
Farfan said. "Latin music as a whole is a big priority for Zune 
and for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In partnering with Wisin  Yandel, Zune picked a 
youth-appealing, top-selling Latin act that also has traction 
in mobile and digital sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In this particular partnership we were trying to reach the 
acculturated Latino in the U.S.," Farfan said. "They are an act 
that embraces technology and showcases technology to their 
audience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Microsoft, it's about not just selling devices, but 
also selling subscriptions to its music service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Latin digital marketplace is served primarily by iTunes 
Latino, which has upped its marketing and promotion in the past 
year. For the week ending October 7, digital sales of Latin 
albums stood at 367,000, which equals 1.5 percent of total 
Latin album sales so far in 2007, according to Nielsen 
SoundScan. That's almost double the 198,000 Latin digital 
albums sold in the same time period of 2006, but still 
significantly below the industry average: Across all genres, 
10.6 percent of total 2007 album sales have been digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Within the U.S., the Latin market is one that many 
technology companies have sought to become more active in 
marketing to," said Ross Ruben, director of industry analysis 
at NPD Group. But Microsoft in particular "has talked about 
working more closely with artists in general."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Billboard&lt;/p&gt;

such that directors are elected annually, and eliminate an
anti-takeover defense known as a poison pill. It also said the
company should buy back more stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shamrock said it has held talks with Jackson Hewitt, and
expects to hold more. It said it was "encouraged" by the
company's decision on Oct. 9 to split up the chairman and chief
executive roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney and Gold had campaigned from late 2003 through early
2005 for the ouster of Michael Eisner as chief executive of
Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), named for Roy Disney's uncle. Eisner
was succeeded in 2005 by Robert Iger, who remains chief
executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson Hewitt shares closed Monday down 7 cents at $31.90
on the New York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 6 percent this
year. Shares of larger rival HR Block Inc (HRB.N) have fallen
7 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) ended three years of resistance on Monday, finally agreeing to comply with a landmark 2004 antitrust decision by the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defeated software giant announced it would not appeal against a decisive European Union court ruling two months ago that backed the bloc's executive Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The repercussions of these changes will start now and will continue for years to come," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a news conference, adding that Microsoft's agreement would have "profound effects" on the software industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a victory for the consumer," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which was fined nearly half a billion euros in 2004 and a further 280.5 million euros ($400.6 million) in 2006 for non-compliance, faced the prospect of steep new fines if it did not accommodate the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As from today Microsoft has established compliance, no doubt about that," Kroes said. "There is no reason to impose further penalties on Microsoft as of this day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft still faces fines for lack of compliance between 2006 and now, potentially reaching hundreds of millions of euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other reversals, Microsoft will make available to so-called "open source" software developers information they need to make their programs work smoothly with Microsoft's Windows operating system for personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also slashed high royalties that commercial firms would pay for that interoperability information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft suffered a major legal defeat in September when the EU's second-highest court backed the Commission on all major points, ruling the world's largest software maker abused its dominant market position to crush rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Windows runs on 95 percent of the world's personal computers. The Court of First Instance said Microsoft must give rival makers of server software information they need to connect smoothly to Windows desktop software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office desktop PCs use work group server software made by Microsoft and others to sign on to, print and access files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft drastically altered its royalty program on the interconnection information as part of its agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open source software developers, such as Samba, will be able to access and use the interoperability information and Microsoft will assert no patent rights against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial developers such as IBM or Red Hat must pay a license fee of 0.4 percent of revenues to Microsoft when they redistribute that software, to protect against patent challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is far less than the 5.95 percent Microsoft had demanded, but it was unclear whether it would meet Samba's General Public License prohibiting any royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will have to wait and see what the actual documents are," said Carlo Piana, a lawyer for Samba in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who do not need interconnnect information on which Microsoft claims patents can make a one-off payment of 10,000 euros for a license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft updates its software or adds new software that, too, will be covered by the decision. Disagreements will be settled in London's High Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its discussions with the Commission were constructive and it "will continue to work closely with the Commission and the industry to ensure a flourishing and competitive environment for information technology".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-profit European Committee of Interoperable Systems expressed satisfaction with the commission's pursuit of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As always, it is essential that the commission continues vigorously to monitor Microsoft's compliance," the organization said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new stance was signaled earlier this month, when the company withdrew from an appeal against a South Korean antitrust ruling. It had appealed to the Seoul High Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes personally negotiated with Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer in conversations and over a meal at a restaurant near her hometown of Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I paid for the dinner," she told the news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Emma Davis)&lt;/p&gt;

2004 and a further 280.5 million euros ($400.6 million) in 2006
for non-compliance, faced the prospect of steep new fines if it
did not accommodate the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As from today Microsoft has established compliance, no
doubt about that," Kroes said. "There is no reason to impose
further penalties on Microsoft as of this day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Microsoft still faces fines for lack of compliance
between 2006 and now, potentially reaching hundreds of millions
of euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among other reversals, Microsoft will make available to
so-called "open source" software developers information they
need to make their programmes work smoothly with Microsoft's
Windows operating system for personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also sliced high royalties that commercial firms
would pay for that interoperability information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft suffered a major legal defeat in September when
the EU's second-highest court backed the Commission on all major
points, ruling the world's largest software maker abused its
dominant market position to crush rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's Windows runs on 95 percent of the world's
personal computers. The Court of First Instance said Microsoft
must give rival makers of server software information they need
to connect smoothly to Windows desktop software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Office desktop PCs use work group server software made by
Microsoft and others to sign on to, print and access files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft drastically altered its royalty programme on the
interconnection information as part of its agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Open source software developers, such as Samba, will be able
to access and use the interoperability information at no cost
and Microsoft will assert no patent rights against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commercial developers such as IBM or Red Hat must pay a
licence fee of 0.4 percent of revenues to Microsoft when they
redistribute that software, to protect against patent
challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is far less than the 5.95 percent Microsoft had
demanded, but it was unclear whether it would meet Samba's
General Public License prohibiting any royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will have to wait and see what the actual documents
are," said Carlo Piana, a lawyer for Samba in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who do not need interconnnect information on which
Microsoft claims patents can make a one-off payment of 10,000
euros for a licence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Microsoft updates its software or adds new software that,
too, will be covered by the decision. Disagreements will be
settled in London's High Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said its discussions with the Commission were
constructive and it "will continue to work closely with the
Commission and the industry to ensure a flourishing and
competitive environment for information technology".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's new stance was signalled earlier this month,
when the company withdrew from an appeal against a South Korean
antitrust ruling. It had appealed to the Seoul High Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kroes personally negotiated with Microsoft Chief Executive
Steve Ballmer in conversations and over a meal at a restaurant
near her hometown of Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I paid for the dinner," she told the news conference.

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA Oct 22 (Reuters) - A Nigerian court on Monday allowed
the federal government to extend a $6.5 billion lawsuit against
U.S.-based pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer (PFE.N) to target
Nigerian drug maker Neimeth NEIM.LG as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The federal government and the northern state of Kano are
both suing Pfizer over the 1996 trial of Trovan, a new drug that
was tested on children during a meningitis epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria alleges that Pfizer was responsible for the deaths
of 11 children and permanent health problems for dozens of the
200 children involved in the Trovan trial. Neimeth was under
Pfizer's control at the time of the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer remains the first defendant, and also faces criminal
charges brought by the federal and state governments, as well as
a $2 billion compensation claim from the Kano state government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I hereby grant the order for the plaintiff to amend his
writ of summons," judge Babs Kuewumi said, adjourning the case
to Dec. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer says Trovan saved lives and the alleged victims were
affected by meningitis, not Trovan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer stands by the results of the 1996 Trovan clinical
trial and will vigorously defend it in court," spokesman Chris
Loder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trovan had been tested on 5,000 people before it was used in
Nigeria. It was licensed by the United States Food and Drug
Administration for use on adults a few months after the Kano
trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trovan briefly became one of Pfizer's top-selling drugs,
with 300,000 prescriptions per month in the United States, but
authorities imposed strict curbs on its use three years later
when it was found to cause serious liver injuries in some
patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nigerian lawsuit was first filed in the United States,
but was struck out in 2005 by a judge who said it should be
heard in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Kano state government's civil suit against Pfizer will
open on Dec. 5, while the criminal case comes up on Nov. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The attorney general of Kano state, Aliyu Umar, has said he
will lead a delegation to the United States on Nov. 17 to
explore an out-of-court settlement with Pfizer.

&lt;p&gt; By David Lawsky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Oct 22 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) ended
three years of resistance on Monday and finally agreed to comply
with a landmark 2004 antitrust decision by the European
Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The defeated software giant announced it would not appeal
against a decisive European Union court ruling two months ago
that backed the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The repercussions of these changes will start now and will

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ulf Laessing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KUWAIT Oct 22 (Reuters) - Kuwait said on Monday it had
reached a preliminary deal with Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) to
produce heavy oil in the north of the Gulf Arab state and aimed
to boost production to 900,000 barrels per day by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State owned Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) said it wanted to reach
a final deal with the U.S. company to explore the Lower Fars oil
field near the Iraqi border by July 2008 but negotiations were
still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil said the deal would be to produce 700,000
barrels per day (bpd) from the field, while KOC, which is in
charge of oil exploration in the world's seventh-largest oil
producer, added that it also wanted to explore other fields to
reach its long-term target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The agreement has several stages," said Khaled al-Sumaiti,
deputy managing director of KOC's northern oilfield operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kuwait, which sits on about 10 percent of global reserves,
aimed to produce 50,000 bpd of heavy oil by 2011 and 250,000 bpd
by 2015 as part of plans to boost its total oil output to 4
million bpd by 2020, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a tight schedule but we will work hard to reach
this goal," Sumaiti told an oil conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan faced several challenges, including a lack of
skilled workers and a problem with mines that have littered the
northern area since the 1991 Gulf War, which ended seven months
of Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NO PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL NEEDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Vierbuchen, Exxon Mobil's vice president for the
Caspian Sea and the Middle East, said the talks were about
producing 700,000 bpd from northern Kuwait but declined to
provide more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Kuwait has very ambitious heavy oil plans ... We're working
very closely together," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hashem al-Rafai, the head of Kuwait's northern oil field
exploration, dubbed Project Kuwait, said the Exxon Mobil deal
did not need approval by parliament, where several government
plans are stuck due to a standoff with deputies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't need approval for this. This is an enhanced
technical service agreement," he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kuwait has been planning a multi-billion project to explore
its northern oil fields for more than a decade but it has never
made beyond committee level at parliament as some Islamist
deputies oppose the involvement of foreign firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two years ago, Kuwait estimated the cost of the project at
$8.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Independent Kuwaiti oil analyst Karmal Harmi said the Gulf
state would not be able to reach its heavy oil targets without
the help of international firms. "We need them," he said.

&lt;p&gt;Forey, who manages the JPM Emerging Markets fund, said: "This year we have allocated money into domestic-orientated sectors related to investment in real estate, construction and materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is because we believe the engine of growth will shift towards consumption and domestic investment in the emerging markets world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forey does not believe problems in the US will have a significant impact on emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes a slowdown in the US could work as a positive, as it would keep the cost of money low in developing economies and help to expand enterprise and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forey remains confident in the wake of the credit crunch and has not made any significant changes to his investment approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "There will be relatively little direct effect, except in countries with a significant external funding gap, for example, in their current account."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forey has highlighted Turkey and parts of eastern Europe as the most obvious regions under threat from liquidity problems in markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he expects the liquidity boom in China to continue for at least the short-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is targeting firms which are not solely dependent on the liquidity cycle for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He prefers stocks with strong fundamentals over the medium to long-term. Forey is hoping the actions of central banks in emerging markets will continue to support the stockmarket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said their needs to be changes in the operating culture at these banks and stressed the importance of them working together to have a positive influence on equity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "I would like to see central banks worrying about inflation. But to take effective action, they need to work towards changing the whole policy framework, particularly in countries with closed capital accounts or more or less fixed exchange rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 36 months to the end of September Forey has returned 159 percent on his Emerging Markets fund versus an average return of 145 percent in the peer group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(c) Citywire Financial Publishers Ltd 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Daisuke Wakabayashi and Michele Gershberg &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Oct 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said its $6 billion acquisition of aQuantive will fill out its Internet advertising technology and make it as competitive as Google Inc (GOOG.O) in that market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The August purchase of the digital advertising firm positions Microsoft as one of the few companies with the money and technology know-how to be a major force in an industry expected to grow to $80 billion by 2010, said Brian McAndrews, former aQuantive CEO who is leading Microsoft's advertising efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Our goal is to have a significant amount of the revenue in the industry going through our technology, our platform," said McAndrews, who spoke to Reuters this week on the sidelines of the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco. "All parts of our business will be bigger and more profitable." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    AQuantive's Atlas technology allows advertisers and publishers to buy and sell digital advertisements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft still needs to be able to sell "contextual" advertising to target specific visitors of a Web site, but McAndrews expects that it can introduce that capability next year, providing a full suite of advertising tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    McAndrews is at the vortex of Microsoft's major push into Web advertising technology. Threatened by Google, the company is working to build a major business to be a pillar of earnings alongside its main Windows and Office software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft made its biggest-ever acquisition when it bought aQuantive and handed the keys to its advertising business to McAndrews. The executive ranked No. 11 in Business 2.0 magazine's "50 Who Matter Now," ahead of even his Microsoft bosses, who include CEO Steve Ballmer and Chairman Bill Gates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    '1 + 1 = 3' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    McAndrews, who is senior vice president at Microsoft's advertiser and publisher services group, said the benefits of the acquisition would increase over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Absolutely, one plus one equals three, but not on day one," he said. "I would say something like one plus one equals two and a quarter." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft's acquisition of aQuantive is part of a $10 billion consolidation spree in the online advertising market, centered mostly around deep-pocketed players. Google agreed to pay $3.1 billion for DoubleClick, while Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) snatched up the rest of Right Media for $680 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "There just aren't going to be very many companies that can invest the kind of money it's going to take to build these platforms and have the technology expertise," said McAndrews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For now, AQuantive's Avenue A/Razorfish interactive ad agency will remain in Microsoft. Wall Street analysts had earlier speculated the higher-margin unit, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of aQuantive's revenue, may be sold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    McAndrews explained that Avenue A had also been a key link between its advertiser clients and the part of aQuantive that specializes in ad-serving and tracking technologies. AQuantive has also profited from its technology ties with traditional ad agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Agencies are a critical part of the ecosystem," McAndrews said. "They aren't going away, they shouldn't go away and, frankly, if there is a technology company trying to disintermediate them, then I think that's a mistake." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Google has sought to extend its auction-based technology for efficiently selling Web search advertising to traditional media, from television to radio and print. While the company said it did not plan to replicate the ad agency model, many in the industry fear it might eventually offer a wider range of advertising services, including creating campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Click here to see Reuters MediaFile blog)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Lisa Von Ahn; Reuters Messaging: daisuke.wakabayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 206 652 2326)) Keywords: MICROSOFT MCANDREWS/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N),
Susquehanna International Group and two U.S. stock exchanges --
NYSE Euronext NYX.N and Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) -- are among the
parties that have expressed interest in bidding for the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange, people familiar with the matter
said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Several parties, including domestic and international
exchanges, broker-dealers and venture capital funds have been
approached and have expressed interest in PHLX, these sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the four named parties are considered top
interested bidders, the situation could change before next
week, these people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The oldest U.S. securities exchange, which is privately
owned, said in August it hired investment bank Greenhill  Co
to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale or an
initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greenhill is expected to present expressions of interest to
the Philadelphia exchange officials next week, according to
these people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No decision has been reached," one person familiar with
the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and NYSE officials declined to comment, and
officials at Nasdaq and Susquehanna were not immediately
available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Philadelphia exchange trades stocks, options and
currencies, but its recent growth has been driven by its
options business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHLX, the No. 3 U.S. options exchange with about 15 percent
of the market, has been looking for months for a potential
buyer in the consolidating financial exchanges sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, the exchange made headlines on speculation that
it was discussing a tie-up with Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYSE and Nasdaq have both said they are interested in
expanding their presence in the U.S. options business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nasdaq plans to launch its own options market in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the
International Securities Exchange Holdings Inc ISE.N hold
about 60 percent of the U.S. options market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ISE is in the process of being acquired by German
exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. exchange-wide options trading volume crossed 2 billion
contracts in September, an increase of 36.5 percent over the
same point last year, according to the Options Industry
Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This explosive growth has been driven partly by
institutional traders who have adopted options trading in their
strategies to manage risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Joseph A. Giannone)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Oct 22 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said it
would cut the Japan price of its Xbox 360 game gear by 13 percent
to 34,800 yen ($305) on Nov 1 in a bid to shore up demand for the
console struggling in a home turf of Nintendo Co Ltd 7974.OS
and Sony Corp (6758.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move follows a Sony announcement earlier this month that
it would cut the price of its PlayStation 3 game machine by 10
percent in Japan and launch a new, lower-priced model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new Xbox 360 price compares with a 39,980 yen price tag
for an upcoming PS3 model with a 40-gigabyte hard disk drive,
which will go on sale on Nov. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although popular in the United States and Europe, the Xbox
360 has been lagging behind Sony's PS3 and Nintendo Co Ltd's
7974.OS Wii in monthly sales in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first half of calendar 2007, Microsoft sold 122,565
units of the Xbox 360 in Japan, compared with 1.78 million units
of the Wii and 503,554 units of the PS3, according to game
magazine publisher Enterbrain.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 22 (Reuters) - Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc agreed to buy $400 million in Harman
International Industries (HAR.N) debt securities to settle a
dispute over a thwarted takeover of the audio equipment maker,
the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The deal is aimed at settling a legal dispute over whether
the two private equity buyers should pay a $225 million break-up
fee after they backed out of the $8 billion deal to buy Harman
last month, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the agreement, KKR and Goldman will buy $400 million
worth of convertible debt securities paying 1.25 percent
interest annually and convertible into equity should shares
reach $104 sometime over the next five years, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, KKR partner Brian Carroll will be added to the
Harman board, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The buyers backed out of the deal on Sept. 21, claiming
Harman had seen a "material adverse change" in its business,
causing the shares to fall 25 percent in one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harman subsequently forcast quarterly earnings well below
what analysts were expecting, because of higher research and
development costs and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harman objected to the pullout at the time, which valued the
company at $120 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harman shares, which closed at $112.25 on Sept. 20, slumped
25 percent after news of the deal's collapse. The shares closed
at $86.40 on Friday, down $1.18.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Proceeds of the $400 million investment will be used to
repay Harman debt, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reported deal comes amid a general pullback in merger
deals as credit markets tighten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A representative of KKR could not be reached for comment.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Tuesday 
it will not participate in an upcoming U.S. mobile phone 
airwave auction despite speculation that Web rival Google Inc 
(GOOG.O) will bid at least $4.6 billion on the wireless 
spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said the company 
was not interested in the auction for the 700-megahertz 
spectrum band because it would not advance the company's 
strategy to sell mobile phone software to handset makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What would it buy us to buy a piece of spectrum, one piece 
of spectrum in one country," said Ballmer at the CTIA wireless 
conference in San Francisco seen over the Internet. "It would 
do a lot to alienate the telecom industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The airwaves to be sold in the 700-megahertz band are 
considered prime U.S. wireless property because they can travel 
long distances and penetrate thick walls. The spectrum will be 
freed up once broadcast television networks switch to digital 
from analog in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google surprised the telecommunications industry earlier 
this year by announcing it planned to take part in the auctions 
for wireless broadband networks, bidding against established 
wireless carriers if the auction met certain requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It vowed, at that time, to spend at least $4.6 billion on 
the wireless spectrum if those conditions were met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One requirement sought by Google and other Internet 
companies and adopted by the Federal Communications Commission 
was that part of the spectrum be opened up to allow any mobile 
device, software or Web service to run on the new networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently, wireless carriers restrict the models of cell 
phones that can be used on their networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In August, Google CEO Eric Schmidt said the company was 
leaning toward bidding in the auction, even though not all of 
its requirements were met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google's participation stirred speculation that other 
Internet players would also take part in the auction, scheduled 
to begin on January 24 because it would be the last major 
opportunity for a new player to enter the wireless market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer would not address Google directly, but said 
Microsoft's expertise is not in setting up wireless networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Nobody knows what will happen out of some of our 
competitors because they are rumored to be doing a lot of 
things so we will have to wait and see," said Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft rose 38 cents to $30.89 in afternoon 
Nasdaq trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With an eye on boosting tourism to the United States, Disney is waving its magic wand and trying to put some sparkle into the often grim business of arriving as a foreigner in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co offered up its vast resources and an award-winning creative team to create "Portraits of America" -- a 7-minute film and hundreds of still pictures aimed at welcoming foreign visitors to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film, which is set to dramatic music and includes long sweeping shots of well-known U.S. landmarks, is made up mostly of images of Americans smiling at the camera. The only dialogue is when a few people say "Welcome!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be shown in federal inspection areas of U.S. airports where visitors go through immigration and also at U.S. consulates and embassies overseas. The still portraits will be used in posters and banners welcoming visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is part of a U.S. government effort to boost the number of foreign visitors coming to the country. The number of overseas travelers dropped sharply after the September 11 attacks amid tighter entry and security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Travel Industry of America, the number of travelers to the United States -- not including Canadians and Mexicans -- has dropped by 17 percent since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since one of the main causes of the 17 percent decline in overseas travel to the U.S. is the fear of the U.S. entry process, delivering a welcoming message upon travelers' arrival is long overdue," said Jonathan Tisch, chairman of the Travel Business Roundtable and chairman of Loews Hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will help change negative perceptions and lead to increased visitation to the U.S., which translates into millions of American jobs and billions of dollars for our nation's economy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys have shown that the United States gets low marks for travel friendliness. One poll from last year showed that many foreigners were anxious about the visa entry process, making the United States less attractive than other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts and industry experts say that many would-be visitors are put off by the visa process, long waits and perceptions of poor treatment by gruff immigration officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portraits of America is part of a plan by the Departments of Homeland Security and State to try to make the United States more welcoming. Disney, which has a vested interest in a strong tourist market, donated the film and pictures to the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federico Tio, a Cuban-American who came to the United States as a refugee in 1965, produced the film. He took a crew on a 14,000-mile (22,400-km) road trip zig-zagging across the country to find the faces for the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tio said they met about 500 people who were included in the film, which he said aimed to show "extraordinary aspects of seemingly ordinary people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the end, the one thing that may do the most to lure tourists to the United States has nothing to do with Disney or government efforts to improve its image -- the weakening dollar could bring in more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobile devices are acquiring the computing firepower to become crucial productivity tools for business people and management nightmares for technology administrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The IT (information technology) folks, the same as it was in the PC environment, don't want to roll out 10,000 devices. They want roll out one device 10,000 times," said Michael Gartenberg, analyst at Jupiter Research. "Microsoft is hoping to replicate the success and the model of the PC."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker will unveil software dedicated to managing devices using its Windows Mobile platform during CEO Steve Ballmer's keynote speech on Tuesday at the CTIA wireless conference in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft System Center Mobile Device Manager 2008 will allow technology administrators to send applications to phones, control security and generally simplify management of devices which are becoming more and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This positions Windows Mobile devices, which have been sold mainly through retail shops, to appeal to organizations who buy phones in bulk to distribute to their workforce. It's a market dominated by Research in Motion's BlackBerry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Enderle, industry analyst at the Enderle Group, said the market for smart phones, advanced phones with many PC-like attributes, is still evolving and many companies like Microsoft and Apple Inc. are targeting RIM's lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market for smart phones is still largely under penetrated," said Enderle, who provides advice and industry insight to Microsoft. "RIM has a number of reasons to be concerned, (and it's) not just Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has declined to comment on persistent rumors that it is interested in acquiring RIM to tap into the company's corporate customers, said reaching out to large organizations is a critical part of its goal to sell over 20 million Windows Mobile licenses in fiscal year 2008, which ends next June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a key part of accelerating our business," said Scott Horn, general manager of marketing at Microsoft's Windows Mobile business. "You're going to see (Mobile Device Manager) really ramp up in fiscal 2009 starting July 1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPETITION WITH BLACKBERRY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIM has been working for years to extend the capabilities of its BlackBerry devices beyond its trademark wireless e-mail service, offering applications that allow workers to access company data and collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantage that RIM holds over Microsoft, according to Enderle, is that RIM makes both the software and hardware. It also offers the services to help companies deploy the devices, providing a cohesive single offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it formed a partnership with a service company called Enterprise Mobile to build and deploy Windows Mobile phones customized for different organizations, working with a number of wireless carriers and handset manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New phones supporting the Mobile Device Manager software will be available in the second quarter of 2008 from Samsung Electronics, Palm Inc., Motorola Inc. and other device manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server software will be released in the first half of next year, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the average Windows Mobile smartphone now has the processing power, storage and graphics capabilities of computers from 7 or 8 years ago. They also run on more powerful networks to open up the device to new applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Wojtek Dabrowski in Toronto)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 23 (Reuters) - Wildfires raging through Southern California should not cause major losses to home insurers such as Allstate Corp (ALL.N), Nationwide NFS.N and State Farm, according to a report by Goldman Sachs analyst Thomas Cholnoky on Tuesday. More than 11 major wildfires are burning, mostly unchecked, with hundreds of thousands of residents in the San Diego and Los Angeles areas forced to evacuate as high winds fan the flames. Damages are expected to be hundreds of millions of dollars, based on previous losses. Cholnoky said that while it was too early to assess insurer losses, it appears that non-traditional companies and markets such as British-based Lloyd's might bear the brunt of the losses. Most of the more traditional writers (of home insurance) have explicitly avoided writing any exposures in 'brush' defined areas, he said in a research note. The exception could be where winds have driven fires from these outlying areas closer to San Diego, he said. Cholnoky said the average cost of homes in the area was about $500,000, meaning that every 100 homes lost would generate $50 million in insurance losses. So far, about 700 homes have been destroyed and some 250,000 people have been ordered to evacuate ahead of the flames. Seven of the 10 most expensive wildfires in U.S. history, as defined by insurance losses, have occurred in California, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a group that provides industry statistics. The largest, in Oakland and Alameda Counties in 1991, resulted in more than $2.5 billion in insured damages (in 2006 dollars).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 23 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Tuesday
said a Spanish appellate court has upheld the validity of a
patent on the company's blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol drug,
reversing an unfavorable lower court decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said the Court of Appeal of Barcelona upheld its
so-called enantiomer patent on the calcium salt of
atorvastatin, the active ingredient of Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based Pfizer said the patent, which will lapse in
July 2010, had been contested by generic drugmaker Lek
Pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said Lek's action is one of four separate challenges
to the calcium salt patent on Lipitor. The cholesterol fighter
is sold in Spain under the brand names Zarator and Cardyl.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Monday it is launching a reworked low-end version of its Xbox 360 in a bid to widen the game console's appeal to a broader audience that has flocked to rival Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS Wii.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Xbox 360 Arcade costs $280 and comes with five games previously available only for download over the Xbox Live online service. It does not have the hard drive found on more expensive Xbox models, but will have a memory card for saving progress in games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arcade, which goes on sale on Tuesday, replaces the Core model, which carried the same price but didn't include any games or memory storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we first launched the console, the goal was to initially win the core consumer," Aaron Greenberg, global product manager for Xbox 360, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we enter this holiday, it's the right time to shine a spotlight on all the great family games and content we have," Greenberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also announced two new games aimed at younger players -- one from Activision Inc (ATVI.O) based on the "Shrek" animated movies, and one from THQ THQI.O based on Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants cartoon character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The games will cost about $10 each and be sold through Xbox Live, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Xbox Live Arcade already has lots of family friendly entertainment but now we're seeing our partners developing this kind of content that won't even be available in retail," Greenberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Warner Bros will start selling episodes of its classic "Looney Toons" cartoons over Xbox Live, while Nickelodeon, a unit of Viacom VIAb.N, will sell episodes of several popular shows such as "Blue's Clues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Microsoft sold 528,000 Xbox 360 units, its best month since last December, as it was lifted by the debut of its highly anticipated game "Halo 3".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo also had its best month of the year as it sold 501,000 Wii consoles. The Wii has outsold the Xbox 360 and Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation 3 this year due to its low price point and emphasis on simple, easy-to-learn games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Camillus Eboh &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA Oct 22 (Reuters) - A Nigerian court on Monday allowed the federal government to extend a $6.5 billion lawsuit against U.S.-based pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer (PFE.N) to target Nigerian drug maker Neimeth NEIM.LG as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The federal government and the northern state of Kano are both suing Pfizer over the 1996 trial of Trovan, a new drug that was tested on children during a meningitis epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nigeria alleges that Pfizer was responsible for the deaths of 11 children and permanent health problems for dozens of the 200 children involved in the Trovan trial. Neimeth was under Pfizer's control at the time of the epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer remains the first defendant, and also faces criminal charges brought by the federal and state governments, as well as a $2 billion compensation claim from the Kano state government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I hereby grant the order for the plaintiff to amend his writ of summons," judge Babs Kuewumi said, adjourning the case to Dec. 4.    Pfizer says Trovan saved lives and the alleged victims were affected by meningitis, not Trovan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Pfizer stands by the results of the 1996 Trovan clinical trial and will vigorously defend it in court," spokesman Chris Loder said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Trovan had been tested on 5,000 people before it was used in Nigeria. It was licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use on adults a few months after the Kano trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Trovan briefly became one of Pfizer's top-selling drugs, with 300,000 prescriptions per month in the United States, but authorities imposed strict curbs on its use three years later when it was found to cause serious liver injuries in some patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Nigerian lawsuit was first filed in the United States, but was struck out in 2005 by a judge who said it should be heard in Nigeria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Kano state government's civil suit against Pfizer will open on Dec. 5, while the criminal case comes up on Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The attorney general of Kano state, Aliyu Umar, has said he will lead a delegation to the United States on Nov. 17 to explore an out-of-court settlement with Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Writing by Tume Ahemba, editing by Mette Fraende; Lagos newsroom tel: +234 1 463 0257))   Keywords: PFIZER NIGERIA/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) ended three 
years of resistance on Monday, finally agreeing to comply with 
a landmark 2004 antitrust decision by the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The defeated software giant announced it would not appeal 
against a decisive European Union court ruling two months ago 
that backed the bloc's executive Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The repercussions of these changes will start now and will 
continue for years to come," Competition Commissioner Neelie 
Kroes told a news conference, adding that Microsoft's agreement 
would have "profound effects" on the software industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a victory for the consumer," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which was fined nearly half a billion euros in 
2004 and a further 280.5 million euros ($400.6 million) in 2006 
for non-compliance, faced the prospect of steep new fines if it 
did not accommodate the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As from today Microsoft has established compliance, no 
doubt about that," Kroes said. "There is no reason to impose 
further penalties on Microsoft as of this day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Microsoft still faces fines for lack of compliance 
between 2006 and now, potentially reaching hundreds of millions 
of euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among other reversals, Microsoft will make available to 
so-called "open source" software developers information they 
need to make their programs work smoothly with Microsoft's 
Windows operating system for personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also slashed high royalties that commercial firms 
would pay for that interoperability information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft suffered a major legal defeat in September when 
the EU's second-highest court backed the Commission on all 
major points, ruling the world's largest software maker abused 
its dominant market position to crush rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's Windows runs on 95 percent of the world's 
personal computers. The Court of First Instance said Microsoft 
must give rival makers of server software information they need 
to connect smoothly to Windows desktop software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Office desktop PCs use work group server software made by 
Microsoft and others to sign on to, print and access files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft drastically altered its royalty program on the 
interconnection information as part of its agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Open source software developers, such as Samba, will be 
able to access and use the interoperability information and 
Microsoft will assert no patent rights against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commercial developers such as IBM or Red Hat must pay a 
license fee of 0.4 percent of revenues to Microsoft when they 
redistribute that software, to protect against patent 
challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is far less than the 5.95 percent Microsoft had 
demanded, but it was unclear whether it would meet Samba's 
General Public License prohibiting any royalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will have to wait and see what the actual documents 
are," said Carlo Piana, a lawyer for Samba in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who do not need interconnnect information on which 
Microsoft claims patents can make a one-off payment of 10,000 
euros for a license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Microsoft updates its software or adds new software 
that, too, will be covered by the decision. Disagreements will 
be settled in London's High Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said its discussions with the Commission were 
constructive and it "will continue to work closely with the 
Commission and the industry to ensure a flourishing and 
competitive environment for information technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The non-profit European Committee of Interoperable Systems 
expressed satisfaction with the commission's pursuit of 
Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As always, it is essential that the commission continues 
vigorously to monitor Microsoft's compliance," the organization 
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's new stance was signaled earlier this month, 
when the company withdrew from an appeal against a South Korean 
antitrust ruling. It had appealed to the Seoul High Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kroes personally negotiated with Microsoft Chief Executive 
Steve Ballmer in conversations and over a meal at a restaurant 
near her hometown of Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I paid for the dinner," she told the news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Emma Davis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A fund controlled by activist
investors Roy Disney and Stanley Gold on Monday said it has
taken a 6.59 percent stake in Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc
JTX.N, and plans to seek changes at the No. 2 U.S. tax
preparer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a regulatory filing, Shamrock Activist Value Fund LP
said it owns 1,987,400 Jackson Hewitt shares, valued as of
Monday's market close at $63.4 million, and may buy more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shamrock said the Parsippany, New Jersey-based company's
shares are undervalued in part because of "governance
deficiencies," a condition it said "impedes accountability to
the detriment of shareholder value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson Hewitt did not immediately return a call seeking
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund said Jackson Hewitt should declassify its board,
such that directors are elected annually, and eliminate an
anti-takeover defense known as a poison pill. It also said the
company should buy back more stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shamrock said it has held talks with Jackson Hewitt, and
expects to hold more. It said it was "encouraged" by the
company's decision on Oct. 9 to split up the chairman and chief
executive roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney and Gold had campaigned from late 2003 through early
2005 for the ouster of Michael Eisner as chief executive of
Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), named for Roy Disney's uncle. Eisner
was succeeded in 2005 by Robert Iger, who remains chief
executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson Hewitt shares closed Monday down 7 cents at $31.90
on the New York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 6 percent this
year. Shares of larger rival HR Block Inc (HRB.N) have fallen
7 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by

&lt;p&gt; (Updates share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Oct 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) beat
out Google Inc (GOOG.O) on Wednesday in a battle to invest in
socializing Web site Facebook, agreeing to pay $240 million for
a 1.6 percent stake in the Web phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also clinched exclusive rights to sell ads on
Facebook outside of the United States as part of the investment
that valued Facebook at $15 billion -- on par with the market
capitalizations of retailer Gap Inc (GPS.N) and hotel chain
Marriott International Inc. MAR.N&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said Microsoft paid a steep price on a bet that
the three-year-old company would be able to transform itself
into a hub for all sorts of Web activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The only way this works is if Facebook becomes sort of the
users' operating system on the Internet -- everyone logs into
Facebook every day to get in contact with their friends and use
a multitude of future applications that will be developed for
it," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook, a social network that lets friends share
information, allows outside developers to create games and
other applications for its site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The popularity and depth of knowledge Facebook has about
its users makes it valuable to companies like Microsoft and
Google which want to sell advertising targeted to individual
preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Founded in 2004 by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg,
Facebook said it registers 250,000 new users a day, 60 percent

 (Adds details from conference call, executive comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Oct 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) beat
out Google Inc (GOOG.O) on Wednesday in a battle to invest in
socializing Web site Facebook, agreeing to pay $240 million for
a 1.6 percent stake in the Web phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also clinched exclusive rights to sell ads on
Facebook outside of the United States as part of the investment
that valued Facebook at $15 billion -- on par with the market
capitalizations of retailer Gap Inc. (GPS.N) and hotel chain
Marriott International Inc. MAR.N&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said Microsoft paid a steep price on a bet that
the three-year-old company would be able to transform itself
into a hub for all sorts of Web activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The only way this works is if Facebook becomes sort of the
users' operating system on the Internet -- everyone logs into
Facebook every day to get in contact with their friends and use
a multitude of future applications that will be developed for
it," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook, a social network that lets friends share
information, allows outside developers to create games and
other applications for its site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The popularity and depth of knowledge Facebook has about
its users makes it valuable to companies like Microsoft and
Google which want to sell advertising targeted to individual
preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Founded in 2004 by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg,
Facebook said it registers 250,000 new users a day, 60 percent
of whom come from outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platform and
services division, said the $15 billion price tag for Facebook

&lt;p&gt;COPENHAGEN Oct 24 (Reuters) - A Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
executive said on Wednesday the company's Dynamics business
software held several advantages over German-based SAP's
(SAPG.DE) recently released Web-delivered product and he was
looking forward to the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We will meet them in the field. We love competing and we
are excited by the upcoming battle," Microsoft Business
Solutions head Kirill Tatarinov told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAP unveiled a long-awaited line of Web-delivered software
last month named Business ByDesign, changing its business model
with a one-size-fits-all, subscription-based package aimed at
mid-sized companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAP, the leader in the market for complex software suites
for large companies, wants to more than double its customer
base to 100,000 by 2010 by offering hosted business services
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tatarinov said Dynamics' core asset was it simplicity and
ease of use, areas where he said Microsoft has invested
heavily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many mid-sized companies already used the Microsoft
infrastructure on which Dynamics is based, he said, and the
company's broader software platform was an important advantage
over SAP's products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are many organisations that may not use Dynamics
just yet, but many are already using the infrastructure that
Dynamics is built on," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tatarinov said recent deals among makers of business
intelligence software -- such as SAP's recent 4.8 billion euro
($6.83 billion) bid to buy Business Objects BOBJ.PA--
generally had not altered the market outlook from Microsoft's
perspective and underlined that software acquisitions were
notoriously difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On the one hand the purchaser...basically signals to the
marketplace that they couldn't do it themselves, that they had
to go after someone else to help them and it also signals from
the seller that they don't see a whole lot of future being a
stand-alone going concern," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft last quarter started rolling out Microsoft
Dynamics Live CRM, the first Web-delivered version of its
customer-relationship management software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tatarinov said early customer adoption of Live CRM was
going according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's going very well. We're staying the course. I would
say from talking to the CRM team they're on track," he said.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds byline, further detail, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N)
said on Wednesday it promoted 299 bankers, traders and other
executives to its managing director ranks, with a greater
percentage now working outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The promotions are effective Dec. 1, the start of Goldman's
2008 fiscal year. With the new additions, Goldman will have
1,767 managing directors worldwide, out of a total 29,905
employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A breakdown of the new class shows how Goldman's business
is increasingly sourced outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some 43 percent of the new managing directors work in the
U.S. and the Americas; 30 percent are in Europe, the Middle
East and Africa; 10 percent work in Japan and the remaining 17
percent are in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, 57 percent of the new managing directors are
outside the United States, compared with 49 percent last year.
"It illustrates the global nature of our business," spokesman
Andrea Rachman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month Goldman reported that 53 percent of its third
quarter revenue came from outside the United States, up from 52
percent in the second quarter and 51 percent in the first
period. And executives at the bank say they expect overseas
markets to grow at a faster pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to break down the new class by business
area, except to say that the largest single component came from
investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which in September reported a 79 percent profit
increase in the third quarter for its second-best quarter ever,
set aside $16.9 billion for salaries and bonuses for the first
nine months of 2007, exceeding the $16.5 billion set aside for
all of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That indicates Goldman executives -- especially its
managing directors and partners -- can expect bigger bonuses
this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To see the Goldman news release and a list of the 299 new

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 24 (Reuters) - Online social network Facebook
is close to reaching a deal with Google Inc (GOOG.O) or
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) for an investment that would value the
company as high as $15 billion, according to media reports on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Facebook deal would include an agreement with the

Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representatives from Facebook, Google and Microsoft were
not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Web search leader Google and software maker Microsoft, now
rivals for Internet-based audiences and applications, have each
expressed interest in a minority stake in Facebook for its
fast-growing user base and unmined advertising potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Executives from both companies traveled to Facebook's
headquarters in Palo Alto this week, and a decision could come
as early as Wednesday, the Journal reported. Earlier in the
day, the New York Post said a decision on the Facebook
investment could be announced within 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and Google are each vying for a stake of 5
percent to 10 percent in the social-networking site that could
cost between $750 million and $1.5 billion, the Post reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Google is victorious it is likely to try to unwind
Microsoft's existing ad deal with Facebook, according to the
Post. If Microsoft wins, it will likely look to expand that
agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has
said his company wants to remain independent and is seen as
preparing for an eventual public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook opened its doors to users beyond an original base
of college students beginning one year ago. Since then, its
user base has grown to more than 47 million, becoming a strong
rival to leading social network MySpace NWSa.N with 110
million users.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble (PG.N) hiked listed coffee prices for some of its Folgers Coffee blends effective October 23 due to higher prices for both arabica and robusta beans, a company spokesman said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PG, the largest U.S. roaster, raised Folgers Ground by 10 cents or 4 percent per 10.5 to 13 ounce package equivalent, said Bryan Brown. One New Jersey grocery store gave its retail price for the product at $3.69 a lb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increases ranging from six to eight percent were also made for Folgers Instant, Cappuccino, Singles and Home Cafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No change in the gourmet side of the business, Millstone Coffee or the Dunkin' Donuts retail coffee," Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected brands use both arabica and robusta coffee beans, with the exception of Folgers Instant, which uses only robusta. Robusta beans are typically used to make instant coffee or are blended with ground arabica beans to make a less expensive brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The list price of Folgers products reflects the price of green coffee sold on the commodity market and when green coffee market changes are significant and sustained, as in the case this time, we generally adjust our list prices," Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company made its decision based on the 30-day moving average of both types of beans, as of Monday, Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee futures, which trade on ICE Futures U.S., soared to a near eight-year high at $1.4080 per lb on October 12 in a sustained rally based on concern about severely dry weather in the world's top grower Brazil. Prices then fell to one-month lows as rains fell on the coffee belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same day on London's LIFFE market, the spot-month November robusta contract LKDX7 soared to a contract high of $2,234 per tonne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, ICE's key December arabica futures contract KCZ7 closed up 0.30 cent at $1.2385 a lb while LIFFE's most-active January robusta contract LKDF8 finished up $3 at $1,775 a tonne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG most recently increased prices on some Folgers blends in early January due to the steady rise in green arabica bean prices, and in October 2006 due to higher robusta prices. The price hikes were quickly followed by other major U.S. roasters like Chock full o'Nuts and Maxwell House.&lt;/p&gt;

swings in top line performance around peak and trough periods
seem stable to worsening, not moderating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Calyon Securities' Ray Neidl cut his price target on

competes with more efficient network carriers and aggressive
low-cost carriers.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it had formally withdrawn two remaining appeals before the European Union's Court of First Instance against European Commission antitrust decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the company had dropped appeals against a separate Court of First Instance decision. That decision, announced in December, backed the Commission's 2004 antitrust ruling against the software company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft formally discontinued its appeal" seeking to annul a 280.5 million euro ($399 million) fine imposed by the Commission for non-compliance with a remedy, it said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That remedy, part of the 2004 decision, had required the company to provide some software information to rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also on Wednesday dropped an appeal against a Commission decision that the company said required it to license trade secrets on an open source basis. That, too, grew out of the 2004 ruling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Investors will be looking for signs from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) of a strong holiday quarter for Xbox 360 video game consoles and new computers loaded with Windows Vista when the company reports results this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker posts quarterly results on Thursday and investors expect the company to get a boost from the continued adoption of new versions of Windows and Office as well as a solid performance at its video game unit thanks to the release of the blockbuster game title, "Halo 3."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares are up 8 percent over the last month -- outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and SP 500 indices -- and 25 of 34 analysts covering the company have a positive rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its fiscal first quarter ended in September, analysts, on average, forecast Microsoft to earn 39 cents a share on revenue of $12.57 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are more optimistic on Microsoft's big business -- Windows -- because of recent PC numbers," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market research firms Gartner and IDC said last week that worldwide personal computer shipments grew 14.4 percent and 15.5 percent, respectively, in the July-to-September quarter from a year earlier, signaling healthy PC demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading chip maker Intel Corp. (INTC.O) also delivered a bullish outlook for PC sales in the current quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That bodes well for Microsoft's mainstay Windows and Office businesses, which account for more than half of the company's revenue and nearly all of its profit. It released new versions of Windows and the Office productivity suite earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also quells some concerns about poor adoption of Windows Vista, which were fanned when the company said it would delay a scheduled transition to the new operating system and keep selling Windows XP until June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts are expecting next year's release of Microsoft's first major update of Windows Vista, known as Service Pack 1, to spur corporate customers to upgrade operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would love to see some more demand on the business side as opposed to the consumer side, because it shows that businesses are still spending but also the margins are better," said Kim Caughey, a senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which oversees more than $1 billion, including Microsoft shares, for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HALO" EFFECT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's entertainment and devices division is looking to make its first annual profit after six straight years of losses, and its December quarter generates twice more revenue than any other quarter of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the outlook seems rosy. "Halo 3," the latest installment of Microsoft's flagship shooter game franchise, has topped $300 million in sales since its release on September 25 for a game that Morningstar's Tran estimates cost $25 million to make and $10 million to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers also purchased Xbox 360 consoles to play the highly anticipated "Halo 3." U.S. Xbox 360 sales topped rival game machines like Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974.OS Wii and Sony Corp.'s (6758.T) PlayStation 3 in September, according to market research firm NPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think I've heard a negative thing about 'Halo 3,' but the question I have is whether it's going to be sustainable for Christmas or if this was a one-time boost," said Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts are forecasting Microsoft's fiscal second quarter to come in at 44 cents a share, an increase of nearly 70 percent from a year ago, according to Reuters Estimates. Wall Street is also calling for a 24 percent rise in second-quarter revenue to $15.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's online services group, which has lost money for four straight quarters, could get a revenue lift from six weeks of sales from aQuantive, the digital advertising company that Microsoft bought for a record $6 billion in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AQuantive, the company's largest-ever acquisition, is Microsoft's biggest commitment to building an online advertising powerhouse to compete with Web rivals Google Inc. (GOOG.O) and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded medical-device

while raising pharmaceutical company Abbott Laboratories
(ABT.N) to "buy" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it continues to see upside in Boston
Scientific shares but, with catalysts not likely for several
quarters, it sees better near-term upside in Abbott shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman believes the risk of a delay in the U.S. regulatory
clearance of the Xience stent has been largely discounted in
Abbott shares. The brokerage raised its price target on
Abbott's stock to $61 from $57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price target on Boston's stock was cut to $16.50 from
$18. Goldman said with the restructuring announced and outlook
provided for 2008 and 2009, the company's shares may be
range-bound until there are new products launched in the second
half of 2008.

steady rise in green arabica bean prices. The move was quickly followed by
other major U.S. roasters.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 23 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Tuesday said a Spanish appellate court has upheld the validity of a patent on the company's blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol drug, reversing an unfavorable lower court decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said the Court of Appeal of Barcelona upheld its so-called enantiomer patent on the calcium salt of atorvastatin, the active ingredient of Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    New York-based Pfizer said the patent, which will lapse in July 2010, had been contested by generic drugmaker Lek Pharmaceuticals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said Lek's action is one of four separate challenges to the calcium salt patent on Lipitor.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments from Microsoft executive)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Oct 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has made
progress in getting its Windows software to work on a low-cost
laptop computer for poor children that currently runs on rival
Linux software, an executive said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company is now working to
adapt a basic version of Windows XP so it is compatible with
the nonprofit One Laptop per Child Foundation's small
green-and-white XO laptop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're spending a nontrivial amount of money on it,"
Microsoft Corporate Vice President Will Poole said in an
interview on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We remain hopeful with our progress to date, we still have
significant work ahead to finalize our analysis and testing
processes," he said. "At the end of the day, there's no
guarantees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The One Laptop per Child Foundation, a spin-off from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, plans to start producing
the $188 machines in China next month and eventually
manufacture millions a year for elementary school children in
developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The foundation is also selling the machines in the United
States and Canada for $400 apiece through a fund-raisingcampaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The laptops were designed specifically to run Linux
programs. If the machines run only Linux, Microsoft will lose
an opportunity to expose tens of millions of children worldwide
to its Windows system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  If the foundation is able to meet its goal of producing
millions of laptops for school children around the world and
they are all loaded with Linux software, then they would end up
being more comfortable with those programs than with Windows,
said Wayan Vota, who publishes a blog that monitors the
project. (olpcnews.com/).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People will realize there is an alternative to Windows and
they might like it better," Vota said."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the new laptop uses some technologies developed by the
foundation that haven't previously been used in personal
computers, Poole said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We still have plenty of work to do in determining if the
highly constrained performance, power, and memory in the first
generation XO laptops will be compatible with Windows and
popular Windows applications," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Originally dubbed the $100 laptop, which is the group's
target price for the machine, the XO features a string pulley
to charge its battery, a keyboard that switches between
languages, a digital video camera and wireless connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The laptop's designer, Mary Lou Jepsen, said in an
interview earlier this month she expects the price to drop in
the first quarter of next year because prices of memory tend to
fall dramatically during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The computer requires just 2 watts of power compared with
the typical laptop's 30 to 40 watts and does away with hard
drives, relying instead on flash memory and four USB ports to
add memory devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The XO laptop's component makers include Advanced Micro
Devices Inc (AMD.N) and Marvell Technology Group Ltd (MRVL.O).
Software maker Red Hat Inc (RHT.N) helped develop the device.
Quanta Computer Inc (2382.TW) will manufacture it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The foundation will start taking orders for its Give 1 Get
1 campaign on Nov. 12 at www.laptopgiving.org.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds operating margin forecasts, valuations, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Oct 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) lifted
its full-year forecasts and posted 23 percent quarterly profit
growth on Thursday, topping analysts' estimates on strong sales
of "Halo 3" and Vista, and sending its shares up 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software maker raised full-year revenue
targets across its business divisions and gave a bullish profit
forecast for the crucial, current holiday quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors have waited for sales of the new Windows Vista
operating system to pick up since its January release. Windows,
which sits on more than 90 percent of all personal computers,
generates almost 80 cents in profit for every dollar in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The growth of Windows Vista has finally occurred," said
Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Halo 3," the latest installment of Microsoft's flagship
shooter franchise video game, also racked up more than $300
million in its first week of sales in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft beat even Wall Street's most bullish forecast
with a net profit of $4.29 billion, or 45 cents per diluted
share, in its fiscal first quarter, up from $3.48 billion, or
35 cents per diluted share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose 27 percent to $13.76 billion in the three
months ended Sept. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The highest analyst profit forecast had been 40 cents per
share, with revenue on average seen at $12.54 billion,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It looks like they're firing on all cylinders," said Toan
Tran, analyst at Morningstar. "Windows, Office  ... all grew by
20 percent and they're the big hitters for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares, already up 10 percent in the last month,
surged to $35.40 in after-hours trade, up 10.7 percent from the
close and their highest since 2001. Its market capitalization
grew by more than $30 billion and its top shareholder,
co-founder Bill Gates, saw his fortune grow by $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft raised its full-year revenue outlook for its
Windows client sales to a range of 12 percent to 13 percent
versus a previous forecast of 9 percent to 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Market research firms Gartner and IDC had said global PC
shipments rose about 15 percent in the September quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue at the Windows client division, focused on PCs,
rose nearly 25 percent in the quarter. Operating profit at the
segment went up 27 percent to $3.37 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumers also bought Xbox 360 consoles to play "Halo 3,"
vaulting Microsoft's game machine past rivals in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The entertainment and devices division, after six straight
annual losses, delivered 91 percent revenue growth and swung to
a $165 million profit from a $142 million loss a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOOKING AHEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft raised full-year earnings estimates to a range of
$1.78 to $1.81 per share from a previous range of $1.69 to
$1.73. It also raised its full-year revenue estimate range by
almost $2 billion, to $58.8 billion to $59.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street analysts, on average, were forecasting fiscal
2008 earnings of $1.73 per share on revenue of $57.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft is never going to be aggressive on guidance.
Even from a conservative perspective, it looks to be a pretty
positive forward view," said Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio
manager at Jensen Portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those figures also include a $85 million impact, or 1 cent
per diluted share, from costs and expenses related to its $6
billion acquisition of digital advertising firm aQuantive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the current quarter, Microsoft forecast earnings of 44
cents to 46 cents per diluted share on revenue of $15.6 billion
to $16.1 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings
per share of 44 cents a share on revenue of $15.5 billion in
the fiscal second quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft forecast second-quarter operating profit margin
would fall to about 38 percent from 43 percent in the September
quarter, due in part to sales of Xbox 360 consoles, which it
sells at a loss in order to drive sales of high-margin games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The current holiday quarter is a crucial one for Microsoft
as it aims to spur adoption of new computers running Vista. Its
entertainment arm also banks on the December quarter generating
twice as much revenue as any other quarter of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's online services group lost money for a
fifth-straight quarter despite a 25 percent rise in revenue
from a year earlier, helped by an $80 million revenue boost
from aQuantive, which became part of Microsoft in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's Office business posted a 20 percent increase in
revenue to $4.11 billion and profit rose 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prior to its earnings, Microsoft shares traded at 18 times
analysts' estimated fiscal 2008 earnings, compared with a 17
ratio for rival software maker Oracle Corp ORCL.O. Web rival
Google Inc (GOOG.O) trades at 32 times 2008 profit estimates,
while International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) was at 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando in New York and Lisa

&lt;p&gt; (Adds age of Shedlarz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 25 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on
Thursday that David Shedlarz would retire as Vice Chairman by
the end of the year, after three decades with the company that

roles before being named chief financial officer in 1995, a
position he held for a decade. He was promoted to vice chairman
in 2005, after also having managed the company's former medical
technology group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During his long tenure as CFO, Shedlarz garnered respect as
one of the company's more personable senior executives and for
his role in building Pfizer into the world's biggest
drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's size and importance mushroomed with a huge
deal engineered by Shedlarz in June 2000, the purchase for $114
billion of Warner-Lambert Corp. The transaction gave Pfizer
full control of a cholesterol fighter named Lipitor which they
had sold together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shedlarz' crowning glory came in April 2003, when Pfizer
completed its $60 billion acquisition of another U.S. rival,
Pharmacia Corp. The deal widened Pfizer's lead as the world's
largest drugmaker -- with 11 percent of the global market for
prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also gave Pfizer full ownership of arthritis blockbuster
Celebrex, which the two companies had co-marketed, as well as
other popular Pharmacia medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helped by huge cost savings and job cuts from the two
deals, Pfizer led the industry in earnings growth for several
years. But its profit growth and share price then steadily
declined as the company's laboratories -- even with an annual
research budget that now exceeds $7 billion -- failed to come
up with blockbusters needed to replace drugs going off patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's current stock price stands 22 percent lower
than it was at the time of the Pharmacia merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shedlarz' planned departure is the latest development in a
continuing shake-up in Pfizer's corporate suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had been in the running to replace Hank McKinnell as
chief executive of Pfizer. But the top job was awarded instead
to company general counsel Jeffrey Kindler in July 2006 when
McKinnell was ousted after a dearth of new medicines sent
Pfizer shares to multi-year lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Karen Katen, another vice chairman, had been the other
major contender for McKinnell's job. She retired only months
after being passed over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Shedlarz stayed aboard, agreeing to oversee
manufacturing operations and strategic planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer in May said Chief Financial Officer Alan Levin had
resigned and that the company's global president of research,
John LaMattina, would leave his post after 30 years with the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In August, Pfizer named an industry outsider, Alcatel-
Lucent executive Frank D'Amelio, as its new CFO. Earlier this
month, it picked Martin Mackay, Pfizer's second-ranking
research executive, to replace LaMattina.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) lifted its full-year estimates and posted a 23 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, topping investor expectations on strong demand for "Halo 3" and Windows Vista, and sending its shares up 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker raised full-year revenue forecasts across its business units and gave a bullish profit forecast for the current quarter, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have waited for sales of Microsoft's new Vista operating system to pick up since it was released in January. Windows, which sits on more than 90 percent of computers, generates almost 80 cents in profit for every dollar in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The growth of Windows Vista has finally occurred," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's "Halo 3," the latest installment of its flagship shooter franchise video game, also racked up more than $300 million in its first week of sales in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the just-reported fiscal first quarter, Microsoft beat even Wall Street's most bullish forecast with a net profit of $4.29 billion, or 45 cents per diluted share, up from $3.48 billion, or 35 cents per diluted share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 27 percent to $13.76 billion in the three months ended September 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, had forecast 39 cents per share in profit with estimates ranging from 38 cents to 40 cents per share on revenue of $12.54 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like it was a blowout quarter," said Toan Tran, analyst at Morningstar. "It looks like they're firing on all cylinders. Windows, Office ... all grew by 20 percent and they're the big hitters for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft, already up 10 percent in the last month, surged another 11.4 percent to $35.63 in after-hours trade from their Nasdaq close of $31.99. The market capitalization of Microsoft increased by about $35 billion and its largest shareholder, co-founder Bill Gates, saw his fortune grow by $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft raised its full-year revenue outlook for all of its five business segments including its Windows client sales to a range of between 12 percent to 13 percent versus its previous forecast of 9 percent to 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market research firms Gartner and IDC said global personal computer shipments rose about 15 percent in the September quarter, which helped Microsoft as well as the quarterly results of chip maker Intel Corp (INTC.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue at Microsoft's Windows client division, focused on PCs, rose nearly 25 percent in its fiscal first quarter. Operating profit at the segment went up 27 percent to $3.37 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers also bought Xbox 360 consoles to play "Halo 3", vaulting Microsoft's game machine past rivals in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entertainment and devices division, which has posted six straight annual losses, delivered a 91 percent rise in revenue and the segment swung to profit of $165 million from a loss of $142 million a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOOKING AHEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft raised full-year earnings estimates to a range of $1.78 to $1.81 per share from a previous range of $1.69 to $1.73. It also raised its full-year revenue estimate range by almost $2 billion, to $58.8 billion to $59.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts, on average, were forecasting fiscal 2008 earnings of $1.73 per share on revenue of $57.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is never going to be aggressive on guidance. Even from a conservative perspective, it looks to be a pretty positive forward view," said Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio manager at Jensen Portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those figures also include a $85 million impact, or 1 cent per diluted share, from costs and expenses related to its $6 billion acquisition of digital advertising firm aQuantive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current quarter, Microsoft forecast earnings in a range of 44 cents to 46 cents per diluted share on revenue of $15.6 billion to $16.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, were forecasting earnings per share of 44 cents a share on revenue of $15.5 billion in Microsoft's fiscal second quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The holiday quarter is a crucial one for Microsoft as it aims to spur adoption of new computers running its latest Windows Vista operating system. Its entertainment arm also counts on the December quarter generating twice as much revenue as any other quarter of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's online services group lost money for a fifth-straight quarter despite a 25 percent rise in revenue from a year earlier helped by an $80 million revenue boost from aQuantive, which became part of Microsoft in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Office business posted a 20 percent increase in revenue to $4.11 billion and profit rose 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando in New York and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds new details throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Erman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 25 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on
Thursday delayed its multibillion dollar Tahiti project in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico by about a year due to defective
shackles in the facility's mooring system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it now expects first production from
Tahiti by the third quarter of 2009. The project had been
scheduled to come online sometime in mid-2008 with an estimated
production of 125,000 barrels per day, making it one of the
largest in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron spokesman Mickey Driver said it was safe to assume
the delay would significantly affect the costs of the Tahiti
project, previously estimated to be around $3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron announced the shackle problem in June, after a
contractor discovered the issue on a similar installation for
another company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shackles connect components of the mooring line and
help anchor the floating production facility to the sea floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's development problems were not a surprise in the
market, especially after the company warned the project had
troubles earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's going to have a material impact on non-OPEC supply
and it's going to have a material impact on Chevron Corp," said
Paul Sankey, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil and gas production costs have surged along with soaring
oil prices on high demand for steel, drilling rigs and other
material used in production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron spokesman Driver said new shackles had to be
remanufactured for the project, anchor tiles and mooring chains
had to be replaced, and Chevron had to reschedule marine
installation equipment -- all factors that contributed to the
delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The delay is going to cost more money, but we haven't
determined that amount of money yet," Driver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is the operator of the Tahiti project with 58
percent working interest. Norway's StatoilHydro  (STL.OL) holds
a 25 percent stake and France's Total  (TOTF.PA) has a 17
percent interest.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to show Microsoft shares climbing 11 percent after
the bell, adds latest volume figures)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Kristina Cooke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday
after disappointing results from Comcast (CMCSA.O) and engine
maker Cummins (CMI.N) fed worries about corporate profits,
while fears of more credit losses hit financial shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Economic reports on housing, manufacturing and employment
painted a picture of a weakening economy, adding to the sour
mood, as did a surge in oil prices to another record above $90
a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American International Group Inc (AIG.N) led financial
stocks lower on market rumors that the insurer may be facing a
large securities write-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But AIG's stock retraced the bulk of its losses after CNBC
reported that the rumors were "simply not true," helping the
Dow and the SP claw back some of their losses late in the
session, as did a 2.4 percent rise in Microsoft MSFT.0 ahead
of its earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rumors came a day after Merrill Lynch MER.N
announced $7.9 billion of credit write-downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Concerns over subprime issues are continuing to bang
around out there, and you've seen earnings which have been
coming in mixed, so that is weighing on investor sentiment,"
said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager at the Swarthmore Group,
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There were rumors AIG may take a big write-down. Given
what Merrill said yesterday about the size of the write-down,
people are nervous and you are going to have these rumors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 3.33
points, or 0.02 percent, to end at 13,671.92. The Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX was down 1.48 points, or 0.10 percent,
at 1,514.40. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 23.90
points, or 0.86 percent, at 2,750.86.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Right after the closing bell, Microsoft reported earnings
that exceeded expectations and provided a strong outlook,
driving its stock up another 11 percent in extended trade to
$35.55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FINANCIALS AND TECHS FALL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the regular session, AIG's stock ended down 3.2 percent
at $61.79. Merrill's stock lost 3.7 percent to $60.90 on the
New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable TV operator, posted a
54 percent drop in quarterly net profit. Comcast also lost
more basic video subscribers than analysts had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Comcast fell 10.8 percent to $21.28 on the
Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another drag on the Nasdaq was software maker Symantec
Corp (SYMC.O), which gave a weak profit outlook, sending its
shares down 12 percent to $18.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cummins Inc, which makes diesel engines and power
generators, reported a third-quarter profit that rose but
still missed estimates, sending its shares down in their
biggest one-day percentage decline in nine years. Cummins
shares lost 16.6 percent to $111.56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a tough day for mortgage insurers, too. MBIA Inc
(MBI.N), the world's largest bond insurer, dropped 14.9
percent to $46.99 after it posted a third-quarter loss. Shares
of Ambac Financial Group ABK.N tumbled 13.8 percent to
$43.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of new U.S. homes were unexpectedly weak last month,
although they climbed off an 11-year low, and orders for
durable goods fell, according to data on Thursday that
underscored the economy's weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A third report showed the number of Americans filing an
initial claim for unemployment aid edged down last week, but
stayed at a level suggesting some softening in the job market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A bright spot was EMC Corp (EMC.N), the top maker of
corporate data storage equipment, which reported a 74 percent
rise in quarterly profit and doubled its stock-buyback program
to $2 billion. Its stock shot up 8.5 percent to $24.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was fairly active on the NYSE, with about 1.62
billion shares changing hands, short of last year's estimated
daily average of 1.84 billion, while on the Nasdaq, about 2.79
billion shares traded, exceeding last year's daily average of
2.02 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of
about 17 to 16 on the NYSE and by 17 to 12 on the Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft's (MSFT.O) compliance with a landmark European Union antitrust decision has opened competition for servers, where one rival says it now has a fighting chance to take on the software giant's dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open-source, non-profit Samba software group says it won some things but not everything it wanted this week, when Microsoft said it would stop fighting the EU's 2004 antitrust decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a major change of direction, Microsoft agreed to provide rivals with vital interconnection information, one month after the EU's second-highest court backed the Commission's decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the deal leaves the playing field uneven, Samba says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is still contested ground to win," said Eban Moglen, a Columbia University law professor who also heads the Software Freedom Law Center, which backs the free software movement and represents Samba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ground is in most offices around the world in computers called servers which run printers, allow desktop PCs to access shared files and act as the cockpit of the entire network, coordinating resources and providing personalized access, user by user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samba servers can handle printing and files access but they lack the ability to work as a cockpit, something that can be done today only by Microsoft's software called Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samba says its own approach is a decade old, which means ancient history in the world of software. Its aim is to provide a free, full-service server software to go head-to-head with Microsoft in the multi-billion dollar market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do that, it needs interconnection information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Samba's engineers can develop its products, which dovetail with the commercial world. Companies like Red Hat (RHT.N), Canonical and Oracle ORCL.O and others make money by selling service and installation with Samba's free products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PIONEER SIDETRACKED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severs were originally pioneered for PCs by Novell NOVL.O, which got its interconnect information from Microsoft.

&lt;p&gt;As part of the decision, which won backing last month from the second-highest EU court, Microsoft will ease the way for competition by rivals against its work group servers, which provide printing, file and controls for small business groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release interconnection information -- called protocols -- which rival servers need in order to work smoothly with Microsoft Windows desktops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main competitor is the open-source, non-profit Samba Group, which makes software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samba seeks to work around Microsoft patents protecting its protocols so no royalties will be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will post to its Web site in coming days a list of protocols on which it claims patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It provided this summary of patents on the 106 protocols which will be released:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing U.S. patents: 32, covering 21 protocols&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing European patents: Four, covering four protocols&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total existing patents: 36, covering 25 protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proposed U.S. patents: 54, covering 28 protocols&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proposed European patents: Ten, covering 10 protocols&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total proposed patents: 64, covering 38 protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total proposed and existing patents: 100, covering 63 protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds company and analyst comments, details, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 25 (Reuters) - Transport for London (TfL) said
on Thursday IBM (IBM.N) would administer the capital's
congestion charge from 2009, beating two other bidders,
including current provider Capita Group Plc (CPI.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IBM's submission to operate the London Congestion Charging
scheme has been selected as it best meets TfL's operational and
technical requirements," TfL said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain's biggest back-office company, Capita, was the
biggest FTSE .FTSE loser in a strong broader market as its
shares fell as much as 10.5 percent in strong volume after the
company lost the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are disappointed not to have delivered the next stage of
congestion charging for TfL," Capita, which generates around 56
million pounds ($115 million) in revenue a year from the
contract, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cazenove analysts estimated the firm would have made
revenues of 60 million pounds in 2009 from the contract, which
would have translated to a profit of 10 million pounds, or 3
percent of forecast pretax profit for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TfL said IBM would also administer the low emission zone,
which begins in February 2008. It aims to deter high polluting
vehicles being driven in London by imposing charges on
diesel-engined lorries, coaches, buses, vans and minibuses that
do not meet the standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The third bidder was the Thales Alliance, made up of Thales
Information Systems Ltd, Accenture (ACN.N) and Vertex Data
Science Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 1200 GMT, shares in Capita were down 4.6 percent at 707
pence with 15.5 million shares traded compared with average full
day volume of 4.2 million shares traded over the past 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TfL oversees London's public transport network as well as
administering the congestion charge that spreads from Earl's
Court in the west to Whitechapel in the east.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Oct 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft's (MSFT.O) compliance
with a landmark European Union antitrust decision has opened
competition for servers, where one rival says it now has a
fighting chance to take on the software giant's dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The open-source, non-profit Samba software group says it won
some things but not everything it wanted this week, when
Microsoft said it would stop fighting against the EU's 2004
antitrust decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a major change of direction, Microsoft agreed to provide
competitors with vital interconection information, one month
after the EU's second-highest court backed the Commission's
decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the deal leaves the playing field uneven, Samba says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is still contested ground to win," said Eban Moglen,
a Columbia University law professor who also heads the Software
Freedom Law Center, which backs the free software movement and
represents Samba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That ground is in most offices around the world, where "work
group servers" connect to desktop PCs and run printers, access
files and act as the cockpit of the entire network, coordinating
resources and providing personalised access, user by user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samba can print and access files but it lacks the ability to
work as a cockpit, something that can be done today only by
Microsoft's Active Directory. Samba says its own approach is a
decade old, ancient history in the world of software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Samba's aim is to provide a free, full-service product to 
go head-to-head with Microsoft in the multi-billion dollar
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To do that, it needs interconnection information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Samba's engineers can develop its products, which
dovetail with the commercial world. Companies like Red Hat
(RHT.N), Canonical and Oracle ORCL.O and others make money by
selling service and installation with Samba's free products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PIONEER SIDETRACKED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Severs were originally pioneered for PCs by Novell NOVL.O,
which got its interconnect information from Microsoft. Once
Microsoft entered the server field it stopped giving full
information and rival products stopped working smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft captured the lion's share of the market, wiping
out profits of commercial rivals, the Commission and then the EU
court found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samba is a non-profit organisation so a lack of profits
could not kill it, making it the last real competitor standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This week's deal allows everyone to get full interconnection
information from Microsoft for 10,000 euros ($14,220).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who resell products making use of the information can
choose to pay a royalty of 0.4 percent of turnover to forestall
lawsuits on patents claimed by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Samba's General Public Licence and free software
principles require it to be free, without royalty-bearing
patents, said Carlo Piana, a lawyer for Samba in Milan, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first step in that direction is to get a definitive list
of Microsoft's patent claims, which has not happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Until we have it we cannot say anything because we just
don't know", said Volker Lendecke, a software developer for
Samba in Goettingen, Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even then the path may be uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Can we invalidate or render harmless the patents which we

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp beat out Google Inc on Wednesday in a battle to invest in socializing Web site Facebook, agreeing to pay $240 million for a 1.6 percent stake in the Web phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also clinched exclusive rights to sell ads on Facebook outside of the United States as part of the investment that valued Facebook at $15 billion -- on par with the market capitalizations of retailer Gap Inc and hotel chain Marriott International Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said Microsoft paid a steep price on a bet that the three-year-old company would be able to transform itself into a hub for all sorts of Web activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only way this works is if Facebook becomes sort of the users' operating system on the Internet -- everyone logs into Facebook every day to get in contact with their friends and use a multitude of future applications that will be developed for it," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook, a social network that lets friends share information, allows outside developers to create games and other applications for its site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popularity and depth of knowledge Facebook has about its users makes it valuable to companies like Microsoft and Google which want to sell advertising targeted to individual preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2004 by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook said it registers 250,000 new users a day, 60 percent of whom come from outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platform and services division, said the $15 billion price tag for Facebook is based on Microsoft's belief that the site could eventually reach 300 million users, who can be targeted for advertising. It has nearly 50 million today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You combine the number of users with the monetization opportunities and you can figure out a fairly modest average revenue per user per year and you can very quickly get to this level of valuation," Johnson said in a conference call with analysts and reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has stepped up efforts to be a player in the $40 billion market for online advertising, which the company expects to double in size within three years. It paid $6 billion to acquire digital advertising firm aQuantive in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the Facebook deal, Microsoft would be the exclusive third-party advertising platform for Facebook extending a previous deal for Microsoft to sell banner advertising next to Facebook member profiles in the U.S. until 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE VS. MICROSOFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft, now rivals for Internet-based audiences and applications, have butted heads before for Internet properties. Google beat Microsoft with a $1.65 billion acquisition of online video sharing site YouTube last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrester Research analyst Charlene Li said that Microsoft was a better strategic fit for Facebook, since it knew how to work with software developers and build computing environments -- such as its Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is a company that knows how to build platforms, knows how to develop relationships with developers. Microsoft developed the network that is the biggest, most vibrant one out there," she said. "Google didn't bring as much to the deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook opened its doors to users beyond an original base of college students a year ago. It also opened the doors to outside developers and there are tens of thousands of developers writing Facebook applications, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was one of many suitors looking to participate in its latest round of financing, said Facebook Vice President Owen Van Natta. The funds will go toward doubling the company's staff over the next year and other growth initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Co-founder Sergey Brin told a meeting with Wall Street analysts at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters that his company could partner with important Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't feel, at a higher level, that we need to own every successful company on the Internet," said Brin, who later told reporters that Microsoft may have overbid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has a multiyear deal with MySpace, the largest social network, to provide search and advertising alongside MySpace's 110 million user profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Schmidt, Google's CEO, told reporters that its pact with MySpace is performing better than originally expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft rose slightly to $31.60 from a Nasdaq close of $31.25, while Google ticked down to $675.30 from a close of $675.82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco, Paul Thomasch in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds age of Shedlarz) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Ransdell Pierson &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Thursday that David Shedlarz would retire as Vice Chairman by the end of the year, after three decades with the company that turned difficult in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shedlarz, 59, joined Pfizer in 1976 and assumed a number of roles before being named chief financial officer in 1995, a position he held for a decade. He was promoted to vice chairman in 2005, after also having managed the company's former medical technology group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    During his long tenure as CFO, Shedlarz garnered respect as one of the company's more personable senior executives and for his role in building Pfizer into the world's biggest drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company's size and importance mushroomed with a huge deal engineered by Shedlarz in June 2000, the purchase for $114 billion of Warner-Lambert Corp. The transaction gave Pfizer full control of a cholesterol fighter named Lipitor which they had sold together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shedlarz' crowning glory came in April 2003, when Pfizer completed its $60 billion acquisition of another U.S. rival, Pharmacia Corp. The deal widened Pfizer's lead as the world's largest drugmaker -- with 11 percent of the global market for prescription drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It also gave Pfizer full ownership of arthritis blockbuster Celebrex, which the two companies had co-marketed, as well as other popular Pharmacia medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Helped by huge cost savings and job cuts from the two deals, Pfizer led the industry in earnings growth for several years. But its profit growth and share price then steadily declined as the company's laboratories -- even with an annual research budget that now exceeds $7 billion -- failed to come up with blockbusters needed to replace drugs going off patent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company's current stock price stands 22 percent lower than it was at the time of the Pharmacia merger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shedlarz' planned departure is the latest development in a continuing shake-up in Pfizer's corporate suite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He had been in the running to replace Hank McKinnell as chief executive of Pfizer. But the top job was awarded instead to company general counsel Jeffrey Kindler in July 2006 when McKinnell was ousted after a dearth of new medicines sent Pfizer shares to multi-year lows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Karen Katen, another vice chairman, had been the other major contender for McKinnell's job. She retired only months after being passed over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But Shedlarz stayed aboard, agreeing to oversee manufacturing operations and strategic planning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer in May said Chief Financial Officer Alan Levin had resigned and that the company's global president of research, John LaMattina, would leave his post after 30 years with the company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In August, Pfizer named an industry outsider, Alcatel- Lucent executive Frank D'Amelio, as its new CFO. Earlier this month, it picked Martin Mackay, Pfizer's second-ranking research executive, to replace LaMattina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Leslie Gevirtz/Andre Grenon/Deborah Cohen; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net +1-646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER SHEDLARZ/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

and reported quarterly profit that beat analysts' while
Countrywide, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said the

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has made progress in getting its Windows software to work on a low-cost laptop computer for poor children that currently runs on rival Linux software, an executive said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is now working to adapt a basic version of Windows XP so it is compatible with the nonprofit One Laptop per Child Foundation's small green-and-white XO laptop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're spending a nontrivial amount of money on it," Microsoft Corporate Vice President Will Poole said in an interview on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We remain hopeful with our progress to date, we still have significant work ahead to finalize our analysis and testing processes," he said. "At the end of the day, there's no guarantees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The One Laptop per Child Foundation, a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, plans to start producing the $188 machines in China next month and eventually manufacture millions a year for elementary school children in developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation is also selling the machines in the United States and Canada for $400 apiece through a fund-raising campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laptops were designed specifically to run Linux programs. If the machines run only Linux, Microsoft will lose an opportunity to expose tens of millions of children worldwide to its Windows system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the foundation is able to meet its goal of producing millions of laptops for school children around the world and they are all loaded with Linux software, then they would end up being more comfortable with those programs than with Windows, said Wayan Vota, who publishes a blog that monitors the project. (olpcnews.com/).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People will realize there is an alternative to Windows and they might like it better," Vota said."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the new laptop uses some technologies developed by the foundation that haven't previously been used in personal computers, Poole said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still have plenty of work to do in determining if the highly constrained performance, power, and memory in the first generation XO laptops will be compatible with Windows and popular Windows applications," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally dubbed the $100 laptop, which is the group's target price for the machine, the XO features a string pulley to charge its battery, a keyboard that switches between languages, a digital video camera and wireless connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laptop's designer, Mary Lou Jepsen, said in an interview earlier this month she expects the price to drop in the first quarter of next year because prices of memory tend to fall dramatically during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computer requires just 2 watts of power compared with the typical laptop's 30 to 40 watts and does away with hard drives, relying instead on flash memory and four USB ports to add memory devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The XO laptop's component makers include Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Software maker Red Hat Inc helped develop the device. Quanta Computer Inc will manufacture it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation will start taking orders for its Give 1 Get 1 campaign on November 12 at www.laptopgiving.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Oct 26 (Reuters) - At least seven brokerages raised their
price target on Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), a day after it posted
23 percent quarterly profit growth, topping analysts' estimates
and sending shares to a year-high in opening trade.

 The world's largest software maker said strong sales of its
video game "Halo 3" and operating system Vista boosted
first-quarter gains.

 Microsoft's shares rose 12 percent to $35.91 on the Nasdaq.

 Citigroup analyst Brent Thill said a combination of reduced
piracy and selling new, higher priced premium offerings will
drive ongoing revenue and margin upside.

 Goldman Sachs said it continues to expect strong momentum
from multiple product cycles kicking into gear, including
Office 2007, Windows Server 2008 and Vista, powering top-line
growth rates.

 Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said Microsoft's shares
deserve a slight premium multiple given the company is in the
midst of several strong product cycles and has the tailwind of
a relatively strong broader personal computer buying
environment.

 Microsoft raised its full-year earnings estimates to $1.78
to $1.81 a share from a previous range of $1.69 to $1.73 and
its revenue estimates by almost $2 billion, but some analysts
feel these estimates are conservative.

 Thill said its operating margin estimate of 40 percent for
2008 is conservative, with room for numbers to move ahead.

 Olson said the company can outperform its operating margin
view of 38 percent for the next quarter.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates prices, adds Countrywide details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Caroline Valetkevitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open
higher on Friday after lender Countrywide Financial Corp.
CFC.N said it expects to return to profitability this quarter
and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) raised its profit outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Countrywide jumped more than 19 percent to $15.60
before the bell. The largest U.S. mortgage lender said the
housing slump led to a $1.2 billion third-quarter loss, but it
expects to report a profit this quarter as it slashes jobs and
stabilizes its operations.  For details, see [ID:nL26142482]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People were expecting the worst (from Countrywide)...it's
what's not in there," said Todd Leone, head of listed trading
at Cowen  Co. in New York. "Microsoft earnings were good, but
people have been watching the financials."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, Merrill Lynch  Co. MER.N reported making
huge write-downs for bad investments related to risky subprime
mortgages, joining other financial firms such as Citigroup Inc
(C.N) and Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft rose 13.3 percent at $36.25 before the
bell, a day after it lifted full-year forecasts and posted
quarterly profit that beat analysts' expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 were up 9.40 points and were above
fair value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by
taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to

points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures rose 15 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill's stock also rose before the opening bell after
news Chief Executive Stan O'Neal met with Wachovia Corp.
WB.N, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, about a merger. Shares
were up 1.8 percent at $61.99 after the report in The New York
Times. For details, see [ID:nL26620794].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data on Friday will include the Reuters/University of

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Repeating to additional subscribers) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Daisuke Wakabayashi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SEATTLE, Oct 25 (Reuters) - More than a year ago, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer stood in front a group of skeptical Wall Street analysts and insisted that the software maker was still a growth company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It was a bold statement at the time. Microsoft was suffering delays in releasing an update to its flagship Windows operating system and its stock had slumped to around $24, the lower end of a range it had drifted in for about four years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft delivered strong results on Thursday that justified some of Ballmer's optimism for continued growth in its main software lines while buying the company time with investors to build out newer ventures like online advertising and video games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The stock, already up 10 percent in the last month, surged to $35.57 in after-hours trade, up nearly 14 percent from Wednesday's close and its highest level since 2001. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Ballmer went out on the limb, because it did look like a very silly statement that not only Microsoft was a growth story but that PC operating systems were still a growth story," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group recalling the financial analyst meeting in July 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "However, this is a good foundation for growth." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft blew past Wall Street estimates with profit and revenue growth exceeding 20 percent for the just-ended quarter and raised its full-year revenue and earnings outlook with a solid performance across its range of businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It looks really strong across the board. It's hard not to like what you see," said Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio manager for Jensen Portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said the company defied the "law of large numbers" -- it's harder for big companies to grow -- by posting the fastest start to its year since 1999 when its stock hit an all-time high near $60. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft's growth still does not match the dizzying climb at Google Inc. (GOOG.O) or the iPod-led resurgence at Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) but the share's sharp gain after the results is a sign that investors are taking a second look at the company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Based on the top-end of Microsoft's own earnings estimate range for fiscal 2008, the stock traded at around 20 times earnings in after-hours trade. By comparison, Google trades at 32 times analysts' estimated 2008 earnings and Apple is at 37 times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We think that this is a $40 stock, $40-plus, so we think finally Microsoft is getting recognition for what it's doing," said Caughey from Fort Pitt Capital, which oversees more than $1 billion including Microsoft shares for clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    WINDOWS OPEN AGAIN &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Windows and Office units delivered revenue growth of more than 20 percent, a sign that businesses and consumers are starting to upgrade to Windows Vista and Office 2007, the latest versions of the two software franchises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Windows and Office are the two pillars of Microsoft's business. Those traditional desktop software businesses are also considered the most vulnerable to competitors looking to deliver software over the Internet as a service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Profits from those high-margin businesses during upgrade cycles can be invested into new, high-growth initiatives. It's the same strategy Microsoft used to give birth to its computer server software business and entertainment division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft is not entirely out of the woods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Its online services business posted a fifth straight quarterly loss and the jury is still out on whether its $6 billion acquisition of digital advertising firm aQuantive will pay off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company showed its desperation to become a major force in online advertising when it agreed to buy a stake in social networking Web site Facebook for a valuation not seen since the height of the dot-com frenzy in the late 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft also lags behind Google and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) in Web search, the most profitable portion of the online advertising market, and improvements to the search engine's look and technology have done little to bridge the gap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft's entertainment and devices division swung to a profit in the September quarter thanks to sales of blockbuster video game title "Halo 3," but the unit is still three months removed from a $1.06 billion charge to fix hardware problems with the Xbox 360. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The division has predicted that it will turn an annual profit for the first time in the segment's history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Kim Coghill, Reuters Messaging: daisuke.wakabayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 206 652 2326)) Keywords: MICROSOFT GROWTH/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Caroline Valetkevitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures were mixed
 on Friday, with technology shares set to gain after Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT.O) raised its profit outlook, but record oil prices
could weigh on the broad market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP and Dow futures were down slightly, while Nasdaq 100
futures rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft lifted its full-year forecasts after the close on
Thursday and posted quarterly profit that beat analysts'
expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in other earnings news, Waste Management Inc WMI.N,
the largest U.S. trash hauler, posted results that missed
estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also weighing on sentiment was oil's rise to a record high
of $92.22 a barrel. U.S. crude futures later pared gains to
$91.29 in electronic trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even though Microsoft's earnings were good, the financial
sector has been weak," said Peter Dunay, investment strategist
at Leeb Capital Management in New York. "What concerns me is
the forward-looking guidance in financials."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dunay added, "We can't ignore oil pushing to new highs
every day. That's a big increase in energy prices for the
consumer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 were down 1.80 points but still
above fair value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing

points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures gained 4 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch  Co. MER.N shares rose before the opening

rose 1.8 percent to $61.99 after the report in The New York

which included $7.9 billion in write-downs for bad investments
related to risky subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Countrywide Financial Corp.  CFC.N shares rose 12.5
percent to $14.70 before the bell after the lender reported
quaterly results and said it negotiated additional liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other news, Merrill Lynch raised its rating on Wal-Mart
Stores (WMT.N), according to theflyonthewall.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In after-hours trading, Microsoft's stock rose about 5

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) lifted its full-year forecasts and posted 23 percent quarterly profit growth on Thursday, topping analysts' estimates on strong sales of "Halo 3" and Vista, and sending its shares up 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker raised full-year revenue targets across its business divisions and gave a bullish profit forecast for the crucial, current holiday quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have waited for sales of the new Windows Vista operating system to pick up since its January release. Windows, which sits on more than 90 percent of all personal computers, generates almost 80 cents in profit for every dollar in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The growth of Windows Vista has finally occurred," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halo 3," the latest installment of Microsoft's flagship shooter franchise video game, also racked up more than $300 million in its first week of sales in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft beat even Wall Street's most bullish forecast with a net profit of $4.29 billion, or 45 cents per diluted share, in its fiscal first quarter, up from $3.48 billion, or 35 cents per diluted share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 27 percent to $13.76 billion in the three months ended September 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest analyst profit forecast had been 40 cents per share, with revenue on average seen at $12.54 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like they're firing on all cylinders," said Toan Tran, analyst at Morningstar. "Windows, Office ... all grew by 20 percent and they're the big hitters for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares, already up 10 percent in the last month, surged to $35.40 in after-hours trade, up 10.7 percent from the close and their highest since 2001. Its market capitalization grew by more than $30 billion and its top shareholder, co-founder Bill Gates, saw his fortune grow by $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft raised its full-year revenue outlook for its Windows client sales to a range of 12 percent to 13 percent versus a previous forecast of 9 percent to 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market research firms Gartner and IDC had said global PC shipments rose about 15 percent in the September quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue at the Windows client division, focused on PCs, rose nearly 25 percent in the quarter. Operating profit at the segment went up 27 percent to $3.37 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers also bought Xbox 360 consoles to play "Halo 3," vaulting Microsoft's game machine past rivals in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entertainment and devices division, after six straight annual losses, delivered 91 percent revenue growth and swung to a $165 million profit from a $142 million loss a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOOKING AHEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft raised full-year earnings estimates to a range of $1.78 to $1.81 per share from a previous range of $1.69 to $1.73. It also raised its full-year revenue estimate range by almost $2 billion, to $58.8 billion to $59.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts, on average, were forecasting fiscal 2008 earnings of $1.73 per share on revenue of $57.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is never going to be aggressive on guidance. Even from a conservative perspective, it looks to be a pretty positive forward view," said Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio manager at Jensen Portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those figures also include a $85 million impact, or 1 cent per diluted share, from costs and expenses related to its $6 billion acquisition of digital advertising firm aQuantive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current quarter, Microsoft forecast earnings of 44 cents to 46 cents per diluted share on revenue of $15.6 billion to $16.1 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings per share of 44 cents a share on revenue of $15.5 billion in the fiscal second quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft forecast second-quarter operating profit margin would fall to about 38 percent from 43 percent in the September quarter, due in part to sales of Xbox 360 consoles, which it sells at a loss in order to drive sales of high-margin games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current holiday quarter is a crucial one for Microsoft as it aims to spur adoption of new computers running Vista. Its entertainment arm also banks on the December quarter generating twice as much revenue as any other quarter of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's online services group lost money for a fifth-straight quarter despite a 25 percent rise in revenue from a year earlier, helped by an $80 million revenue boost from aQuantive, which became part of Microsoft in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Office business posted a 20 percent increase in revenue to $4.11 billion and profit rose 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to its earnings, Microsoft shares traded at 18 times analysts' estimated fiscal 2008 earnings, compared with a 17 ratio for rival software maker Oracle Corp ORCL.O. Web rival Google Inc (GOOG.O) trades at 32 times 2008 profit estimates, while International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) was at 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando in New York and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles, editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds forecast, more details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE Oct 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) posted a rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by healthy demand for personal computers loaded with its Windows operating system and strong sales of its "Halo 3" video game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest software maker said net profit in its fiscal first quarter totalled $4.29 billion, or 45 cents per diluted share, versus $3.48 billion, or 35 cents per diluted share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Revenue rose 27 percent to $13.76 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts, on average, had forecast 39 cents per share in first-quarter profit on revenue of $12.54 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Market research firms Gartner and IDC said global PC shipments rose about 15 percent in the September quarter, which helped Microsoft as well as the quarterly results of chip maker Intel Corp (INTC.O). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft also enjoyed strong sales of "Halo 3," the latest installment of its flagship shooter franchise. The blockbuster game title racked up more than $300 million in its first week of sales after its Sept. 25 debut. Consumers also purchased the Xbox 360 console to play the game, vaulting the game machine past rival consoles in September. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For the current quarter, Microsoft forecast earnings in a range of 44 cents to 46 cents per diluted share on revenue of $15.6 billion to $16.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts, on average, were forecasting earnings per share of 44 cents a share on revenue of $15.5 billion in Microsoft's fiscal second quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The holiday quarter is a crucial one for Microsoft as it aims to spur adoption of new computers running its latest Windows Vista operating system.

It's hard not to like what you see," said Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio manager for Jensen Portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said the company defied the "law of large numbers" -- it's harder for big companies to grow -- by posting the fastest start to its year since 1999 when its stock hit an all-time high near $60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's growth still does not match the dizzying climb at Google Inc. (GOOG.O) or the iPod-led resurgence at Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) but the share's sharp gain after the results is a sign that investors are taking a second look at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the top-end of Microsoft's own earnings estimate range for fiscal 2008, the stock traded at around 20 times earnings in after-hours trade. By comparison, Google trades at 32 times analysts' estimated 2008 earnings and Apple is at 37 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think that this is a $40 stock, $40-plus, so we think finally Microsoft is getting recognition for what it's doing," said Caughey from Fort Pitt Capital, which oversees more than $1 billion including Microsoft shares for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WINDOWS OPEN AGAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Windows and Office units delivered revenue growth of more than 20 percent, a sign that businesses and consumers are starting to upgrade to Windows Vista and Office 2007, the latest versions of the two software franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows and Office are the two pillars of Microsoft's business. Those traditional desktop software businesses are also considered the most vulnerable to competitors looking to deliver software over the Internet as a service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profits from those high-margin businesses during upgrade cycles can be invested into new, high-growth initiatives. It's the same strategy Microsoft used to give birth to its computer server software business and entertainment division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is not entirely out of the woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its online services business posted a fifth straight quarterly loss and the jury is still out on whether its $6 billion acquisition of digital advertising firm aQuantive will pay off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company showed its desperation to become a major force in online advertising when it agreed to buy a stake in social networking Web site Facebook for a valuation not seen since the height of the dot-com frenzy in the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also lags behind Google and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) in Web search, the most profitable portion of the online advertising market, and improvements to the search engine's look and technology have done little to bridge the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's entertainment and devices division swung to a profit in the September quarter thanks to sales of blockbuster video game title "Halo 3," but the unit is still three months removed from a $1.06 billion charge to fix hardware problems with the Xbox 360.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The division has predicted that it will turn an annual profit for the first time in the segment's history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - It has four legs and a tail like a dog or a cat, so why shouldn't man's best friend be a...rat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand for rats as pets has surged thanks to the latest Disney/Pixar animated film "Ratatouille" featuring the adventures of a gourmet rat Remy demonstrating his culinary prowess in the top kitchens of Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's Pets at Home domestic pet chain says rat sales have surged 50 percent since the film opened in Britain on October 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's early doors yet, but it seems 'Ratatouille' has done wonders for the image of rats," said company spokesman Steve Fairburn said on the www.ukpets.co.uk Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Contrary to popular opinion, rats are actually one of the cleanest and least smelly pets you can own. They are incredibly responsive to learning and can be taught to do amazing tricks, much in the way that dogs and cats can," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the British experience appears to have been echoed wherever the film has been screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States reported a surge in demand for pet rats during the summer, and pet groups in Germany and Sweden have also said rat sales have surged thanks to the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they also warn that, as with demand for pet puppies and kittens that can fade once the cute factor diminishes with age, a rat is for life not just the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 30 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) experimental
drug axitinib has shown promise for treating patients with
advanced kidney cancer, slowing the disease for six months or
more in some cases, according to a study published on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The findings from the company's Phase II trials show that of
52 patients in the study 23 had complete or partial responses to
the drug, a French team reported  in the journal Lancet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The objective response and time to progression in our study
suggest that axitinib might be a promising drug in the treatment
of patients with metastatic renal-cell cancer, although a
randomised controlled trial is needed to confirm this finding,"
Oliver Rixe of the University of Paris and colleagues said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Around 200,000 people a year are diagnosed with the disease
that mostly strikes older people and which rarely sees new
treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axitinib, from a class of drugs known as VEGF inhibitors,
works by starving tumours of blood and nutrients necessary for
growth, a process called anti-angiogenesis. Genentech's DNA.N
widely-used cancer drug Avastin was the first approved medicine
to work in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most common adverse side effects in trials of axitinib
as a single agent have included fatigue, protein in the urine,
 stomatitis/mucositis, raised blood pressure and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the French study the cancer of 22 patients did not worsen
for at least eight weeks, including 13 people who remained
stable for 24 weeks or longer, the researchers said
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The findings come after the world's biggest drugmaker in
June said axitinib showed enough promise in a mid-stage trial
against advanced pancreatic cancer to warrant continued
development of the medicine in large late-stage studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer is hoping that its growing number of experimental
cancer drugs will prove successful and make it a force in
oncology, which has been a highly lucrative area for rival
drugmakers such as Switzerland's Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX).

Monday that a German court has revoked the drugmaker's patent
covering the active ingredient in its blockbuster cholesterol
drug, Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The decision resulted from a patent challenge by generic
manufacturers Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd (RANB.BO) and Basics

impact, in part because neither patent challenger has approval
to sell a generic version in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it will appeal the decision, a process expected
to take two to three years. Lipitor is sold in Germany under
the brand name Sortis.

&lt;p&gt;Co says that the the Federal Patent Court in Munich, Germany has revoked the co's patent covering atorvastatin calcium, the active ingredient in Lipitor. The patent at issue in the lawsuit (EP 409,281) expires in July 2010. The decision -- has no immediate commercial impact because neither company has regulatory approval to sell a generic atorvastatin product in Germany, and because Pfizer's basic patent covering atorvastatin remains in force, and expires after the enantiomer patent. That patent expires in Nov, 2011. Pfizer said it will appeal the decision, a process expected to take two to three years. The ruling will have no effect on a pending challenge to the basic atorvastatin patent in Germany by the same two companies. Pfizer also noted that the decision will have no impact on patent litigation involving Lipitor in other jurisdictions around the world.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court said on Monday it would hear Exxon Mobil Corp's appeal seeking to overturn the $2.5 billion in punitive damages for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The justices agreed to review a ruling by a U.S. appeals court that awarded record punitive damages to about 32,000 commercial fishermen, Alaska natives, property owners and others harmed by the nation's worst tanker spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high court rejected a separate appeal by the plaintiffs seeking to reinstate the jury's original award of $5 billion in punitive damages against Exxon Mobil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound in March 1989, spilling about 11 million gallons of crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spill spread oil to more than 1,200 miles of coastline, closed fisheries and killed thousands of marine mammals and hundreds of thousands of sea birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal jury in Alaska awarded $5 billion in punitive damages in 1994.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Repeating to additional subscribers) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Daisuke Wakabayashi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SEATTLE, Oct 25 (Reuters) - More than a year ago, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer stood in front a group of skeptical Wall Street analysts and insisted that the software maker was still a growth company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It was a bold statement at the time. Microsoft was suffering delays in releasing an update to its flagship Windows operating system and its stock had slumped to around $24, the lower end of a range it had drifted in for about four years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft delivered strong results on Thursday that justified some of Ballmer's optimism for continued growth in its main software lines while buying the company time with investors to build out newer ventures like online advertising and video games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The stock, already up 10 percent in the last month, surged to $35.57 in after-hours trade, up nearly 14 percent from Wednesday's close and its highest level since 2001. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Ballmer went out on the limb, because it did look like a very silly statement that not only Microsoft was a growth story but that PC operating systems were still a growth story," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group recalling the financial analyst meeting in July 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "However, this is a good foundation for growth." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft blew past Wall Street estimates with profit and revenue growth exceeding 20 percent for the just-ended quarter and raised its full-year revenue and earnings outlook with a solid performance across its range of businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It looks really strong across the board. It's hard not to like what you see," said Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio manager for Jensen Portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said the company defied the "law of large numbers" -- it's harder for big companies to grow -- by posting the fastest start to its year since 1999 when its stock hit an all-time high near $60. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft's growth still does not match the dizzying climb at Google Inc. (GOOG.O) or the iPod-led resurgence at Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) but the share's sharp gain after the results is a sign that investors are taking a second look at the company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Based on the top-end of Microsoft's own earnings estimate range for fiscal 2008, the stock traded at around 20 times earnings in after-hours trade. By comparison, Google trades at 32 times analysts' estimated 2008 earnings and Apple is at 37 times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We think that this is a $40 stock, $40-plus, so we think finally Microsoft is getting recognition for what it's doing," said Caughey from Fort Pitt Capital, which oversees more than $1 billion including Microsoft shares for clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    WINDOWS OPEN AGAIN &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Windows and Office units delivered revenue growth of more than 20 percent, a sign that businesses and consumers are starting to upgrade to Windows Vista and Office 2007, the latest versions of the two software franchises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Windows and Office are the two pillars of Microsoft's business. Those traditional desktop software businesses are also considered the most vulnerable to competitors looking to deliver software over the Internet as a service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Profits from those high-margin businesses during upgrade cycles can be invested into new, high-growth initiatives. It's the same strategy Microsoft used to give birth to its computer server software business and entertainment division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft is not entirely out of the woods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Its online services business posted a fifth straight quarterly loss and the jury is still out on whether its $6 billion acquisition of digital advertising firm aQuantive will pay off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company showed its desperation to become a major force in online advertising when it agreed to buy a stake in social networking Web site Facebook for a valuation not seen since the height of the dot-com frenzy in the late 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft also lags behind Google and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) in Web search, the most profitable portion of the online advertising market, and improvements to the search engine's look and technology have done little to bridge the gap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft's entertainment and devices division swung to a profit in the September quarter thanks to sales of blockbuster video game title "Halo 3," but the unit is still three months removed from a $1.06 billion charge to fix hardware problems with the Xbox 360. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The division has predicted that it will turn an annual profit for the first time in the segment's history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Kim Coghill, Reuters Messaging: daisuke.wakabayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 206 652 2326)) Keywords: MICROSOFT GROWTH/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on Dell, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 29 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added Dell Inc DELL.O to
its conviction buy list and shares of the world's No. 2
personal computer maker rose almost 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it sees a series of fairly immediate catalysts
that could propel Dell's stock to the brokerage's revised price
target of $35. The prior price target was $33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dell's new retail partnerships with Wal-Mart Stores Inc
(WMT.N) and Staples Inc (SPLS.O) so far, and with more to come,
should add $0.5 billion-$1 billion to revenue over the next
year, the brokerage added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman expects Dell to announce a share buyback of about
$8 billion in a future filing, which it believes should bring
down Dell's tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage removed the world's largest personal computer
maker Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) from its conviction buy list
but maintained its "buy" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Business is strong on a number of fronts, putting HP in a
position to beat the brokerage's forecast for the October
quarter, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dell shares rose 81 cents to $29.79 in early morning trade
on the Nasdaq, while HP shares were down about 46 cents at
$52.01 on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - It has four legs and a tail like a dog 
or a cat, so why shouldn't man's best friend be a...rat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Demand for rats as pets has surged thanks to the latest 
Disney/Pixar animated film "Ratatouille" featuring the 
adventures of a gourmet rat Remy demonstrating his culinary 
prowess in the top kitchens of Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain's Pets at Home domestic pet chain says rat sales 
have surged 50 percent since the film opened in Britain on 
October 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's early doors yet, but it seems 'Ratatouille' has done 
wonders for the image of rats," said company spokesman Steve 
Fairburn said on the www.ukpets.co.uk Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Contrary to popular opinion, rats are actually one of the 
cleanest and least smelly pets you can own. They are incredibly 
responsive to learning and can be taught to do amazing tricks, 
much in the way that dogs and cats can," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, the British experience appears to have been echoed 
wherever the film has been screened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The United States reported a surge in demand for pet rats 
during the summer, and pet groups in Germany and Sweden have 
also said rat sales have surged thanks to the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they also warn that, as with demand for pet puppies and 
kittens that can fade once the cute factor diminishes with age, 
a rat is for life not just the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds further details, quotes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI Oct 29 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N), which has
invested more than $1 billion in India, is ready to double or
triple its exposure to the country, its chairman and chief
executive said in a newspaper interview published on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman last year decided to end a 10-year old joint
venture with India's Kotak Mahindra and launch its own
operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When we came here a year ago we said we'd try to invest $1
billion over the next two years. We have invested more than a
$1 billion in India already," Goldman Chairman and Chief
Executive Lloyd Blankfein told the Economic Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we saw opportunities to invest a couple more billion
dollars in next year we will do that. It would depend on what
the opportunities are, but we would certainly be happy to
double or triple our exposure to India."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said that during the last quarter more than half of the
company's revenue came from outside the United States and the
Asian business was the fastest growing part of the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our strategy in countries like India and China is central
to our future growth for the obvious reason that we want our
client franchise to grow alongside these economies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs looked to invest in growth opportunities, and
the extent that growth was disproportionately large in Asia,
Blankfein said he expect the firm's Asian portfolio to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the firm would commit more capital as its corporate
advisory services grow in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein said emerging economies would continue to attract
more capital inflows and that the reasons were not only the
weakening dollar, but also companies from the region, evolving
as global players, were attracting investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Just think about here in India -- Reliance (RELI.BO),
Tata, Infosys (INFY.BO) to name just a few," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These companies are growing not only within their home
countries, but globally as well. This has opened the eyes of
investors everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein said India needed to remain as a free and open
market. He said the stock market regulator's recent move to
curb unregistered investors' use of a derivative instrument
known as participatory notes would affect inflows in the near
term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the longer term, it remains to be seen if companies can
find a way to comply with the new rules and can accomplish
their investing objectives by accepting a form of regulation
that would qualify them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As long as India presents itself as an attractive place to
invest, investors will find a way to get access," he told the
newspaper.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Florida resident Mark Calcavecchia is banking on home advantage at this week's Disney Classic in Lake Buena Vista, the final event on the 2007 PGA Tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - International Business Machine Corp 
said on Tuesday it has developed a silicon wafer recycling 
system that may help ease the refined silicon shortage that has 
limited output of solar energy panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; IBM said it can remove intellectual property from discarded 
scrap semiconductor wafers made out of silicon. It can then 
sell them to the solar industry which uses the silicon in 
photovoltaic cells that generate electricity on rooftops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every day about 250,000 wafers are produced globally to 
make chips for products from cell phones to computers and to 
monitor and control manufacturing, according to a wafer 
industry group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM estimates that 3.3 percent of those wafers are 
scrapped, which adds up to nearly 3 million discarded wafers 
per year. It estimates that the silicon from the discarded 
wafers could generate 13.5 megawatts of solar energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is a small amount of the overall solar market. Sharp 
Corp, the world's largest solar panel maker, makes about 710 
megawatts' worth of solar cells per year. But Eric White, an 
IBM semiconductor engineer who helped discover the recycling 
process, said that as the semiconductor industry grows, more of 
the wafers could become available for the solar industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And any new silicon could provide relief to the solar 
industry. Solar power currently generates much less than 1 
percent of global electricity, but in recent years solar panel 
sales have had 30 to 40 percent annual growth. This year, the 
solar industry has tied the computer industry as the world's 
largest consumer of refined silicon, a material that requires 
high temperatures and large amounts of energy to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One of the challenges facing the solar industry is a 
severe shortage of silicon, which threatens to stall its rapid 
growth," Charles Bai, chief financial officer of Chinese solar 
company ReneSola, said in a statement about the IBM recycling. 
"This is why we have turned to reclaimed silicon materials 
sourced primarily from the semiconductor industry to supply the 
raw material our company needs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N) on Tuesday posted a 14 percent increase in quarterly profit, helped by sales of Gillette razors, Charmin toilet paper and Pampers diapers, the weaker dollar and cost-cutting measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company said profit was $3.08 billion, or 92 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter that ended September 30, compared with $2.70 billion, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding a one-time tax benefit, earnings were 90 cents a share. Analysts on average had forecast 90 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. On September 18, the company reiterated its forecast of 88 to 90 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 8 percent to $20.20 billion. Analysts on average had forecast $20.25 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 5 percent during the quarter, in line with the company's target range, PG said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG has been boosting sales in emerging markets, focusing on new products such as its Crest Pro-Health oral-care line, and looking at selling off some brands. At the same time, the company is raising prices on a number of products to help offset rising costs for oil, resin and pulp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG said it expects earnings of $3.46 a share to $3.49 a share in fiscal year 2008, raising its forecast range by 2 cents to account for the tax benefit. Sales are expected to grow 6 percent to 8 percent, with currency accounting for about 3 percent, the company said. Analysts on average have forecast $3.47, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the second quarter, the company forecast earnings of 95 to 97 cents a share, with sales up 6 to 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG shares closed at $71.83 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Oct 30 (Reuters) - Shares of Aozora Bank Ltd (8304.T)
and Shinsei Bank Ltd (8303.T) jumped on Tuesday on speculation
they may be takeover targets for JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N),
after the U.S. bank's chief executive was quoted saying he was
eyeing acquisitions in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of Aozora posted their biggest one-day gain since
listing on the Tokyo exchange last year, surging 11.7 percent to
400 yen. Shares of Shinsei booked their biggest jump in a month,
climbing 7.7 percent to 352 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Financial Times quoted JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon as saying
the bank would consider a takeover or joint venture to boost its
presence in the world's second-largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shinsei and Aozora could be potential targets, the paper
added, citing unamed analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I have asked the management teams here that they come up
with joint ventures and acquisitions that, if they did make
sense, we will pursue. We think Japan will be a great market over
time," the paper quoted Dimon as saying at a management forum in
Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A potential purchase by a Wall Street heavyweight was enough
to attract investors, who have heard little good news from
Japanese banks recently, said Ken Masuda, senior dealer in
equities at Shinko Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is speculative buying," Masuda said. "Shinsei and
Aozora are also helped by the fact that -- unlike the major banks
-- they have so far not rebounded from the sell-off in bank
shares."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japanese bank shares have tumbled in recent months, hit by
concern they may be hurt by U.S. subprime debt losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Shinsei have dropped by around half this year,
making it the worst-performing bank on the Tokyo exchange's first
section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aozora has fallen about 14 percent, outperforming the Tokyo
exchange's index of bank stocks .IBNKS.T, which has slid about
22 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHASING CITI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon's comments come as Citigroup Inc (C.N) prepares to list
its shares in Tokyo next month and make brokerage unit Nikko
Cordial Corp 8603.T a wholly owned subsidiary to help it tap
Japan's estimated $13 trillion in household financial assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We clearly would be as aggressive as Citi," the paper quoted
Dimon as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mika Watanabe, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined comment
on whether or not the U.S. firm was considering a takeover of
either Shinsei or Aozora, saying it was speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. firm employs more than 1,500 staff in Japan focusing
on investment banking, asset management, treasury and securities,
Watanabe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While its mainstay business has been investment banking, it
has also been boosting other businesses, Watanabe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Shinsei and Aozora are more than half owned by foreign
investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shinsei became Japan's first foreign-owned bank after private
equity firm Ripplewood Holdings bought the lender's bankrupt
predecessor, Long Term Credit Bank in 1999. The bank was relisted
the bank as Shinsei in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aozora was listed last year, after Cerberus [CBS.UL], another
private equity firm, acquired predecessor Nippon Credit Bank.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 29 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Monday that a German court has revoked the drugmaker's patent covering the active ingredient in its blockbuster cholesterol drug, Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The decision resulted from a patent challenge by generic manufacturers Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd (RANB.BO) and Basics GmbH, Pfizer said. The patent expires in July 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said the decision has no immediate commercial impact, in part because neither patent challenger has approval to sell a generic version in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said it will appeal the decision, a process expected to take two to three years. Lipitor is sold in Germany under the brand name Sortis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Andre Grenon; Reuters Messaging: Lewis.Krauskopf.reuters.com@reuters.net; lewis.krauskopf@reuters.com +1-646-223-6082)) Keywords: PFIZER LIPITOR/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's Windows Vista is starting to see mass adoption from businesses nearly a year after it was released, the company said while predicting a strong first holiday season for the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We feel like we are starting to hit our stride not only in demand, but in deployment in business," Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platform and services group, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft delivered quarterly results last week that eclipsed Wall Street's most bullish forecasts, helped in part by strong demand for Vista, the latest upgrade to its flagship Windows operating system. Vista was introduced in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vista's success was not always a foregone conclusion. Early Vista buyers complained about the lack of compatibility with existing devices and software programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also buckled to PC manufacturer demands that the company delay the scheduled transition to Vista and extend sales of its previous Windows operating system, Windows XP, for another five months because some customers preferred XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note to clients on Wednesday, Bernstein Research analyst Charles Di Bona said he thinks Vista's upgrade cycle is "underappreciated" and expects growth at the Windows business to be stronger than market expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Di Bona forecasts Windows revenue to grow by 15 percent in this fiscal year ending in June versus Microsoft's own estimate of an increase of 12 percent to 13 percent. Each percentage point of growth represents about $150 million in revenue and roughly $110 million in operating profit, based on previous results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows runs on more than 90 percent of the world's computers and Microsoft makes about 75 cents in profit for every dollar in Windows sales. The Windows client business generated $15 billion in revenue is fiscal 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PREMIUM AND PIRACY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue at the segment, Microsoft's largest and most profitable unit, rose 25 percent in the September quarter, boosted by a PC market growing at around 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, improved measures to curb piracy and greater adoption of higher-margin, premium versions of Vista helped push the segment's sales above PC market growth, Johnson said in the interview this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives have said for years that being able to crack down on pirated versions of its software will help drive significant increases in sales. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has said that more than 20 percent of its software running around the world is pirated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vista comes with a new authentication program that sends security updates and improves service to users of genuine copies of Windows. Johnson said the company has made progress in educating consumers to the advantages of buying more expensive, non-pirated versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As consumers use their computers more for home entertainment, Microsoft has boosted the percentage of higher-end versions of Windows. Premium versions accounted for about 75 percent of all Windows copies in the first quarter, compared to about 59 percent a year earlier, Di Bona said in his report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Johnson said the company should see a pick-up in corporate deployment of Vista after the release of Windows Vista Service Pack 1, the first major update to the new operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sign of business customers' intent to upgrade was a 27 percent increase in unearned revenue at the Windows business during the past quarter, Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unearned, or deferred, revenue reflects long-term contracts on the balance sheet that have been signed but not recognized as income until the product is delivered. In this case, it is when the customers start deploying Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Oct 31 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and
Hanesbrands Inc (HBI.N) said on Wednesday they agreed to a
ten-year deal that will make Hanes and Champion the exclusive
suppliers of basic T-shirts and other apparel at Walt Disney's
U.S. resorts and parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terms of the deal, which includes fleece sweatshirts,
sweatpants and hoodies, were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts will continue
to sell other manufacturers' lines of upscale T-shirts and
clothing at their stores, Meg Crofton, president of Walt Disney
World Resort, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal also calls for some apparel to be co-labeled, with
names such as "Disneyland Resort by Hanes," "Walt Disney World
by Hanes," and "ESPN Zone by Champion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the agreement, Hanes will sponsor and have signage at
the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith at Disney-MGM
Studios and will have locations where visitors can personalize
T-shirts and other items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stadium at Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex will
be renamed for Champion, and both brands of clothing will be
offered and promoted at Disney's eight ESPN Zone restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has other long-standing corporate partnerships that
are featured throughout the U.S. parks but this is the first to
result in co-branding of merchandise, Crofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the partnerships result in more advertising within
the resorts, Crofton said Disney has seen no resistance from
visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Quite the opposite: it's one of the reasons we choose our
partners so carefully," Crofton said. "Our guests love to see
brands they know ... and associate with quality."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on rig problem)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAPE TOWN Oct 31 (Reuters) - U.S. ExxonMobil (XOM.N) said
on Wednesday it hoped to establish a "significant" position in
Libya after returning to the north African nation following a
period of political instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're back and we hope to establish a significant position
there in the future," Kevin Biddle, vice president of the
company's African operations, said at the Africa Upstream 2007
oil conference in Cape Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil, which is aiming to boost its African output by
about 50 percent by the end of this decade, has earmarked Libya
as one of its promising new markets on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company was among a number of Western oil companies that
left Libya after its leader Muammar Gaddafi embraced a radical
anti-American policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview after his presentation, Biddle said that the
company, like other oil majors, was seeing a shortage of
available oil rigs in Africa, which has experienced a boom in 
exploration and drilling in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It affects everybody," Biddle said, adding, however, that
ExxonMobil had "adequate" rigs to cover its activities on the
continent.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are supplying Libya's government with 150,000 rugged laptop computers that cost $200 to build and are designed to meet the needs of children in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel spokeswoman Agnes Kwan said in an interview on Tuesday night that Libya's education ministry ordered the equipment in August and shipments began last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So far it's going well. We're just a month into the deployment," Kwan told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of the devices was reported by Libya's domestic press in August, she said, but Intel and Microsoft have yet to discuss it outside of that country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwan said that Intel and Microsoft are not subsidizing the price of the laptops, which Intel sells under the Classmate PC brand. She did not disclose how much the Libyan education ministry is paying for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also said that Intel had signed up Nigeria as a Classmate PC customer, though she said she did not know how many machines the government would order, or whether they would run on Windows or the rival Linux operating system. Classmate PCs are capable of running both types of software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of the Classmate PCs to Libya is Intel's second-largest since it launched the product last year.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and the states accusing it of continuing monopolistic behavior asked a federal judge to temporarily delay the end of government oversight of the software giant, according to court documents filed on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Most of the provisions from a 2002 consent decree between Microsoft and the federal government are set to expire on Nov. 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In a joint motion, Microsoft and the 18 states pushing for the government to extend its oversight asked the court to delay the existing deadline "only for so long as necessary" but no later than Jan. 31, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The extra time is needed for all of the states to file their motions with the court, the documents said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The states want some parts of the 2002 consent decree to be extended to 2012, arguing that Microsoft has failed to live up to the agreement. Some portions have already been extended to 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The remedy has been challenged by California and some other states, which argue that Microsoft continues to abuse its dominant position in the market for computer operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Europe's second-highest court recently affirmed a 2004 European Commission ruling that Microsoft abused its overwhelming market position to crush competitors. The court also upheld a 497 million-euro ($708 million) fine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ((Editing by Leslie Gevirtz, Diane.Bartz@Reuters.com, 202-898-8313)) Keywords: MICROSOFT ANTITRUST/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.
