&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - Walter Industries Inc.
(WLT.N) shares could be worth 54 percent more than the current
price as the company spins off units and as demand grows for
its main product, metallurgical coal used in steel production,
Barron's newspaper said in its April 2 edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tampa, Florida-based Walter is a coal and natural gas
producer that also has home-building and financing operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barron's said the company's shares have been hurt by
production problems at an Alabama mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It nevertheless said Walter's parts could be worth $38 per
share, 54 percent above Friday's closing price of $24.75 on the
New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newspaper said Walter could produce up to 7 million
tons of coal in 2007, helping boost profit 17 percent to $170
million, or $3.06 per share, on revenue of $1.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Profit may increase 15 percent a year over the next five
years, the newspaper said. Barron's also expects Walter by 2008
to sell or spin off its home-building and financing operations,
becoming a pure-play coal company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said Matt Hagerty, who works at Pennant Capital,
estimates that Walter shares sell for four times market value
plus net debt, and could sell for six times, in line with other
coal companies and valuations in recent mining transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pennant owns 2.5 million Walter shares and advocates a
breakup, the newspaper said.

&lt;p&gt;LIMA (Reuters) - Peru, the world's No. 2 cocaine producer, should launch air strikes and machine-gun attacks to destroy jungle drug factories and airstrips used by traffickers, President Alan Garcia said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garcia said a day earlier the destruction of coca crops would resume in one of the most-important cocaine-making regions in the South American country. Officials had made a deal with local farmers to halt the eradication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've got to finish every last cocaine factory and every last airport. Use the A37 planes, bomb and attack these airports, these cocaine factories with machine guns," Garcia said, directing his comments to the country's interior minister, who is in charge of the police that lead the fight against drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peru is the second-largest producer of cocaine in the world after Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not willing to be blackmailed ... I'm not going to be a straw doll or puppet of the political fears," said Garcia, who took office in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to official figures, Peruvian police raided 718 cocaine factories last year and seized 14.7 tons of partially processed cocaine. They also destroyed more than 25,000 acres&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;of illegal crops of coca, the plant used to make cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 2 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) on Monday said it had agreed to pay almost $35 million in fines to settle federal charges that a rival drugmaker it acquired four years ago had inappropriately marketed the human growth hormone Genotropin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer acquired the medicine as part of its $60 billion purchase in 2003 of Pharmacia, which the U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating for its past "off-label" marketing of Genotropin. Although doctors may prescribe drugs for off-label uses, meaning uses not approved by U.S. regulators, drugmakers are not allowed to actively promote drugs for such unauthorized uses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said one of its Pharmacia subsidiaries will plead guilty to a single count of offering a vendor payment for recommending purchase of Pharmacia medicines. The plea will not affect continued marketing of the growth hormone, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Another Pharmacia subsidiary has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice that includes a fine of $15 million for improper promotion of Genotropin that Pfizer discovered soon after the Pharmacia merger, Pfizer said. No criminal charges will be filed against Pharmacia in exchange for compliance with terms of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, editing by Martin Golan; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER GENOTROPIN/SETTLEMENTS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. plans to patch a security hole in Windows on Tuesday related to an animated cursor that hackers have used to launch attacks after users click on links to malicious Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose Windows operating system runs on some 95 percent of the world's computers, said it would release the patch outside of a regular monthly security update because it completed testing earlier than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's monitoring of attack data continues to indicate that the attacks and customer impact is limited," the world's biggest software maker said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security firm F-Secure said attacks using the flaw related to cursor animation files used by Windows intensified over the weekend, with the majority tracing back to different Chinese hacker groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said most of the activity around the so-called ANI exploit has been via dozens of malicious Web sites but warned that on Sunday the first Internet worm, able to replicate without the user doing anything to the machine, was found using the flaw to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This vulnerability is really tempting for the bad guys," said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure. "It's easy to modify the exploit, and it can be launched via Web or e-mail fairly easily."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been working to improve the security and reliability of its software as more and more malicious software targets weaknesses in Windows and other Microsoft software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it was working with authorities investigating the latest attacks and that consumers could visit Microsoft Update or Windows Update or get more information at www.microsoft.com/athome/security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exploitation may occur when a user clicks a malicious link, reads or forwards a specially-crafted HTML e-mail, or accesses a folder containing a malicious animated cursor file," said a technical bulletin from the U.S. government-backed Computer Emergency Readiness Team.&lt;/p&gt;

and Friedman LLC, for about $1.8 billion.

 --The brokerage said it was downgrading the staffing
services company as there are no obvious signs that alternative
bidders were stepping up.

 --It said with the announcement of the acquisition, the
company will now trade in a tight range defined by the pending
cash purchase price of $55 per share.

&lt;p&gt;AMELIA ISLAND, Florida (Reuters) - Venus Williams used a strong serve and powerful groundstrokes to whip Aravane Rezai 6-1, 6-2 in her opening match at the Amelia Island championship on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Williams needed just an hour to record the victory before saying she feels better than she has all year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tonight was the most comfortable I've felt on the court of all the matches I've played this season," the American said. "I'm rounding into form at the right time with the claycourt season ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In earlier matches, top-seeded Nadia Petrova stopped Kaia Kanepi of Estonia 6-4, 6-0, while number three Daniela Hantuchova bounced Nuria Llagostera Vives of Spain, 6-1, 6-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams was near perfect on her first serve in the match. She won 14 of 18 points on her first serve in the opening set and was even better in the second, capturing all but two of 12 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-times grand slam title winner consistently frustrated Rezai by placing forehand shots down the line that the Frenchwoman could not reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My service game was that strong in Memphis too," said Williams of the tournament she won in February. "Yet last week at the Sony Ericsson (in Miami) I couldn't find my serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My second serve was also very strong tonight. That definitely helped me hold serve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams never lost her serve and broke Rezai twice in both sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victory set up Wednesday's featured match between the unseeded Williams and number four seed Patty Schnyder. Schnyder, ranked No. 16 in the world, has never beaten Williams in eight matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, April 3 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) said
on Tuesday its 150,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles-area
refinery in Torrance, California, was restarting units shut for
unplanned repairs on March 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A planned two-month overhaul of units, including the
hydrotreating system for boosting motor fuel production, which
began in February continues, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trade sources said they understood one of two sulfur
recovery units was back in operation at the refinery. The March
22 shutdown of an SRU, while the other was off-line as part of
the planned overhaul, forced the refinery to cut output to
minimum levels, but Exxon was able to meet its contractual
obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The planned work on the hydrotreater, hydrogen plant and
second SRU is expected to finish by mid-April.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cocaine and amphetamine abusers increase their risk of suffering strokes, a study of Texas hospital patients showed on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such stimulants have been linked to strokes in previous research on animals and in some human studies but the analysis of more than 3 million patients treated in Texas hospitals between 2000 and 2003 found a stronger link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stimulants are thought to increase stroke risk by raising blood pressure and triggering spasms in blood vessel walls that can damage and narrow the vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study cocaine abusers had double the risk of both types of strokes -- ischemic, in which a blockage cuts off blood flow to the brain, and hemorrhagic, in which bleeding occurs in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of amphetamines, which included the popular drug methamphetamine, was associated with a five-fold increase in hemorrhagic strokes, although the drug was not linked to a higher risk of ischemic strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Arthur Westover of The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas said amphetamine abuse also was associated with a higher risk of death in hemorrhagic strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amphetamine use was growing faster than that of any other drug in Texas during the study period. The rate amphetamine abusers were suffering strokes was increasing faster than the rate of strokes among abusers of any other drug, said the study in the April issue of Archives of General Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 2 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) on Monday said it had agreed to pay almost $35 million in fines to settle federal charges that a rival drugmaker it acquired four years ago had inappropriately marketed the human growth hormone Genotropin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer acquired the medicine as part of its $60 billion purchase in 2003 of Pharmacia, which the U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating for its past "off-label" marketing of Genotropin. Although doctors may prescribe drugs for off-label uses, meaning uses not approved by U.S. regulators, drugmakers are not allowed to actively promote drugs for such unauthorized uses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said one of its Pharmacia subsidiaries will plead guilty to a single count of offering a vendor payment for recommending purchase of Pharmacia medicines. The plea will not affect continued marketing of the growth hormone, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Another Pharmacia subsidiary has entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice that includes a fine of $15 million for improper promotion of Genotropin that Pfizer discovered soon after the Pharmacia merger, Pfizer said. No criminal charges will be filed against Pharmacia in exchange for compliance with terms of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, editing by Martin Golan; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER GENOTROPIN/SETTLEMENTS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LIMA (Reuters) - Peru, the world's No. 2 cocaine producer, should launch air strikes and machine-gun attacks to destroy jungle drug factories and airstrips used by traffickers, President Alan Garcia said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garcia said a day earlier the destruction of coca crops would resume in one of the most-important cocaine-making regions in the South American country. Officials had made a deal with local farmers to halt the eradication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've got to finish every last cocaine factory and every last airport. Use the A37 planes, bomb and attack these airports, these cocaine factories with machine guns," Garcia said, directing his comments to the country's interior minister, who is in charge of the police that lead the fight against drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peru is the second-largest producer of cocaine in the world after Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not willing to be blackmailed ... I'm not going to be a straw doll or puppet of the political fears," said Garcia, who took office in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to official figures, Peruvian police raided 718 cocaine factories last year and seized 14.7 tons of partially processed cocaine. They also destroyed more than 25,000 acres&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;of illegal crops of coca, the plant used to make cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Adam Sandler is set to 
star in his first Walt Disney Pictures film, the family comedy 
"Bedtime Stories."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sandler will play a harried real estate developer whose 
life is turned upside down when the lavish bedtime stories he 
tells his niece and nephew begin to come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film will be directed by Adam Shankman, a specialist in 
the genre with such hits as "The Pacifier" and "Cheaper By the 
Dozen 2" to his credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shankman said one reason Sandler signed on was "the fact 
that he is a new father, and the idea of making a beautiful 
Disney brand fantasy is something that is in his heart right 
now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And he gets to play dual roles. He gets to play a regular 
guy and a knight in shining armor in the fantasy world. The 
comedic possibilities are limitless. And there is nothing 
better than Adam and kids. It's going to be really fun."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Production will begin this year for a holiday 2008 release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandler worked with Disney on the 1998 hit "The Waterboy," 
but that film was released under the Touchstone Pictures label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is currently in theaters with the drama "Reign Over Me," 
which has earned just $13.5 million after two weeks. His most 
recent comedy, "Click," grossed $137.3 million at the domestic 
box office last year. On Saturday, he received the 2007 Kids' 
Choice Award for favorite movie actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Technology companies may face a shortage of skilled workers later this year after U.S. immigration services reached its annual quota for visa applications in one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Clearly there is a need for science and engineering talent in this country that is not being met by home-grown talent," said William Morin, director of government affairs for Applied Materials Inc., the world's biggest supplier of equipment for making microchips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are people who are going to develop the next big thing, and you're driving people offshore. It boggles the mind that we would come to this point," Morin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Citizenship and Immigration Services received a record of more than 150,000 applications for the H-1B visa on Monday, nearly double the number of visas it can grant for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals cannot apply for the visa. The employer must apply or submit a petition on the worker's behalf. The visa is good for up to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will grant 65,000 visas to those who hold the equivalent of an undergraduate degree and possess the technical expertise in a specialized field, such as engineering and computer programming. Another 20,000 visas will go to people with advanced academic degrees who have technical expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHOSEN BY LOTTERY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency will review the petitions to ensure that all applications are correct. After that, applications will be compiled, and individuals will be chosen by a computerized lottery system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a very fair process, so everyone who submitted their application has the same shot," Chris Rhatigan, a spokeswoman with the immigration agency said on Wednesday. "This process could take a couple of weeks, and then they will notify the individuals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhatigan was unable to say how soon the visas would be issued due to the volume of applications received. Last year, the cap was reached at the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What stronger signal could be sent for the need for immigration reform in the high-skills area than this?" Morin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margie Jones, U.S. immigration manager at Intel Corp., the world's biggest maker of microchips, said, "Each year the cap has been reached earlier and earlier and earlier. By hitting it the first day, it means it is severely under-rated how many we need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel employs about 90,000 people worldwide, and about 4 percent of the firm's U.S. workforce are foreigners with work visas, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the cap is truly reached, that means there are no (visas) available until 10/1/08," Jones said. "It will impact hiring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applications can be resubmitted April 1, 2008 when H-1B visas become available for the following fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner Cable Inc. reached comprehensive distribution agreements that will include the launch of new Disney high-definition channels on the No. 2 U.S. cable operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies said on Wednesday Time Warner Cable will carry sports channels ESPN2 HD and ESPNU later this year. Some systems will also offer Disney Channel on Demand and ESPN Desportes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable, which has 13.4 million subscribers, also agreed to carry three new high-definition channels -- ABC Family HD, Disney Channel HD and ESPNEWS HD -- in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, the two companies extended their retransmission pact for Disney's ABC-owned broadcast television station on Time Warner Cable systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retransmission discussions between cable operators and broadcasters have become strained in recent months as broadcasters started to demand that cable operators pay for the right to carry the 'free-to-air' stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media companies like Disney, which owns broadcasters alongside cable channels and movie studios, typically reach agreements with operators by bartering channel carriage and advertising for retransmission of the broadcast stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last November Disney hammered out a similar agreement, worth $1 billion with the U.S. No.1 cable company, Comcast Corp., after protracted discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial terms of the agreements between Disney and Time Warner Cable were not furnished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shows will also be offered on Time Warner Cable's "Start Over" service, which lets viewers start a show from the beginning at any point during a broadcast in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney will also provide content to Time Warner Cable's Quick Clips platform. Quick Clips are 2- to 10-minute clips of extra content relevant to certain network shows and at no additional cost to Time Warner Cable digital subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, mayor's comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - The New York-New Jersey Port
Authority on Wednesday said it was talking with JP Morgan Chase
 Co. (JPM.N) about building an office tower in lower Manhattan
just south of the World Trade Center complex that was destroyed
on Sept. 11, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're continuing negotiations," said Port Authority
spokesman Steve Coleman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Any agreement would need to bring substantial value to the
Port Authority and be good for lower Manhattan and the region,"
he added, declining to offer details about the negotiations,
which were reported by The New York Times on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If JP Morgan, the No. 3 U.S. banking group, does build a
1.3 million-square-foot tower where the Deutsche Bank building
now is being torn down, it would be the latest sign of a
renewed influx of banks, many of which are seeking space for
large trading floors, into a neighborhood some abandoned
following the 2001 attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Deutsche Bank building must be demolished, partly
because it became infested with mold after the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York state officials, who share control of the Port
Authority with New Jersey and often take the lead in
redeveloping Ground Zero, had no immediate comment on the
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan was willing to pay the bi-state agency as much as
$300 million for the development rights for the Deutsche Bank
site, The New York Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti declined to comment on
the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, Sachs  Co (GS.N) won a $1.75 billion incentive
package in 2005 for its plan to build its new headquarters just
west of the World Trade Center complex. Though the investment
bank's decision helped ensure lower Manhattan would remain a
financial center, Mayor Michael Bloomberg was blasted by
critics for giving the investment bank too rich a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, Bloomberg told reporters JP Morgan would not
get as sweet a deal as Goldman Sachs, which had helped spark
the city's rebound when its recovery was still fragile. "We
really needed Goldman to stay downtown as an anchor tenant," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If anybody builds downtown now, they will get the normal,
as of right, tax breaks, if you want to phrase it that way, or
benefits -- and nothing more." he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later, the Republican mayor said the city now puts greater
weight on "improving the life in New York City, and that will
help these companies in a way that I think is more
appropriate." Such investments include better schools and
cutting crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Times also said Merrill Lynch  Co. MER.N was
considering either expanding its current headquarters in lower
Manhattan, where its lease is set to expire in 2013, or
possibly building a new tower nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch spokeswoman Jessica Oppenheim said the
investment bank was considering its options, but declined to
elaborate.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Updates with further details, scale of NHS drug purchases) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Britain's consumer affairs watchdog said on Wednesday it would investigate the UK market for distributing medicines after drugs giant Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) struck a deal to sell its products through a single wholesaler. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Until recently all medicines were distributed in Britain through competing wholesalers, but Pfizer radically changed that model last month when it began selling prescription drugs solely through UniChem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    UniChem is the wholesaling division of Alliance Boots Plc AB.L, which is currently facing a 10 billion pound ($19.8 billion) bid from private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) -  Investment banks Goldman
Sachs Group (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) dominate global
energy trading, but lower-tier players are using lending
capabilities to gain share, according to a research report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Financial services research firm Greenwich Associates said
almost 40 percent of North American, European and Asian
companies that use over-the-counter energy derivatives turn to
Goldman Sachs as a dealer, followed by Morgan Stanley with a 35
percent market share and Barclays Capital (BARC.L) at 27
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also was the top trader of listed energy
derivatives globally, trailed by Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas
(BNPP.PA). The energy-trading report, released on Wednesday,
noted that Barclays is a stronger player in Europe, where it's
tied with Goldman for the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 287 companies surveyed by Greenwich ranked Goldman,
Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) with the highest
overall quality and franchise strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On average, the companies hedged 48 percent of physical
sales or purchases of energy.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) and Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC.N) reached comprehensive distribution agreements that will include the launch of new Disney high-definition channels on the No. 2 U.S. cable operator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The two companies said on Wednesday Time Warner Cable will carry sports channels ESPN2 HD and ESPNU later this year. Some systems will also offer Disney Channel on Demand and ESPN Desportes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Time Warner Cable, which has 13.4 million subscribers, also agreed to carry three new high-definition channels -- ABC Family HD, Disney Channel HD and ESPNEWS HD -- in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As part of the deal, the two companies extended their retransmission pact for Disney's ABC-owned broadcast television station on Time Warner Cable systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Retransmission discussions between cable operators and broadcasters have become strained in recent months as broadcasters started to demand that cable operators pay for the right to carry the 'free-to-air' stations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Media companies like Disney, which owns broadcasters alongside cable channels and movie studios, typically reach agreements with operators by bartering channel carriage and advertising for retransmission of the broadcast stations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last November Disney hammered out a similar agreement, worth $1 billion with the U.S. No.1 cable company, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA.O), after protracted discussions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Financial terms of the agreements between Disney and Time Warner Cable were not furnished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney shows will also be offered on Time Warner Cable's "Start Over" service, which lets viewers start a show from the beginning at any point during a broadcast in progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney will also provide content to Time Warner Cable's Quick Clips platform. Quick Clips are 2- to 10-minute clips of extra content relevant to certain network shows and at no additional cost to Time Warner Cable digital subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Yinka Adegoke and Kenneth Li, editing by Dave Zimmerman; Reuters Messaging: kenneth.li.reuters.com@reuters.net; +646-223-6224; e-mail: kenneth.li@reuters.com Keywords: DISNEY TIMEWARNERCABLE/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to close)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Caroline Valetkevitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged up on
Wednesday as Iran's plans to release captured British troops
led to a decline in oil prices and positive brokerage comments
boosted Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data pointing to services sector weakness and
slower-than-expected growth in factory orders revived concerns
about the economy and kept a lid on gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow notched its fifth day of gains, its longest winning
streak since mid-March, while the SP rose for a third straight
day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news from Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil
exporter, that it would free the 15 captured British sailors
and marines it has held more than a week eased global tensions
and helped push down oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup said it raised its fiscal third-quarter earnings
estimates for Microsoft after the software maker's successful
launch of the Windows Vista operating system. For details, see
[ID:nBNG200516] Microsoft shares gained 2.3 percent, boosting
the three major indexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Iran is supportive for the markets. That's a problem
that's not there anymore -- until the next incident," said
Frank Lesh, a futures analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading
LLC in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm impressed by way the market held up with some of the
economic news we'd had. The data was off a little bit, and
we're up a little bit," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 19.75
points, or 0.16 percent, to end at 12,530.05. The Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 1.60 points, or 0.11 percent, at
1,439.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 8.36 points, or
0.34 percent, at 2,458.69, its fifth up day and its longest
winning streak since early January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude oil for May delivery CLc1 fell 26 cents to
settle at $64.38 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Monster Worldwide Inc. (MNST.O), parent of jobs
Web site Monster.com, were down 13.2 percent at $42.10 and
among the top negatives on the SP and Nasdaq. The company said
it expects first-quarter revenue to fall below its prior
forecast. For details, see [ID:nN04325116]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the drop reflects fears that U.S. hiring may
be slowing faster than had been expected. Other staffing stocks
also fell, including Labor Ready Inc. LRW.N, down 6.7 percent
at $17.85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Institute for Supply Management said its index of
non-manufacturing industries showed growth in the vast services
sector last month tumbled to its weakest pace in four years,
below even the most bearish forecast in a Reuters survey. In
addition, the report showed a rise in an inflation measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New orders at U.S. factories rose by a weaker-than-expected
amount in February as orders for machinery and metals fell, the
Commerce Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of companies seen positioned to withstand slowing
economic growth, including tobacco maker Altria Group Inc.
(MO.N), advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Altria, which on Friday completed its spin-off of
Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N, notched their third straight day of
gains, up 1.1 percent at $70.44 on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diversified health-care company Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N)
rose 1.1 percent to $61.29, also on the NYSE after a brokerage
recommended the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose 63 cents to $28.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was below average on the NYSE, with many traders
absent because of the Passover and Easter holidays. About 1.40
billion shares changed hands on the NYSE, below last year's
estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On Nasdaq, about 1.78
billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of
about 9 to 7 on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, decliners beat
advancers by 15 to 14.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Skilled foreign workers, who often seek employment in the high tech industry, can no longer apply for a visa to work in the United States after the government reached its quota for applications in just one day, authorities said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Citizenship and Immigration Services received more than 150,000 applications for the H-1B visa on Monday, a record that nearly doubled the number that can be granted for the fiscal year beginning October 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visa is good for up to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will grant 65,000 visas to those who hold the equivalent of an undergraduate degree and possess the technical expertise in a specialized field, such as engineering and computer programming. Another 20,000 visas will go to those with advanced academic degrees who also have technical expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency will review the petitions to ensure that all applications are correct. After that, applications will be compiled and individuals will be chosen by a computerized lottery system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a very fair process, so everyone who submitted their application has the same shot," Chris Rhatigan, a spokeswoman with the immigration agency said on Wednesday. "This process could take couple of weeks and then they will notify the individuals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhatigan was unable to say how soon the visas would be issued due to the volume of applications the agency received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the cap was reached at the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from ConocoPhillips, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tanya Mosolova&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, April 4 (Reuters) - Russian gas export monopoly
Gazprom (GAZP.MM) has narrowed the list of potential partners
in its giant Shtokman gas field to four as U.S. oil major
Chevron (CVX.N) has lost interest, a Gazprom source said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source said Gazprom was still talking to France's Total
(TOTF.PA), U.S. company ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Norway's
Statoil (STL.OL) and Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) on setting up a joint
operating company for Shtokman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are talking about setting up a company, which would own
production infrastructure, over 600 km (375 mi) of pipelines
and the liquefied natural gas plant," the source told
reporters, adding that Gazprom would control at least 51
percent of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Gazprom will be the sole owner of the gas," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As they (foreign partners) will be involved in production
and all technological aspects, they will be able to book
reserves if they manage to get it confirmed with the SEC (the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The comment follows Gazprom's statement on Tuesday that the
company's chief executive, Alexei Miller, met Total President
Christophe de Margerie to discuss Total's role in Shtokman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miller has had similar meetings with ConocoPhillips Chief
Executive James Mulva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips spokeswoman Janet Grothe said on Wednesday
the company remains interested in Shtokman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have maintained steady dialogue with Gazprom about how
ConocoPhillips might participate with Gazprom in its
development," Grothe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year Gazprom stunned all five companies by scrapping a
year-long bidding process and saying it would develop Shtokman
without any foreign equity partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts interpreted the move as a Kremlin response to U.S.
criticism of Moscow's energy policies. Many energy-rich
countries are seeking to tighten their grip over resources amid
record prices for oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some industry analysts said Gazprom would struggle to
complete the $20 billion project, under the stormy and
iceberg-strewn Barents Sea, without foreign know-how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After ditching the shortlist, Gazprom said it would use
foreign contractors but would not offer them any equity in the
project, which envisages piping some Shtokman gas to Europe and
liquefying the rest for shipping to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Chief Executive David O'Reilly said last month his
company would not be interested in taking on a contractor role
at the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shtokman, located 550 km off the coast of Norway and
Russia, has reserves of more than 3.7 trillion cubic metres of
gas -- enough to meet global consumption for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Discovered in the 1980s, the field was meant to be put on
stream in 2003, but the start up is now not expected before
2013 to 2015.

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA, April 4 (Reuters) - Colombia's second-biggest rebel army on Wednesday denied government charges it has become a drug trafficking organization and said the accusations jeopardize preliminary peace talks set to resume this month. Peace commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo, who has represented Colombia in more than a year of negotiations with the National Liberation Army, or ELN, told Reuters on Tuesday that cocaine smuggling has supplanted kidnapping as the left-wing group's main source of income. The commissioner has committed an offense against the peace process, putting the process at risk, ELN second-in-command Antonio Garcia told local radio. We do not cultivate illicit crops, operate cocaine production laboratories or traffic in drugs. This is ELN policy. What the commissioner said is not true, Garcia said. The ELN was started in 1964 by radical students and Catholic priests inspired by Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution. It has long been seen as Colombia's most ideologically driven rebel force, in part thanks to its traditional reluctance to get involved in Colombia's multibillion-dollar cocaine trade. Colombia will open a new six-week round of talks with the 5,000-member guerrilla army in Cuba on April 12 aimed at clinching an initial cease-fire deal that would set the stage for the group's disbandment. The ELN is known in this Andean country for bombing energy installations, kidnapping for ransom and planting land mines that are often stepped on and detonated by poor farmers and their families. Thousands are killed in the guerrilla war every year. Colombia's biggest rebel force, the 17,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, has rejected President Alvaro Uribe's conditions for starting peace talks. FARC leaders are wanted in the United States for drug smuggling.

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks inched higher on
Wednesday, led by advances in shares of companies seen
positioned to withstand slowing economic growth, including
tobacco maker Altria Group Inc. (MO.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A drop in crude oil prices after Iran said it would free
the British sailors and marines it has detained also cushioned
the stock market after data pointing to services sector
weakness and slower-than-expected growth in factory orders
revived concerns about the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Signs of economic weakness, however, raised hopes that the
U.S. Federal Reserve may keep interest rates steady or cut them
in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The data is showing for a couple months in a row that the
growth in the service sector is light, so perhaps that's
leading people to not worry a lot about inflation," said
Stephen Carl, principal and head of U.S. Equity Trading, The

maker up 2.9 percent at $28.70 on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock was among the Dow's biggest advancers and led the
SP 500's climb ahead of Altria, parent of cigarette maker
Philip Morris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Altria, which on Friday completed its spin-off of
Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N, notched their third straight day of

&lt;p&gt;ASTANA (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's Ecology Ministry said on 
Wednesday it had dropped claims against the Chevron-led firms 
operating a large oilfield after the group pledged up to $300 
million a year for environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tengizchevroil (TCO) produces a fifth of the Central Asian 
state's oil output from the huge Tengiz oilfield in western 
Kazakhstan but has periodically faced accusations from the 
government over its environmental record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have managed to completely solve all of our problems," 
Ecology Minister Nurlan Iskakov told reporters in the capital 
Astana. "Tengizchevroil completely recognized all of our 
claims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, Iskakov threatened the joint venture with the 
suspension of its license if it did not produce a plan to deal 
with its vast stocks of sulphur within a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil from the field has a high sulphur content, which is 
removed from the crude and stockpiled in huge yellow slabs the 
size of several soccer pitches near the oil wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TCO has said in the past the sulphur is harmless and it has 
a program to sell off the by-product gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iskakov said the ministry's change of heart came after 
pledges of increased environmental spending from TCO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our complaint is that for every tonne of oil that they 
produce they spend just 1.3 tenge (1 U.S. cent)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now we have signed and agreed a plan presented to us under 
which environmental protection spending under our criteria and 
meeting our complaints will be 110 billion tenge ($880 million) 
in 2007-2009."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now they will be closely monitored," he added. "We'll 
watch every cent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for Tengizchevroil said the company planned 
to spend $800 million over three years to 2009 on environmental 
measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are committed to excellent environmental performance 
and in 2006 emissions were below permit levels as was flaring," 
she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spokeswoman said the money would be spent on waste 
water and solid waste management, sulphur granulation and 
environmental projects linked to a planned major "second 
generation" upgrade of the Tengiz oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron holds 50 percent in TCO, national oil firm 
KazMunaiGas has 20 percent, U.S. Exxon Mobil 25 percent and 
Russia's LUKOIL holds 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Michael Steen in Almaty)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=123.60 tenge)&lt;/p&gt;

  April 4 (Reuters)  - Citigroup said it raised its U.S.

successful launch of Windows Vista, Office 2007, and SharePoint
Server by the company.

 In the April 3 note, the brokerage said it expects
Microsoft to show upside in the third-quarter due to strong
product portfolio, and raised its earnings estimates to 47
cents a share from 45 cents a share and revenue estimates to
$14.1 billion from $13.8 billion.

 Citigroup, which has a "hold" rating on the stock, said the
world's biggest software maker has strong fundamentals in its

&lt;p&gt;If the No. 3 U.S. banking group does decide to build a 1.3 million-square-foot tower on the site, it would be the latest sign of a renewed influx of banks, many of which are seeking space for larger trading floors, into a neighborhood some abandoned following the attacks in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times also said Merrill Lynch  Co. was considering either expanding its current headquarters in lower Manhattan, where its lease is set to expire in 2013, or possibly building a new tower nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti declined to comment on the report, while Merrill Lynch spokeswoman Jessica Oppenheim said the investment bank was considering its options, but declined to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, April 4 (Reuters) - Russia's gas export monopoly
Gazprom (GAZP.MM) has narrowed the list of potential partners in
its giant Shtokman gas field to four as U.S. oil major Chevron
(CVX.N) has lost interest, a Gazprom source said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The source said Gazprom was still talking to France's Total
(TOTF.PA), U.S. ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Norways' Statoil
(STL.OL) and Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) on setting up a joint
operating company for Shtokman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The operating company would own production and
transportation facilities and would belong at least 51 percent
to Gazprom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Russian firm will also be the sole owner of gas
produced, but foreign partners could in theory book reserves of
Shtokman as shareholders of the operator, the source said.

&lt;p&gt;ASTANA, April 4 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's Ecology Ministry
said on Wednesday it had dropped claims against the Chevron-led
(CVX.N) firms operating a large oilfield after the group pledged
$300 million a year for environmental protection.
Tengizchevroil (TCO) produces a fifth of the Central Asian
state's oil output from the huge Tengiz oilfield in western
Kazakhstan but has periodically faced accusations from the
government over its environmental record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We have managed to completely solve all of our problems,"
Ecology Minister Nurlan Iskakov told reporters in the capital
Astana. "Tengizchevroil completely recognised all of our
claims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, Iskakov threatened the joint venture with the
suspension of its licence if it did not produce a plan to deal
with its vast stocks of sulphur within a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil from the field has a high sulphur content, which is
removed from the crude and stockpiled in huge yellow slabs the
size of several soccer pitches near the oilwells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TCO has said in the past the sulphur is harmless and it has
a programme to sell off the by-product gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iskakov said the ministry's change of heart came after
pledges of increased environmental spending from TCO.
"Our complaint is that for every tonne of oil that they
produce they spend just 1.3 tenge (1 U.S. cent)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now we have signed and agreed a plan presented to us under
which environmental protection spending under our criteria and
meeting our complaints will be 110 billion tenge ($880 million)
in 2007-2009."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now they will be closely monitored," he added. "We'll watch
every cent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron holds 50 percent in TCO, national oil firm
KazMunaiGas has 20 percent, ExxonMobil (XOM.N) 25 percent and
Russia's LUKOIL (LKOH.RTS) holds 5 percent.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/AMSTERDAM, April 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
has ended its advisory role with Dutch bank ING Groep (ING.AS)
to free it up to advise a possible counterbidder for ABN AMRO
AAH.AS, according to Dutch newspaper Financieele Dagblad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Dealers on Wednesday said the report prompted speculation
Goldman wanted a clear role to advise Royal Bank of Scotland
(RBS.L) if it makes a counterbid for ABN, which is currently in
talks to be taken over by Barclays (BARC.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and ING declined to comment. The U.S. investment
bank is an adviser to RBS and has helped on its past deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays and ABN confirmed they were in exclusive talks on
March 19. The talks are expected to last until around April 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBS is one of the most likely banks to launch a rival bid,
according to analysts, but it has declined to comment on its
intentions and is not expected to move until Barclays shows its
hand.

&lt;p&gt; (The following was issued by Israel's Tower Semiconductor
Ltd. (TSEM.TA) (TSEM.O)):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; April 4 - Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM)
(TASE:TSEM), an independent specialty foundry, announced today
that it was chosen by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to
manufacture a CMOS image sensor for use in the development of
its advanced MultiSpectral Polarimetric Imager (MSPI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The device utilises an image sensor process at Tower's Fab1
facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This design is JPL's fifth submission to Tower, dating back
to April, 2001. The previous submissions totaled 28 different
designs, with this latest design being the most challenging of
the series fabricated for JPL by Tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through its airborne and planned space-borne implementation,
the MSPI is intended for the study of atmospheric aerosols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Utilising complex Analog-to-Digital (ADC) design techniques,
the high-speed on-chip 50-Megasamples per second ADC is 9-bit
square-root-encoded, resulting in the equivalent of 14-bit
quantization at low signal levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With high Quantum Efficiency and 10-electron read noise, the
imager is ideal for JPL's latest state-of-the-art scientific
application which requires flexibility in addressing rows in the
imager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are pleased to partner with the highly professional team
at JPL, supporting this product's demanding specs," said Dr. Avi
Strum, general manager of CIS and NVM product lines at Tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I trust that our long standing relationships will further
evolve while we team up to challenge new frontiers in the areas
at which JPL excels."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Devon Energy Corp. (DVN.N), a
U.S. oil and gas producer, could be a takeover target for U.S.
energy giant Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N), BusinessWeek reported
in its "Inside Wall Street" column, citing Oppenheimer analyst

&lt;p&gt; Devon is the largest U.S. independent energy producer with
estimated proved reserves of 2.4 billion barrels of oil and gas
and it has a leading position in Gulf of Mexico deepwater
production, one area where Exxon, the world's largest listed
oil company, is relatively weak, the magazine reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gheit said perennial rumors of an Exxon-Devon merger have
resurfaced in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon officials were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even without a takeover, Gheit told the magazine, Devon
stock could reach $90 to $100 a share by the end of next year,
based on estimated cash flow growth. Devon shares closed at
$71.88 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cash-rich oil companies are looking to expand their energy
reserves, the column said. And with the heightened political
risks of operating in countries like Venezuela and Russia, Big
Oil is more likely to seek growth in the United States, the
column said, citing Oppenheimer Chief investment strategist

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, April 5 (Reuters) - T.J. Rodgers, chief
executive of Cypress Semiconductor Corp. CY.N, had a simple
solution to the hassles of getting visas for foreign engineers
he needed to run his $1 billion business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "When I hire an Indian PhD today, I hire him in Bangalore,
not San Jose. Now I can hire all I want and not have to worry
about the vagaries of government decrees," Rodgers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They've made it less tenable to do business here, so we do
business elsewhere," Rodgers told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News this week that the U.S. immigration service hit its
annual quota for skilled worker visas in one day highlighted
what Rodgers and other executives said is the need for reform
of a system overwhelmed by New Economy hiring demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, the first day people could apply for the next
round of H-1B visas that allow skilled foreigners to work in
the United States, authorities were flooded with a record
number of applications -- more than 150,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government plans to grant 65,000 H-1B visas to those
who hold the equivalent of an undergraduate degree and have
expertise in a specialized field. Another 20,000 visas will go
to people with advanced degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Executives say the chronic shortage of American engineers,
programmers and scientists is forcing many companies to expand
overseas, while also squeezing smaller companies that do not
have the money for such expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The problem, obviously, is that not every company has that
ability to relocate people overseas," said Robert Hoffman, vice
president of government affairs for business software maker
Oracle Corp. ORCL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A lot of small companies rely on H-1Bs. A lot of companies
were started by those who were here on H-1Bs," said Hoffman,
who is also co-chair of Compete America, an industry group that
advocates easier rules on foreign workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are also those on the other side of the fence who say
the current system is not strict enough and that fewer foreign
workers should be allowed in because they are taking jobs away
from qualified U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The problem is that there are not enough skilled workers
at ten to twenty thousand dollars below the market rate. That's
the reason why these companies love these visas," said John
Miano, founder of The Programmers Guild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guild president Kim Berry added by e-mail: "The fact that
the cap was reached in one day indicates how important a cap
is. The software job market is flat, and has been so for many
years. If there were no cap, people would flood in until we
were reduced to begging for day programming work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companies such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), the world's
biggest software maker, counter that they often pay more to
hire foreign workers since legal fees can run well over $10,000
per person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we're not able to hire these people, it puts increasing
pressure on us and other companies to do that work abroad. It
has the perverse impact of encouraging off-shoring," said Jack
Krumholtz, head of Microsoft's Washington, D.C. office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates urged Congress to
find ways to keep foreign students in the United States and
help speed skilled foreigners obtain permanent residency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I see the negative effects of these policies every day at
Microsoft," Gates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Navneet Chugh, an attorney with The Chugh Firm, a Los
Angeles-based law firm representing about 50 Indian companies
doing business in the United States, said the visa limits meant
American companies will increasingly turn to off-shoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The IT environment in the United States and the IT
manpower in India are two balloons tied to each other. When one
is squeezed the air goes to the other. When the U.S. is unable
to import software engineers, more work will go to India,"
Chugh added.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co. has changed its policy to allow same-sex couples to participate in a popular Fairy Tale Wedding program it runs mainly at its two U.S. resorts and cruise line, a Disney spokesman said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney previously had allowed gay couples to organize their own weddings or commitment ceremonies at rented meeting rooms at the resorts, but had barred them from purchasing its Fairy Tale Wedding package and holding the event at locations at Disneyland and Walt Disney World that are set aside specifically for weddings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are updating our Fairy Tale Wedding guidelines to include commitment ceremonies," Disney Parks and Resorts spokesman Donn Walker said. "This is consistent with our policy of creating a welcoming, respectful and inclusive environment for all of our guests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker said the change was prompted by "an inquiry from a guest that asked about this service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney had allowed gay couples to take part in its vow renewals program but excluded them from buying wedding packages by requiring a valid marriage license from California or Florida, which do not permit or recognize gay marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, gay Web site AfterElton.com criticized Disney for not allowing same-sex couples to participate in the Fairy Tale Weddings and Honeymoons program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's Fairy Tale Wedding packages start at $8,000 and include a wedding planner, the ceremony, food and beverages, flowers and table decorations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lavish Wedding Option also includes a ride to the ceremony in the Cinderella coach, costumed trumpeters heralding the couple's arrival, and attendance by Mickey and Minnie Mouse characters dressed in formal attire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has come under fire from religious conservatives, including the Southern Baptist Convention, which have accused the company of promoting a gay agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groups, which lifted an eight-year boycott of Disney in 2005, had criticized the company for such corporate policies as giving health benefits to same-sex partners of employees, allowing "Gay Day" celebrations at its theme parks and airing a prime time television show on its ABC network featuring openly gay comedian Ellen DeGeneres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not in the business of making judgments about the lifestyle of our guests.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Investment banks Goldman
Sachs Group (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) dominate global
energy trading, but lower-tier players are using lending
capabilities to gain share, according to a recent research
report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Financial services research firm Greenwich Associates found
that almost 40 percent of North American, European and Asian
companies that use over-the-counter energy derivatives employ
Goldman Sachs as a dealer, followed by Morgan Stanley with a 35
percent market share and Barclays Capital (BARC.L) at 27
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also was the top trader of listed energy
derivatives globally, trailed by Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas
(BNPP.PA). The energy-trading report this week noted that
Barclays is a stronger player in Europe, where it tied with
Goldman for the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 287 companies surveyed by Greenwich ranked Goldman,
Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) with the highest
overall quality and franchise strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On average, the companies hedged 48 percent of physical
sales or purchases of energy.

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO (Reuters) - Shareholders of Canadian specialty-TV 
group Alliance Atlantis Communications Inc. have voted in favor 
of a C$2.3 billion ($2 billion) takeover offer from CanWest 
Global Communications Corp. and a private-equity affiliate of 
Goldman Sachs  Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The offer, which values Alliance's class A and class B 
shares at C$53 each, got the backing of 99.99 percent of the 
class B votes cast at a meeting on Thursday. Class A 
shareholders voted 99.7 percent in favor of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That was a squeaker," joked Michael MacMillan, executive 
chairman of Alliance Atlantis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through the deal, Winnipeg-based CanWest, which is Canada's 
largest media company, stands to gain exposure to lucrative 
specialty-television assets. Alliance has 13 specialty 
channels. It also co-produces the hit TV franchise "CSI: Crime 
Scene Investigation" with CBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, CanWest announced it would raise its equity in 
the entity that is acquiring Alliance to C$200 million from 
C$132 million. This gives it an economic interest of 29 
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the deal, four years from now, CanWest is to combine 
its own TV operations with Alliance's to form a joint company. 
The equity to be held by Goldman and CanWest in that entity 
will be determined by its operating profit at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alliance's stake in CSI is to be fully owned by a Goldman 
unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed takeover was first announced in January and is 
still subject to court and regulatory approvals. It is expected 
to close this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are a number of steps that we still need to 
accomplish before closing," MacMillan told reporters after the 
vote. "But we're completely positive and optimistic that we'll 
move through each of those in due course and in fine order."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alliance also has a 51 percent stake in Motion Picture 
Distribution LP, which distributes films in Canada and has 
operations in Britain and Spain. That business is expected to 
be controlled by a Canadian partner of Goldman Sachs' private 
equity affiliate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest of Motion Picture Distribution is owned by 
publicly traded Movie Distribution Income Fund. The fund said 
late on Wednesday that it will seek a court appearance with 
respect to the deal, also arguing that the takeover requires 
the approval of its subsidiary trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rubin Osten, chairman of the trust's special committee, 
said in a statement the fund does not want to "frustrate" the 
Alliance deal, but wants more information on the takeover and 
how it will affect its interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MacMillan told reporters he believes the closing of the 
deal doesn't need the trustees' approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alliance's class B shares rose 3 Canadian cents to C$51 on 
the Toronto Stock Exchange. CanWest shares were up 1 Canadian 
cent, to C$11.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=$1.15 Canadian)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt has tightened the procedures for Iraqis entering the country, apparently to stem a flow of people seeking refuge from the violence in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of obtaining visas at points of entry such as Cairo airport, Iraqis will have to apply in advance through Egyptian consulates abroad, an official source said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Foreign Ministry official Mahmoud Aouf told parliament on Wednesday his ministry was making the change for security reasons, the state news agency MENA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision is due to the nature of the security circumstances accompanying the entry of Iraqis into Egypt at this stage," he said.

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Adam Sandler is set to 
star in his first Walt Disney Pictures film, the family comedy 
"Bedtime Stories."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sandler will play a harried real estate developer whose 
life is turned upside down when the lavish bedtime stories he 
tells his niece and nephew begin to come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film will be directed by Adam Shankman, a specialist in 
the genre with such hits as "The Pacifier" and "Cheaper By the 
Dozen 2" to his credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shankman said one reason Sandler signed on was "the fact 
that he is a new father, and the idea of making a beautiful 
Disney brand fantasy is something that is in his heart right 
now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And he gets to play dual roles. He gets to play a regular 
guy and a knight in shining armor in the fantasy world. The 
comedic possibilities are limitless. And there is nothing 
better than Adam and kids. It's going to be really fun."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Production will begin this year for a holiday 2008 release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandler worked with Disney on the 1998 hit "The Waterboy," 
but that film was released under the Touchstone Pictures label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is currently in theaters with the drama "Reign Over Me," 
which has earned just $13.5 million after two weeks. His most 
recent comedy, "Click," grossed $137.3 million at the domestic 
box office last year. On Saturday, he received the 2007 Kids'

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, April 6 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) released on Friday a detailed plan to compensate villagers affected by its expanded search for oil in Chad's southern Doba basin. The revised action plan follows findings of an independent report, which said the expansion of drilling had affected the livelihoods of families who survived off the land despite some cash compensation by the company . Exxon's affiliate, Esso Chad, commissioned the report following concerns expressed by the World Bank's private-sector lender, the International Finance Corp (IFC), which helped finance a pipeline that carries oil from Doba to the Atlantic Ocean through neighboring Cameroon. The IFC said families would be worse off in the long term if their livelihoods were not restored. Exxon operates the central African country's Doba pipeline, pumping 170,000 barrels a day through Cameroon, with partners Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Malaysia's state run Petronas. IFC funding for the project was made available on condition that oil profits from the project would go toward projects that benefit the poor. The action plan, which is posted on the company's Web site, identifies nine areas where Esso will improve compensation for families affected by drilling. Among these, Esso said it would improve the way it assesses who is affected by its work; clear a backlog of land still to be returned to families after drilling has taken place; resettle villagers where necessary, and reduce the impact of its drilling on farmland. Exxon also said it would set up a system to monitor the implementation of the plan, which will be tracked by Esso and IFC managers. An IFC official said the plan, if implemented as planned, will minimize the impact of the oil project and help strengthen the restoration of livelihoods.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - As foreign students prepare to graduate from U.S. universities this spring, many worry that a record number of applications for U.S. skilled-worker visas may cause them to lose jobs they have already been offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresh university graduates are vulnerable to being rejected for the H-1B visas designated for skilled workers. A record 150,000 H-1B applications were filed in one day this week, nearly double the number U.S. authorities are allowed to grant in a given fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flood of applications raised anew a domestic debate over quotas for the entry of foreign workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa shortages could ultimately discourage overseas students from studying in the United States over other countries with fewer restrictions on working visas for graduates, said Kay Clifford, associate director of the International Center at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm concerned that this will be discouraging to international students," she said. "They are worried about their futures. They are worried about the impact on their careers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the government allows students to stay in the country for a year, granting them an F-1 visa to work in a field related to their area of study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for many students that Clifford deals with, the ability to stay in the country and work for several years is a key component of their decision to study in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some employers will not bother hiring graduates unless they can get them an H-1B visa from the start of their employment, said Ted Ruthizer, head of the business immigration practice for New York law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an employer hires a graduate this spring and is not able to get an H-1B this year, the employee will only be able to work in the United States for 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if that employee manages to get an H-1B when the window opens again in April 2008, he or she would not be able to start work again until October 2008, leaving a gap where the worker would have to go on leave or work outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government will grant 65,000 H-1B visas this fiscal year to people with at least the equivalent of an undergraduate degree and expertise in a specialized field such as engineering or computer programming. An additional 20,000 visas are reserved for those with advanced academic degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That quota is "woefully inadequate," Ruthizer said. "I think everybody was caught off guard. It's a mess."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate lobbyists have tried to raise that threshold for years, citing a shortage of home-grown talent in the sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Semiconductor Corp., a maker of computer chips, said it had planned to hire 120 employees in the United States this year, 12 of whom require H-1B visas. But given the imbalance between the number of applications and visas to be issued, it is unlikely all of them will get work credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In many cases we are trying to convince kids to stay on in school so they don't get into that kind of predicament," said National Semiconductor Vice President Eddie Sweeney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is relatively easy to renew an H-1B visa for an employee who already holds one, other expert workers are also vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a Belgian scientist employed by National Semiconductor on a temporary visa will have to leave the country if he does not win a longer-term work permit through a lottery, Sweeney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some employers feel it is no longer worth the hassle to obtain U.S. visas for their staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet entrepreneur Rakesh Mathur spent years securing visas to hire engineers for a string of companies he founded in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his current venture, a Web technology company known as Webaroo, he decided to hire the bulk of his workers overseas, with 15 employees in the United States and about 100 in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The demand for talent is very real," he says. "And there is a shortfall of trained talent in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - T.J. Rodgers, chief executive of Cypress Semiconductor Corp., had a simple solution to the hassles of getting visas for foreign engineers he needed to run his $1 billion business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When I hire an Indian PhD today, I hire him in Bangalore, not San Jose. Now I can hire all I want and not have to worry about the vagaries of government decrees," Rodgers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've made it less tenable to do business here, so we do business elsewhere," Rodgers told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News this week that the U.S. immigration service hit its annual quota for skilled worker visas in one day highlighted what Rodgers and other executives said is the need for reform of a system overwhelmed by New Economy hiring demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the first day people could apply for the next round of H-1B visas that allow skilled foreigners to work in the United States, authorities were flooded with a record number of applications -- more than 150,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government plans to grant 65,000 H-1B visas to those who hold the equivalent of an undergraduate degree and have expertise in a specialized field. Another 20,000 visas will go to people with advanced degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives say the chronic shortage of American engineers, programmers and scientists is forcing many companies to expand overseas, while also squeezing smaller companies that do not have the money for such expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem, obviously, is that not every company has that ability to relocate people overseas," said Robert Hoffman, vice president of government affairs for business software maker Oracle Corp..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of small companies rely on H-1Bs. A lot of companies were started by those who were here on H-1Bs," said Hoffman, who is also co-chair of Compete America, an industry group that advocates easier rules on foreign workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also those on the other side of the fence who say the current system is not strict enough and that fewer foreign workers should be allowed in because they are taking jobs away from qualified U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem is that there are not enough skilled workers at ten to twenty thousand dollars below the market rate. That's the reason why these companies love these visas," said John Miano, founder of The Programmers Guild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guild president Kim Berry added by e-mail: "The fact that the cap was reached in one day indicates how important a cap is. The software job market is flat, and has been so for many years. If there were no cap, people would flood in until we were reduced to begging for day programming work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest software maker, counter that they often pay more to hire foreign workers since legal fees can run well over $10,000 per person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we're not able to hire these people, it puts increasing pressure on us and other companies to do that work abroad. It has the perverse impact of encouraging off-shoring," said Jack Krumholtz, head of Microsoft's Washington, D.C. office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates urged Congress to find ways to keep foreign students in the United States and help speed skilled foreigners obtain permanent residency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see the negative effects of these policies every day at Microsoft," Gates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navneet Chugh, an attorney with The Chugh Firm, a Los Angeles-based law firm representing about 50 Indian companies doing business in the United States, said the visa limits meant American companies will increasingly turn to off-shoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The IT environment in the United States and the IT manpower in India are two balloons tied to each other. When one is squeezed the air goes to the other. When the U.S. is unable to import software engineers, more work will go to India," Chugh added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston)&lt;/p&gt;

what Rodgers and other executives said is the need for reform 
of a system overwhelmed by New Economy hiring demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, the first day people could apply for the next 
round of H-1B visas that allow skilled foreigners to work in 
the United States, authorities were flooded with a record 
number of applications -- more than 150,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government plans to grant 65,000 H-1B visas to those 
who hold the equivalent of an undergraduate degree and have 
expertise in a specialized field. Another 20,000 visas will go 
to people with advanced degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Executives say the chronic shortage of American engineers, 
programmers and scientists is forcing many companies to expand 
overseas, while also squeezing smaller companies that do not 
have the money for such expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The problem, obviously, is that not every company has that 
ability to relocate people overseas," said Robert Hoffman, vice 
president of government affairs for business software maker 
Oracle Corp. ORCL.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A lot of small companies rely on H-1Bs. A lot of companies 
were started by those who were here on H-1Bs," said Hoffman, 
who is also co-chair of Compete America, an industry group that 
advocates easier rules on foreign workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are also those on the other side of the fence who say 
the current system is not strict enough and that fewer foreign 
workers should be allowed in because they are taking jobs away 
from qualified U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The problem is that there are not enough skilled workers 
at ten to twenty thousand dollars below the market rate. That's 
the reason why these companies love these visas," said John 
Miano, founder of The Programmers Guild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guild president Kim Berry added by e-mail: "The fact that 
the cap was reached in one day indicates how important a cap 
is. The software job market is flat, and has been so for many 
years. If there were no cap, people would flood in until we 
were reduced to begging for day programming work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companies such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), the world's 
biggest software maker, counter that they often pay more to 
hire foreign workers since legal fees can run well over $10,000 
per person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we're not able to hire these people, it puts increasing 
pressure on us and other companies to do that work abroad. It 
has the perverse impact of encouraging off-shoring," said Jack 
Krumholtz, head of Microsoft's Washington, D.C. office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates urged Congress to 
find ways to keep foreign students in the United States and 
help speed skilled foreigners obtain permanent residency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I see the negative effects of these policies every day at 
Microsoft," Gates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Navneet Chugh, an attorney with The Chugh Firm, a Los 
Angeles-based law firm representing about 50 Indian companies 
doing business in the United States, said the visa limits meant 
American companies will increasingly turn to off-shoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The IT environment in the United States and the IT 
manpower in India are two balloons tied to each other. When one 
is squeezed the air goes to the other. When the U.S. is unable 
to import software engineers, more work will go to India," 
Chugh added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) 
released on Friday a detailed plan to compensate villagers 
affected by its expanded search for oil in Chad's southern Doba 
basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The revised action plan follows findings of an independent 
report, which said the expansion of drilling had affected the 
livelihoods of families who survived off the land despite some 
cash compensation by the company .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's affiliate, Esso Chad, commissioned the report 
following concerns expressed by the World Bank's private-sector 
lender, the International Finance Corp (IFC), which helped 
finance a pipeline that carries oil from Doba to the Atlantic 
Ocean through neighboring Cameroon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IFC said families would be worse off in the long term 
if their livelihoods were not restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon operates the central African country's Doba pipeline, 
pumping 170,000 barrels a day through Cameroon, with partners 
Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Malaysia's state run Petronas. IFC 
funding for the project was made available on condition that 
oil profits from the project would go toward projects that 
benefit the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The action plan, which is posted on the company's Web site, 
identifies nine areas where Esso will improve compensation for 
families affected by drilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among these, Esso said it would improve the way it assesses 
who is affected by its work; clear a backlog of land still to 
be returned to families after drilling has taken place; 
resettle villagers where necessary, and reduce the impact of 
its drilling on farmland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon also said it would set up a system to monitor the 
implementation of the plan, which will be tracked by Esso and 
IFC managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An IFC official said the plan, if implemented as planned, 
will "minimize the impact of the oil project and help 
strengthen the restoration of livelihoods."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner Cable 
Inc. reached comprehensive distribution agreements that will 
include the launch of new Disney high-definition channels on 
the No. 2 U.S. cable operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The two companies said on Wednesday Time Warner Cable will 
carry sports channels ESPN2 HD and ESPNU later this year. Some 
systems will also offer Disney Channel on Demand and ESPN 
Desportes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time Warner Cable, which has 13.4 million subscribers, also 
agreed to carry three new high-definition channels -- ABC 
Family HD, Disney Channel HD and ESPNEWS HD -- in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the deal, the two companies extended their 
retransmission pact for Disney's ABC-owned broadcast television 
station on Time Warner Cable systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retransmission discussions between cable operators and 
broadcasters have become strained in recent months as 
broadcasters started to demand that cable operators pay for the 
right to carry the 'free-to-air' stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Media companies like Disney, which owns broadcasters 
alongside cable channels and movie studios, typically reach 
agreements with operators by bartering channel carriage and 
advertising for retransmission of the broadcast stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last November Disney hammered out a similar agreement, 
worth $1 billion with the U.S. No.1 cable company, Comcast 
Corp., after protracted discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial terms of the agreements between Disney and Time 
Warner Cable were not furnished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shows will also be offered on Time Warner Cable's 
"Start Over" service, which lets viewers start a show from the 
beginning at any point during a broadcast in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney will also provide content to Time Warner Cable's 
Quick Clips platform. Quick Clips are 2- to 10-minute clips of 
extra content relevant to certain network shows and at no 
additional cost to Time Warner Cable digital subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROME, April 8 (Reuters) - An Italian film showing Jesus
Christ drinking Coca-Cola sparked such strong protest from the
soft-drinks giant that it blocked the film's Easter weekend
premiere, the film makers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The film "7 km from Jerusalem" is about an Italian
advertising executive who is soul searching after losing his job
and marriage. He flies to Jerusalem, where he runs into Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to local press reports, he offers the returned
Christ a can of Coca-Cola and, seeing Jesus drinking the
beverage, thinks: "What a testimonial!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apparently Coca-Cola disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The multinational's Italian unit sent a legal letter

well-known beverage," the producers said on the film's Web site,

its brand was unacceptable and could get the company a bad
image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The director, Claudio Malaponti, said that if further talks
were unsuccessful, the scene would indeed be cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This recasting requires about 20 days and the hope is to be

quoted as saying on the Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A preview of the film can be seen on the movie's website:

Christ's scourging and crucifixion in blood-dripping detail,
opened across Europe just before Easter 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Catholics in Italy largely applauded the film, whose scenes
of Christ's final hours were filmed in the ancient Italian stone
city of Matera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jewish leaders across Europe expressed concern that the
film's unflattering depiction of Biblical-era Jews could boost
an anti-Semitism.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Roy Oswalt put a stop to Houston's season-opening four-game losing streak, pitching the Astros to a 5-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oswalt, recording his 99th career win with his 12th complete game, pitched a five-hitter to allow the Astros to avoid their worst start since the 1983 team lost its first nine games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlos Lee, Houston's big free agent signing, hit his first home run as an Astro, and Lance Berkman became the second player to hit 100 home runs in Houston's Minute Maid Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any time you lose four straight, whether it's at the beginning of the season or the middle of the season, you start to get kind of a bad feeling," Berkman told reporters. "It's good to erase that and turn the page."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswalt needed just 94 pitches to shut down the struggling world champion Cardinals, who fell to 1-4 in the season's first week. St. Louis is hitting .192 and has two homers as a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Atlanta's John Smoltz out-pitched former team mate Tom Glavine and the Braves handed the Mets their first loss in five games, 5-3. Smoltz pitched six innings, yielding two runs on seven hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Florida's Dontrelle Willis went six innings and struck out nine for his second victory of the year and Josh Willingham drove in four runs as the Marlins beat the Phillies 8-5, despite Jimmy Rollins's third home run of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Carlos Zambrano, rebounding from a shaky opening day start, went seven innings and Aramis Ramirez hit a two-run homer as the Cubs beat the Brewers 6-3 for their second straight weekend win in Milwaukee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sales of Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE.N) new 
inhaled insulin, Exubera, are off to such a sluggish start that 
the launch has cast doubts on the company's ability to hit its 
sales goals and may tarnish prospects for competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exubera, which was also developed by Nektar Therapeutics 
(NKTR.O), is the first approved insulin that diabetics inhale 
rather than inject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since its approval in January 2006, total weekly 
prescriptions in the United States have grown to only about 
1,300, according to recent data from analysts. By comparison, 
Merck  Co.'s (MRK.N) newly launched Januvia diabetes pill 
recently hit 39,000 prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's one of the worst launches ever," Natexis Bleichroeder 
analyst Jon LeCroy said of Exubera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exubera has been dogged by concerns about cost to the 
patient, lung safety and inconvenience of the device used to 
give the insulin, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The disappointing launch has led some analysts to project 
peak annual sales at levels far below the $2 billion that 
Pfizer said in January the product would eventually reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LeCroy projects that Exubera will reach only $300 million. 
Merrill Lynch analyst David Risinger last week cut his 2012 
forecast for U.S. Exubera sales to $250 million from $635 
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts say Exubera's slow start has also led to 
questions about the prospects for other inhaled insulin 
products, which trail Exubera by at least three years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PROSPECTS OF RIVALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MannKind Corp. (MNKD.O); a partnership of Eli Lilly and Co. 
(LLY.N) and Alkermes Inc. (ALKS.O); and Novo Nordisk A/S. 
(NOVOb.CO) have inhaled insulins in development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "My perspective is it's bad for everyone, because it means 
that the concept of inhaled insulin doesn't have a whole lot of 
cheerleaders out in the physician community," LeCroy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Kliff, publisher of the Diabetic Investor electronic 
newsletter, said that after Exubera's disappointing launch, 
physicians may be more wary of subsequent inhaled insulins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Any time you have a first-generation product with so much 
hype and so much free media that fails, you raise the bar for 
whoever's next in line," Kliff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think that it has made the road for Lilly and MannKind a 
little bit more difficult," Kliff added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer began a phased launch of Exubera early last year to 
specialist doctors and expanded the launch to primary care 
physicians in January of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MannKind shares have fallen about 30 percent from $21 in 
October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exubera's slow launch "has been part of (MannKind's) 
negative drift downward," LeCroy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alfred Mann, CEO of MannKind, said the company would rather 
that Exubera be successful to get patients and doctors 
comfortable with the idea of inhaled insulin. But he said 
MannKind's insulin has clinical differences from Pfizer's 
product as well as from other insulins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mann said his company's product acts quickly, with better 
glucose control that includes few cases seen for low blood 
sugar, or hypoglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our problem is going to be we need to educate people why 
our product is totally different," Mann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rebecca Peterson, vice president of corporate 
communications for Alkermes, said its insulin being developed 
with Lilly is administered with an easy-to-use device about the 
size of an asthma inhaler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exubera has been criticized as cumbersome, although Pfizer 
says patients who have used the device do not complain about 
it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe we have a much better mousetrap that would 
enable patients to more readily and easily take their 
medication," said Peterson, who also said the large clinical 
trial program for the product stands to distinguish it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOT THROWING IN TOWEL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Pfizer, which has annual sales of about $50 billion, 
Exubera is one of a number of new drugs that it hopes will help 
reinvigorate sales as its older medicines face competition from 
generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Nektar, its smaller co-developer, have fallen 44 
percent from a year-high in May 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's short-term struggles aside, some analysts say 
marketing efforts by the world's largest drugmaker still could 
help rivals by acclimating patients and doctors to inhaled 
insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rochelle Chaiken, a Pfizer medical executive for 
cardiovascular and metabolism, said it has taken a while to 
educate physicians and medical staff about the use of Exubera 
and the importance of early insulin use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We underestimated the kind of education an innovative

that the $2 billion in annual sales remained an "achievable 
goal" but may take longer to reach than the company originally 
expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While agreeing that Exubera's launch has been 
disappointing, Wilbur said, "It's not a battle that's going to 
be won and lost in a six-to-12 month period."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sales of Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE.N) new 
inhaled insulin, Exubera, are off to such a sluggish start that 
the launch has cast doubts on the company's ability to hit its 
sales goals and may tarnish prospects for competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exubera, which was also developed by Nektar Therapeutics 
(NKTR.O), is the first approved insulin that diabetics inhale 
rather than inject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since its approval in January 2006, total weekly 
prescriptions in the United States have grown to only about 
1,300, according to recent data from analysts. By comparison, 
Merck  Co.'s (MRK.N) newly launched Januvia diabetes pill 
recently hit 39,000 prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's one of the worst launches ever," Natexis Bleichroeder 
analyst Jon LeCroy said of Exubera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exubera has been dogged by concerns about cost to the 
patient, lung safety and inconvenience of the device used to 
give the insulin, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The disappointing launch has led some analysts to project 
peak annual sales at levels far below the $2 billion that 
Pfizer said in January the product would eventually reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LeCroy projects that Exubera will reach only $300 million. 
Merrill Lynch analyst David Risinger last week cut his 2012 
forecast for U.S. Exubera sales to $250 million from $635 
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts say Exubera's slow start has also led to 
questions about the prospects for other inhaled insulin 
products, which trail Exubera by at least three years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PROSPECTS OF RIVALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MannKind Corp. (MNKD.O); a partnership of Eli Lilly and Co. 
(LLY.N) and Alkermes Inc. (ALKS.O); and Novo Nordisk A/S. 
(NOVOb.CO) have inhaled insulins in development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "My perspective is it's bad for everyone, because it means 
that the concept of inhaled insulin doesn't have a whole lot of 
cheerleaders out in the physician community," LeCroy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Kliff, publisher of the Diabetic Investor electronic 
newsletter, said that after Exubera's disappointing launch, 
physicians may be more wary of subsequent inhaled insulins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Any time you have a first-generation product with so much 
hype and so much free media that fails, you raise the bar for 
whoever's next in line," Kliff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think that it has made the road for Lilly and MannKind a 
little bit more difficult," Kliff added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer began a phased launch of Exubera early last year to 
specialist doctors and expanded the launch to primary care 
physicians in January of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MannKind shares have fallen about 30 percent from $21 in 
October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exubera's slow launch "has been part of (MannKind's) 
negative drift downward," LeCroy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alfred Mann, CEO of MannKind, said the company would rather 
that Exubera be successful to get patients and doctors 
comfortable with the idea of inhaled insulin. But he said 
MannKind's insulin has clinical differences from Pfizer's 
product as well as from other insulins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mann said his company's product acts quickly, with better 
glucose control that includes few cases seen for low blood 
sugar, or hypoglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our problem is going to be we need to educate people why 
our product is totally different," Mann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rebecca Peterson, vice president of corporate 
communications for Alkermes, said its insulin being developed 
with Lilly is administered with an easy-to-use device about the 
size of an asthma inhaler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exubera has been criticized as cumbersome, although Pfizer 
says patients who have used the device do not complain about 
it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe we have a much better mousetrap that would 
enable patients to more readily and easily take their 
medication," said Peterson, who also said the large clinical 
trial program for the product stands to distinguish it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOT THROWING IN TOWEL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Pfizer, which has annual sales of about $50 billion, 
Exubera is one of a number of new drugs that it hopes will help 
reinvigorate sales as its older medicines face competition from 
generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Nektar, its smaller co-developer, have fallen 44 
percent from a year-high in May 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's short-term struggles aside, some analysts say 
marketing efforts by the world's largest drugmaker still could 
help rivals by acclimating patients and doctors to inhaled 
insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rochelle Chaiken, a Pfizer medical executive for 
cardiovascular and metabolism, said it has taken a while to 
educate physicians and medical staff about the use of Exubera 
and the importance of early insulin use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We underestimated the kind of education an innovative 
product like Exubera would need in doctors' offices," Chaiken 
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer plans to start a consumer advertising campaign for 
Exubera this summer, and its impact will be closely watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This may be a market where being a fast-moving second or 
third entrant frankly is the ideal spot," CIBC analyst Elliot

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts first paragraph, adds average prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 10 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N)
expects its first quarter profit to rise from the fourth
quarter on a large gain from a sale, but said results will be
hurt by decreased use of its refineries and lower oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. oil and gas producer said on
Tuesday it expects an after-tax gain of $700 million in the
quarter from the sale of its 31 percent stake of its Nerefco
refinery in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which plans to release its results on April
27, posted earnings of $3.77 billion, or $1.74 a share, in the
fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The average first quarter earnings forecast of analysts,
which generally excludes one-time items such as the refinery
sale from their projections, was $1.67 a share, according
Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The San Ramon, Calif., company said the amount of crude
processed at Chevron's U.S. refineries fell 20 percent during
the first two months of the quarter as a fire at its Richmond,
California, refinery lengthened planned maintenance at the
unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said it did not fully benefit from higher first quarter
benchmark refining margins on the U.S. West Coast due to the
repairs at Richmond. It said international refining margins
were also below indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also said oil and gas production in the first
two months of 2007 fell about 1.7 percent from fourth quarter
levels. It produced an average of 2.61 million barrels of oil
equivalent per day, down from about 2.66 million barrels of oil
equivalent per day in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has said it expects its 2007 production to average
about 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, down about
70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from last year's
levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, the company said most of that decline
would come from Venezuela, where the company will lose about
64,000 barrels per day as the government increases its control
over some Chevron assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But most of the drop in January and February came in the
United States, where dropped about 3 percent due to downtime at
third-party pipelines that affected its assets in the Gulf of
Mexico and San Joaquin Valley regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its international production dipped about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's average price for U.S. crude oil it sold in the
first two months fell to $50.33 per barrel, down from $52.98
per barrel in the fourth quarter and $54.99 per barrel in the
first quarter of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its average price for liquids produced outside the U.S.
dropped to $49.05 per barrel in January and February from
$51.77 in the fourth quarter and $55.13 per barrel in the first
quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's U.S. gas prices averaged $6.16 per thousand
cubic feet in the period, compared with $5.90 per thousand
cubic feet in the previous quarter and $7.46 per thousand cubic
feet in the first quarter of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its international gas prices rose to an average of $3.93
per thousand cubic feet from $3.67 per thousand cubic feet in
the fourth quarter and $3.78 per thousand cubic feet last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company noted that benchmark pricing for crude and
liquids rose in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares closed at $77.04 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Tuesday, after reaching a new record of $77.22
earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil company share prices have jumped recently as concerns
about tensions with Iran and supplies of gasoline ahead of the
U.S. driving season have pushed up oil prices.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) warned of four security flaws in its software that it categorized as "critical" on Tuesday that could allow attackers to gain control of a user's computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose Windows operating system runs some 95 percent of the world's computers, issued the patches as part of its monthly security bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest software maker defines a flaw as "critical" when it could allow a damaging Internet worm to replicate without the user's doing anything to the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said the "critical" patches fixed three holes in its Windows operating system and another in its Content Management Server product. Microsoft also issued another security update for Windows it rated at the lower threat level of "important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fixes come a little more than a week after it released a patch outside of the regular monthly update to plug a security hole related to an animated cursor that hackers had used to launch attacks after users clicked on links to malicious Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has been working to improve the security and reliability of its software as more and more malicious software target weaknesses in Windows and other Microsoft software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest patches can be downloaded at www.microsoft.com/security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 10 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N)
expects first quarter earnings to rise from the fourth quarter,
helped by a gain from the sale of its stake in a Dutch
refinery, the second-largest U.S. oil and gas producer said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the company said decreased use of its refineries and
lower oil prices would partially offset benefits of the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also said oil and gas production in the first

&lt;p&gt;ROME (Reuters) - An Italian film showing Jesus Christ 
drinking Coca-Cola sparked such strong protest from the 
soft-drinks giant that it blocked the film's Easter weekend 
premiere, the film makers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The film "7 km from Jerusalem" is about an Italian 
advertising executive who is soul searching after losing his 
job and marriage. He flies to Jerusalem, where he runs into 
Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to local press reports, he offers the returned 
Christ a can of Coca-Cola and, seeing Jesus drinking the 
beverage, thinks: "What a testimonial!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apparently Coca-Cola disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The multinational's Italian unit sent a legal letter 
forcing the elimination of the scene in which Jesus drinks the 
well-known beverage," the producers said on the film's Web 
site, here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Italian media reported that the company felt that the use 
of its brand was unacceptable and could get the company a bad 
image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The director, Claudio Malaponti, said that if further talks 
were unsuccessful, the scene would indeed be cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This recasting requires about 20 days and the hope is to 
be able to have in cinemas by the end of April," Malaponti was 
quoted as saying on the Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A preview of the film can be seen on the movie's website: 
here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was not the first time that a controversial film about 
Jesus was meant to open just before the Easter holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ," which depicted 
Christ's scourging and crucifixion in blood-dripping detail, 
opened across Europe just before Easter 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Catholics in Italy largely applauded the film, whose scenes 
of Christ's final hours were filmed in the ancient Italian 
stone city of Matera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jewish leaders across Europe expressed concern that the 
film's unflattering depiction of Biblical-era Jews could boost 
an anti-Semitism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details; recasts first paragraph) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, April 10 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) has offered to exchange $323 million worth of backdated Pixar Animation Studios Inc. stock options, which were the subject of an internal investigation, for higher-priced options and cash, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pixar had awarded the backdated options to its employees before Disney bought it last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The highest possible cost to Disney for making the exchange is $33.5 million, including tax contributions, the company said on Monday in the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The filing showed that backdating at Pixar was not confined to top executives, who were not included in the exchange offer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The exchange applies only to unexercised options that had original exercise prices that were less than fair market value on the day they were issued. Disney said it would withhold taxes from the cash payments issued to participating employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney Chairman John Pepper revealed last month that Pixar had issued backdated options, but said his company would see no financial impact from it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney purchased Pixar in May in a $7.4 billion all-stock transaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sanders Morris Harris analyst David Miller said the aggregate value of the backdated options was not a surprise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I'm not really that concerned," Miller said. "I think that this is something that Disney will settle, and this is something that will quickly go away." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney shares were up 6 cents at $34.97 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The aggregate amount of $323 million, calculated under the  Black-Scholes-Merton method for valuing options, assumes that all eligible options will be tendered under Disney's offer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As of March 30, there were 15.5 million shares of Disney common stock eligible for exchange, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Gina Keating, editing by Lisa Von Ahn; Reuters Messaging: gina.keating.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 213 955 6776)) Keywords: DISNEY/OPTIONS  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds company comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s
(GS.N) Cogentrix Energy Inc. subsidiary signed a letter of
intent with Hunton Energy that would make Cogentrix the lead
equity partner in the proposed $2.4 billion Lockwood power plant
in Texas, Hunton said Monday in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lockwood is a 1,200-megawatt integrated gasification
combined cycle (IGCC) project in Fort Bend County, southwest of
Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunton Energy, a division of the Hunton Group, wants to
build the project in two phases, with construction of the first
phase expected to start in the first quarter of 2008 and
scheduled to enter service in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IGCC technology, a variation of a natural gas-fired combined
cycle plant, uses coal or petroleum-derived gas in a gas turbine
to generate electricity and then uses the hot gas leaving the
turbine to heat water to produce steam to power a steam turbine
and generate more power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IGCC technology allows for the separation of the pollutants
currently regulated in the United States -- nitrogen oxide,
sulfur dioxide and mercury -- from the gas before burning it,
and in the future may allow for the capture of carbon dioxide, a
greenhouse gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Houston-based Tondu Corp. and Princeton, New Jersey-based
NRG Energy (NRG.N) are also looking at IGCC projects in Texas, a
state that needs additional electric generation to meet growing
demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dallas-based TXU Corp. TXU.N is also studying IGCC options
to partially offset scrapped plans for eight traditional
pulverized coal units that drew harsh criticism from
environmental groups and elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunton's Lockwood plant will use petroleum coke or "pet
coke" as its primary fuel. Pet coke is a refinery byproduct with
properties similar to coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunton has a 200-acre site under contract subject to the
successful negotiation of tax incentives. Hunton has a letter of
intent with Valero Energy Corp. (VLO.N) to receive pet coke for
processing in return for power generated at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for Hunton said the company has sent revised
solicitations to consortiums led by General Electric Co. (GE.N),
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Shell Oil Co. (RDSa.L) regarding the
gasification technology to be used at Lockwood.  Responses are
expected this summer. Once the technology is selected, Hunton
officials will proceed to file for an air permit, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Lockwood project has been reconfigured to increase the
level of carbon dioxide that can be captured from 35 percent to
as much as 75 percent, the spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Texas, one megawatt supplies enough electricity for about
500 homes.

(MSFT.O) said on Tuesday it expects its China sales to rise more than 20 percent this year, boosted by new products and a national crackdown on software piracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Responding to complaints by Western governments and companies, as well as criticism from a growing field of domestic firms, China has been clamping down on piracy over the last two years to the benefit of software makers such as Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As part of the campaign, most of the nation's top domestic PC sellers, including Lenovo (0992.HK) and Founder, have pushed to boost their number of PCs sold with legal copies of Microsoft's Windows operating systems already installed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Other major foreign players in the market, including global leaders Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) and Dell DELL.O, are pushing similar policies in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Reflecting the trend, only about 30 percent of Lenovo PCs now being sold will ultimately contain pirated Windows systems, down sharply from 90 percent last year, said Timothy Chen, chief executive officer of Microsoft's greater China region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We've made great progress there," he told Reuters on the sidelines of an event in Taipei.    China is the world's second-largest PC market by unit sales, with more than 20 million units shipped last year, according to data tracking firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Following the implementation of China's crackdown starting in late 2005, IDC estimated the number of PCs sold with legal copies of Windows reached about 50 percent in last year's first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rampant piracy there previously made the market a difficult one for software makers like Microsoft, with many industry watchers estimating that most computers in the country used pirated copies of Windows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Chen added that growth was also coming from new product sales, including the company's newly introduced Vista operating system, the next-generation equivalent of Windows, which Microsoft rolled out at the beginning of this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company plans to launch seven new products in China this year, and another six in 2008, Chen said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It is a great year for the region," he said. "Vista is selling very well."  Microsoft founder Bill Gates said in February that Vista had been well received and that PC vendors had seen a nice lift in their sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (US$1=T$33.1) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Sheena Lee, editing by Doug Young; Reuters Messaging: sheena.lee.reuters.com@reuters.net; +886 2 2508-0815)) Keywords: MICROSOFT TAIWAN/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co. (DOW.N) and Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. (CVX.N) (COP.N) said on Tuesday they planned to join forces to produce plastics and raw materials used to make products ranging from car parts to foam packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planned 50-50 joint venture would link up the world's second- and eighth-largest styrenics companies, bringing Dow's vast processing and marketing arms into partnership with a business operated by two of the world's largest oil producers, Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The advantage of getting together is their upstream and our downstream complement each other," Dow Chief Executive Andrew Liveris told CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow, which has been the subject of several takeover rumors, issued a statement on Monday saying it was not holding discussions regarding a possible leveraged buyout, as was reported in a British newspaper twice in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 50-50 joint venture, which would link the companies' polystyrene and styrene monomer assets, is expected to close in the second half of the year and yield significant synergies in manufacturing, commercial operations and feedstock costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The styrenics business has long been a money loser for Dow, one analyst said, and the company has embarked on a strategy to shift away from the lower margin, commodity chemicals businesses toward higher-value specialty chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would imagine that in a best-case scenario, they may be able to break even or just eke out a profit for this JV," HSBC analyst Hassan Ahmed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical's shares fell 2.7 percent in early trading to $45.38 per share on the New York Stock Exchange, while the broader Standard  Poor's 500 Index was slightly firmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No financial details were released from the planned link-up under the nonbinding memorandum of understanding signed by the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new partnership is expected to combine Dow's styrene monomer plant in Camacari, Brazil, and six polystyrene plants in the United States, Colombia and Brazil, with Chevron Phillips' Louisiana styrene monomer plant and Ohio polystyrene plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips Chemical was formed in 2000 from the petrochemical businesses of Chevron and Phillips Petroleum Corp, which is part of ConocoPhillips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it added Oracle
Corp. ORCL.O to its "buy" list and moved it to the software
coverage group following a change in analyst covering the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it also raised its price target on the stock

second-largest maker of business applications before being
moved from the application and infrastructure software group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oracle is at the threshold of going to market with a
strengthened product set across database, applications and
middleware, it said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it believes some multiple expansion is likely
as this momentum becomes evident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oracle's applications business is poised to gain share with
customer-centric policies and aggressive vertical focus, while
the company's broad middleware stack is set to take significant
share, driving into the company's large installed customer
base, analyst Sarah Friar wrote in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, Oracle trades at a substantial discount to the
group despite in-line organic growth, Goldman added.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s
(GS.N) Cogentrix Energy Inc. subsidiary signed a letter of
intent with Hunton Energy that would make Cogentrix the lead
equity partner in the proposed $2.4 billion Lockwood power
plant in Texas, Hunton said Monday in a release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lockwood is a 1,200-megawatt integrated gasification
combined cycle (IGCC) project in Fort Bend County, southwest of
Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunton Energy, a division of the Hunton Group, wants to
build the project in two phases with construction of the first
phase expected to start in the first quarter of 2008 and
scheduled to enter service in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IGCC technology, a variation of a natural gas-fired
combined cycle plant, uses coal or petroleum-derived gas in a
gas turbine to generate electricity and then uses the hot gas
leaving the turbine to heat water to produce steam to power a
steam turbine and generate more power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IGCC technology allows for the separation of the pollutants
currently regulated in the United States -- nitrogen oxide,
sulfur dioxide and mercury -- from the gas before burning it,
and in the future may allow for the capture of carbon dioxide,
a greenhouse gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Lockwood plant will use petroleum coke or "pet coke" as
its primary fuel. Pet coke is a refinery byproduct with
properties similar to coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunton has a 200-acre site under contract subject to the
successful negotiation of tax incentives, and a long-term
supply arrangement with Valero Energy Corp. (VLO.N) to receive
pet coke for processing in return for power generated at the
plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The developer also said it was involved in discussions with
consortiums led by General Electric Co. (GE.N) and
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) regarding the gasification process for
the Lockwood Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We anticipate executing a letter of intent with either the
GE or ConocoPhillips in early first quarter 2007," Richard
Hunton Jr., executive vice president, said in a release in
January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also said it expected to file for a permit
during the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project will likely create over 1,200 construction jobs
while under development and 150 permanent jobs.

changing technologies and business models could hit Microsoft's
position in desktops, and deplete its "cash cow".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors continue to be nervous about the uncertainty over
the software giant's spending plans in 2008 and on recent
negative comments from Microsoft on the operating system Vista,
the brokerage said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman kept its "buy" rating on Microsoft, and has a price
target of $36 for the stock.

&lt;p&gt; (adds detail, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Saeed Azhar &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SINGAPORE, April 10 (Reuters) - Six private bankers have quit UBS AG (UBSN.VX) in Singapore to join rival Goldman Sachs (GS.N), banking sources said on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The six include senior private banker Shern Liang Tan, who spent several years at UBS and who was previously with Citigroup. Three of the bankers have clients with assets of at least $50 million, banking sources told Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    UBS declined to comment, while Goldman Sachs was not available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    UBS is the world's biggest wealth manager. In Asia, it has $100 billion in assets, equivalent to almost 10 percent of its global assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    UBS currently has more than 20 bankers in Singapore in its key client team, which handles wealthy individuals with assets of more than $50 million. Across the whole of Asia, UBS has a key client team of 60 bankers in total, a source said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The moves are another sign of fierce competition among private banks to poach talent in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last year a quarter of the private banking team of Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. (OCBC.SI) left the Singapore bank to join rival foreign banks, banking sources said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tan Su Shan, managing director Citigroup Private Bank Singapore, told Reuters in January that the last two years had been particularly bad for private banks as rivals tried to lure teams of experienced bankers with extensive contacts books. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I think too many private banks were trying to steal other bankers with books. That in 2005 and part of 2006 led to high turnover in the industry which I have said over and over again is not healthy for banks or the clients," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bankers say the situation has improved in 2007 because more graduates are coming out of universities and training institutes while private banks are also training bankers in-house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This week, UBS will open a wealth management campus in Singapore that has the capacity to train a total of 5,000 UBS wealth management staff in the next four years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last year Citigroup started legal proceedings against six bankers who were poached by UBS in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In recent years, Singapore has emerged as a key centre for wealth management in Asia, and a string of international banks have moved their regional chiefs for private banking to Singapore.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Citigroup this month appointed Deepak Sharma to run its global wealth management business outside the United States from Singapore, making him the bank's only international business head not to be based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Merrill Lynch/Capgemini expects the wealth of millionaires in Asia to grow by 6.7 percent a year through 2010 to $10.6 trillion, ahead of the global average of 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Saeed Azhar, editing by Geert De Clercq; saeed.azhar@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: saeed.azhar.reuters.com@reuters.net; +65 64035664)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For more stories about Singapore's fast-growing financial services industry, please double-click on [nSINFIN] Keywords: UBS SINGAPORE/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;"A macro trend that we see ... is that corporates in Europe will accept more aggressive balance sheets and weaker ratings," Hamish Buckland, co-head of leveraged finance at JP Morgan, said at the Reuters Hedge Funds and Private Equity Summit in London on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pressure is going to come ... from the institutional shareholders, the public equity guys, who are saying: 'Rather than sell and be taken private, let's be more aggressive and more efficient about how we manage our balance sheet, do some of the things private equity have in their toolbox,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change is unlikely to be swift, Buckland said, but as a result corporates are expected to take up a greater share of the leveraged loan market, which is dominated in Europe by financing for leveraged buyouts by private equity firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A downgrade to "junk"-status ratings can raise a company's funding costs, but the huge increase in the funding available in the leveraged debt markets in recent years means that the prospect of moving out of investment-grade territory may not be as worrying as in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area that may drive this is mergers and acquisitions, with companies willing to consider losing investment-grade status for the right deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last year, German chemicals company Lanxess (LXSG.DE) made waves in the credit markets by saying it would countenance temporary double-B category ratings for an acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, Standard  Poor's said it might cut retailer Pinault Printemps Redoute's (PRTP.PA) rating to "junk" as a result of its bid for sportswear maker Puma (PUMG.DE), which is being financed entirely with bank debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We certainly see the number of companies that are prepared to consider all-cash debt-financed acquisitions increasing," Buckland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the activity in this area in the past has been in the telecoms, media and technology sector, where leverage has been used historically and companies and investors are comfortable with the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is a growing consideration in the case of cross-border acquisitions, and also a popular technique among emerging-market borrowers looking to acquire European assets, such as Tata Steel's TISC.CO acquisition of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the trend would mark a change in corporate psychology for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think (there has been) general unwillingness around corporate Europe to take on the stigma of sub-investment grade," Buckland said. "In the past it's always been associated with fallen angels ... and not viewed as an efficient way of managing the capital structure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But in the U.S. it's perfectly acceptable in the public equity markets for a quoted company to be double-B, even single-B," he said. "I think we will see a gradual move towards a U.S.-style model."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, April 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) has hired two more private bankers from UBS AG (UBSN.VX)
and two from JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), raising the total
number of private bankers recently hired in Singapore to 10, a
source said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This marks the most aggressive hiring spree by the private
wealth management arm of the U.S. bank in Singapore for some
time, the source told Reuters, adding the bank plans to add more
people to tap growing wealth in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, banking sources told Reuters Goldman had hired
six private bankers from UBS, including senior private banker
Shern Liang Tan, who spent several years at UBS and who was
previously with Citigroup (C.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two additional hires from UBS were from a different team
of key client advisers, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's wealth management unit targets the ultra-rich and
the firm says its clients include 43 percent of Forbes
magazine's 400 list of wealthiest individuals, according to its
website www.gs.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS is the world's biggest wealth manager. In Asia, it has
$100 billion in assets, equivalent to almost 10 percent of its
global assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A recent survey by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini predicted 
the wealth of millionaires in Asia would grow by 6.7 percent a
year through 2010 to $10.6 trillion, ahead of the global average
of 6 percent.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI, April 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co.'s (JPM.N)
Chinese fund management venture said on Wednesday it had received
nearly 90 billion yuan ($11.7 billion) of subscriptions to its
new equities fund in a single day -- over 10 times its original
sales target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The oversubscription ratio is one of the highest seen at any
fund since China's stock market bull run began a year ago, and
suggests new Chinese investors are continuing to enter the
market, fund managers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China International Fund Management Co. initially hoped to
raise up to 8 billion yuan with its new retail fund, which will
invest in consumer-related stocks, the joint venture's chief
executive Mandy Wang told Reuters in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said on Wednesday it had now decided to raise up
to 10 billion yuan, while returning the rest of the subscriptions
to applicants. The new fund, which is the venture's sixth, began
sales on Tuesday and closed them at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Harvest Fund Management Co., China's largest fund
company, raised a record 41.9 billion yuan in a one-day sales
promotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year, however, regulators are capping new funds at 10
billion yuan each, partly out of concern that excessively large
funds could destabilise the industry or the stock market,
industry sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than 50 new mutual fund applications are awaiting
Beijing's approval, and industry sources told Reuters on Monday
that the process could be slowed by regulators' worries about the
stock market overheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's benchmark stock index .SSEC, which set a fresh
all-time high on Wednesday, is up 31 percent from the end of last
year and soared 130 percent in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, HSBC Holdings Plc.'s (0005.HK)(HSBA.L) fund
management joint venture HSBC Jintrust Fund Management Co. raised
about 5.3 billion yuan for its new equities fund.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) warned of four security flaws in its software that it categorized as "critical" on Tuesday that could allow attackers to gain control of a user's computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose Windows operating system runs some 95 percent of the world's computers, issued the patches as part of its monthly security bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest software maker defines a flaw as "critical" when it could allow a damaging Internet worm to replicate without the user's doing anything to the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said the "critical" patches fixed three holes in its Windows operating system and another in its Content Management Server product. Microsoft also issued another security update for Windows it rated at the lower threat level of "important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fixes come a little more than a week after it released a patch outside of the regular monthly update to plug a security hole related to an animated cursor that hackers had used to launch attacks after users clicked on links to malicious Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has been working to improve the security and reliability of its software as more and more malicious software target weaknesses in Windows and other Microsoft software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest patches can be downloaded at www.microsoft.com/security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects story first issued on April 12 to remove word
"deepwater" from first paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 (Reuters) - Top U.S. oil major
ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) has started up gas production from the
Tabu gas field off northeastern Malaysia, the firm's Malaysian
unit said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Production from the non-associated gas project, 200 km (124
miles) off the coast of the Malaysian state of Terengganu, is
expected to peak at 180 million cubic feet per day, the firm
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project, with a total development cost of $182 million
under a production sharing contract between field operator
ExxonMobil and Petronas Carigali, a unit of state oil firm
Petronas [PETR.UL], aims to help meet rising gas demand in
Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are pleased with the start-up, which will contribute
further towards Malaysia's energy security," the statement
quoted Liam Mallon, ExxonMobil's Malaysia chief, as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil's unit, ExxonMobil Exploration and Production
Malaysia Inc., is one of the largest crude oil producers and
suppliers of natural gas to Malaysia, and operates as a
contractor to Petronas under production sharing contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm, which produces about 200,000 barrels per day
(bpd) of crude oil and about 1 billion cubic feet of natural
gas, now operates more than 40 platforms and has interests in
17 fields offshore Terengganu.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Biotechnology company MedImmune Inc. 
MEDI.O has hired Goldman Sachs to explore a sale of the 
company, which industry analysts said could fetch $11 billion 
to $12 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Confirming what sources had earlier told Reuters, the group 
said on Thursday it had decided to seek bids following 
indications of interest by big drugmakers and dissatisfaction 
over the stock price performance among some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It added the process was well under way but there was no 
guarantee that a sale would be concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One person familiar with the situation said a speedy 
disposal looked likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think a transaction will happen in the next four to five 
weeks," said the source, who requested anonymity because of the 
confidential nature of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MedImmune has been the subject of takeover speculation for 
some time, with talk of a bid intensifying since billionaire 
investor Carl Icahn disclosed in February he owned 2.8 million 
shares of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock had already risen 20 percent since then and 
gained as much as 14 percent in early trade on the Nasdaq on 
Wednesday to hit a five-year high of $43.18, valuing the 
business at just over $10 billion. Other biotech shares also 
rose on the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MedImmune, one of the larger independent biotech firms in 
the United States, is best known as the maker of the nasal 
spray flu vaccine FluMist, but it also has two other marketed 
products, Synagis for infectious respiratory disease and Ethyol 
for reducing chemotherapy side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company announced on Monday it expected first-quarter 
earnings to have tripled, driven by higher-than-expected sales 
of Synagis, which has had reimbursement problems in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One person familiar with the situation said MedImmune 
should see good demand from bidders, since it is a relative 
rarity among biotech firms in already having commercial 
products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That may make it attractive to a number of large drugmakers 
looking to bolster their portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset 
Advisors, a shareholder in MedImmune who has been pushing for 
the sale of the company, welcomed the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It makes enormous sense in terms of maximizing shareholder 
value," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman is expert in running strategic reviews ... The 
company should be sold for a healthy price, probably starting 
at $45," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Sonnier, an analyst with William Blair, estimated 
MedImmune was worth between $45 and $50 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katz noted that many big drug companies, facing a wave of 
patent expirations, had expressed interest in biotech as a way 
to build their businesses in infectious diseases, oncology and 
value-added vaccines, all areas where MedImmune has products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Potential acquirers could include Merck  Co. Inc. (MRK.N), 
Wyeth WYE.N, Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY.N) and Abbott 
Laboratories Inc. (ABT.N) among U.S. pharmaceutical groups, 
other sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Europe, Novartis AG (NOVN.VX) is seen by some as a 
potential suitor, though one person familiar with the situation 
said the Swiss firm was not interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novartis earlier on Thursday announced it was selling its 
Gerber baby-food business for $5.5 billion to Nestle SA 
(NESN.VX) to focus fully on healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), which is hungry for assets to 
refill a depleted new drugs pipeline, is also a possible 
suitor, but GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) is considered unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials at these companies declined to comment or were 
not immediately available to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MedImmune already has links with Glaxo and Merck, since it 
is entitled to royalties on sales of the companies' rival HPV 
vaccines, Cervarix and Gardasil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; France's Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA) and Australia's CSL 
Ltd. (CSL.AX) also have technology licensing deals with the 
company, while Abbott is co-promoter of Synagis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major holders of MedImmune stock include Goldman, with an

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil major Chevron Corp. and forest 
products company Weyerhaeuser Co. said on Thursday they plan to 
study the possible development of biofuels from non-food 
sources including wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The companies will focus on developing technology to 
transform wood and other cellulosic sources into clean-burning 
fuels for cars and trucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ethanol from plant cellulose has the same chemical 
properties as ethanol made from corn or sugar cane, but it can 
be produced from a variety of nonedible materials such as 
cereal straw, sawdust and switchgrass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the United States, corn is the dominant feedstock used 
to make ethanol. As the number of corn-fed ethanol plants has 
mushroomed, the price of the crop has risen sharply this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron is investing in cellulosic biofuels, because we 
believe they will play a role in meeting future energy growth," 
said Chevron Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe this partnership will accelerate the 
achievement of that reality," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his State of the Union speech in January, President

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, changes dateline from AMSTERDAM) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, April 12 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa and U.S. private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners are in the race to buy television production company Endemol EML.AS, the Financial Times reported on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The paper said the two were among at least five groups that made it to the second round of an auction in which Spain's Telefonica (TEF.MC) is selling its 75 percent stake in Endemol. the company it bought in 2000 for 5.5 billion euros ($7.38 billion). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Televisa spokesman could not comment immediately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last year, Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) lost a bidding war for U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications Inc. It was defeated by an investor group that included Thomas H. Lee Partners [THL.UL] and media mogul Haim Saban. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    After its defeat, Televisa decided to sell its 11 percent stake in Univision UVN.N, receiving $1.094 billion in the sale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa has a joint venture with Dutch company Endemol Mexico, which dates back to 2001 and was behind the production of the successful local version of "Big Brother" along with other talent shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But the Mexican company, the biggest producer of Spanish-language content in the world, will face tough competition in the race for Endemol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cyrte, the investment vehicle of Endemol co-founder John de Mol, confirmed on Wednesday it was preparing a bid for the "Big Brother" producer with Italy's Mediaset (MS.MI) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    According to recent media reports, Endemol's former chief operating officer, Tom Barnicoat, has teamed up with private equity firm Apax [APAX.UL] for a bid, with another group led by the head of Endemol's French operations, Stephane Courbit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts have cited Endemol's run of hit formats, global network, strong cash generation and under-leveraged financial position as attractive features for potential bidders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Endemol shares have more than doubled from a November 2005 issue price of 9 euros. They were up 0.48 percent at 23.01 euros on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    At Wednesday's closing price of 22.90 euros, Endemol's market capitalization was 2.9 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.7448 Euro) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Niclas Mika in Amsterdam and Cyntia Barrera Diaz in Mexico City; editing by John Wallace; cyntia.barrera.reuters.com@reuters.net; +5255 5282 7161)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for:  * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com      * BridgeStation: view story .134                              For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: ENDEMOL/SALE  - Keywords: ENDEMOL/SALE  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM, April 12 (Reuters) - Televisa (TV.N), the world's largest Spanish-language broadcaster, and U.S. private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners [THL.UL] are in the race to buy television production company Endemol EML.AS, the Financial Times reported on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The paper said the two were among at least five groups to have made it through to the second round of the auction in which Spain's Telefonica (TEF.MC) is selling its 75 percent stake in the company it bought in 2000 for 5.5 billion euros ($7.38 billion). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cyrte, the investment vehicle of Endemol co-founder John de Mol, confirmed on Wednesday it was preparing a bid for the "Big Brother" producer with Italy's Mediaset (MS.MI) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N).  According to recent media reports, Endemol's former chief operating officer, Tom Barnicoat, has teamed up with private equity firm Apax [APAX.UL] for a bid, with another group led by the head of Endemol's French operations, Stephane Courbit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Some consortia remain fluid and others could enter the fray, the paper said, citing people familiar with the auction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts have cited Endemol's run of hit formats, global network, strong cash generation and underleveraged financial position as attractive features for potential bidders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Endemol shares have more than doubled from a November 2005 issue price of 9 euros. The shares closed at 22.90 euros on Wednesday, giving the company a market capitalisation of about 2.9 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Niclas Mika; editing by Sue Thomas; niclas.mika@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: niclas.mika.reuters.com@reuters.net; +31 20 504 5008)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.7448 Euro)   Keywords: ENDEMOL/SALE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) warned of four security flaws in its software that it categorized as "critical" on Tuesday that could allow attackers to gain control of a user's computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose Windows operating system runs some 95 percent of the world's computers, issued the patches as part of its monthly security bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest software maker defines a flaw as "critical" when it could allow a damaging Internet worm to replicate without the user's doing anything to the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said the "critical" patches fixed three holes in its Windows operating system and another in its Content Management Server product. Microsoft also issued another security update for Windows it rated at the lower threat level of "important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fixes come a little more than a week after it released a patch outside of the regular monthly update to plug a security hole related to an animated cursor that hackers had used to launch attacks after users clicked on links to malicious Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has been working to improve the security and reliability of its software as more and more malicious software target weaknesses in Windows and other Microsoft software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest patches can be downloaded at www.microsoft.com/security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) said on Wednesday it will be able to make microchips faster and more energy efficient by stacking components on top of each other, a breakthrough that cuts the distance an electrical signal needs to travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique works by drilling tiny holes through a wafer of silicon and filling them with metal. Components such as memory can then be stacked on top of the main part of the chip, eliminating the need for wires stretching out to the sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM likened the method to replacing a sprawling airport parking lot with a multi-storied garage right next to the terminal. Like people walking from the garage to the terminal, electrical signals do not have to travel as far in a chip with stacked components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It opens up a range of applications and neat things we can do," said Lisa Su, head of semiconductor research at IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM will use the method to make power management chips for wireless devices later this year, allowing them to use 40 percent less power than previous versions, Su said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, IBM plans to incorporate the technique into full-blown processors, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the latest achievement by International Business Machine Corp.'s semiconductor researchers, who have in recent months hit upon several breakthroughs in materials science and chip design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been working on techniques like this for the past 10 years and you never know when they are going to come to market," Su said. "The scope of innovation you have to deal with is much larger. It's not just materials and atoms, but systems and how you put components together."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR, April 12 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major
ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) has started up gas production from the
Tabu deepwater gas field off northeastern Malaysia, the firm's
Malaysian unit said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Production from the non-associated gas project, 200
kilometres (124 miles) off the coast of the Malaysian state of
Terengganu, is expected to peak at 180 million cubic feet per
day, the firm said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project, with a total development cost of $182 million
under a production sharing contract between field operator
ExxonMobil and Petronas Carigali, a unit of state oil firm
Petronas [PETR.UL], aims to help meet rising gas demand in
Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are pleased with the start-up, which will contribute
further towards Malaysia's energy security," the statement
quoted Liam Mallon, ExxonMobil's Malaysia chief, as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil's unit, ExxonMobil Exploration and Production
Malaysia Inc., is one of the largest crude oil producers and
suppliers of natural gas to Malaysia, and operates as a
contractor to Petronas under production sharing contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm, which says it produces about 200,000 barrels per
day (bpd) of crude oil and about 1 billion cubic feet of
natural gas, now operates more than 40 platforms and has
interests in 17 fields offshore Terengganu.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - Shares of British bank Barclays (BARC.L) edged higher again on Friday following trader talk that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) could consider a bid for Barclays if Barclays fails in its takeover talks for Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Two banking analysts interviewed by Reuters were skeptical about any move on Barclays by JPMorgan, but one of them did not rule it out. JPMorgan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "If JPMorgan is going to buy Barclays, it is going to be what they now call a transformational merger," said Richard Bove, analyst at Punk, Ziegel &amp; Co. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "If it is a transformational merger, then (JPMorgan CEO) Jamie Dimon would be making a decision to completely revise the structure of his company.    "In so doing (JPMorgan would) become a far more internationally-oriented company and become far more involved in money management than it is already." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Barclays' booming investment banking and fund management businesses helped Britain's third biggest bank report a 35 percent jump in 2006 profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Barclays reported record yearly pretax profit of 7.14 billion pounds ($13.9 billion) -- including 323 million of exceptional gains on disposals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Profits at the Barclays Capital (BarCap) investment banking unit jumped 55 percent to 2.22 billion pounds in 2006, while fund manager Barclays Global Investors (BGI) reported a 32 percent rise to 714 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    BARCLAYS TOO BIG? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The analysts stressed the size of Barclays as a possible hurdle for any potential bidder. According to Reuters data, Barclays has a current market value of roughly $95 billion, while JPMorgan is currently worth roughly $171 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I struggle to construct a compelling value case ... for any of the American players buying any of the British players," said analyst Antony Broadbent at Sanford Bernstein. "I don't buy the strategic logic. I don't buy the valuation logic." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ABN, worth about 64 billion euros ($87 billion) at current market prices, has been in exclusive merger talks with Barclays since last month to strike the biggest-ever bank takeover, but a 30-day period of exclusivity expires next week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    However, other banks are also interested in ABN. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ABN confirmed on Friday it had received a letter from Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), Belgian-Dutch firm Fortis FOR.BR and Spain's Santander (SAN.MC), inviting it to start exploratory talks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Barclays chief executive John Varley has said the bank would walk away from talks to take over ABN if it is unable to negotiate a deal on the right terms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Traders this week talked up the chances of a JPMorgan bid for Barclays if the British bank's talks with ABN fail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analyst Bove said JPMorgan would have to think very hard before making such a move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I'm not going to tell you it's not going to happen -- I'm just going to say this would be a tough merger and it would completely change the nature of JPMorgan," said Bove. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It would destroy JPMorgan's stock in the short run and there would be a long period of work out to make the two companies fit together." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Another issue is whether Barclays would want to sell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Barclays is a very strong, very profitable, very fast-growing institution -- I cannot conceive of a reason that they would want to sell," said Bove. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Broadbent agreed, adding: "It's not clear to me that what John Varley (Barclays CEO) is saying is: we are for sale." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Mark McSherry, editing by Jerry Kearney; mark.mcsherry@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: mark.mcsherry.reuters.com@reuters.net; +646 223 6094)) Keywords: BARCLAYS JPMORGAN/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co. (GE.N) reported higher first-quarter earnings on Friday, with profit rising at all its units except GE Industrial, which was weighed down by the GE Plastics business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE, whose operations range from jet engines to the NBC media group, said net earnings rose to $4.51 billion, or 44 cents per diluted share, from $4.44 billion, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COMMENTARY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JAMES HARDESTY, PRESIDENT OF HARDESTY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BALTIMORE, WHICH OWNS GE SHARES:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just don't understand why it isn't a $50 stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The plastics group ... we'll probably hear something on that soon. They'll probably divest them. They're talking big numbers $10-$12 billion for their plastics group. That will give Mr. Immelt a real war chest to pursue his interests. With a 3 percent yield, and starting to see the earnings growth accelerating, I can't understand why this stock shouldn't be one's most significant holding in a conservative, value-oriented approach. With the favorable treatment of dividends, this is almost what we're using as our money-market reserve. "I'm surprised the market yawned at this stock. This is the unsung hero of the Dow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it was a fabulous quarter. It should be reassuring to those who are worried about the economy, that it is sliding into deeper waters. This is a wonderful proxy for the economy, telling us things are fine. With their substantial presence in the appliances business, even with the housing difficulties it shows the economy is healthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ERIC BOYCE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, AUSTIN, TEXAS-BASED HESTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, WHICH OWNS GE SHARES:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their consumer businesses were soft. That was expected. Profits in infrastructure were expected to be pretty strong and they were. Commercial finance profitability was probably ahead of expectations as an area that was supposed to be fairly strong. Obviously, plastics is still a headwind for them. Industrial business profitability was arguably weaker than expected. Even though it has less bearing on the bottom line, I thought NBC Universal probably did a little bit better than expected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All in all, I don't think it's a quarter that necessarily gets the Street terribly excited, although revenues were ahead of expectations to a degree."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the did-not-like side, industrial was weak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Returns, just at a 25,000-foot level, look OK and obviously the balance sheet remains in pretty good shape."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DOUGLAS OBER, ADAMS EXPRESS CO., BALTIMORE, MARYLAND-BASED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INVESTMENT COMPANY, WHICH OWNS GE SHARES:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The strength of the infrastructure business was probably extraordinary ... they talked about developing markets being particularly strong. I thought that was impressive. I thought their upside in the commercial finance business was strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was a little bit disappointed in the top-line revenue number, I thought that was a little bit on the light side."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a clean quarter, number one, and they have been struggling very hard to make their quarters as clean as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The GE Money business, which everybody thought was a potential hurting spot, didn't seem to bother them too much, so I was pleased with that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sooner they get rid of the Plastics business, the better off they'll be. That was obviously a penalty for them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All in all, I thought it was a pretty good quarter for them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK CITY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM, WHICH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DOES NOT OWN GE SHARES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Certainly a solid quarter for GE. Revenue coming in above expectations is a good sign. Sales from overseas were strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The backlog of orders is a big number, but new orders of 3 percent (growth) reflect the size of GE and how hard it is to grow a company this size. Given GE's size, 3 percent in terms of new orders is about as good as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nothing much of a surprise other than the international markets appear to be strong and sales therefore were above expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NICK SKIMING, FUND MANAGER AT ASHBURTON, JERSEY, U.K.:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At first glance it's in line. Their guidance seems to be reasonably satisfactory. It comes as a little bit of a relief, given the comments from the Fed as much as anything about the slowdown in the U.S. economy, and obviously we saw comments from the IMF that they expect a slowdown in the U.S. economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PETER DIXON, STRATEGIST AT COMMERZBANK, LONDON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers were solid, but expectations were healthy anyway, so these numbers are not going to be sufficiently punchy to make investors think that the earnings season is looking particularly great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the other side, they aren't terrible either. Because the numbers were in line, the market implications will be very limited. Investors will now be looking for more companies due to report in the next couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Klayman in Chicago, Scott Malone in Boston, Jennifer Coogan in New York and Sophie Hares and Neha Kumar in London)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil major Chevron Corp. and forest 
products company Weyerhaeuser Co. said on Thursday they plan to 
study the possible development of biofuels from non-food 
sources including wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The companies will focus on developing technology to 
transform wood and other cellulosic sources into clean-burning 
fuels for cars and trucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ethanol from plant cellulose has the same chemical 
properties as ethanol made from corn or sugar cane, but it can 
be produced from a variety of nonedible materials such as 
cereal straw, sawdust and switchgrass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the United States, corn is the dominant feedstock used 
to make ethanol. As the number of corn-fed ethanol plants has 
mushroomed, the price of the crop has risen sharply this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron is investing in cellulosic biofuels, because we 
believe they will play a role in meeting future energy growth," 
said Chevron Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe this partnership will accelerate the 
achievement of that reality," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his State of the Union speech in January, President 
George W. Bush floated a plan to raise U.S. biofuels production 
five-fold by 2017 to help reduce reliance on Middle East oil.&lt;/p&gt;

Wall Street Journal reported in its April 14 edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As previously reported by the New York Times, the
Blackstone Group is also interested in acquiring the company,
which could be worth as much as $20 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.C. Flowers is run by Chris Flowers, a former head of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s (GS.N) financial institutions group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has been expanding its student loan business and
had $10.3 billion of student loans on its books at the end of
2006, up from $3 billion in 2005, the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan and Blackstone declined to comment. J.C. Flowers
was not immediately available for comment.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - In a century-old farming town in central Washington state, Microsoft Corp. has built a farm for the Internet age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rather than corn or cows, this farm teems with computer servers and data storage systems that will serve as the backbone of Microsoft's effort to combat escalating competition on the Web from Google Inc. and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new data center in Quincy, Washington, is its largest "server farm" to date -- big enough to house seven soccer fields -- and a physical manifestation of the company's giant ambitions to be a force in the world of Web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker will officially flip the switch on tens of thousands of computer servers at the Quincy facility on April 16 and Microsoft is already at work on a massive $550 million data center in San Antonio, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those facilities are among the first new data centers to come online since Microsoft surprised investors last year with an aggressive spending plan to enhance its Web services business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a strategic shift for a company that built its business selling out-of-the-box software and a testament to the growing threat posed by software applications from Google and other Web-based rivals to Microsoft's Windows and Office monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Data centers are the basic infrastructure that enable Web services, so if Microsoft wants to compete in services this is the price of admission," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran. "The software industry is headed toward Web services, so this is what Microsoft has to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data centers provide the base infrastructure upon which Microsoft can create a range of Web services such as its Xbox Live online video game system to its upcoming CRM Live business software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web heavyweights like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft are competing to engage Internet users with a variety of Web services from online video to hosted e-mail to news. The growth of online marketing has made Web services supported by advertising more lucrative than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the cost of computing power and data storage has fallen sharply, encouraging deep-pocketed companies to build enormous data centers to handle and control all of the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a Goldman Sachs conference in February, Microsoft's chief software architect, Ray Ozzie, said the company will continue to invest in new data centers, building enough capacity to eventually allow other companies and developers to build Web services on top of its infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a strategy that online retailer Amazon.com has already embraced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software industry is traditionally a low capital expenditure business, but the building of these facilities is changing that business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morningstar estimates that Microsoft's capital spending will rise 50 percent to $1.5 billion this fiscal year and expects that figure to grow another 50 percent next year to $2.3 billion. It is still only a small portion of Microsoft's estimated $50 billion in revenue this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'TREASURE MAP'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data centers are nondescript buildings filled with racks and racks of computer servers, data storage and network systems. Since all that computing power gets very hot, they require elaborate cooling systems to prevent overheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating costs, however, are quite low since most of the work in the data center is automated. A large chunk of the operating costs come from electricity to power the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Quincy facility will consume up to 48 megawatts of electricity -- enough to power 40,000 homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a system for finding potential data center sites. It takes 31 factors into account such as access to cheap, renewable electricity and fiber optic connectivity before coming up with a handful of locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I kind of view it as a treasure map," Mike Manos, Microsoft's director of data centers, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company discloses the bare minimum about the facilities since it views every aspect of the data center from location to layout as a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is not alone in its reticence. Google's annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledges that the company operates data centers in major regions of the world, but reveals nothing about exact locations or costs of operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Yahoo are also actively building data centers all around the world. In fact, the two companies are building facilities in the U.S. Pacific Northwest -- home to some of America's cheapest electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, April 16 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa is seen posting a 7.6 percent rise in first-quarter net profit as strong sales at its satellite and cable units make up for lower advertising revenues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Reuters poll of five analysts predicted that Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) earned 1.450 billion pesos ($131 million) in the January-March period compared with 1.348 billion pesos in the year-ago quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    First-quarter advertising revenues were boosted in 2006 by political ad campaigns ahead of the July 2 presidential election. Televisa also benefited in the year-ago period from an extra week and from higher advertising rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The soccer World Cup also brought broadcasters additional ad revenues in the first half of last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Quarterly revenues are seen up 3 percent at 8.019 billion pesos while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) -- a key performance gauge for Mexican companies -- is seen up 6.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa's Cablevision cable television unit, along with its SKY satellite operation, likely continued to increase its contribution to Televisa's total revenue in the quarter, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The two units are doing very, very well. They've posted really good numbers (in previous quarters)," HSBC analyst Raul Ochoa said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SKY is enjoying a growing subscriber base, thanks to new exclusive shows, while Cablevision is luring in new customers with broadband and video packages. The company plans to add digital phone services later this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The following table shows the average estimates of five analysts surveyed by Reuters.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. is looking to grab a bigger piece of the wedding cake, and feed its burgeoning Princess business, with a new line of character-inspired bridal gowns aimed at women who want to look and feel like Cinderella at the ball on their big day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 34 gowns by designer Kirstie Kelly were inspired by princesses from Disney films like "Sleeping Beauty" and "Beauty and the Beast" and mark the latest effort by Disney to steer its weddings business toward higher-end nuptials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney instructed Kelly to base her gown designs on those characters in a bet that the popularity of the Disney Princess line of products for girls, which racked up $3.4 billion in worldwide sales last year, would carry over to brides who grew up with Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do 'being a princess' better than anyone," Korri McFann, marketing manager for Disney Fairy Tale Weddings and Honeymoons, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly's gowns, which debuted on a New York catwalk on Sunday, range in price from $1,500 to $3,000, below couture prices but above the average wedding dress price of $1,000. The price point is aimed at a generation of couples who are getting married older and paying for their own celebrations, Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are enticing them to step up without breaking the bank," said Jim Calhoun, executive vice president for global apparel at Disney Consumer Products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, the wedding gown line could soon expand to include other Disney Princess-branded fashions and home furnishings for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it really is the lifestyle opportunity that we think it is, then it really opens up possibilities ... beyond the day of the wedding," Calhoun said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company was encouraged to delve into the high-end wedding business by the 2,000 weddings it hosts each year at its U.S. resorts -- Walt Disney World and Disneyland -- and its cruise line, according to McFann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney hopes to capitalize on soaring demand for destination weddings, in which couples and their guests turn their nuptials into wedding-vacations that often take place at resorts in tropical locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Parks and Resorts division glitzed up the 16-year-old Fairy Tale Weddings program this year by hiring celebrity party planner David Tutera to design a "couture" line of decorations, floral arrangements and furniture for wedding packages that will start at $75,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have had ... couples that have been looking for an over-the-top wedding, and now we are going to offer that product to them," McFann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard Fairy Tale Weddings packages -- which include ceremony and reception costs and sometimes extras like rides in a Cinderella carriage, trumpeting heralds and appearances by Mickey and Minnie Mouse in formal attire -- start at $4,000 but average $27,000, about the same as the average wedding budget in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of destination weddings has grown 400 percent in the last decade and those events now comprise 16 percent of all U.S. weddings, according to Conde Nast Bridal Media's 2006 American Wedding Survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey also showed that 55 percent of destination weddings took place in the United States and a quarter of those couples honeymooned in the same spot where they were married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millie Martini Bratten, Brides magazine editor-in-chief, said that's good news for Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it plays into a lot of other things that Disney has done in general to expand what people already love (and) the service they get," Bratten said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are offering different types of weddings for different budgets and ... they have the resources and the imagination and the focus to attract the higher-end weddings."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, April 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), the
world's largest software maker, unveiled on Sunday a new online
media platform called Silverlight to challenge Adobe Systems
Inc.'s (ADBE.O) dominant Flash player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Silverlight works on most Web browsers including
Apple Inc.'s (AAPL.O) Safari and Mozilla's FireFox. The company
sees the plug-in as a platform for rich interactive
applications, or Web programs that run like desktop computer
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Silverlight, which will be demonstrated at the National
Association of Broadcasters conference, allows content
providers to deliver games, videos and animation over the Web
in a dynamic way with advanced graphics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is trying to move into the graphic design and
animation tool software business with a new set of programs
called Microsoft Expression suite, a rival to Adobe's Creative
Suite 3 software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adobe has dominated the market with its Flash software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Using Silverlight, Microsoft aims to appeal to content
companies with lower costs for media delivery, because it
integrates with existing Web technology. It is also compatible
with Windows Media format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has signed up Major League Baseball and Netflix
Inc. (NFLX.O) to support the technology.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N) posted a 
better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the 
continued roll-out of Coke Zero helped boost sales in many 
countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares were up nearly 3 percent in afternoon trade, as the 
results proved to many investors that there is growth left in 
the soft drink business and that Coke is able to capture it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Atlanta-based company said net income for the first 
quarter ended March 30 rose 14 percent to $1.26 billion, or 54 
cents per share, from $1.11 billion, or 47 cents per share, a 
year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding items including a charge from an asset write-off 
in a Philippine bottler and gains on the sales of an equity 
interest in a Brazilian bottler, the company earned 56 cents 
per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average were expecting 53 cents per share on 
that basis, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's No. 1 beverage company saw strong gains in 
emerging markets such as Russia, China and Africa, as well as 
moderate gains in developed markets like Japan and the European 
Union, which offset an expected decline in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke, like rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP.N), has suffered amid an 
industry-wide slowdown in the North American market as 
health-conscious consumers move away from soft drinks in favor 
of bottled waters, teas and energy drinks. While Coke Chief 
Executive E. Neville Isdell acknowledged that weakness on 
Tuesday, he delivered an optimistic message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to expect 2007 to be weak," said Isdell on a 
conference call with analysts. "But we do expect to begin 
seeing sequential improvement in the second half of the year as 
we execute against our key goals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the leadership of Isdell, who was brought out of 
retirement in 2004 to help turn the company around, Coke has 
introduced new products, smoothed relationships with bottlers, 
and launched a marketing campaign with the tagline "the Coke 
side of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We took away (from the earnings) the impression that the 
strategies Isdell has been working on appear to be paying off," 
said Eric Schoenstein, an analyst at Jensen Investment 
Management in Portland, Oregon, which owns over 1 million Coke 
shares among its $3 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It just looks like they're able to execute a little better 
than they had been previously," Schoenstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg called Tuesday's 
results "the best evidence yet that a nearly 3-year turnaround 
is working and that the company's long-term targets are sound 
and being achieved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swartzberg raised his earnings estimates and price target 
on Coke shares and reiterated his "buy" rating.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BY THE NUMBERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net operating revenue rose 17 percent to $6.10 billion as 
worldwide unit case volume, a key beverage industry metric, 
grew 6 percent, helped by strength in Latin America, China, 
Eastern Europe, South Africa, Nigeria and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Coke's growth has lagged over the past five years and is 
now coming back," said Marc Heilweil, president of Spectrum 
Advisory Services, which owns 132,522 Coke shares. He noted, 
however, that the company got a little boost this quarter as an 
earlier Easter holiday this year shifted some sales seen last 
year in the second quarter to the first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Case volume fell 3 percent in North America, but revenue in 
the area, which made up about 28 percent of the company's 
total, rose 2 percent, as Coke raised prices and sold a greater 
number of more-expensive energy and sports drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volume rose 17 percent in Africa, 7 percent in Latin 
America, 11 percent in the European Union, and 5 percent in the 
Pacific region. The Eurasia region, which includes South Asia, 
the Middle East, Russia and the Balkans, saw its volume rise 16 
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results were driven by noncarbonated beverages such as 
Dasani bottled water, Powerade sports drink and Minute Maid 
juices, though soft drinks, which fell industry-wide in the 
U.S. for the past two years, rose 5 percent in the latest 
quarter, helped by the launch of Coca-Cola Zero, a no-calorie 
cola which tastes more like "the Real Thing" than Diet Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke shares have traded in their highest range since July 
2004 in recent weeks. Before Tuesday, the stock traded at more 
than 19 times estimated 2007 earnings, making it the 
second-costliest stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
.DJI on a price-to-earnings basis, though its multiple is

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Mike McCue never imagined he would be an employee of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) -- the company that crushed his former employer, Netscape, during the Web browser wars of the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As chief executive and co-founder of Tellme Networks Inc, an early leader in search on mobile phones that was acquired by the software giant in March, McCue now stands at the forefront of Microsoft's strategy in two areas: online services and voice-recognition technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tellme brings to Microsoft the world's largest database of voice-recognition data, and employees versed in a Web-based business model that threatens Microsoft's traditional, out-of-the-box software business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is trying to advance in areas that it hasn't been familiar with in the past. It is trying to embrace the differences, not eliminate them," McCue said in an interview with Reuters on the sideline of the Web 2.0 Expo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't sell any software. It's only services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tellme will stay in its offices in the heart of Silicon Valley, hundreds of miles away from Microsoft's Redmond, Washington campus, and operate like an independent entity within the $44 billion software maker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you empower a team and tell them do whatever you need to do and make whatever technology decisions, they can operate like a start-up inside the company," said McCue. "Ten years ago, that would have never happened."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not disclose how much it paid for Tellme, but sources familiar with the situation previously told Reuters the companies were in talks for a deal that could value the company at more than $800 million. At that price, it would be Microsoft's biggest acquisition since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tellme launched a new mobile search service on Tuesday, which allows users to request information by voice free of charge and see the results pop up with maps and directions on the phone's screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tellme acquisition is expected to enhance Microsoft's position in searches done from mobile phones, which the company sees as a relatively untapped market where it can compete more favorably with current Web search leader Google Inc. (GOOG.O) and with Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Tellme's service is a voice-recognition database that allows the company to accurately predict what information callers are seeking and decipher many different accents and dialects. Tellme said it adds 9 billion "utterances" a year to its database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's one of the assets that Microsoft valued pretty highly," said McCue. "Mobile search and PC search will be very different things. The leaders in PC search won't necessarily be the leaders in mobile search."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCue also brings to Microsoft extensive experience in operating a software-as-a-service business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft built its business selling software that runs on a computer's hard drive and it is moving to adopt elements of the online services movement to deliver software as a service through the Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a business model long embraced by Google and other Internet companies, but somewhat new territory to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to facilitate that strategic shift, Microsoft is investing billions in new massive data centers filled with computers servers, storage equipment and network systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is the underdog right now with tens of billions (in cash) behind them," said McCue. "Microsoft has the will, the courage, the intent to make software as a service happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCue said he remembers another time when Microsoft was the underdog. He was the vice president of technology at Netscape, which at the time was the dominant Web browser with a healthy lead over Microsoft's Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft came and beat us pretty good," McCue said with a laugh. "I learned a huge lesson there."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading human rights group on Tuesday urged Washington to cancel a U.S. visa granted to Cambodia's police chief to attend counter-terrorism talks because of questions about his past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hok Lundy, Cambodia's top police officer, is set to attend counter-terrorism talks with FBI officials on Thursday and State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said there had likely been a "healthy discussion" before the visa was granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lundy had requested a U.S. visa in 2005 but was turned down because of "what was believed to be credible evidence of complicity in human trafficking," said former senior State Department official John Miller, who was ambassador at large to stop human trafficking until a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe he has redeemed himself in some way ... my advice to the FBI and Justice Department is that one should be careful when one sups with the devil," he said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Human Rights Watch group, Lundy also allegedly was part of a conspiracy to carry out a grenade attack on opposition leader Sam Rainsy in March 1997. The attack killed 16 people and injured more than 150.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human Rights Watch said the decision to grant Lundy a visa should be reversed because he had been implicated in crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hok Lundy's alleged involvement in political violence and organized crime in Cambodia means that the FBI should be investigating him, not hosting him," Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lundy previously has rejected the allegations of human trafficking but Miller said the police chief allegedly played a role in freeing eight traffickers just hours after they were seized in a raid in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That the biggest trafficking raid with arrests could be overturned within hours ... does not happen without the complicity of the national chief of police," Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCormack said a "policy judgment" was taken to let Lundy come to the United States, an indication that Lundy's contribution to the FBI counter-terrorism meeting outweighed questions about other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that there are a lot of allegations and I'm not trying to discount those allegations," McCormack said. "In adjudicating the visa, there were no legal bars to his receiving a visa."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously there was an inter-agency discussion and the FBI wanted him for his interests in terrorism issues," said Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI declined comment on the issue and referred all questions to the State Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects 8th paragraph to revenue instead of profit)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Philipp Gollner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, April 17 (Reuters) - International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM.N), the world's largest technology services
company, reported higher first-quarter earnings on Tuesday as
sales of software and computer services increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income rose to $1.84 billion, or $1.21 per share, from
$1.71 billion, or $1.08 per share, a year earlier. Revenue
climbed to $22.03 billion from $20.66 billion, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $1.21 per share
on revenue of $21.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, IBM paid nearly $5 billion for 13 acquisitions
to boost sales of software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of IBM rose 1.5 percent to $98.60 in after-hours
trading following the earnings report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The worry going into the quarter was sluggishness (in)
server spending, but the fact that IBM pulled off the quarter
shows that the diversified portfolio of businesses is working,"
said Sunil Reddy, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset
Management, which oversees about $21 billion, including IBM
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said revenue in its services business, which accounted
for more than one-half of total sales in 2006, rose 8 percent
in the quarter. Services signings, a key indicator of future
revenue, slipped to $11.1 billion from $11.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue in its Global Business Services unit, which
includes consulting and managing of customers' business
software, increased 8.7 percent to $4.2 billion. It was the
eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year pretax profit
growth in the business, reflecting IBM's push to sell
more-profitable software-based services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's first-quarter deals included a $775 million contract
to manage information-technology for Circuit City Stores Inc.'s
CC.N more than 600 stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM also signed a $700 million extension of a contract with
Germany's Sparkassen Informatik GmbH, which handles information
technology for savings banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Software revenue rose 8.8 percent to $4.25 billion in the
first quarter, helped by strong sales of IBM's middle-ware
software for running corporate data networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of hardware, including microprocessors and servers
and storage gear for businesses, rose 2.3 percent to $4.52
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock closed up 1 percent at $97.12 in regular-session
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Armonk, New York-based IBM are down 2.3 percent
this year amid investor concern over revenue and profit growth
for 2007. The stock trades at about 14 times estimated 2007

&lt;p&gt;    (Adds revenue, details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N), the world's largest beverage company, on Tuesday reported higher quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates as strength in emerging markets overshadowed weakness in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Net income for the first quarter ended March 30 rose 14 percent to $1.26 billion, or 54 cents per share, from $1.11 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Excluding items including a charge from an asset write-off in a Philippines bottler and gains on the sales of an equity interest in a Brazilian bottler, the company earned 56 cents per share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts on average were expecting 53 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coca-Cola, like rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP.N), has seen a slowdown in sales in mature markets such as North America as increasingly health-conscious consumers opt for bottled water or tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coke's North American sales were flat last year, while sales in Eurasia grew in the double-digits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Net operating revenue rose 17 percent to $6.10 billion as worldwide unit case volume, a key metric in the beverage industry, grew 6 percent, helped by strength in Latin America, China, Eastern Europe, and South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Case volume was down 3 percent in North America, up 7 percent in Latin America, and up 11 percent in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coke shares have been trading in their highest range since July 2004 in recent weeks. Before Tuesday, the the stock traded at more than 19 times estimated 2007 earnings, making it the second-priciest stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI on a price to earnings basis, though its multiple is only slightly higher than that of rival PepsiCo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Derek Caney; Reuters messaging: martinne.geller.reuters.com@reuters.net; martinne.geller@reuters.com; +1 646 223 6023)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: COCACOLA RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the continued roll-out of Coke Zero helped boost sales in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares were up nearly 3 percent in afternoon trade, as the results proved to many investors that there is growth left in the soft drink business and that Coke is able to capture it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based company said net income for the first quarter ended March 30 rose 14 percent to $1.26 billion, or 54 cents per share, from $1.11 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding items including a charge from an asset write-off in a Philippine bottler and gains on the sales of an equity interest in a Brazilian bottler, the company earned 56 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average were expecting 53 cents per share on that basis, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's No. 1 beverage company saw strong gains in emerging markets such as Russia, China and Africa, as well as moderate gains in developed markets like Japan and the European Union, which offset an expected decline in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke, like rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP.N), has suffered amid an industry-wide slowdown in the North American market as health-conscious consumers move away from soft drinks in favor of bottled waters, teas and energy drinks. While Coke Chief Executive E. Neville Isdell acknowledged that weakness on Tuesday, he delivered an optimistic message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to expect 2007 to be weak," said Isdell on a conference call with analysts. "But we do expect to begin seeing sequential improvement in the second half of the year as we execute against our key goals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of Isdell, who was brought out of retirement in 2004 to help turn the company around, Coke has introduced new products, smoothed relationships with bottlers, and launched a marketing campaign with the tagline "the Coke side of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We took away (from the earnings) the impression that the strategies Isdell has been working on appear to be paying off," said Eric Schoenstein, an analyst at Jensen Investment Management in Portland, Oregon, which owns over 1 million Coke shares among its $3 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It just looks like they're able to execute a little better than they had been previously," Schoenstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg called Tuesday's results "the best evidence yet that a nearly 3-year turnaround is working and that the company's long-term targets are sound and being achieved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swartzberg raised his earnings estimates and price target on Coke shares and reiterated his "buy" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BY THE NUMBERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net operating revenue rose 17 percent to $6.10 billion as worldwide unit case volume, a key beverage industry metric, grew 6 percent, helped by strength in Latin America, China, Eastern Europe, South Africa, Nigeria and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Coke's growth has lagged over the past five years and is now coming back," said Marc Heilweil, president of Spectrum Advisory Services, which owns 132,522 Coke shares. He noted, however, that the company got a little boost this quarter as an earlier Easter holiday this year shifted some sales seen last year in the second quarter to the first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case volume fell 3 percent in North America, but revenue in the area, which made up about 28 percent of the company's total, rose 2 percent, as Coke raised prices and sold a greater number of more-expensive energy and sports drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume rose 17 percent in Africa, 7 percent in Latin America, 11 percent in the European Union, and 5 percent in the Pacific region. The Eurasia region, which includes South Asia, the Middle East, Russia and the Balkans, saw its volume rise 16 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were driven by noncarbonated beverages such as Dasani bottled water, Powerade sports drink and Minute Maid juices, though soft drinks, which fell industry-wide in the U.S. for the past two years, rose 5 percent in the latest quarter, helped by the launch of Coca-Cola Zero, a no-calorie cola which tastes more like "the Real Thing" than Diet Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke shares have traded in their highest range since July 2004 in recent weeks. Before Tuesday, the stock traded at more than 19 times estimated 2007 earnings, making it the second-costliest stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI on a price-to-earnings basis, though its multiple is only slightly higher than that of rival PepsiCo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke shares were up $1.29, or 2.6 percent, to $51.56 on the New York Stock Exchange in late afternoon dealings.&lt;/p&gt;

nitric oxide release reported to state regulators on Tuesday
was not due to an operational problem at its 260,000 barrel per
day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in El Segundo, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery detected a slightly higher flow of nitric

reported it to the California Office of Emergency Services out
of "an abundance of caution," said spokesman Rod Spackman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 200 lbs of nitric oxide, a common byproduct of
refining which can form nitrogen dioxide when mixed with
oxygen, was released on Tuesday morning, according to a notice

&lt;p&gt; By Kristina Cooke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - U.S. blue-chip stocks edged
higher on Tuesday, helped by data showing tamer March core
consumer prices and after solid profits at companies such as
Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Coca-Cola were up 1.7 percent, while those of
health-care company Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N), which also
posted stronger-than-expected earnings, were up 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The general news flow has been positive," said David Katz,
chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 22.26

showed U.S. industrial production unexpectedly fell in March.
[ID:nN17403020]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts also said traders were cautious, due to the
weakness of the dollar, which breached the $2 level against
sterling, as data showed a surge in UK inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When the dollar seems to be in a faster-than-desired
decline, people get worried," said Katz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Coca-Cola, the world's largest beverage company,
rose to $51, while Johnson  Johnson's stock rose to $65.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Labor Department said the consumer price index,
excluding food and energy, rose at a muted pace last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other earnings due on Tuesday include Intel Corp. (INTC.O)

components and both due after the market's close. Intel was up
0.9 percent at $20.88 and IBM rose 0.7 percent to $96.92.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Coca-Cola, updates prices, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Kristina Cooke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures fell on
Tuesday as caution before consumer price data tempered reports
of stronger-than-expected earnings from companies, including
Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Coca-Cola, a Dow component, rose 1.5 percent
before the bell after the world's largest beverage company
reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates.
For details see [ID:nN17379123]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other earnings due on Tuesday include Dow components Intel
Corp. (INTC.O), Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N) and International
Business Machines Corp.(IBM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides earnings, investors await economic reports,
especially March consumer price data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A sharp drop in the dollar against sterling after data
showed inflation in Britain above 3 percent could put investors
on edge. A fall in the dollar can add to pressure on U.S.
prices and increase imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors will also get reports on housing starts and
industrial production. On Monday the Standard  Poor's 500
index rose to a 6 1/2-year high on signs of strength in the
economy and corporate profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "CPI is the big concern for the market, and we've seen
indications that inflation is still there in the system," said
Peter Dunay, investment strategist at Leeb Capital in New
York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With SP making a new multiyear high yesterday, it's not
surprising to see the futures adding a little bit of caution to
head lower. A weaker dollar adds evidence that it would be very
difficult for the Fed to cut rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that stronger-than-expected earnings would cushion
the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 were down 2.70 points, below fair
value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking
into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration
on the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 were down 11
points and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures were off 4.50 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Labor Department's CPI is forecast to rise 0.6 percent
in March after rising 0.4 percent in February, according to
economists polled by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, was
expected to rise 0.2 percent in March, matching February's
gain. The prices report and the March housing data are due at
8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week minutes from the Federal Reserve's policy-setting
meeting said more interest rates increases could be needed to
tame price pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola's shares rose 1.5 percent to $51 in electronic
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Ellis Mnyandu)

&lt;p&gt;April 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its view on the U.S.
biofuels sector to "cautious" from "neutral" on concerns of
contracting ethanol margins due to higher corn prices and
weakening ethanol prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also cut ethanol provider Aventine Renewable
Energy Holdings Inc. AVR.N to "neutral" from "buy", on
valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ethanol prices would have to fall if it had to expand
beyond its traditional markets, the Midwest and the
reformulated gasoline markets, Goldman Sachs analyst Arjun
Murti said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ethanol sector is expensive, with shares of both
Aventine and VeraSun Energy Corp. VSE.N up about 39 percent
from their 52-week lows seen early in the year, he observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murti said he recommended selling ethanol shares into the
rebound in prices since the U.S. Agriculture Department's
Prospective Plantings report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report, issued on March 30, indicated US farmers intend

potentially enough to produce a record 12.5 billion-bushel
crop.

retail banking is challenged right now, and JPMorgan is no 
exception," said analyst Bill Fitzpatrick of Johnson Asset 
Management in Racine, Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income at the No. 3 U.S. bank rose to $4.8 billion, or 
$1.34 a share, from $3.1 billion, or 86 cents a share, a year 
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding a one-time gain from the adoption of a new 
accounting rule, JPMorgan earned $1.23 a share, beating the 
analysts' average forecast of $1.02, according to Reuters 
Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They've got some credit quality issues but it appears as 
though they've got a good handle on it," Fitzpatrick said. "I 
think these diversified financials can stomach it better than 
the pure-play regional banks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan also said it was raising its quarterly dividend by 
12 percent to 38 cents a share and authorized a new $10 billion 
stock buyback program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank bought back $4 billion in stock in the first 
quarter, using up most of the authorization from a prior 
repurchase plan from 2006, Chief Financial Officer Mike 
Cavanaugh told reporters on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Tuesday's close, JPMorgan shares were up 3.9 percent so 
far this year, compared with a 1.9 percent decline in the KBW 
Banks index .BKX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has been focused on growth, changing course from 
its previous focus on cost savings from a series of previous 
acquisitions and mergers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Executives have said they planned to invest $1 billion in 
investment banking in 2007 -- about one third more than in 2006 
-- to expand in markets such as energy trading in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banking, one of the company's strongest areas in 
the quarter, posted an 81 percent gain in profit to $1.54 
billion, helped by strong revenue from fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retail banking earnings fell 2 percent to $859 million as 
provisions for credit losses more than tripled to $292 million 
from a year earlier due to higher losses from subprime 
mortgages and home equity loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cavanaugh downplayed the importance of subprime for 
JPMorgan, noting that it accounted for only $20 million in 
charge-offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have subprime very well under control and are 
comfortable there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Problems with subprime mortgages, which are targeted to 
less-creditworthy borrowers, have shaken many smaller lenders 
and even rattled larger banks like Washington Mutual Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (WM.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gains on private equity investments helped JPMorgan's 
corporate bank swing to a $631 million profit from a $366 
million loss in the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N) on Wednesday said first-quarter earnings rose 55 percent, beating forecasts, as gains in investment banking and private equity outweighed weak growth in retail banking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strong results at the bank, which also raised its dividend and authorized a new $10 billion stock buyback plan, follow better-than-expected earnings at larger rival Citigroup (C.N) earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares were up 2.6 percent in electronic trading after the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results are clearly driven by investment banking, but retail banking is challenged right now, and JPMorgan is no exception," said analyst Bill Fitzpatrick of Johnson Asset Management in Racine, Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income at the No. 3 U.S. bank rose to $4.8 billion, or $1.34 a share, from $3.1 billion, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding a one-time gain from the adoption of a new accounting rule, JPMorgan earned $1.23 a share, beating the analysts' average forecast of $1.02, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've got some credit quality issues but it appears as though they've got a good handle on it," Fitzpatrick said.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, April 18 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster
Televisa posted a surprise 46 percent plunge in first-quarter
earnings on Wednesday because of a sharp jump in expenses,
losses at affiliates and higher taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grupo Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) said it earned 734
million pesos ($66 million), compared with 1.348 billion pesos
in the first quarter of 2006. Results came in way below
analysts' estimate of 1.450 billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The jump in other expenses -- up 603.3 million pesos from
the same quarter a year earlier -- reflected a one-time charge
after the sale of its investment in U.S. broadcaster Univision
Communications Inc. UVN.N&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts think Televisa received less than it expected for
the sale. Late last month, Televisa said it had sold its
minority interest in Univision for $1.094 billion. Televisa
sources declined to elaborate on the charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net profit was also hurt after Televisa, famous for its
soap operas that it sells around the world, reported a 244.4
million peso increase in losses at affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sharp decline in quarterly profits was also due to 35
million pesos more in income taxes, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=11.044 pesos as of end March)

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details and background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, April 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it agreed to pay up to $180 million to settle a class-action lawsuit, claiming the company has used its monopoly to overcharge citizens in the state of Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Judge Scott Rosenberg, who presided over the case in Polk County, Iowa, granted preliminary approval to the terms of the settlement. Microsoft had announced in February that it reached a settlement in the case, but did not disclose details at that time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The court scheduled an Aug. 31 hearing on final approval of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Individuals and businesses that purchased Microsoft operating systems and applications between May 18, 1994 and June 30, 2006 will be eligible to file claims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft said the settlement dismisses all antitrust and damage claims which had been raised in the case and which could have amounted to $1 billion or more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Iowa case and another case in Mississippi are the remaining class-action lawsuits against Microsoft pending in state courts. Microsoft has settled or had dismissed most of the other similar lawsuits in state courts.

&lt;p&gt;    (Adds background and details, share reaction) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) on Wednesday reported a 55 percent increase in quarterly earnings, helped by gains in investment banking and private equity, and bolstered its dividend and stock buyback plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Net income rose to $4.8 billion, or $1.34 a share from $3.1 billion, or 86 cents, a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Results were boosted by a one-time gain of $391 million, or 11 cents a share from the adoption of a new accounting rule.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings of $1.02 before extraordinary items, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan shares were up 2.9 percent in pre-market electronic trading after the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The No. 3 U.S. bank also said it was raising its quarterly dividend by 12 percent to 38 cents a share and authorized a new $10 billion stock buyback program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The repurchase plan replaces a prior, $8 billion one which had $850 million remaining to be bought.   JPMorgan shares are up 3.9 percent so far this year, outperforming the KBW Banks index .BKX, which was down 1.9 percent for the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The No. 3 U.S. bank has been focused on growth, changing course from its previous focus on cost savings from a series of previous acquisitions and mergers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Executives have said they plan to invest $1 billion in investment banking in 2007 -- about one third greater than in 2006 -- to expand in markets including energy trading in Asia.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Connecticut authorities on Wednesday threatened to sue makers of a canned energy drink called Cocaine, saying it "dangerously glamorizes drug use."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Las Vegas-based manufacturer, Redux Beverages, will face legal action if it does not immediately stop selling the high-caffeine drink, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contains no cocaine but markets itself as "the legal alternative" to the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its ingredients include legal stimulants like caffeine, guarana -- a South American seed that is a natural source of caffeine -- and taurine, an amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has also notified the company that the drink is illegally marketed as a street drug alternative and a dietary supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drink, which carries a mock health warning saying it can result in "excess excitement, stamina, fun and possible feeling of euphoria," has appeared in stores and the company uses a Web site to market cocktails containing the beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Naming this product 'Cocaine' is an insult to anyone seeking to deter and discourage illegal drug use," Blumenthal said. "The effect is to verbally trample or obscure the true, hard lessons about cocaine -- for profit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at Redux Beverages were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blumenthal said Connecticut is the only state he is aware of taking this step and legal action could entail damages and an injunction against the drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to late afternoon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Caroline Valetkevitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones industrial
average set a lifetime high on Wednesday as
stronger-than-expected profits from JPMorgan Chase  Co.
(JPM.N) overshadowed disappointing results from tech
bellwethers such as Yahoo and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow eclipsed its previous intraday record high of
12,795.93 set on Feb. 20, a week before a global sell-off hit
equities markets. The average is on track to surpass its
previous closing record of 12,786.64, also set on Feb. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A string of big corporate buyouts and data showing steady
economic growth, fueled by consumer spending, have helped the
30-stock Dow average bounce back from its 416-point loss on
Feb. 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan Chase, the No. 3 U.S. bank, and Boeing
Co. (BA.N), the world's biggest-selling commercial jetmaker,
ranked among the biggest positive influences on the blue-chip
Dow average. For details, see [ID:nN18454450].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One of the things that's been impressive is that earnings
reports we've seen so far have been generally positive. I
think the big concern going into this earnings season was how
financial stocks were going to do, given the subprime
problems," said Sam Rahman, portfolio manager at Baring Asset
Management Inc. in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are a lot of people out there who are bearish, but
the market continues to climb that wall of worry," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 44.69
points, or 0.35 percent, at 12,817.73. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX was up 2.89 points, or 0.20 percent, at
1,474.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 1.96
points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,514.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's stock gained 4 percent at $52.19 after reaching
an all-time high of $52.39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boeing's stock climbed 3.7 percent to a record high at
$93.83 after news that the U.S. aerospace company was the sole
bidder for a $2.5 billion South Korean jet deal.
[ID:nN18284048].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But tech stocks fell following disappointing results from
Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) and International Business Machines Corp.(IBM.N), which were released after Tuesday's closing bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares slid 11.6 percent to $28.38 on the Nasdaq,
while IBM's stock dropped 2.4 percent to $94.82 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - GE Energy, the energy arm of
U.S. conglomerate General Electric (GE.N), is studying the sale
of its Baglan Bay gas-fired power plant in Britain, a company
spokeswoman said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are now considering plans to sell Baglan Bay," she said,

million pounds ($1.01 billion) for the 510-megawatt plant in
Port Talbot, South Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She denied the newspaper's report that the plant had already
been put up for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plant -- which has an efficiency rate of 60 percent --
opened in September 2003 but may have served its purpose for GE

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to early morning)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Kristina Cooke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - U.S. technology stocks fell
on Wednesday after disappointing results from Yahoo Inc.
(YHOO.O) and IBM (IBM.N) raised concerns about the outlook for
tech spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of International Business Machines Corp. dropped
more than 2 percent and were the biggest drag on the Dow. But a
4 percent rise in shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N), which
posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit, buoyed the
blue-chip average. For details, see [ID:nN18454450].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology shares are often seen as an indicator for the
health of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Tech, particularly after news from Yahoo, is obviously the
big disappointment of the day, and is weighing on the market,"
said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star
Investment Management Corp. in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But the market is not selling off very sharply,
considering how much it has been going up. Financial stocks,
which people were worried about, seem to be trading well
today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 2.84 points,
or 0.02 percent, at 12,775.88. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX was down 1.00 points, or 0.07 percent, at 1,470.48. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 9.68 points, or 0.38
percent, at 2,507.27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow industrials' march toward a record high stalled on
Wednesday. The gauge came within striking distance of the Feb.
20 record close of 12,786.64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Internet company Yahoo reported an 11 percent fall in
first-quarter profit, missing Wall Street estimates.
[ID:nN1794147]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jefferies  Co. cut its price target on Yahoo to $36 from
$38, according to theflyonthewall.com, and Yahoo's shares fell
11.84 percent to $28.29, making it one of the biggest drags on
both the SP and the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of IBM, the world's largest technology services
company, fell after it reported net income rose to $1.84
billion, or $1.21 per share, matching Wall Street estimates.
[nN17189627]. IBM's stock declined 2 percent to $95.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock, with
Goldman citing IBM's comments about a weaker U.S. spending
environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helping to limit the market's losses were financial
companies' stocks. The SP index of financial shares .GSPF
was up nearly 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase, the No. 3 U.S. bank, hit an all-time high
after the company said quarterly earnings increased, helped by
gains in investment banking and private equity. Its shares rose
3.7 percent to $52.05 after reaching a high of $52.39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still in the pipeline on Wednesday are earnings from
Internet auctioneer eBay Inc. (EBAY.O), which reports after the
bell.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds JPMorgan comment, details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Jeffrey Goldfarb and William Kemble-Diaz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) expects to decide by mid-May whether to move its London investment banking operations eastwards to Canary Wharf from the City, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    One of the sources, who requested anonymity, said any move was unlikely to happen for another four to five years, and would not affect JP Morgan's treasury and securities services or asset management operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It would, however, include its booming investment banking division, potentially dealing a blow to the City's reputation as London's financial heartland. The unit is currently spread among seven City locations now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The U.S. investment bank -- which was founded in London in 1837 -- is weighing a site at the Riverside South area just off Westferry Circus at Canary Wharf in east London and another at Fore Street in the historic City financial district, the sources said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It is especially keen to develop several new trading floors of at least 50,000 square feet each. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have several attractive scenarios from which to choose and we are looking at them all," a JPMorgan spokesman said. The bank declined to go into detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan earlier on Wednesday reported a 55 percent rise in quarterly earnings, spurred in part by investment banking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Although the City -- or "square mile" -- is synonymous with London as a global financial centre, several prominent financial groups already have their UK headquarters at Canary Wharf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Among them are HSBC (HSBA.L), Barclays (BARC.L), Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), Lehman Brothers LEH.N, Bank of America (BAC.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Merrill Lynch MER.N, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), UBS (UBSN.VX), ING (ING.AS), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and ABN AMRO AAH.AS are in the City and its surrounding area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Songbird Estates SBDb.L, which owns the Riverside site and has planning permission to develop 1.8 million square feet &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(167,200 sq. metres) of space on it, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Jeffrey Goldfarb and William Kemble-Diaz, editing by Will Waterman, Paul Bolding; Tel: +44(0)20 7542 5228; email: william.kemble-diaz@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: william.kemble-diaz.reuters.com@reuters.net))   Keywords: JPMORGAN RELOCATION/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Motorola, updates prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Kristina Cooke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures pointed
to a lower open on Wall Street on Wednesday, dragged down by
investor concerns about technology spending after disappointing
results from Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) and brokerage downgrades of
IBM. (IBM.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N), the No. 3 U.S. bank, reported
a 55 percent rise in quarterly profit, which sent its shares
higher and lent brief support to futures. For details, see
[ID:nN18454450].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A sharp drop in the dollar could also spread caution in the
stock market where the Dow industrials stood just short of a
record high after Tuesday's gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts fear a weaker dollar could contribute to domestic
inflation as prices of imports rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the market being at high levels, investors are going
to take a bit more of a cautious attitude as the earnings
season moves into full gear," said Peter Cardillo, chief market
economist at Avalon Partners in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A mixed bag of earnings is weighing down on stocks. The
dollar is hitting lows against the pound and other currencies,
and that somewhere along the line is also a negative for
equities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  SP 500 futures SPc1 were down 3.9 points, below fair
value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking
into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration
on the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 were down 22
points and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures were down 10.5 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Internet company Yahoo reported an 11 percent fall in
first-quarter profit after the bell on Tuesday, missing Wall
Street estimates. [ID:nN1794147] Jefferies  Co. cut its price
target on Yahoo to $36 from $38, according to
theflyonthewall.com. Yahoo's shares fell 2 percent in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In more negative news for tech, shares of Research In
Motion RIMM.O fell 2 percent before the bell after a news
report that a system failure had affected users of its
Blackberry handheld devices in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest
technology services company, reported net income rose to $1.84
billion, or $1.21 per share, matching Wall Street estimates.
[nN17189627]. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs downgraded the
stock, with Goldman citing slower U.S. spending growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase said on Wednesday quarterly earnings
increased, helped by gains in investment banking and private
equity. Its shares rose 2.7 percent to $51.51 in electronic
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Motorola Inc. MOT.N, the world's second-biggest mobile
phone maker, posted a quarterly loss and lower revenue due to
weak handset pricing and a limited portfolio of advanced
phones. Its shares fell 0.9 percent to $17.78 in electronic
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan raised its rating on Intel, while Merrill Lynch
raised its second-quarter loss estimate for Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. (AMD.N), an Intel rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still in the pipeline today are earnings from Internet
auctioneer eBay Inc. (EBAY.O), which reports after the bell.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
expects to decide by mid-May whether to move its London
investment banking operations eastwards to Canary Wharf from the
City, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; One of the sources, who requested anonymity, said any move
was unlikely to happen for another four to five years, and would
not affect JP Morgan's treasury, asset management or securities
services operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would, however, include one of the oldest and best-known
UK investment banking brands -- Cazenove -- potentially dealing
a blow to the City's reputation as London's financial heartland.
JPMorgan's investment banking division is spread among seven
City locations now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. investment bank is weighing a site at the Riverside
South area just off Westferry Circus in east London and another
at Fore Street in the historic City financial district, the
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is especially keen to develop a new trading floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the City -- or "square mile" -- is synonymous with
London as a global financial centre, several prominent financial
groups already have moved their UK headquarters east to the
former brownfield site at Canary Wharf since the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among them are HSBC (HSBA.L), Barclays (BARC.L), Credit

SBDb.L, which owns the Riverside site and has planning
permission to develop 1.8 million square feet  (167,200 sq.
metres) of space on it.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    (Adds revenue, details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N), the world's largest beverage company, on Tuesday reported higher quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates as strength in emerging markets overshadowed weakness in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Net income for the first quarter ended March 30 rose 14 percent to $1.26 billion, or 54 cents per share, from $1.11 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Excluding items including a charge from an asset write-off in a Philippines bottler and gains on the sales of an equity interest in a Brazilian bottler, the company earned 56 cents per share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts on average were expecting 53 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coca-Cola, like rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP.N), has seen a slowdown in sales in mature markets such as North America as increasingly health-conscious consumers opt for bottled water or tea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coke's North American sales were flat last year, while sales in Eurasia grew in the double-digits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Net operating revenue rose 17 percent to $6.10 billion as worldwide unit case volume, a key metric in the beverage industry, grew 6 percent, helped by strength in Latin America, China, Eastern Europe, and South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Case volume was down 3 percent in North America, up 7 percent in Latin America, and up 11 percent in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coke shares have been trading in their highest range since July 2004 in recent weeks. Before Tuesday, the the stock traded at more than 19 times estimated 2007 earnings, making it the second-priciest stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI on a price to earnings basis, though its multiple is only slightly higher than that of rival PepsiCo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Derek Caney; Reuters messaging: martinne.geller.reuters.com@reuters.net; martinne.geller@reuters.com; +1 646 223 6023)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: COCACOLA RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - International Business Machines 
Corp. (IBM.N), the world's largest technology services company, 
said on Tuesday that quarterly profit rose 8 percent on higher 
sales of software and computer services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Net income rose to $1.84 billion, or $1.21 per share, 
matching Wall Street estimates. A year earlier, it earned $1.71 
billion, or $1.08 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue climbed 6.6 percent to $22.03 billion from $20.66 
billion a year earlier and topped expectations of $21.9 
billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following the earnings report in after-hours trading, IBM 
shares slipped 91 cents to $96.21 after closing up 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The worry going into the quarter was sluggishness (in) 
server spending, but the fact that IBM pulled off the quarter 
shows that the diversified portfolio of businesses is working," 
said Sunil Reddy, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset 
Management, which oversees about $21 billion, including IBM 
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company stood by its January forecast of full-year 
earnings-per-share growth of 10 percent to 12 percent, adding 
that growth would likely be around 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge told analysts 
on a conference call that weakness in the United States was 
more than offset by strong sales in Asia and in Europe, 
especially in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM paid nearly $5 billion for 13 acquisitions to boost 
sales of software and services last year, part of a strategy to 
improve profitability by selling more software-based services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said revenue at its two services businesses, which 
accounted for more than one-half of total sales in 2006, rose 8 
percent in the quarter. Services signings, a key indicator of 
future revenue, slipped to $11.1 billion from $11.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue at one services unit, Global Business Services, 
increased 8.7 percent to $4.2 billion. It was the eighth 
consecutive quarter of year-over-year pretax profit growth for 
the business, reflecting IBM's push to sell more-profitable 
software-based services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue at the other services unit, Global Technology 
Services, rose 7 percent to $8.3 billion. The first unit 
includes consulting and managing of customers' business 
software, while the other is involved in outsourcing and 
computer maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First-quarter services deals included a $775 million 
contract to manage information technology for more than 600 
Circuit City CC.N stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM, of Armonk, New York, also signed a $700 million 
extension of a contract with Germany's Sparkassen Informatik 
GmbH, which handles information technology for savings banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Software revenue rose 8.8 percent to $4.25 billion in the 
first quarter, helped by strong sales of IBM's middleware 
software for running corporate data networks. Middleware is a 
layer of software that connects applications or components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of hardware, including microprocessors and servers 
and storage gear for businesses, rose 2.3 percent to $4.52 
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock closed up 94 cents at $97.12 on the New York 
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares are down 2.3 percent this year amid investor concern 
over revenue and profit growth for 2007. The stock trades at 
about 14 times estimated 2007 earnings per share, compared with 
an average multiple of about 15 for companies on the Standard  
Poor's 500 Index .SPX, including competitor Hewlett-Packard 
Co. (HPQ.N)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 18 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Intel
Corp. (INTC.O) to "overweight," saying its share gains, stable
pricing and lower costs should drive margin expansion during
second half of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised its 2007 earnings estimates for the
chip maker to $1.03 a share from $1.00, but lowered its revenue
estimates to $36.9 billion from $37.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan said it had been positive on Intel's improved
products and restructuring efforts, but were concerned on risk
to margins due to excess processor capacity and aggressive
pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said that Intel's superior products are
taking their toll on rival AMD (AMD.N), which led to a 3
percent gain in market share during first-quarter of 2007. J.P.
Morgan added that Intel should gain share again during
second-quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect Intel gross margins to bottom in second-quarter
of 2007 and recover in the second half of 2007 due to lower
start up costs, higher revenues and improved unit costs," J.P.
Morgan said in a brokerage note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan said while Intel's inventory is still "too
high", it sees inventories decreasing in the second half of the
year due to improved unit shipments and a seasonal increase in
PC demand.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts paragraph 2, adds quotes paragraphs 3-4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tom Brown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIAMI, April 19 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) is
optimistic about the future of foreign oil companies in
Venezuela's vast Orinoco reserve after the government's planned
takeover of multibillion-dollar projects there, a Chevron
executive said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Sommer, Chevron's commercial manager for Latin
American exploration and production, said the move by the
leftist government of President Hugo Chavez stopped short of an
outright nationalization of one of the world's largest oil
reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the old days nationalization was -- they kick out the
oil companies and their nationals took over 100 percent of the
operations," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a little bit different, so I guess the word is
recapitalization," he said at a Latin American conference
sponsored by the University of Miami's Center for Hemispheric
Policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sommer said negotiations are still under way over the
government's plan to take a majority stake in Orinoco projects
valued at more than $30 billion and funded by Chevron, Exxon
Mobil (XOM.N), Conoco Phillips (COP.N), Norway's Statoil
(STL.OL), Britain's BP Plc (BP.L) and France's Total
(TOTF.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some degree of confidence about the talks was fueled by
negotiations between the Chavez government and foreign oil
majors last year, when Sommer said the foreign operators "were
fairly well treated" in operating service agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're optimistic that on these conversions of the heavy
oil projects there's an opportunity for the companies to come
out OK," he said, referring to the Orinoco contract talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High prices have allowed foreign operators to generate big
profits from Venezuelan oil, despite their sometimes harsh
treatment by Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On May 1, Venezuela's state oil company takes over the
operation of four heavy crude upgrader projects in the Orinoco
and has decreed that the new ownership structure for the joint
ventures should be finalized by June 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The projects can produce 600,000 barrels of oil per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Underpinning his upbeat assessment, Sommer said Venezuela,
a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
needs foreign cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They recognize they need the foreign oil companies. They
need our technology, and they need our capital," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We need to go where the reserves are, sometimes in
countries that have difficult local policies to deal with,"
Sommer said, speaking of the oil industry in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's our job to be above that and just be a good
international investor and partner."

segments," executive vice president Alfonso De Angoitia told an 
analysts' conference call on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Due diligence is an investigation of a potential investment 
and helps companies gather key information regarding a sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, we have not made any decision yet on whether we

during the first half of May. European and U.S. satellite 
operators are also looking at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa uses satellite signals to transmit its programming 
to partners all across the American continent. The potential 
acquisition could help cut those transmission costs and get 
additional revenue from renting Satmex transponders to other 
broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1998, Televisa pulled out from a venture it had with 
PanAmSat by selling its stake in the satellite operator to 
Hughes Electronics Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa shares ended up 0.42 percent at 66.40 pesos while 
its New York Big Board traded shares edged up 0.4 percent to 
close at $30.12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, analyst quote, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Cyntia Barrera Diaz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    MEXICO CITY, April 18 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa posted a surprise 46 percent plunge in first-quarter earnings, hurt by a one-time charge from the sale of its stake in U.S. partner Univision, losses in affiliates and higher taxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Grupo Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) said on Wednesday it earned 734 million pesos ($66 million), compared with 1.348 billion pesos in the first quarter of 2006. Results came in way below analysts' consensus estimate of 1.450 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The jump in other expenses -- up 603.3 million pesos from the same quarter a year earlier -- reflected a one-time charge after the sale of its investment in U.S. broadcaster Univision Communications Inc. UVN.N. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts think Televisa received less than it expected for the sale. Late last month, Televisa said it had sold its minority interest in Univision for $1.094 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I think that the difference between market value and the price they had projected (for the Univision stake) is what caused this virtual loss," said analyst Raul Ochoa with HSBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Net profit was also hurt after Televisa, famous for its soap operas that it sells around the world, reported a 244.4 million peso increase in losses at affiliates, particularly at its Spanish venture La Sexta, in which it holds a 40 percent interest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Quarterly profits also fell sharply because income taxes increased by 35 million pesos, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Quarterly revenue rose 5.9 percent to 8.232 billion pesos &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($745 million), above analysts' expectations, driven by its satellite and cable television businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa's core broadcasting sales fell 3.8 percent in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This decrease reflects primarily the absence of political advertising related to the presidential elections in Mexico sold during the first quarter of 2006," the company said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mexican broadcasters benefited from political and soccer World Cup advertising during the first half of last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Satellite unit SKY reported a 11 percent rise in first-quarter revenue while sales at cable television unit Cablevision grew by 28 percent in the period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Other business segments with strong revenue growth in the quarter were programming exports, driven by royalties from Univision, and magazine publishing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Televisa shares fell 0.88 percent to close at 66.12 pesos on Wednesday while its New York-traded shares dropped 1.19 percent to $30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   ($1=11.044 pesos as of end March) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   (Additional reporting by Armando Tovar) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Cyntia Barrera Diaz, editing by Richard Chang; mexicocity.newsroom@reuters.com, Reuters Messaging: cyntia.barrera.reuters.com@reuters.net +52 55 5282 7161)) Keywords: TELEVISA RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

Usen Corp. 4842.OJ, making it the second-biggest shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Usen, which also offers broadband Internet service and

Usen President Yasuhide Uno, which last year bought 30 billion

&lt;p&gt;    (Adds background and details, share reaction) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) on Wednesday reported a 55 percent increase in quarterly earnings, helped by gains in investment banking and private equity, and bolstered its dividend and stock buyback plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Net income rose to $4.8 billion, or $1.34 a share from $3.1 billion, or 86 cents, a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Results were boosted by a one-time gain of $391 million, or 11 cents a share from the adoption of a new accounting rule.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings of $1.02 before extraordinary items, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan shares were up 2.9 percent in pre-market electronic trading after the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The No. 3 U.S. bank also said it was raising its quarterly dividend by 12 percent to 38 cents a share and authorized a new $10 billion stock buyback program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The repurchase plan replaces a prior, $8 billion one which had $850 million remaining to be bought.   JPMorgan shares are up 3.9 percent so far this year, outperforming the KBW Banks index .BKX, which was down 1.9 percent for the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The No. 3 U.S. bank has been focused on growth, changing course from its previous focus on cost savings from a series of previous acquisitions and mergers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Executives have said they plan to invest $1 billion in investment banking in 2007 -- about one third greater than in 2006 -- to expand in markets including energy trading in Asia.  Investment banking was one of the bank's strongest areas in the quarter, posting an 81 percent gain in profit to $1.54 billion, helped by strong revenue from fees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Retail banking profit fell 2 percent to $859 million as its provision for credit losses more than tripled from a year ago to $292 million due to higher losses in its subprime mortgage portfolio and on home equity loans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Gains on private equity investments helped JPMorgan's corporate bank swing to a $631 million profit from a $366 million loss in the year-ago period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Reporting by Christian Plumb; Editing by Derek Caney; Reuters Messaging: christian.plumb.reuters.com@reuters.net +1 646 223-6134)) Keywords: JPMORGANCHASE RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on Lipitor in paragraphs 7-9) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. said on Friday it was placing a hold on development of any drugs in the same class as torcetrapib, its experimental product that dramatically raised "good" HDL cholesterol but was scrapped after being linked to deaths in a large trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer (PFE.N) research chief John LaMattina told analysts on a conference call that torcetrapib's failure to cut levels of plaque in coronary arteries, even as it sharply raised HDL, had shaken confidence in the so-called CETP-inhibitor class of drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "That has given us and a lot of other people pause," said LaMattina, whose company last year had highlighted the potential of its other CETP inhibitors in earlier stages of testing. But that was before Pfizer scrapped torcetrapib, whose late-stage trials were the most costly in history, last December. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have not ended development of the drugs; we've put them on hold," a Pfizer spokesman said, as the company continues to assess potential of the medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He said Pfizer had halted an early-stage trial of one CETP inhibitor, in the wake of torcetrapib's failure, but had already completed an early-stage trial of another drug in the class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Similar drugs are being developed by Merck &amp; Co. (MRK.N) and by a partnership of Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX) and Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914.T) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    During the conference call, Pfizer executives said favorable rebate trends that bolstered first-quarter sales of cholesterol fighter Lipitor will turn "slightly negative" during the remainder of 2007, crimping performance of the company's biggest product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Global Lipitor sales rose 8 percent to $3.36 billion in the quarter, although the number of prescriptions fell in the important United States market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The product's first-quarter sales growth was due to price hikes and favorable rebate trends in the period, company officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, editing by Jerry Kearney; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER HDL/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) said on Friday quarterly earnings fell on special charges, anemic sales of inhaled diabetes drug Exubera and plunging demand for drugs facing generic competition, sending shares down 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest drugmaker said its 2007 earnings will be below Wall Street expectations due to the unexpectedly swift introduction of cheaper generic forms of its hypertension treatment Norvasc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said 2008 revenue will be little changed from 2007, which itself was expected to be flat with last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer also warned that sales of its biggest product, cholesterol fighter Lipitor could have "modest growth to modest decline" this year because more U.S. patients than expected switched to cheaper generic forms of Merck &amp; Co's (MRK.N) rival Zocor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer earned $3.39 billion, or 48 cents per share, in the first quarter, compared with $4.11 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Excluding special items, New York-based Pfizer earned 68 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 57 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Revenue rose 6 percent to $12.47 billion, topping the Reuters Estimate of $11.77 billion, helped by surging sales of its drug Lyrica used to treat neuropathic pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Company sales growth has also stalled due to generic competition for other former big-sellers, including antibiotic Zithromax and anti-depressant Zoloft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer in January said revenue in 2007 should be flat, but that earnings would grow about 6 percent to 9 percent thanks in part to ongoing cost-cutting efforts, including an ongoing effort to cut 10,000 jobs by 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Derek Caney; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details and background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) followed Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) on Friday by unveiling an exclusive distribution system for its medicines in Britain, in a move that is likely to anger third-party distributors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Anglo-Swedish group said it had appointed AAH Pharmaceuticals and UniChem, the wholesaling division of Alliance Boots Plc AB.L, as its agency partners to deliver medicines directly to pharmacies, doctors and hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The new supply system, which AstraZeneca plans to implement in late summer, replaces the traditional one of supplying products indirectly through multiple wholesalers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    AstraZeneca said it had made the change to "simplify and modernise" supply arrangements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But the move will add to controversy about a trend which Pfizer started last month when it began selling its products through a single wholesaler. The U.S. giant also chose UniChem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Britain's consumer affairs watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading, said two weeks ago it would investigate the market for distributing medicines in the wake of the Pfizer move, although this probe will not stop the new scheme from continuing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Independent wholesalers argue that exclusive distribution deals stifle competition and could undermine Britain's flexible round-the-clock drug-ordering and delivery service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ben Hirschler, editing by Quentin Bryar; email: ben.hirschler@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: ben.hirschler.reuters.com@reuters.net; +44 20 7542 5082))   Keywords: ASTRAZENECA BOOTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

Inc. (WMT.N) empire that is now the world's biggest retailer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mrs. Walton, widow of legendary Wal-Mart's founder "Mr.
Sam," died of natural causes after having been in poor health
recently. She was 87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The woman her husband called "pretty and smart and
educated, ambitious and opinionated and strong-willed," was
also responsible for giving women a greater role in running
Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She pressed her husband to include women on the board of
directors -- which he did in 1986, bringing on Arkansas lawyer
and first lady of the state, Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mrs. Walton didn't win every battle, though. She also
complained about Sam forcing Wal-Mart managers to work on
Saturdays, a policy -- still commonplace at Wal-Mart -- she
said damaged families because it kept parents away from their
children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helen Walton was born on Dec. 3, 1919, and graduated from
the University of Oklahoma with a degree in finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She met her future husband at a bowling alley in her
hometown of Claremore, Oklahoma, and they were married on
Valentine's Day in 1943.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They had four children; Rob, John, Jim and Alice; eight
grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Rob Walton now
serves as Wal-Mart's chairman. John Walton died in a plane
crash in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  In 1950, five years after opening the Ben Franklin store,
Sam opened Walton's 510 in Bentonville, Arkansas, where
Wal-Mart is still based. Sam opened his first Wal-Mart discount
store in Rogers, Arkansas, not far from Bentonville, in 1962.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sam's strategy was to bring low prices to underserved rural
communities, and many analysts contend that his plan might not
have worked so well had he targeted larger cities from the
start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wal-Mart now faces fierce opposition as it tries to expand
into major urban areas. Critics allege that Wal-Mart forces
local retailers out of business, drives down employee wages,
increases traffic, and hurts the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FAMILY FORTUNE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mrs. Walton ranked 11th on the 2006 Forbes list of the
richest Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other Walton family members hold four of the top 10 spots.
The family's combined fortune is above that of the richest
person, Bill Gates. The Walton family controls around 40
percent of Wal-Mart's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After Sam's death in 1992, Helen Walton served as a vital
link to her husband's legacy at a company that still turns to
the words of its founder for wisdom. Company executives
routinely quote from Sam's autobiography, and use clips of his
speeches to motivate employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Sen. Clinton, who left the Wal-Mart board in 1992 as
Bill Clinton campaigned for president, said it was Helen and
daughter Alice who convinced Sam that it was time to break up
the boardroom boys' club and invite women to join the ranks of
directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sam phoned Clinton and said, "They tell me I have to have a
woman on the board. Do you want to be her?" Clinton recalled in
a January 2004 speech to the National Retail Federation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sam had a chance to buy a Federated department store in St.
Louis in 1945, but Helen "laid down the law," as Sam put it in
his 1992 autobiography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Sam, we've been married two years and we've moved 16
times. Now, I'll go with you any place you want so long as you
don't ask me to live in a big city. Ten thousand people is
enough for me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helen Walton always drew standing ovations from the
18,000-strong crowds when she arrived at Wal-Mart annual
meetings. Her health, however, did not permit her to attend in
recent years.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp., trying to meet its goal of doubling the number of computer users to 2 billion by 2015, promised to cut its software prices to governments in developing countries that provide free computers to school children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates announced the program at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it plans to offer a software package called Microsoft Student Innovation Suite for $3 to governments purchasing and giving Windows-based computer to primary and secondary students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software bundle, which will be available in the second half of 2007, includes Windows XP Starter Edition, Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007, Windows Live Mail desktop and other programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not a philanthropic effort, this is a business," Orlando Ayala, senior vice president at Microsoft's emerging segments market development group in an interview before the official announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many emerging markets, Microsoft has seen its software pirated and sold at a fraction of the price of a genuine product. Microsoft said the  technology industry must also adapt business models to developing nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is working with retailers and computer makers in Brazil to test a pay-as-you-go system, because that model has been successful with mobile phones in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Televisa said it is interested in 
buying Satmex, a move that could return it to the satellite 
business, cut transmission costs and strengthen the Mexican 
broadcaster's footprint from Canada to Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Satmex is Mexico's main satellite operator but the company 
was in financial trouble until it refinanced its bulky debt 
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa said it had not decided yet if it will bid for the 
firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are just analyzing it. We are in the process of due 
diligence. We are learning about that business, about the 
synergies that it would have with other (Televisa) business 
segments," executive vice president Alfonso De Angoitia told an 
analysts' conference call on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Due diligence is an investigation of a potential investment 
and helps companies gather key information regarding a sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, we have not made any decision yet on whether we 
are going forward or not," De Angoitia added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Satmex said last month that it expected to go on auction 
during the first half of May. European and U.S. satellite 
operators are also looking at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa uses satellite signals to transmit its programming 
to partners all across the American continent. The potential 
acquisition could help cut those transmission costs and get 
additional revenue from renting Satmex transponders to other 
broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1998, Televisa pulled out from a venture it had with 
PanAmSat by selling its stake in the satellite operator to 
Hughes Electronics Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa shares ended up 0.42 percent at 66.40 pesos while 
its New York Big Board traded shares edged up 0.4 percent to 
close at $30.12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) cut its 2007 forecast on Friday on plunging demand for hypertension drug Norvasc in the face of generic competition and warned of potentially lower sales of cholesterol fighter Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although first-quarter results beat expectations, the world's largest drugmaker lowered its 2007 sales and earnings forecasts largely due to the U.S. arrival in March -- six months ahead of expectations -- of cheaper generic forms of Norvasc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were flat in early trade. The stock has underperformed its peers in the past year, but the company's hefty dividend and valuation discount relative to its rivals are supporting the share price, analysts said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's basically a whole host of issues that appear to be plaguing the company in a difficult period," said Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Norvasc, still the company's second-biggest medicine, fell 10 percent to $1.1 billion in the quarter, but are expected to shrink more dramatically later this year as new copycats reach drugstores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it now expects company revenue in both 2007 and 2008 to be essentially flat with, or possibly a bit lower than, the $48.4 billion seen last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It trimmed its 2007 earnings outlook to between $2.08 and $2.15 per share, which translates into growth of up to 4.3 percent. In January, it had projected growth of up to 9.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also cautioned that sales of Lipitor, its biggest product, this year could have "modest growth to modest decline" as U.S. patients keep switching to cheaper generic forms of Merck  Co's (MRK.N) rival Zocor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lipitor first-quarter sales rose 8 percent to $3.36 billion, helped by a price increase in January, which A.G. Edwards analyst Joseph Tooley said was about $260 million above his expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer earned $3.39 billion, or 48 cents per share, in the first quarter, compared with $4.11 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, New York-based Pfizer earned 68 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 57 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 6 percent to $12.47 billion, topping the Reuters Estimate of $11.77 billion, helped by surging sales of its drug Lyrica used to treat neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooley said total revenues in the quarter exceeded his estimate by about $650 million, enabling Pfizer to handily beat earnings forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyrica sales more than doubled to $395 million, while sales of arthritis treatment Celebrex jumped 22 percent to $598 million as the company stepped up its marketing efforts behind the drug. Caduet, a new smoking-cessation drug, contributed $146 million in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sales of anti-depressant Zoloft and antibiotic Zithromax fell 81 percent and 49 percent, respectively, crushed by generic competition, together shedding $761 million in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Pfizer expects no revenue growth through at least 2008, it aims to deliver some profit growth thanks to ongoing cost-cutting efforts, including an ongoing effort to cut 10,000 jobs by 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer was even at $27.07 in early trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds government reaction, banker comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Lefteris Papadimas and Dina Kyriakidou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATHENS, April 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan on Friday offered to
buy back a Greek state bond it underwrote, which ended up with
Greek pension funds, amid accusations by ministers that the
structured bond was overpriced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The affair has been in the headlines for weeks, leading to
the resignation of a state pension fund head and hurting the
government's popularity during an election year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said in a statement it was offering to buy back the
structured bond, hoping others involved in its subsequent sale
would follow its example, in an effort to protect the interests
of both the Greek state and pension funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the questions that have arisen over what has happened
with this bond ... our proposal to buy back the bond and end the
swap will help reach the best result for all those concerned,"
JPMorgan said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The structured 280-million-euro bond, which was issued on
Feb. 22, 2007 with an initial coupon of 6.25 percent and
terminates in 2019, changed several hands before ending up with
the public servants auxiliary pension fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following press revelations and accusations by government
ministers that the fund paid too much for the bond, the
governnent appointed a special investigator to probe the case,
banned funds from investing in structured bonds and revamped
legislation of how they invest their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The country's capital markets commission on Wednesday
revoked the license of Acropolis Securities, saying the
brokerage, which sold the bond to the pension fund, had acted in
a way that hurt its client's interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government will examine all aspects of the JPMorgan
proposal, with the full recovery of any possible financial loss
to pension funds from the trading of the bond on the secondary
market as the main criterion," government spokesman Theodore
Roussopoulos told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bankers said JPMorgan's offer was aimed at showing its role
in the bond was transparent and to assist a major client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After the whole affair, I think JPMorgan did this to help
the Greek state, one of its biggest clients. It wants to show it
has done nothing wrong," a banker at a major Greek treasury told
Reuters on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said that, as the underwriter of the bond, it sold
it to the North Asset Management (NAM) brokerage according to
market rules. It offered to buy it back from NAM at its sale
price, that is 92.95 percent of its nominal value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Following this, JPMorgan is willing to return the bond to
the Hellenic Republic under the original terms and to cancel the
swap, so that the Greek state will suffer no damages from this
transaction," JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said it hoped that all those who participated in trading
the bond from then on will make similar offers to buy it back so
that the current owners will suffer no financial damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greece's committee against money laundering, currently
investigating whether the pension fund was overcharged for the
bond, expects to conclude its probe by May. Its findings may
lead to criminal charges.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, April 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) said on Monday it had responded to European Commission charges that it set unreasonably high prices to discourage would-be competitors from making server software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company also said it would not request an oral hearing on the charges, which could result in a new fine against it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Microsoft confirmed that it has submitted today its response to the European Commission's statement of objections &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SO) of March 1, 2007, concerning the pricing of licenses for the work group server protocol program," it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In March 2004, the Commission imposed a record 497 million euro ($674 million) fine on Microsoft and ordered it to change its business practices, ruling the company had failed to give information to other makers of small-business servers needed to compete with Microsoft's products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft has said it would charge for interoperability information because it was based on the company's own innovative work and protected by patents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But the Commission charged in March this year that competitors gave away such software whether or not it was patented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The Commission's current view is that there is no significant innovation in these protocols," European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement that month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I am therefore again obliged to take formal measures to ensure that Microsoft complies with its obligations," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Commission spokesman said in March that Microsoft's market share of small-business server software had grown to 75 percent while it defied the Commission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by David Lawsky, editing by Dale Hudson; Reuters  messaging david.lawsky.reuters.com@reuters.net; e-mail  david.lawsky@reuters.com; +322-287-6811.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors and analysts painted Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) as the sick man of the pharmaceutical industry on Monday but disagreed on what is needed to get the world's biggest drugmaker back on its feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said the company is in dire straits from failed strategies that could take years to fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its shares fell for a second day, down 2.5 percent to $26.30 in afternoon trading, after Pfizer warned on Friday that sales of Lipitor, its $13-billion-a-year cholesterol fighter, may begin a downswing this year due to tougher competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remedies suggested for the company range from staying its current course of slashing costs to offset anemic drug sales, to making substantial acquisitions, to breaking the company into separately traded units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the stock may be at the bottom, it is unclear to us what will lift it from here short of something revolutionary," said Prudential analyst Tim Anderson, who cut his rating on Pfizer stock to "neutral" from "overweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson said Pfizer's best bet is to either break up the company -- an option Pfizer last week said is not on the drawing board -- or buy sizable rival drugmakers to obtain their marketed and experimental medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jon Fisher, a portfolio manager with Fifth Third Asset Management, said Pfizer should make no drastic moves. Instead, it should bring costs in line with its revenues, which are being eaten away by competition from generic drugs, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They don't need to do anything special or magical. Just run the business," Fisher said. "The market doesn't want patches. The market wants execution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should Pfizer be broken up, Fisher said, its various parts are unlikely to fetch more than $29 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FILLING THE GAP?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts cited increased concern about how Pfizer will fill the gap as more of its drugs continue to face generic competition and Lipitor loses its U.S. marketing exclusivity as soon as 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer on Friday said profits will grow as much as 4 percent this year but sales will be roughly flat through 2008 due to patent expirations for its treatments of depression, allergies and high blood pressure. In the absence of new potential big-selling drugs, the company is relying on cost cuts to ensure some earnings growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To the extent that Lipitor remains on its current trajectory, we would become less confident in Pfizer's ability to meet its 2007 and 2008 guidance," without paring costs further, A.G. Edwards analyst Joseph Tooley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares have risen 6 percent over the past year, supported by the industry's largest dividend and comfort with the drugmaker's mountain of cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the share gain is about half those of large U.S. and European drugmakers as measured by the American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical Index. .DRG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer trades at a 21 percent discount to its peers based on earnings estimates for 2008, according to Tooley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer is clearly a cheap stock, but it's cheap for a reason," Morgan Stanley analyst Jami Rubin said in a research note, saying company earnings prospects are modest even if it cuts costs deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FALLING INTO TRAP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubin said Pfizer has fallen into a trap of relying on cost savings from mergers to provide earnings growth, while it has failed to come up with lucrative new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer's past acquisitions have been shareholder destructive as reflected in its low returns," said Rubin. She suggested the company use its extensive cash holdings to buy back stock, continue to raise its dividend, pare its bureaucracy and buy important new products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred Burke, president of Johnson Lemon Asset Management, said he plans to hold on to his Pfizer shares at least another year in hopes the company will break out of its long slump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They dropped the ball for the last five years, but Pfizer has a great name, and I think they'll come back because you can only be down so long," Burke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had been counting on torcetrapib, a drug that raises levels of "good" HDL cholesterol, to rake in annual sales of $10 billion or more after Lipitor loses patent protection. But it scrapped the experimental drug in December after it was linked to deaths in a big clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big thing is how are they going to replace Lipitor, and they haven't told us anything yet," Burke said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALAMEDA, California (Reuters) - The U.S. Coast Guard unloaded nearly 20 tons of cocaine with a retail street value of $600 million into a California port on Monday following what they called the largest drug bust ever at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The armed Coast Guard cutter Sherman stopped the Panamanian cargo ship Gatun about 20 miles off a Panamanian island on March 17. On Monday dozens of Coast Guard officials under heavy armed protection hauled bales of tightly wrapped packs of cocaine onto a pier at the service's West Coast command center near Oakland, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was the largest bust in U.S. history. It's the largest interdiction on the ocean," Lt. Brock Eckel, one of the officers from the Sherman who discovered the illegal drugs, said in an interview. "It was very exciting, of course. Fifteen guys moved 20 tons of contraband in five hours, so it was very exhausting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The find aboard the Gatun, which was heading from Panama to Mexico in the Pacific Ocean, came late at night following a tip from an intelligence source, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coast Guard Petty Officer Keith Alholm estimated the U.S. street value of the record bust at $300 million wholesale, $600 million retail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cargo ship's 14 crew members were Panamanians and Mexicans, who acted nervously but were not armed and offered no resistance when stopped, Coast Guard officials present during the inspection said. The cargo ship also carried tiles and sand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you try to fight with the U.S. Coast Guard, you come out on the losing end. It would be futile," said Charles DeMore, head of the San Francisco office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Panamanians were handed over to Panama while the Mexicans were taken into U.S. custody, Eckel said. The drugs would be transferred to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency for eventual incineration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coast Guard ship had experienced mechanical difficulties during its mission and was running so low on water that the crew had stopped showering by the time of the March 17 raid, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the end of the day there is nothing like a good drug bust to lift everyone's spirit," said the ship's captain, Charlie Diaz. "We were, of course, elated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alameda, California-based crew also made two smaller drug interdictions during their 101-day patrol at sea, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Scott Hillis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs Group 
Inc. (GS.N) said on Monday it raised a $20 billion private 
equity fund, the largest amount ever raised by a firm for 
leveraged buyouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman said the total includes $11 billion from 
institutional and high net worth clients and $9 billion from 
the firm and its employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund, known as GS Capital Partners VI, makes Goldman 
the only investment bank to have a buyout fund on par with the 
largest private equity firms -- known in the industry as "mega 
funds"-- which dole out billions of dollars in fees to Wall 
Street every year through huge corporate buyouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's massive fund increases the chances of the firm 
competing with its most prized private equity clients. The fund 
also goes to show how successful Goldman has been with its 
leveraged buyout business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity firms buy controlling stakes in companies, 
restructure the businesses, and often sell them two to four 
years later. They typically borrow two-thirds of the money to 
make their purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By comparison, the largest buyout fund to officially close 
in the last year was TPG, which raised $14 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blackstone Group closed a $15.6 billion fund last year, but 
reopened it to more commitments. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co. 
is expected to close on a roughly $16 billion fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the prior investments Goldman has made with its 
buyout arm are food company Aramark Corp., burger chain Burger

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, April 23 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp.'s (CVX.N)
243,000 barrel per day (bpd) San Francisco Bay-area refinery in
Richmond, California, reported flaring to state pollution
regulators on Monday after a lube oil plant flare gas
compressor shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a filing with the California Office of Emergency
Services, Chevron said the loss of a compressor caused an
overpressure and triggered the flaring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; West Coast refined products traders said wholesale gasoline
prices in the Los Angeles market climbed 7.5 cents in part due
to the flaring at the Chevron refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokesman was not immediately available to
discuss refinery operations.

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta, April 23 (Reuters) - An Exxon Mobil Corp.
(XOM.N) manager will take over as chief executive of Syncrude
Canada Ltd. next month as the joint venture's partners agreed
to back a plan to have Exxon Mobil and its Canadian affiliate
staff key positions at the world's biggest oil sands project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tom Katinas, who has run Exxon Mobil's 300,000 barrel-a-day
Fawley Refinery in Britain for the past four years, will
replace outgoing chief executive Charles Ruigrok on May 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO.TO), 69.6 percent owned by Exxon
Mobil, agreed last year to second management to Syncrude
Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move came after a problem-plagued expansion at the oil
sands project in northern Alberta opened last year. The C$8.4
billion ($7.5 billion) expansion boosted output at the project
to about 350,000 barrels a day, a 100,000 bpd increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project, however, was beset by construction delays,
cost overruns and start-up problems. Among the problems, an
expensive new coker, part of the refining plant that converts
bitumen stripped from the sands into synthetic crude oil, had
to be closed for weeks last year after area residents
complained of urine-like odors wafting from the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ruigrok, also on secondment to Syncrude from Imperial, has
been chief executive since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canadian Oil Sands Trust COS_u.TO, Syncrude largest
shareholder with a 36.7 percent stake, said all the partners
have now formally agreed to let Imperial, which owns 25
percent, provide managers to the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some Syncrude staff may also be seconded to jobs within
Exxon Mobil, the trust said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other partners are Petro-Canada PCA.TO,
ConocoPhillips (COP.N), Nexen Inc. NXY.TO, Nippon Oil Corp.
5001.T unit Mocal Energy Ltd., and Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=$1.12 Canadian)

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft may face a new kind of antitrust punishment from the European Union if the company, already hit by multi-million-dollar fines, continues to defy it, the bloc's top competition official hinted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU's executive Commission has said Microsoft set unreasonably high prices to discourage would-be competitors from making server software. The company responded on Monday that it would request no oral hearing on the allegation, which could result in fines of up to 3 million euros ($4 million) daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes -- referring to Microsoft -- said that when a company repeatedly failed to comply with Commission orders it might be time for a new tack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could be reasonable to draw the conclusion that behavioral remedies are ineffective and that a structural remedy is warranted," she said in a transcript of remarks made last week and provided by her office on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2004 the Commission fined Microsoft a record 497 million euros and ordered it to change its business practices, ruling the firm had failed to give information to other makers of small-business servers needed to compete with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it would charge for interoperability information because the data was based on the company's own innovative work and protected by patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Commission charged in March this year that competitors gave away such software whether or not it was patented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission's current view is that there is no significant innovation in these protocols," Kroes said in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said on Monday the firm needed "greater clarity on what prices the Commission wants us to charge, and we believe that is more likely to come from a constructive conversation than from a formal hearing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Commission spokesman said: "We have received the Microsoft reply to our statement of objections and the Commission will study it carefully."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Kroes told the American Bar Association in Washington: "In 50 years of EU antitrust policy we have never before encountered a company that has refused to comply with a Commission decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the possibility of structural remedies was specifically mentioned in European law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the request of the U.S. Justice Department a federal judge ordered Microsoft broken up in 2000, but his decision was later thrown out by an appeals court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Commission spokesman said in March that Microsoft's market share of small-business server software had grown to 75 percent while it defied the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has appealed against the Commission's original 2004 decision and is awaiting a ruling by the European Union's second-highest court, the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROTTERDAM, April 23 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) has
agreed to sell its Benelux fuel stations to Israel's Delek Group
DELKG.TA as part of its strategy to cut downstream activities
in Europe, a Rotterdam oil industry source said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's already a done deal. Delek is buying the Texaco

still going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The discussions are still ongoing. I cannot give any other
details," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. oil major has more than 560 service stations under
the Texaco brand in the Netherlands, 329 of which are owned by a
number of joint ventures in which Chevron holds an approximately
50 percent interest, it said on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also has about 300 Texaco-branded service stations in
Belgium, of which about 55 percent are Chevron owned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Israeli energy, automotive and real estate conglomerate
said last November it was in exclusive talks with Chevron over
the purchase of the Benelux stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last July, Chevron said it would sell its 31 percent stake
in the Rotterdam based Nerefco refinery, Europe's second
biggest, and its fuel stations in the Benelux as it no longer
viewed European downstream as a core part of its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, British oil giant BP Plc (BP.L) agreed to buy
Chevron's Dutch manufacturing business for around $900 million,
including the 31 percent of the 400,000 barrel a day Nerefco
refinery that BP did not already own.

percent stake in the Thevenard assets located off Western
Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Australia's managing director, Jay Johnson, said in

the company to focus on "higher impact" opportunities within
its Australia and Asian portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the assets included oil fields with a combined
production capacity of about 3,000 barrels per day (bpd), as
well as pipeline infrastructure on Thevenard Island used for
processing and storing hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will be setting up a data room over the next few
weeks," said Chevron's spokesman Mike Edmonson. "If we get the
right price from an operator whom we know can operate the
assets safely, we will sell the assets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other venture partners in the Thevenard Island assets are
Australia oil and gas producer Santos Ltd. (STO.AX), which
holds a 35.7 percent stake, and a subsidiary of ExxonMobil

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details and background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) followed Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) on Friday by unveiling an exclusive distribution system for its medicines in Britain, in a move that is likely to anger third-party distributors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Anglo-Swedish group said it had appointed AAH Pharmaceuticals and UniChem, the wholesaling division of Alliance Boots Plc AB.L, as its agency partners to deliver medicines directly to pharmacies, doctors and hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The new supply system, which AstraZeneca plans to implement in late summer, replaces the traditional one of supplying products indirectly through multiple wholesalers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    AstraZeneca said it had made the change to "simplify and modernise" supply arrangements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But the move will add to controversy about a trend which Pfizer started last month when it began selling its products through a single wholesaler. The U.S. giant also chose UniChem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Britain's consumer affairs watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading, said two weeks ago it would investigate the market for distributing medicines in the wake of the Pfizer move, although this probe will not stop the new scheme from continuing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Independent wholesalers argue that exclusive distribution deals stifle competition and could undermine Britain's flexible round-the-clock drug-ordering and delivery service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ben Hirschler, editing by Quentin Bryar; email: ben.hirschler@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: ben.hirschler.reuters.com@reuters.net; +44 20 7542 5082))   Keywords: ASTRAZENECA BOOTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on Lipitor in paragraphs 7-9) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. said on Friday it was placing a hold on development of any drugs in the same class as torcetrapib, its experimental product that dramatically raised "good" HDL cholesterol but was scrapped after being linked to deaths in a large trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer (PFE.N) research chief John LaMattina told analysts on a conference call that torcetrapib's failure to cut levels of plaque in coronary arteries, even as it sharply raised HDL, had shaken confidence in the so-called CETP-inhibitor class of drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "That has given us and a lot of other people pause," said LaMattina, whose company last year had highlighted the potential of its other CETP inhibitors in earlier stages of testing. But that was before Pfizer scrapped torcetrapib, whose late-stage trials were the most costly in history, last December. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We have not ended development of the drugs; we've put them on hold," a Pfizer spokesman said, as the company continues to assess potential of the medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He said Pfizer had halted an early-stage trial of one CETP inhibitor, in the wake of torcetrapib's failure, but had already completed an early-stage trial of another drug in the class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Similar drugs are being developed by Merck &amp; Co. (MRK.N) and by a partnership of Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX) and Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914.T) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    During the conference call, Pfizer executives said favorable rebate trends that bolstered first-quarter sales of cholesterol fighter Lipitor will turn "slightly negative" during the remainder of 2007, crimping performance of the company's biggest product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Global Lipitor sales rose 8 percent to $3.36 billion in the quarter, although the number of prescriptions fell in the important United States market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The product's first-quarter sales growth was due to price hikes and favorable rebate trends in the period, company officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, editing by Jerry Kearney; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER HDL/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

(PFE.N) said on Friday quarterly earnings fell on special charges, anemic sales of inhaled diabetes drug Exubera and plunging demand for drugs facing generic competition, sending shares down 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest drugmaker said its 2007 earnings will be below Wall Street expectations due to the unexpectedly swift introduction of cheaper generic forms of its hypertension treatment Norvasc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said 2008 revenue will be little changed from 2007, which itself was expected to be flat with last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer also warned that sales of its biggest product, cholesterol fighter Lipitor could have "modest growth to modest decline" this year because more U.S. patients than expected switched to cheaper generic forms of Merck &amp; Co's (MRK.N) rival Zocor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer earned $3.39 billion, or 48 cents per share, in the first quarter, compared with $4.11 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Excluding special items, New York-based Pfizer earned 68 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 57 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Revenue rose 6 percent to $12.47 billion, topping the Reuters Estimate of $11.77 billion, helped by surging sales of its drug Lyrica used to treat neuropathic pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Company sales growth has also stalled due to generic competition for other former big-sellers, including antibiotic Zithromax and anti-depressant Zoloft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer in January said revenue in 2007 should be flat, but that earnings would grow about 6 percent to 9 percent thanks in part to ongoing cost-cutting efforts, including an ongoing effort to cut 10,000 jobs by 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Derek Caney; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL, April 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is
finalising talks to buy a South Korean asset management firm,
majority owned by Australia's Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX, two
sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman wants to buy Macquarie-IMM Investment Management, in
which the Australian investment bank controls 65 percent, with
domestic investment firm IMM Co. Ltd. owning the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Macquarie had not originally thought to sell Macquarie IMM,
but switched its stance after three to four financial services
firms expressed keen interest and made good offers to buy it,"
one of the two sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Among them, Goldman proposed the best offer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The size of the potential deal has yet to be disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and Macquarie declined comment.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) will likely 
report a sharp increase in quarterly sales and profit this 
week, but the real focus for investors will be a first look at 
the company's expectations for the next business year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software maker reports results on 
Thursday for its fiscal third quarter ended March, with 
earnings expected to get a boost from about $1.7 billion in 
deferred revenue from the second quarter tied to software 
upgrade coupons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft expects Windows Vista and Office 2007, the latest 
versions of its two flagship products, to underpin earnings 
growth over the next few years. After several delays, Microsoft 
released Vista and Office 2007 to consumers in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe investors will look to fiscal year 2008 
guidance to get a sense of the company's expectations for Vista 
uptake and impact," Charles Di Bona, research analyst at 
Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's 2008 business year, which starts in July, 
will be the first full year of earnings to benefit from 
consumers buying new computers loaded with the new software or 
companies upgrading systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street analysts, on average, forecast Microsoft to 
earn $1.69 per share in 2008 on revenue of $56.3 billion with 
estimates ranging from $55.3 billion to $59.6 billion, 
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft toned down expectations for Windows Vista in 
February when Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said some analysts' 
forecasts for fiscal 2008 revenue for the new operating system 
were "overly aggressive."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PREMIUM VISTA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the company said it sold more than 20 million 
Windows Vista licenses in the first month of general sales, but 
analysts want more information on how premium versions of the 
operating system, which earn better profit margins, are 
selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The key to the Vista story is not PC units," said Jane 
Snorek, a technology analyst for First American Funds. "The key 
will be how many people buy the higher versions of Vista."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the latest quarter, analysts forecast earnings per 
share of 46 cents versus 29 cents in the year-ago period, on 
sales of $13.88 billion with estimates ranging from $13.73 
billion to $14.09 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft continues to benefit from rapid growth at its 
server and tools business, helped by strong sales of SQL Server 
database software. The server segment has been Microsoft's most 
consistent growth area, posting sales growth above 10 percent 
in six straight quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue at the company's entertainment and devices unit is 
expected to decline after Microsoft in January lowered its 
shipment target for its Xbox 360 console for the year ending in 
June to relieve some retail inventory build-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's online services arm has seen sales fall for 
four straight quarters and analysts expect that segment to end 
the losing streak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors will also be listening closely to how the company 
expects to compete better with Google Inc. (GOOG.O), especially 
after the Web search leader beat out Microsoft to acquire 
online advertising provider DoubleClick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has announced changes 
to how it accounts for revenue at its mainstay Windows client 
business that could affect the company's sales growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the past, Microsoft deferred a portion of Windows XP -- 
Vista's predecessor -- sales over the expected lifetime of the 
product. With Vista, it will account for sales immediately with 
no deferrals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanford Bernstein's Di Bona expects the accounting change 
to add 3.4 percentage points, or nearly $1 billion, to sales 
growth at the Windows business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow Jones industrial average rose on Tuesday as IBM boosted its dividend by a third and as companies such as DuPont Co. (DD.N) posted strong earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the sharpest monthly drop in U.S. existing-home sales in 18 years weighed on the broader market and tempered the Dow's late surge toward the 13,000 milestone.

&lt;p&gt;SILVER SPRING, Maryland (Reuters) - A novel AIDS drug by Pfizer Inc. should be approved to give a new option to patients who are not responding to current medicines, U.S. advisers unanimously said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration is expected to make a final decision on the drug, called maraviroc, within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twice-a-day pill is the first designed to keep the HIV virus from entering healthy immune cells. Older AIDS medicines attack the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maraviroc may benefit some patients who are running out of alternatives, panel members said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a clear indication it is helpful for patients who don't have other options," said Dr. Barbara Alexander, a panel member from Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer should continue studying the drug after approval to learn more about potential risks, panel members said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA usually approves drugs that win endorsements from advisory panels. Industry analysts have projected maraviroc sales of about $500 million in 2011 if the drug goes to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 25,000 to 40,000 U.S. AIDS patients resist treatment with current drugs meant to keep the virus at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 45 percent of patients who took maraviroc in Pfizer studies had their HIV suppressed to undetectable levels. The same was true for 23 percent who got a placebo. All patients also were treated with a cocktail of the best available drugs and had tried other regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maraviroc blocks the CCR5 co-receptor that serves as a main doorway for the HIV virus into immune cells. HIV needs to get into the cells to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found years ago that the fraction of people without a working CCR5 receptor seemed resistant to HIV infection or slow to develop full-blown AIDS. That sparked drugmaker interest in blocking CCR5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But drugs that target CCR5 ran into safety problems. Earlier medicines were associated with risks such as lymphoma and liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA reviewers said they saw no higher rate of cancers with maraviroc, but they noted a possible increase in certain heart problems. Any new cases will be analyzed to "try to understand whether or not this is a pattern," FDA medical officer Scott Proestel told the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No clear evidence of liver toxicity was seen, but herpes and some other infections may occur more frequently with maraviroc, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panel members said the drug's risks were not fully known and should be studied closely after approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safety issues "raise a red flag for me, but they are not a deal breaker" that should keep the drug off the market, said Lynda Dee, the panel's patient representative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the drug was well-tolerated and the company would follow some patients in its studies for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker is seeking FDA approval to sell maraviroc for patients who have tried other treatments and have a form of HIV that uses the CCR5 receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monogram Biosciences Inc. makes a blood test to determine if a patient falls into that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Pfizer's screening, 56 percent of previously treated patients had a virus that used CCR5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's proposed brand name for maraviroc is Celsentri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors hope maraviroc will be the first in a wave of new AIDS medicines to reach the market in the coming months. Merck  Co Inc., Johnson  Johnson and other companies are developing new HIV-fighting drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 20 cents to close at $26.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones industrial
average rose on Tuesday as IBM boosted its dividend by a third
and as companies such as DuPont Co. (DD.N) posted strong
earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But data pointing to more weakness in the housing market
weighed on the broader market and tempered the Dow's late surge
toward the 13,000 milestone. The Dow hit an intraday record of
12,989.86, but pared gains in the last hour of trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares ended up 3.5 percent on the increased dividend
and after the world's biggest computer services company also
said it will buy back up to $15 billion of its shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's surge accounted for more than 26 points of the Dow's
rise of 34.54 points, which also was boosted by a 3.3 percent
gain in the shares of Honeywell International Inc. HON.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sharpest monthly drop in U.S. existing-home sales in 18
years and a drop in a gauge of consumer confidence kept

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Tuesday
said it may downgrade its rating on IBM Corp. (IBM.N),
affecting about $34 billion of debt, citing plans by the
world's largest computer services company to raise a stock
buyback program by $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The $15 billion is in addition to about $1.4 billion that
remained from a prior authorization, IBM said on Tuesday. IBM
also said it will raise its quarterly dividend by a third. For
details, see [ID:nN24398359]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has historically had an aggressive share repurchase
program, though it was funded mostly with free cash flow, Fitch
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new stock purchases, however, are more than double
its historical levels, and a substantial portion will be funded
with debt, Fitch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In addition, Fitch believes acquisitions, along with
dividend increases, will continue to be significant uses of
cash for IBM."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any downgrade is likely to be limited to one notch in the
near term, Fitch said. It currently rates IBM at "AA-minus,"
the fourth-highest investment grade.

13,000 milestone on Tuesday, helped by gains in shares of IBM
(IBM.N) after the technology company raised its dividend and
chemical company DuPont Co. (DD.N) posted a
stronger-than-expected profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the sharpest monthly drop in U.S. existing-home sales

both the Nasdaq and the SP 500 indexes little changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of International Business Machines Corp., the
world's biggest computer services company, were the Dow's
biggest gainer with a 4.6 percent gain, the stock's biggest

13,000, was a gain in shares of Honeywell International Inc.

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - The Dow again rose toward
the 13,000 milestone on Tuesday, as gains in shares of IBM
after the computer services company boosted its dividend helped
drive up the blue-chip index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the sharpest monthly decline in U.S. home sales in 18
years and a drop in a gauge of consumer confidence kept both

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, April 24 (Reuters) - Software giants SAP
(SAPG.DE) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) will extend the range of their
so-called Duet software that makes SAP's business applications
accessible through Microsoft's Office programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; SAP said on Tuesday the two companies would bring out two
new versions of Duet, the first at the end of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today's announcement is ... evidence of our continued
commitment to our relationship with Microsoft," SAP's deputy
chief executive, Leo Apotheker, said at a company event in
Atlanta, Georgia, monitored by Reuters via Webcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new versions of Duet, which was launched last June, will
include extra sales and supply-chain features, more
possibilities for team collaboration including via Microsoft's
SharePoint server and more potential for customisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Germany-based SAP, the world's biggest maker of business
software, said Duet had been sold to more than 250 customers
since its launch less than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and SAP held merger talks in 2003 but abandoned
the idea because of the expected complexity and anti-trust
problems that would be faced by such a merger.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N)
and Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), the two largest U.S. oil companies,
on Wednesday raised their dividends, passing on some of the
huge profits they have reaped from soaring oil prices to
shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded company, said it
will raise its second quarter dividend by 3 cents, or 9.4
percent, to 35 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prior to the increase, the company said it has raised its
per-share dividend by nearly 40 percent over the past five
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, said it will
raise its second quarter dividend 11.5 percent to 58 cents a

Commission ruled that Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) can not disclose

report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In its 2005 annual report, Exxon Mobil reported its year-end

required by the SEC and an "internally developed planning price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a letter made public by the SEC earlier this week, Exxon
was told by regulators in January that disclosing its reserves
level based on the planning price would not be permissible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company agreed in February to determine its reserves using
only the year-end price for its 2006 annual report, according to
the correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The numbers were never in question," said Exxon Mobil
spokesman Gantt Walton, who noted that no restatements would be
necessary in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They said we really shouldn't do that, so we agreed to modify

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif., April 25 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp.
(CVX.N) shareholders rejected a proposal requiring it to draft
a report on whether laws in countries where the oil and gas
producer operates are adequate to protect human health, the
environment and its own reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; While about 40 demonstrators outside the company's
headquarters called on Chevron to protect the environment in
oil-producing nations, Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly told the
annual meeting on Wednesday that it had done nothing wrong in
an environmental dispute in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trillum Asset Management and other "socially responsible"
investment groups had proposed that Chevron submit the report
by November. Trillum has submitted proposals on Ecuador for
each of the last three annual meetings, and shareholders have
turned down all them them, Chevron's proxy statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 91 percent of shareholder votes cast before the
meeting on Wednesday were against the proposal, which alleged
that Chevron had caused environmental damage in Ecuador, the
Niger Delta, Angola and Burma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said producing a special report "critiquing the
environmental laws of the countries in which we operate is both
inappropriate and unnecessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Ecuador debate involves a $6 billion lawsuit by Amazon
jungle dwellers that accuses the second-largest U.S. oil and
gas company of polluting their communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nearly 30,000 jungle residents, including the Cofan Indian
tribe, accuse Chevron's Texaco subsidiary of dumping 18 billion
gallons of oil-laden water into the environment in Ecuador from
1972 to 1992 and demand damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Texaco was acquired by Chevron in 2001, and the company
denied any wrongdoing. Chevron no longer operates in Ecuador,
which is South America's fifth-largest oil producer with an
output of around 530,000 barrels of oil per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly, in response to questions at the annual meeting,
said the spill was cleaned up and that there was no scientific
evidence to support a claim that Texaco had done any harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron will "vigorously defend" itself when it is falsely
accused, O'Reilly said, adding: "We take great care how we
operate around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1998, the Ecuador government said the clean-up was
completed and released a Texaco unit from any future
environmental liabilities, Chevron said.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail, quotes, background, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Cyntia Barrera Diaz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, April 25 (Reuters) - Mexico's Televisa, the
world's leading Spanish-language show producer, said on
Wednesday it is considering an investment in Dutch producer
Endemol, the creator of reality TV hit "Big Brother."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa (TV.N)(TLVACPO.MX) Chairman and majority owner
Emilio Azcarraga told Reuters that an investment in Endemol
Entertainment Holding NV EML.AS, was among several
opportunities his company is pondering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're looking at investment opportunities in Televisa's
business areas, in production, distribution and entertainment,"
Azcarraga said at an event in Mexico City. "Obviously, Endemol
is a good opportunity and we're studying it, and we'll see what
can be done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spanish telecommunications company Telefonica (TEF.MC) owns
75 percent of Endemol, but is eager to get out of the content
production business to concentrate on distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa shares were down 0.75 percent at $64.43 in noon
trading, while stock in Endemol, the maker of TV game and quiz
shows such as "Deal or No Deal" and "Who Wants to be a
Millionaire," rose 1.14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, the Financial Times reported that
Televisa and U.S. private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners
were in a race for the 75 percent stake in Endemol, bought by
Telefonica in 2000 for 5.5 billion euros ($7.5 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies were two of at least five groups that made it
to the second round of the Endemol auction two weeks ago, media
reports have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RUN OF HIT FORMATS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked whether Televisa would team with Thomas H. Lee
Partners to bid for Endemol, Azcarraga said that no decision
had been made with that regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That has not been decided yet, nor the way (we would do
it). Whether we go ahead (with the bid) or not has not been
decided," Azcarraga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cyrte, the investment vehicle of Endemol co-founder John de
Mol, as well as Endemol's former chief operating officer, Tom
Barnicoat and another group led by the head of Endemol's French
operations, Stephane Courbit, have been named as other possible
bidders for the Dutch producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have cited Endemol's run of hit formats, global
network, strong cash generation and under-leveraged financial
position as attractive features for potential bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors have been wondering about Televisa's next move
after the Mexican company sold its investment in U.S.
Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications Inc.
UVN.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale of its stake in Univision gave Televisa slightly
more than $1 billion, part of which is being put towards a

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N), the world's largest publicly traded company, raised its second quarter dividend by 3 cents, or 9.4 percent, to 35 cents, the integrated oil company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the increase, the company said it has raised its per-share dividend by nearly 40 percent over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Exxon Mobil were up 1.6 percent at 79.83 per share on the New York Stock Exchange, slightly below their all-time high of $79.98 hit earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dividend is payable on June 11 to shareholders of record of common stock at the close of business on May 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is scheduled to report its first quarter earnings on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

Azcarraga said at an event in Mexico City. "Obviously Endemol

&lt;p&gt;SILVER SPRING, Maryland (Reuters) - A novel AIDS drug by Pfizer Inc. should be approved to give a new option to patients who are not responding to current medicines, U.S. advisers unanimously said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration is expected to make a final decision on the drug, called maraviroc, within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twice-a-day pill is the first designed to keep the HIV virus from entering healthy immune cells. Older AIDS medicines attack the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maraviroc may benefit some patients who are running out of alternatives, panel members said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a clear indication it is helpful for patients who don't have other options," said Dr. Barbara Alexander, a panel member from Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer should continue studying the drug after approval to learn more about potential risks, panel members said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA usually approves drugs that win endorsements from advisory panels. Industry analysts have projected maraviroc sales of about $500 million in 2011 if the drug goes to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 25,000 to 40,000 U.S. AIDS patients resist treatment with current drugs meant to keep the virus at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 45 percent of patients who took maraviroc in Pfizer studies had their HIV suppressed to undetectable levels. The same was true for 23 percent who got a placebo. All patients also were treated with a cocktail of the best available drugs and had tried other regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maraviroc blocks the CCR5 co-receptor that serves as a main doorway for the HIV virus into immune cells. HIV needs to get into the cells to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found years ago that the fraction of people without a working CCR5 receptor seemed resistant to HIV infection or slow to develop full-blown AIDS. That sparked drugmaker interest in blocking CCR5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But drugs that target CCR5 ran into safety problems. Earlier medicines were associated with risks such as lymphoma and liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA reviewers said they saw no higher rate of cancers with maraviroc, but they noted a possible increase in certain heart problems. Any new cases will be analyzed to "try to understand whether or not this is a pattern," FDA medical officer Scott Proestel told the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No clear evidence of liver toxicity was seen, but herpes and some other infections may occur more frequently with maraviroc, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panel members said the drug's risks were not fully known and should be studied closely after approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safety issues "raise a red flag for me, but they are not a deal breaker" that should keep the drug off the market, said Lynda Dee, the panel's patient representative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the drug was well-tolerated and the company would follow some patients in its studies for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker is seeking FDA approval to sell maraviroc for patients who have tried other treatments and have a form of HIV that uses the CCR5 receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monogram Biosciences Inc. makes a blood test to determine if a patient falls into that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Pfizer's screening, 56 percent of previously treated patients had a virus that used CCR5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's proposed brand name for maraviroc is Celsentri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors hope maraviroc will be the first in a wave of new AIDS medicines to reach the market in the coming months. Merck  Co Inc., Johnson  Johnson and other companies are developing new HIV-fighting drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 20 cents to close at $26.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 25 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded ABN
AMRO AAH.AS, following the 72-billion euro ($98 billion) bid
by a consortium led by the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) for
the Dutch bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage cuts its rating on ABN AMRO to "neutral" from
"overweight", suggesting shareholders take profit in ABN AMRO
shares on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan said following the bid, it sees the Dutch
bank's risk-reward equation as unattractive and its price
target of 38 euros on ABN AMRO currently implies a 4 percent
upside and just 7 percent to the consortium offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said a key consortium condition is that
LaSalle Bank stays within ABN, adding that due to the legal
uncertainty of how the LaSalle deal with Bank of America
(BAC.N) can be broken, and the potential time involved,
shareholders should take profit on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan said Wednesday's share price is more attractive
paid in cash than the consortium offer to pay 70 percent in
cash and 30 percent in RBS shares, or Barclays' all-share
offer.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    (Adds background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Lee Eun-yul and Kim Yeon-hee &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SEOUL, April 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is finalising talks to buy a South Korean asset management firm, majority owned by Australia's Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman wants to buy Macquarie-IMM Investment Management, in which the Australian investment bank controls 65 percent, with domestic investment firm IMM Co. Ltd. owning the remainder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The size of the potential deal has yet to be disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Macquarie had not originally thought to sell Macquarie IMM, but switched its stance after three to four financial services firms expressed keen interest and made good offers to buy it," one of the two sources told Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Among them, Goldman proposed the best offer." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The source added the investment banking group within Macquarie Bank had opposed to the sale, but the fund management group, which controls Macquarie IMM, supported the deal in the interest of shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman Sachs, Macquarie and Macquarie IMM declined comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The potential deal would mean Goldman's entrance into retail business in Asia's third-largest economy, joining in the ranks of global financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and ING Group (ING.AS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman has been focused on businesses with corporate customers and private equity investment in South Korea, including its 9 percent stake in Hana Financial Group (086790.KS), the country's No. 4 financial services firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    South Korea's $250 billion fund management industry, ranked as the world's 11th biggest according to a regulatory body, is expected to grow at a double-digit rate annually due to rising individual wealth and compulsory retirement savings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan applied for a licence in late March to open the 50th asset manager in the country, an Financial Supervisory Service &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(FSS) official said,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Among 14 fund management firms controlled by foreign companies, Macquarie IMM is a small-sized player with a pre-tax profit of 3.7 billion won in the nine months to December 2006. It manages about 10 trillion won with a capital of 13 billion won. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In contrast, Macquarie Shinhan Infrastructure Asset Management, the Australian bank's other joint venture with South Korea's No. 2 lender Shinhan Financial Group (055550.KS), is the biggest among foreign-owned fund managers. The unit earned 11.5 billion won pre-tax profit in the same period, according to the FSS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Asset management is one of key financial services which South Korea wants to open up to foreign competition as part of efforts to build the country's financial clout in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Separately Landmark Investment Trust Management, owned by Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) private equity investment arm, had sent invitation letters to potential suitors and attracted a number of foreign investors, a regulatory official said last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Keiron Henderson; yeonhee.kim@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: yeonhee.kim.reuters.com@reuters.net;+82-2-3704-5646)) Keywords: GOLDMAN KOREA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds EPS forecast, CEO quote, shares) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, April 24 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) said on Tuesday it will raise its quarterly dividend by a third and its share buyback program by $15 billion, sending its shares up more than 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As a result of the higher share buyback, 2007 earnings per share growth -- excluding any gain from the recently announced sale of its printer business -- could be 12 to 14 percent, which is one to three points more than its previous estimates, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The board of International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest computer services company, declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 40 cents a share, payable June 9, up from 30 cents per share in the prior quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It authorized $15 billion for stock repurchases, which IBM said was in addition to approximately $1.4 billion that was remaining at the end of March from a prior authorization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Wall Street was expecting per-share profit of $6.74 for 2007, which would be a 12.3 percent gain from last year's $6.00, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of IBM made their biggest jump in more than 3-1/2 years on the news. The stock was up 4.6 percent at $99.55 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM said it may complete a substantial portion of the repurchases during the next several months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This gives us significant financial flexibility to use our capital to drive growth through investments in acquisitions and capital expenditures, and to increase returns to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchase," Samuel Palmisano, IBM's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Jim Finkle and Tiffany Wu, editing by Dave Zimmerman; Reuters Messaging: tiffany.wu.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6142)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: IBM/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp. (IBM.N) plans to start selling products from smaller rival MySQL AB, a developer of an open-source database that is used to help run Web sites, including Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O), Google Inc. (GOOG.O) and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executives at IBM, the world's No. 2 software maker, and MySQL told Reuters they will announce a technology and marketing partnership on Wednesday at a MySQL users' conference in Santa Clara, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MySQL AB is a privately held company that develops standardized versions of the open-source MySQL database. It makes money by selling service agreements that cover upgrades, technical support and maintenance of those programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers have embraced MySQL because its code is open source, which means they can download it, view it and change it. That makes it relatively easy to write programs that work with the database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MySQL is one of the most popular types of open source software after Linux, the popular computer operating system. It competes with products from Oracle Corp. ORCL.O, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) and other software vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement calls for IBM and MySQL to develop software that will make MySQL compatible with programs that run IBM's System i line of business computers, including IBM's i5 operating system DB2 database. IBM will also sell MySQL's service products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the two companies have traditionally competed, IBM decided to team up with MySQL because it found that some customers want both products, said Craig Johnson, a product manager with IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DB2 is designed to handle large databases that are needed to support programs crucial to running large institutions such as banks, government agencies and insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MySQL is more commonly used to run activities over the Internet, from Web sites of all sizes to business programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of programs written for DB2 is limited because it is a proprietary system that only works on IBM software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, thousands of programs are available for MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;

Sachs Group Inc.'s (GS.N) private equity arm for about $8 
billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Harman stockholders would receive $120 in cash for each

Harman's closing stock price on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Harman surged $18.90, or 18.4 percent, to $121.46 
in early morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As an alternative to receiving cash, Harman's stockholders 
could elect to exchange some or all of their Harman stock for 
shares in a new corporation formed by KKR and GS Capital

that new corporation. The stock of the new corporation will not 
be listed on any exchange, but will be registered with U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harman may solicit other bids for a 50-day period ending on 
June 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier, Harman said its third-quarter profit rose, helped 
by higher sales at its automotive segment. Quarterly net income 
totaled $71.0 million, or $1.07 a share, compared with $64.0 
million, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier. Net sales rose 10 
percent to $882.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts were expecting the company to earn $1.09 a share, 
before items, on net sales of $882.5 million, according to 
Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Securities LLC, Credit Suisse, Goldman

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. posted a 65 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, topping Wall Street estimates due to better-than-expected demand for its new Windows Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft rose 5 percent after the announcement, in which the world's biggest software company also forecast 2008 profit at the mid-point of a range of analyst estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The strength of Vista is really driving this," said Kim Caughey, analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. She added that the company had set "manageable expectations for the full year 2008, which generally allows them some headroom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted a net profit of $4.93 billion, or 50 cents per diluted share, in its fiscal third quarter ended March 31 versus a profit of $2.98 billion, or 29 cents per share, in the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding tax benefits and a legal charge, Microsoft earned 49 cents per share, beating the average analyst forecast of 46 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 32 percent to $14.4 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $13.89 billion, with estimates ranging from $13.73 billion to $14.09 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft deferred about $1.7 billion in revenue from its second quarter to its third quarter to account for upgrade coupons given to customers prior to the January launch of Vista and Office 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects the latest versions of its two flagship products to underpin profit growth over the next few years. Those two product lines alone account for more than half of Microsoft's total revenue and a majority of its profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said consumer sales of Vista surpassed the company's own expectations by $300 million to $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is very good acceptance from a launch perspective for the product. It's early days, but we're encouraged by it," Liddell said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FORECAST ALLAYS CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's 2008 business year, which starts in July, will be the first full year of earnings to benefit from consumers buying new computers loaded with Vista and Office 2007, or companies upgrading computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft forecast diluted earnings per share of between $1.68 and $1.72 for the coming business year, on revenue of $56.5 billion to $57.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.69 a share on sales of $56.34 billion, with sales estimates ranging from $55.3 billion to $59.6 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a lot of concern in the marketplace over Microsoft's 2008 outlook.

Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 41 cents a share and revenue of $13.31 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddell said the shortfall in its fourth-quarter forecasts was due to marketing expenses shifted to the current period, but emphasized that it will meet the company's full-year estimates for expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose to $30.48 in extended trade. In regular Nasdaq trade, the stock closed up 11 cents at $29.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday's close, the stock was down 3 percent since the start of 2007, while the SP 500 had risen 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sue Zeidler, Gina Keating, Nichola Groom and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Kenneth Li in New York)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUITO, April 26 (Reuters) - Ecuadorean President Rafael
Correa said on Thursday Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) had caused
"irreversible" environmental damage to the Amazon jungle,
backing communities now suing the oil major for $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "I call on the world to see the barbarity committed by this
multinational," Correa was quoted as saying in a government
statement while visiting Ecuador's Amazon rainforest, home to
an array of unique species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jungle residents, including the Cofan Indian tribe, accuse
Chevron's Texaco subsidiary of dumping 18 billion gallons of
oil-polluted water from 1972 to 1992. Nearly 30,000 jungle
residents are demanding money to clean up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Texaco merged with Chevron in 2001 and the company denies
any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S.-firm argues it was released from any liability
when it paid a $40 million for an environmental clean-up in
1995 and blames state oil company Petroecuador for much of the
pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Anyone looking for a source of oil pollution in the Amazon
need look no further than state oil company Petroecuador," said
Chevron Spokesman Kent Robertson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A long-running lawsuit is being heard at a court in the
Amazon and plaintiffs' lawyers said a ruling could come as
early as the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Correa, a leftist former economy minister, has worried
foreign oil companies with pledges to rework contracts in an
effort to boost the government's share of oil revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron no longer operates in Ecuador, South America's
fifth-largest oil producer with an output of around 530,000
barrels of oil per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other oil firms operating in Ecuador are Spain's Repsol
(REP.MC) and Brazil's Petrobras (PETR4.SA).

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from CFO, analyst, background, details, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, April 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O)
posted a 65 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday,
topping Wall Street estimates due to better-than-expected
demand for its new Windows Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft rose 5 percent after the announcement,
in which the world's biggest software company also forecast
2008 profit at the mid-point of a range of analyst estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The strength of Vista is really driving this," said Kim
Caughey, analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. She added that the
company had set "manageable expectations for the full year
2008, which generally allows them some headroom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft posted a net profit of $4.93 billion, or 50 cents
per diluted share, in its fiscal third quarter ended March 31
versus a profit of $2.98 billion, or 29 cents per share, in the
year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding tax benefits and a legal charge, Microsoft earned
49 cents per share, beating the average analyst forecast of 46
cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose 32 percent to $14.4 billion. Analysts, on
average, had forecast revenue of $13.89 billion, with estimates
ranging from $13.73 billion to $14.09 billion, according to
Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft deferred about $1.7 billion in revenue from its
second quarter to its third quarter to account for upgrade
coupons given to customers prior to the January launch of Vista
and Office 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft expects the latest versions of its two flagship
products to underpin profit growth over the next few years.
Those two product lines alone account for more than half of
Microsoft's total revenue and a majority of its profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said consumer sales
of Vista surpassed the company's own expectations by $300
million to $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is very good acceptance from a launch perspective
for the product. It's early days, but we're encouraged by it,"
Liddell said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FORECAST ALLAYS CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's 2008 business year, which starts in July,
will be the first full year of earnings to benefit from
consumers buying new computers loaded with Vista and Office
2007, or companies upgrading computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft forecast diluted earnings per share of between
$1.68 and $1.72 for the coming business year, on revenue of
$56.5 billion to $57.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.69 a share on sales of
$56.34 billion, with sales estimates ranging from $55.3 billion
to $59.6 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There was a lot of concern in the marketplace over
Microsoft's 2008 outlook. We think this forecast should allay
these concerns," said Andy Miedler, technology analyst at
Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer gave investors a
reason to pause in February when he said that some analysts'
Vista sales estimates in fiscal 2008 were "overly aggressive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the current quarter, Microsoft said it expects to earn
between 37 cents and 39 cents a share on revenue of $13.1
billion to $13.4 billion. Analysts, on average, were expecting
earnings of 41 cents a share and revenue of $13.31 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liddell said the shortfall in its fourth-quarter forecasts
was due to marketing expenses shifted to the current period,
but emphasized that it will meet the company's full-year
estimates for expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose to $30.48 in extended trade. In
regular Nasdaq trade, the stock closed up 11 cents at $29.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of Thursday's close, the stock was down 3 percent since
the start of 2007, while the SP 500 had risen 5 percent.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Microsoft and Baidu.com rising after-hours, drop in
SanDisk's shares, details on volume)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones industrial
average rose on Thursday as a fresh wave of
better-than-expected profits from such companies as 3M Co.
(MMM.N) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) propelled the blue-chip
index to its second straight close above 13,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But after the prior session's big run-up, which took the
broader market to its highest level in more than six years,
some investors opted to lock in profits, causing the SP 500 to
dip into the red by the close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surprisingly strong earnings from Apple Inc. (AAPL.O)
helped extend Wednesday's multi-year highs for the Nasdaq and
the SP 500 during the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The advance was also tempered by caution ahead of Friday's
data on economic growth and wage inflation, which could offer
clues to the outlook for interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Earnings continue to come out strongly from a variety of
different sources. Apple reported with a great number, you had
3M with a good number this morning and better-than-expected
from Ford," said William Knapp, investment strategist for
MainStay Investments in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Looking ahead, the GDP number is going to be an important
number to watch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI finished up 15.61
points, or 0.12 percent, at 13,105.50. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX ended down 1.17 points, or 0.08 percent, at
1,494.25. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC closed up 6.57
points, or 0.26 percent, at 2,554.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thursday's gains sent the Dow to its 36th record close
since the beginning of last October, when it first crossed the
12,000 threshold, and its second such feat since crossing
13,000 on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of 3M, a Dow component whose products include Scotch
tape and Post-It notes, contributed the most to the Dow's
advance, finishing up 4.5 percent at $80.45 on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3M's rise also helped the Dow climb to an intraday all-time
peak of 13,132.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil, another Dow component, posted a quarterly
profit that beat analysts' estimates and its shares ended up
0.8 percent at $80.55 on the NYSE. Exxon shares earlier set a
record high, at $80.86, for the second straight day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; APPLE'S RECORD, MICROSOFT'S BEAT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Apple, the maker of the iPod and MacIntosh
computers, rose 3.7 percent to end at $98.84. Apple shares
marked their biggest advance since January. During the session,
Apple's shares hit a record high of $102.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the bell, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) reported profits
that beat estimates, which could underpin the technology sector
on Friday. Shares of the world's biggest software maker, a Dow
component, rose 3 percent in after-hours trade from a Nasdaq
close of $29.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's move helped Nasdaq futures tick higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Baidu.com Inc. (BIDU.O) were another
after-the-bell standout, rising more than 19 percent to $130
after the Chinese Web search leader also posted
better-than-expected results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But shares of SanDisk Corp. (SNDK.O), a maker of flash
memory for cell phones and digital cameras, dropped more than 6
percent to $42.35 after the company posted a quarterly loss,
reversing a year-earlier profit. [ID:nN26451419]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other corporate news, Ford Motor Co. (F.N) posted a
first-quarter loss that was smaller than analysts expected, and
its shares ended up 4.1 percent at $8.20 on the NYSE. Shares of
rival General Motors Corp. (GM.N) ended up 4.4 percent at
$32.45, making the stock the second biggest advancer on the Dow
behind 3M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The biggest drag on the SP 500 was Comcast Corp.
(CMCSA.O), whose shares finished down 3.5 percent at $27.10 on
the Nasdaq, after the leading U.S. cable operator's reported
in-line results, disappointing investors who had expected an
even stronger performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through Thursday, 289 SP 500 companies have reported
results, with 69.20 percent beating estimates, 17.7 percent
missing estimates and 13.2 percent matching estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 1.70 billion shares changed hands on the NYSE, below
last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on
the Nasdaq about 2.51 billion shares traded, above last year's
daily average of 2.02 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of
about 7 to 6 on the NYSE and by about 9 to 8 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friday's reports on first-quarter U.S. gross domestic
product and employment costs are due for release before the
market open at 8.30 a.m. (1230 GMT).

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) posted a forecast-beating 65 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by revenue booked on discounted license upgrades for its new Windows Vista operating system and Office 2007 software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft rose 3.5 percent to $30.12 in extended trade. In regular Nasdaq trade, the stock had closed up 11 cents at $29.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted a net profit of $4.93 billion, or 50 cents per diluted share, in its fiscal third quarter ended March 31 versus a profit of $2.98 billion, or 29 cents per share, in the year-ago period.

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds shares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Erman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N)
said on Thursday rising profits from gasoline and chemicals
sales drove its first-quarter earnings up over 10 percent,
offsetting lower oil and gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was another massive profit for Exxon Mobil, the world's
largest publicly traded company, which has seen its coffers
swell due to soaring oil prices over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company earned $39.5 billion in 2006, the largest
profit in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income rose to $9.28 billion, or $1.62 a share, in the
quarter, from $8.4 billion, or $1.37 a share, last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results came in ahead of the average analyst forecast
of $1.53 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon also outperformed its closest peers that have already
reported first-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; British major BP Plc's (BP.L) profit dropped 17 percent on
lower oil prices and production, while ConocoPhillips (COP.N),
the third-largest U.S. oil company, posted higher earnings than
last year because of over $500 million in one-time gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Exxon, "they're running the ship very well," said Gene
Pisasale, who helps manage about $25 billion at Mercantile
Capital Advisors, a unit of PNC Wealth Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pisasale, who was expecting results to be slightly ahead of
last year's, said he was very surprised by the strength of
Exxon Mobil's refining and marketing operations, which process
and sell gasoline and other fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PROFITS ROUSE CRITICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's massive profit also attracted critics,
including several U.S. senators who plan to introduce a
windfall profits tax bill on Thursday that would increase taxes
on energy companies when oil is trading above $50 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In one month alone in Pennsylvania gas prices have gone up
20 cents while oil companies continue to make billions in
profits," U.S. Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania,
said at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "My bill will increase our energy independence while
providing relief at the pump and taking away taxpayer subsidies
for Big Oil," Casey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gasoline prices have averaged about $2.49 in 2007, the
second most expensive year on record after last year, according
to Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It has been tried before and it is not the right answer,"
said Exxon Mobil Vice President of Public Affairs Ken Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we want to have a policy in this country that has been
shown to reduce domestic supplies, create higher prices at the
pump, and undermine capital investment in the U.S., than we
probably should try a windfall profits tax. But we don't think
that's the right approach," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REFINING AND MARKETING PROFITS SURGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue in the quarter fell to $87.22 billion from $88.98
billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings at the company's oil and gas exploration and
production unit fell 5 percent to $6.04 billion on lower
commodity prices and decreased natural gas volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Exxon Mobil's profit from its refining and marketing
business surged more than 50 percent to $1.91 billion on higher
margins from its refineries and sales of gasoline and other
products. The company also increased the amount of fuel
processed at its refineries in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its chemical segment's earnings rose 30 percent to $1.24
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices dropped sharply at the beginning of the quarter
as geopolitical tensions seemed to ease, but renewed friction
with Iran as well as concerns about gasoline supplies have
pushed prices back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's average worldwide crude price in the quarter
fell to $54.64 a barrel, down about 4 percent from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said oil and gas production fell about 3 percent to
4.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, mostly on
reduced demand for natural gas in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil has been using a portion of the fortune it has
generated in recent years from soaring oil prices to buy back
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company repurchased $7 billion of shares during the
quarter, lowering the number of its shares outstanding by 1.7
percent. According to Standard  Poor's, Exxon Mobil has
reduced its overall share count by 19 percent since the third
quarter of 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Furthermore, Exxon raised its second-quarter dividend 9.4
percent to 35 cents a share on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the beginning of the year, Exxon Mobil shares are up
5.1 percent, just underperforming the Chicago Board Options
Exchange's oil index .OIX, which rose about 5.8 percent in
the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon Mobil closed up 63 cents at $80.55 on the
New York Stock Exchange, just off their all-time high of $80.86
hit earlier in the day.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb. Co.
(BMY.N) on Thursday said Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) agreed to help
develop and sell its promising, experimental drug apixaban to
prevent blood clots, and that the companies will also try to
develop drugs to combat obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bristol-Myers said it will receive an upfront payment of
$250 million from Pfizer under the deal for apixaban, which in
clinical trials has reduced rates of death and clots in the
legs and lungs of patients who have undergone orthopedic
surgery, compared with standard treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late-stage trials of apixaban began last year for
prevention of strokes among people with atrial fibrillation, or
irregular heartbeat. If successful in those studies, the drug
is considered to be a possible blockbuster replacement for
Bristol's poorly tolerated, but widely used medicine,
Coumadin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bristol-Myers said it may receive additional payments of up
to $750 million from Pfizer based on development and regulatory
milestones for apixaban, which Bristol-Myers has said will
likely be given twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A once-daily similar pill called rivaroxaban is being
co-developed by Bayer AG BAYG.DE and Johnson  Johnson
(JNJ.N) and is considered slightly farther along in testing.
Both drugs work by blocking a protein called Factor Xa, which
is involved in early stages of the blood-clotting process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bayer earlier this month said the once-a-day dosing of its
product could give it a big marketing advantage over apixaban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bristol-Myers Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield
told journalists on a conference call on Thursday that
apixaban's twice-daily dosing provides "the right balance" for
patients between safety and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't believe a once-a-day drug will be an advantage,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry analysts have said that Bayer's Factor Xa
inhibitor has potential to garner annual sales of more than
$2.5 billion if it proves to be safer in trials than Coumadin,
but is at least equally effective in preventing strokes among
patients with atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coumadin, which has been sold for more than 50 years and is
now available as a generic under its chemical name warfarin,
causes great hardships to patients because of its interactions
with many drugs and foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patients must undergo routine blood tests to ensure that
levels of the drug in their bloodstream are adequate to prevent
blood clots that cause strokes, but not so high that they raise
the risk of serious bleeding or brain hemorrhages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under a separate agreement announced on Thursday,
Bristol-Myers and Pfizer said they will try to develop drugs
for metabolic disorders, including obesity and diabetes, that
are now in advanced stages of preclinical testing. Such
studies, typically in animals, are the last stage before human
trials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, April 25 (Reuters) - Pharmacia and Upjohn Company Inc., a unit of Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N), pleaded guilty to one count of offering a kickback to a pharmacy benefit manager and was sentenced to pay a criminal fine of $19.68 million, federal prosecutors said on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As a result of its conviction, Pharmacia will be excluded permanently from participation in all federal health care programs, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pharmacy benefit managers often recommend drugs to health plans. Their list of recommended drugs is called a formulary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Prosecutors alleged Pharmacia offered the pharmacy benefit manager inflated payments in the amount of $12.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    They also charged that Pharmacia's financial analyses showed the company expected to earn that much or more from the improved formulary positioning and benefits their drugs were expected to receive in return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier this month, prosecutors said Pharmacia would plead guilty to the charge, pay the fine and be permanently banned from federal health care programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Representatives from Pfizer and the U.S. Attorney's office were not immediately available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Lisa Baertlein, editing by Andre Grenon; Reuters Messaging: lisa.baertlein.reuters.com@reuters.net; mail to:lisa.baertlein.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 213 955 6742)) Keywords: PFIZER KICKBACK/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a hot private equity market, a high-profile deal has put a chill on relations between JPMorgan and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co., sources close to the matter say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KKR's proposed $26 billion takeover of business services company First Data Corp. FDC.N sparked an unusual, behind-the-scenes dust up between the giant private equity fund and investment banking titan JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clash centers on the future of the Chase Paymentech Solutions LLC joint venture, of which JPMorgan owns 51 percent and First Data, 49 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both KKR and JPMorgan want to keep their grip on the payment processor, which generates loads of cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KKR KKR.UL reached out to JPMorgan before the buyout was announced on April 1 and assured the bank that it intended to keep the joint venture together, three sources involved with the deal say. JPMorgan pushed back, offering instead to buy out First Data's stake in the business, a proposal that sources say KKR flatly rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute led to high-level talks between the two behemoths and has left each side with a bad taste in its mouth, sources say. In the end, KKR did the First Data deal without any advisory help or debt financing from JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and KKR declined to comment. A decision has not been made on the future of Chase Paymentech, sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The First Data spat is the latest rift between JPMorgan and a major private equity client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment bank was shut out of Blackstone Group's pending $4 billion initial public offering, a curious omission given both the companies' long-time relationship and JPMorgan's underwriting strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity sources said one reason for JPMorgan's exclusion from the IPO was lingering ill will from the bidding war for Equity Office Properties Trust earlier this year. Blackstone did not look kindly on JPMorgan's backing of rival bidder, which lost the deal, but forced the buyout shop to raise its offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, Wall Street clashes happen all the time. Any JPMorgan tussle with a buyout client is unlikely to dent the bank's huge and highly profitable investment banking operation, not to mention its reputation as one of the top lenders in leveraged buyouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, investment banks are loath to upset big private equity clients since they have been reaping billions of dollars a year from these "sponsors" in the buyout boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all about the fees," said Alston  Bird partner Mark Kelly, who heads the law firm's private equity practice. "The sponsors control so much of the business that investment banks have to pander to them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO BLESSING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas-based Chase Paymentech is in an industry known for generating large and steady cash flows. The company says it processes more than $660 billion in annual bankcard and debit volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity firms seek strong cash flows because they need the money to pay down debt used to finance deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So naturally, Chase Paymentech was a major attraction for KKR, and an asset the firm wishes to keep. That would explain why KKR reached out to JPMorgan ahead of time to smooth over any concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Essentially KKR said: 'Do we have your blessing?' And the answer was no," said a source involved with the deal who did not want to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would also explain why KKR is not interested in getting bought out of the partnership, although JPMorgan does have the right to dissolve it, sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would allow JPMorgan to operate the business on its own, but given First Data's expertise in the industry, there are ample reasons for wanting to keep the company on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in this case, JPMorgan is in a bit of a bind, not just with its decision on the fate of Chase Paymentech, but also with its relationship with one of the biggest private equity clients out there. The odds are that the bank will likely not do anything else for the moment to upset the mighty KKR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on Thursday its first-quarter earnings rose over 10 percent as higher profits from its refining and chemical units outweighed lower oil and gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net income for the world's largest publicly traded company rose to $9.28 billion, or $1.62 a share, in the quarter, from $8.4 billion, or $1.37 a share, last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results came in ahead of the average analyst forecast of $1.53 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're running the ship very well," said Gene Pisasale, who helps manage about $25 billion at Mercantile Capital Advisors, a unit of PNC Wealth Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pisasale, who was expecting results to be slightly ahead of last year's, said he was very surprised by the strength of the company's refining and marketing operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue in the quarter fell to $87.22 billion from $88.98 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings at the company's oil and gas exploration and production unit fell 5 percent to $6.04 billion, on lower commodity prices and decreased natural gas volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Exxon Mobil's profit from its refining and marketing business surged more than 50 percent to $1.91 billion on higher margins from its refineries and sales of gasoline and other products. The company also increased the amount of fuel processed at its refineries in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its chemical segment's earnings rose 30 percent to $1.24 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil has been using a portion of the huge profits it has generated in recent years from soaring oil prices to buy back shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company repurchased $7 billion of shares during the quarter, lowering the number of its shares outstanding by 1.7 percent. According to Standard  Poor's, Exxon Mobil has reduced its overall share count by 19 percent since the third quarter of 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Exxon raised its second-quarter dividend 9.4 percent to 35 cents a share on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil prices dropped sharply at the beginning of the quarter as geopolitical tensions seemed to ease, but renewed friction with Iran as well as concerns about gasoline supplies have pushed prices back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average price of U.S. crude CLc1 was around $58 for the quarter -- about $5, or 8 percent, lower than year-earlier levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the year, Exxon Mobil shares are up 4 percent, underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index .OIX, which rose about 5.5 percent in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 27 cents to $79.63 in early New York Stock Exchange trading, just off their all-time high of $80.20 hit on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. shares looked set for a firmer start on Thursday after the Dow hit an all-time high in the previous session and with earnings updates from U.S. heavyweights Mircosoft (MSFT.O) and Ford (F.N) on the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June Dow Jones futures DJM7 were up 0.06 percent, while SP June futures SPM7 were up 0.05 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures NDM7 were up 0.37 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that we can gain further and reach new highs today, because there is little on the macro agenda and a good deal of scheduled earnings," Lutz Roehmeyer, fund manager at LBB Invest, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies to report on Thursday include Microsoft, Ford Motors, ExxonMobil (XOM.N), Bristol-Myers (BMY.N), Halliburton (HAL.N), the leading U.S. cable operator Comcast (CMCSA.O), the largest U.S mortgage lender Countrywide Financial CFC.N, Dow Chemical (DOW.N), Aetna (AET.N) and Cardinal Health (CAH.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steady parade of strong profit reports and reassuring news on the economy had pushed the Dow to a close above 13,000 for the first time on Wednesday, while the broader market rose to its highest level in more than six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The positive surprises are on the increase. The risk is that after so many positive surprises there could also be a negative one. But at the moment, we can't see it," Roehmeyer said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), the No. 2 U.S. 
oil company, posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on 
Friday on higher margins for gasoline and other refined 
products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Oil and gas prices have dipped from the record highs hit 
last year, but profits from refining and gasoline sales have 
picked up the slack at some so-called integrated oil companies 
that both produce and refine oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's net income increased to $4.72 billion, or $2.18 a 
share, in the first quarter, from $4 billion, or $1.80 a share, 
a year earlier. The rise was due to a refinery sale that added 
$700 million to earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding the sale of Chevron's stake in the Nerefco 
refinery in the Netherlands, Chevron's profit was $1.86 a 
share, well ahead of the average analyst forecast of $1.68 a 
share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue fell about 12 percent to $48.23 billion from $54.62 
billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's results were in step with Exxon Mobil Corp.'s 
(XOM.N) better-than-expected profit announced on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But not all integrated oil companies were able to take 
advantage of the high refining margins -- earnings fell 17 
percent at BP Plc (BP.L) and ConocoPhillips' (COP.N) profit 
only rose because of more than $500 million in one-time gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year has been the second most expensive year on record 
for gasoline prices, according to Trilby Lundberg of the 
Lundberg Survey, and the billions oil companies are collecting 
has sparked criticism by some in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Senators Robert Casey and Jim Webb introduced a 
windfall profits tax bill on Thursday that would increase taxes 
on energy companies when oil is trading above $50 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is "doing a lot of things right," said Tom Mangan, 
senior vice president of James Investment Research, who helps 
manage about $2 billion, including about $18 million in Chevron 
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think that's a reflection of good management, which is 
not a temporary phenomenon," he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS NEARLY TRIPLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said earnings from its refining, marketing and 
transportation businesses nearly tripled to $1.62 billion, 
including the $700 million gain, from $580 million last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The San Ramon, California, company said it had higher 
margins for refined products worldwide. But the company missed 
out on around $150 million in additional profits due to a fire 
at its Richmond, Calif., refinery in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company's reliability has been poor," said Mark 
Gilman, an analyst at The Benchmark Co. who has a "sell" rating 
on Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gilman suggested that had Chevron's Richmond and El 
Segundo, Calif., refineries operated at a satisfactory rate, 
then the company's U.S. refining earnings could have been 
tripled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Profit from Chevron's oil and gas exploration segment fell 
16 percent to $2.91 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices dropped sharply at the beginning of the quarter 
as geopolitical tensions seemed to ease. But renewed friction 
between the United States and Iran, as well as concerns about 
gasoline supplies, have pushed prices back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron' average U.S. sales price for oil and natural gas 
liquids was $50 a barrel, down about $4 from last year. Natural 
gas prices decreased about 14 percent to $6.40 per thousand 
cubic feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Outside of the United States, the company's average price 
for oil and liquids fell $4 to $51 a barrel, and natural gas 
prices rose 2 percent to $3.85 per thousand cubic feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said oil and gas production in the quarter was 
basically flat at about 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent 
per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings at its chemicals unit dipped to $120 million from 
$153 million last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through Thursday, Chevron shares had risen 6.3 percent this 
year, narrowly outperforming the Chicago Board Options 
Exchange's oil index .OIX, which was up about 5.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares fell 9 cents to $78.09 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading on Friday afternoon. They hit an all-time high 
of $78.93 earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) rose as much as 5.6 percent on Friday after analysts cheered its better-than-expected results, which were powered by demand for the new Windows Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shares of the world's biggest software company climbed to as high as $30.74, up $1.64, in early trade on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue. It was the biggest one-day gain for the stock in three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said on Thursday its quarterly results, which included a 32 percent rise in revenue, were driven by sales of Vista, introduced to businesses late last year and to individuals this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it expects the latest versions of Vista and Office 2007 products to underpin profit growth over the next few years. Those two product lines alone account for more than half of Microsoft's revenue and a majority of its profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Friday, Citigroup upgraded its opinion on the stock to "buy" from "hold", while CIBC World Markets boosted its view to "sector performer" from "sector underperformer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prudential lifted its target price on Microsoft to $34 from $33, and kept its "overweight" rating unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Together with Vista and Office 2007, MSFT could see a multi-year revenue uplift," AG Edwards analyst Kevin Buttigieg said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With organic revenue growth in the low double digit range, stable operating margins, and a price-to-earnings multiple (in line) with the SP 500, we think Microsoft is a compelling large capitalization buy," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock was at $30.36, up 4.3 percent, by mid-morning trading on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jennifer Coogan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little
changed on Friday after data showing economic growth in the
first quarter at its weakest in four years was offset by a
higher-than-forecast measure of consumer sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nasdaq composite index was helped bystronger-than-expected earnings from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. consumer sentiment fell this month to its lowest in
seven months but was better than first estimated this month and
above economists' forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock market's recent rally boosted optimism, according
to the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. The
survey's one-year inflation index jumped to its highest level
since August 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems that inflation expectations are largely driven by
what people see at the gas station. But a lot of these
inflation expectations are very short term in their nature,"
said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star
Investment Management Corp. in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The stock market is going to continue to be driven by
corporate earnings as long as the macro picture doesn't change
dramatically," Kuby said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 3.25 points,
or 0.02 percent, at 13,108.75. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index

Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 3.05 points, or 0.12

quarterly profit late on Thursday, sending its shares up 6.7

several other units to unlock value in its core business.

NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GE shares were up 1 percent to $36.19, making it the
biggest boon to the Dow after Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gross domestic product, which measures total output of
goods and services within U.S. borders, increased at a 1.3
percent annual rate, below expectations and the weakest since
the first quarter of 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A rise in a consumer prices gauge was another negative
factor, adding to speculation inflation may be quickening

 --Also, the overhang relating to a possible slowdown in
enterprise spending and a weak 2008 forecast have been
addressed, the brokerage said.

 --Citigroup said it believed Microsoft would exceed its
$1.68 to $1.72 per share outlook for 2008. The brokerage raised
its 2008 forecast on the company to $1.74 to $1.78 per share.

&lt;p&gt;CORPUS CHRISTI, April 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) told
state pollution regulators that the shutdown of a light ends unit at the
563,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Baytown, Texas, had minimal impact
on production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Catalytic Light Ends Unit 3 shut down after compressors on the unit
tripped offline on Wednesday afternoon, Exxon said in a filing with the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery scrambled to minimize flaring and restart the unit, the
company said. The incident ended on Wednesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon was able to meet its customer commitments, according to the
notice.

Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Local newspaper reports have earlier said Czech oil group
Unipetrol UNPEsp.PR, owned by Polish refiner PKN Orlen

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures edged lower on Friday but would likely not stray far from the broader market's six-year highs after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported strong earnings after the bell on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, jumped 3 percent after the closing bell on Thursday, after the company posted a 65-percent rise in quarterly profit, driven by the success of its new Windows Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should help support the technology sector as well as the broader market as trade gets underway, although investors will likely remain cautious ahead of data on first-quarter U.S. economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures showed modest declines by mid-morning in Europe, with June Dow Jones futures DJM7 down 0.2 percent, SP futures SPM7 off 0.2 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures NDM7 off 0.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street shares have risen to their highest level in over six years this week as corporate profits have generally beaten expectations and soothed concern about the economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've had some okay results, I wouldn't be doing any cartwheels if I were them at the moment ... having said that of course, we're seeing the indices continuing to press higher," said Peter Dixon, a strategist at Commerzbank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems to be the case that investors are looking at stocks and saying 'we don't have many alternatives anywhere else,' and therefore, stocks appear to be soaking up the liquidity that is out there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week has been one of the busiest of the U.S. earnings season, with roughly 60 percent of the SP having reported quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 appears to be on course to rack up its fourth consecutive weekly gain, its best run since a five-week stretch of gains between October 1 and October 29 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed up 15.61 points, or 0.12 percent, at 13,105.50 points on Thursday, while the Standard  Poor's 500 .SPX ended down 1.17 points, or 0.08 percent, at 1,494.25 and the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC closed up 6.57 points, or 0.26 percent, at 2,554.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the menu for Friday are results from Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil and gas producer, and Alltell Corp (AT.N), the leading U.S. rural wireless provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic agenda includes a first read of first-quarter gross domestic product. Analysts expect growth to have cooled to a 1.8 percent pace in the first three months of this year, from 2.5 percent in the last quarter of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Q1 growth was probably well below trend, below 2 percent and it's fair to say if you get those kind of numbers, you're looking at an economy that is not going great guns at all," Dixon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in general, companies across a wide range of sectors have beaten expectations and reinforced investor confidence in the health of the U.S. economy, in spite of the ongoing deterioration in the housing market and sub-prime lending environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among companies reporting on Thursday, Ford Motor Corp (F.N) posted a first-quarter loss that was smaller than analysts expected, and its shares ended up 4.1 percent at $8.20 on the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Chinese web search engine Baidu.com Inc. (BIDU.O) rose over 19 percent after Thursday's bell to $130 after the company posted better than expected results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a negative note though was a drop in shares in SanDisk Corp. (SNDK.O) a maker of flash memory chips for cell phones and digital cameras, which fell over 6 percent to $42.35 after the company posted a quarterly loss, reversing a year-earlier profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)

 April 27 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded six
U.S. Airlines, saying it saw few catalysts that suggest upside
potential from here.
 Following are the rating changes:
 Company Name              New Rating           Prior Rating
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 AMR Corp.                 Neutral              Overweight
 AMR.N
 Alaska Air Group Inc.     Underweight          Overweight
 (ALK.N)
 UAL Corp.                 Underweight          Overweight
 UAUA.O
 Continental Airlines Inc. Underweight          Neutral

 JetBlue Airways Corp.     Underweight          Neutral
 (JBLU.O)
 US Airways Group Inc.     Neutral              Overweight
 LCC.N

 The brokerage, however,  said AirTran Holdings Inc. AAI.N
remains one bright spot, adding that its
revenue-per-available-seat-mile (RASM) trends will buck the
increasingly gloomy industry pattern of deceleration.

 J.P. Morgan kept its "overweight" rating, and cut its 2007
earnings forecast on AirTran to 77 cents from 90 cents a
share.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, April 27 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. has made a
booking for a super tanker to load crude from Mexico, adding an
option to use it as storage for surplus imports, or to gain
from higher forward oil prices, industry sources said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The U.S. refiner has made a prompt provisional booking for
the Birdie, a 270,000 deadweight tonne, double-hulled Very
Large Crude Carrier (VLCC), to load on May 5 from the east
coast of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cargo is scheduled to be discharged at the U.S. Gulf
Coast, but the crude could also be stored on the tanker for 30
days, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Based on how it has been reported, it looks like there is
an option to use the vessel for storage in the U.S. Gulf," a
Singapore-based shipbroker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said the option to use the VLCC as floating storage
could be due to tight onshore tank space in the United States.
Chevron (CVX.N), the second-largest oil company in the United
States, has a refining capacity of 932,000 barrels per day
(bpd).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They could be having a situation where they have to clear
some supply first before moving in the cargo," a
Singapore-based crude oil trader with a European trading house
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The current contangoed market would also allow the refiner
to make a profit by keeping its crude in storage for about a
month, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Front-month June West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lags
the July contract by $1.34 a barrel, while the cost of storing
crude on a VLCC in the U.S. Gulf Coast is around 65 cents a
barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Current contango economics of WTI crude allows for
traders, or refiners to explore the floating storage option," a
Singapore-based trader with a U.S. refiner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude stocks for the week ended April 20, rose 2.1
million barrels as refiners run at lower rates -- much below
the five-year average -- following maintenance or due to
outages, while imports rose by 116,000 barrels per day (bpd) to
10.04 million bpd, government data showed. [EIA/S]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One trader with a U.S. refiner said there could be a few
more cases of VLCCs being booked for use as floating storage
under the current conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But another trader at a U.S. major noted: "These decisions
are isolated, situational and case-specific, it is very hard to
say what is the exact situation in the U.S. Gulf Coast from
here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another U.S. refiner, Valero Energy Corp. (VLO.N), was seen
making a booking for a prompt-loading supertanker from the East
Coast of Mexico, but without a storage option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 260,000 deadweight tonne Front Force was booked for
$1.3 million, and was scheduled to load on Saturday. The
double-hulled supertanker is scheduled to discharge in Aruba,
in the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valero operates a 275,000-bpd refinery in Aruba, which
mainly manufactures distillates and feedstocks. The plant has
limited gasoline-making capacity as it does not have a
catalytic cracker.

&lt;p&gt; By Nick Antonovics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS, April 27 (Reuters) - Theme park operator Euro Disney
SCA (EDLP.PA) said on Friday its first-half net loss narrowed
due to a rise in the number of visitors to Disneyland Paris and
despite higher charges linked to its debts.
 The company, which is celebrating 15 years of the park east
of the French capital, said the net loss in the six months to
March 31 narrowed to 69.2 million euros ($94.21 million) from
83.6 million a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Operating losses narrowed to 36.3 million euros from 60.9
million, while financial charges rose nearly 10 percent to 45.6
million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The results of the first semester are pleasing because they
confirm what we want to believe, which is that we are making
steps in the right direction to profitability although we know
it is still a long road," said Chief Financial Officer Ignace
Lahoud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What's pleasing for us is that we got these results even
before kicking off our 15th anniversary," he said, noting
visitor numbers had risen 600,000 in the first half after a rise
of 500,000 in its last fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Euro Disney launched an anniversary parade and attractions
on April 1, the start of its second half. In June it is due to
open new rides based on the films Finding Nemo and Cars. A
high-speed train link to eastern France is also due to open that
month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lahoud said the company was pleased with visitor numbers in
the first few days of April but noted the weather - the month is
on track to be the hottest since records began - had been
particularly favourable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Euro Disney SCA results are weighed by the huge debts run up
to develop the park. Contractual payments to lenders helped
explain the rise in first-half financial charges, Lahoud said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At March 31, total borrowing amounted to 1.993 billion euros
compared with 1.941 billion on Sept. 30, the close of the
company's 2005/06 year. Equity fell to 312.7 million euros from
393.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under a debt restructuring deal in 2005, Euro Disney has to
meet certain operating targets. The company said: "Although no
assurances can be given, the group currently believes it will
meet its financial covenants in fiscal 2007."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lahoud said the group was not affected by rising European
Central Bank interest rates, as 72 percent of its borrowings
were fixed and the remaining floating portion was hedged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he declined to say if the company expected to break even
at an operational level this year after it narrowed full-year
operating losses in 2005/06 to 2 million euros.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on 
Thursday rising profits from gasoline sales and its chemicals 
unit drove its first-quarter earnings up over 10 percent, 
offsetting lower oil and gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It was yet another massive profit for Exxon Mobil -- the 
world's largest publicly traded company -- which has seen its 
coffers swell due to soaring oil prices over the last few 
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company earned $39.5 billion in 2006, the largest 
profit in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income rose to $9.28 billion, or $1.62 a share, in the 
quarter, from $8.4 billion, or $1.37 a share, last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results came in ahead of the average analyst forecast 
of $1.53 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon also outperformed its closest peers that have already 
reported first-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; British major BP Plc's (BP.L) profit dropped 17 percent on 
lower oil prices and production, while ConocoPhillips (COP.N), 
the third-largest U.S. oil company, posted higher earnings than 
last year only because of over $500 million in one-time gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Exxon, "they're running the ship very well," said Gene 
Pisasale, who helps manage about $25 billion at Mercantile 
Capital Advisors, a unit of PNC Wealth Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pisasale, who was expecting results to be slightly ahead of 
last year's, said he was very surprised by the strength of 
Exxon Mobil's refining and marketing operations, which process 
and sell gasoline and other fuels.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PROFITS ROUSE CRITICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's massive profit also attracted critics, 
including several U.S. senators who plan to introduce a 
windfall profits tax bill on Thursday that would increase taxes 
on energy companies when oil is trading above $50 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In one month alone in Pennsylvania gas prices have gone up 
20 cents while oil companies continue to make billions in 
profits," U.S. Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, 
said at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "My bill will increase our energy independence while 
providing relief at the pump and taking away taxpayer subsidies 
for Big Oil," Casey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gasoline prices have averaged about $2.49 in 2007 -- the 
second most expensive year on record after last year, according 
to Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It has been tried before and it is not the right answer," 
said Exxon Mobil Vice President of Public Affairs Ken Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we want to have a policy in this country that has been 
shown to reduce domestic supplies, create higher prices at the 
pump, and undermine capital investment in the U.S., than we 
probably should try a windfall profits tax. But we don't think 
that's the right approach," he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REFINING AND MARKETING PROFITS SURGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue in the quarter fell to $87.22 billion from $88.98 
billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings at the company's oil and gas exploration and 
production unit fell 5 percent to $6.04 billion, on lower 
commodity prices and decreased natural gas volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Exxon Mobil's profit from its refining and marketing 
business surged more than 50 percent to $1.91 billion on higher 
margins from its refineries and sales of gasoline and other 
products. The company also increased the amount of fuel 
processed at its refineries in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its chemical segment's earnings rose 30 percent to $1.24 
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices dropped sharply at the beginning of the quarter 
as geopolitical tensions seemed to ease, but renewed friction 
with Iran as well as concerns about gasoline supplies have 
pushed prices back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's average worldwide crude price in the quarter 
fell to $54.64 a barrel, down about 4 percent from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said oil and gas production fell about 3 percent to 
4.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, mostly on 
reduced demand for natural gas in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil has been using a portion of the fortune it has 
generated in recent years from soaring oil prices to buy back 
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company repurchased $7 billion of shares during the 
quarter, lowering the number of its shares outstanding by 1.7 
percent. According to Standard  Poor's, Exxon Mobil has 
reduced its overall share count by 19 percent since the third 
quarter of 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Furthermore, Exxon raised its second-quarter dividend 9.4 
percent to 35 cents a share on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the beginning of the year, Exxon Mobil shares are up 
5.4 percent, just underperforming the Chicago Board Options 
Exchange's oil index .OIX, which rose about 5.8 percent in 
the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon Mobil rose 89 cents to $80.81 in late New 
York Stock Exchange trading, just off their all-time high of 
$80.85 hit earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. said on Monday the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada has blocked generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. from launching a copycat form of its Celebrex arthritis drug in the country until 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the court, in its ruling, reversed a lower court ruling that would have permitted Teva's Novopharm affiliate to launch its form of Celebrex in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent concerned the chemical composition of Celebrex, Pfizer spokesman Bryant Haskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrex had global first-quarter sales of $598 million, making it one of Pfizer's top products. The world's largest drugmaker declined to provide Canadian sales of the medicine, saying it generally does not break out revenue from its drugs in individual overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haskins said government agency Health Canada earlier indicated that, on Tuesday, it would "de-list," meaning invalidate, a separate patent protecting Celebrex. That patent concerns how Celebrex is used, Haskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But with today's court decision, Celebrex will be protected in Canada until 2014 no matter what Health Canada does," Haskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Israel-based Teva declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in December won an important round in another patent battle with Teva, when a Canadian federal court prevented the Novopharm affiliate from launching a generic version of Pfizer's Lipitor cholesterol fighter until a patent expires in July 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva, the world's biggest maker of generic medicines, has appealed the Lipitor decision -- which had been rendered by the Canadian Federal Court in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far more is at stake in the Lipitor patent battle because the cholesterol drug -- with annual sales of about $13 billion -- is a far bigger product than Celebrex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Monday overturned a ruling that Microsoft Corp. should be held liable for patent infringement on copies of the Windows operating system sold overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By a 7-1 vote, the justices rejected arguments by ATT Inc. that Microsoft software code that infringes on its patents could be deemed a "component" of a computer, making overseas sales of the Windows operating system an infringement under U.S. patent law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft-ATT dispute is one of a series of important patent cases that the court has agreed to hear in the last year. It hinges on a provision of U.S. patent law that holds products sold overseas can be held liable for infringement if they include a U.S.-supplied "infringing "component."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court upheld a lower court decision that, under that provision, Microsoft was liable for infringing an ATT patent for converting speech into computer code in copies of Windows sold overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the world's largest software maker was liable for the unauthorized distribution of codec technology, used to compress speech signals into data, in copies of Windows overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Supreme Court's majority opinion, written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, reversed the appeals court's ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department has sided with much of Microsoft's argument and said the appeals court ruling "improperly extends United States patent law to foreign markets" and puts U.S. software companies at a competitive disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Justice John Paul Stevens dissented from the court's ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by James Vicini)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) plans to roll out a "very, very large" number of services to allow smaller Web developers to tap into its well-financed data centers, the backbone for its online strategy, the company's top software executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray Ozzie, who replaced Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as its chief software architect in June, said investment in data centers packed with computer servers, data storage and network systems would continue to grow in order to build capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's size and deep pockets allow it to build huge data centers like its new facility in central Washington state -- big enough for seven soccer fields of computing equipment -- and then lease out usage of the equipment to smaller Web developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At a principal level, we're going to be working on and releasing more things that transfer our (economies of scale) to developers, particularly small developers," Ozzie said in an interview with Reuters. "The number of services ... we are going to offer is going to be very, very large."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company unveiled on Monday Microsoft Silverlight Streaming by Windows Live, a streaming video service that stores and hosts video for its new Silverlight online media platform, at its MIX 07 conference for Web developers and designers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is one of the first applications introduced by Microsoft to allow developers to make use of its Web infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online retailer Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN.O) has already rolled out services aimed at allowing other companies and developers to build Web services on top of its infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie, who joined Microsoft two years ago after it bought his collaboration software company Groove Networks, said Silverlight Streaming would serve as a model for how it plans to make money from other infrastructure service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the service is formally launched, Microsoft will keep it free for light users but ask heavy users either to allow Microsoft to sell advertising space in exchange for unlimited usage or pay a nominal fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's growing data center investments are not based on a huge amount of speculative risk, according to Ozzie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to be a growing thing, but it can grow in a way that can track usage and profitability. It's not something we have to ridiculously overbuild in advance," Ozzie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft investors are carefully watching its growing operating expenses from data centers, because it is a shift from the low capital expenditures associated with software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also a major strategic shift for a company that built the world's largest software company by selling software installed on a computer's hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Microsoft faces a threat from companies like Google Inc. (GOOG.O) to deliver software similar to its desktop applications as a service through the Internet browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's "Live" online services are aimed at augmenting its dominance in desktop software with a host of new Web services. To that end, it rebranded many of its Web properties, including changing the name of Hotmail to Windows Live Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie said the focus of Monday's announcements at MIX were focused on developers, but there would be a "Wave 2" of Windows Live services later, though he did not give details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Corrects to UPDATE 2 from UPDATE 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds Teva declining comment, details on Lipitor battle)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) said on
Monday the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada has blocked
generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. TEVA.O
from launching a copycat form of its Celebrex arthritis drug in
the country until 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said the court, in its ruling, reversed a lower
court ruling that would have permitted Teva's Novopharm
affiliate to launch its form of Celebrex in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The patent concerned the chemical composition of Celebrex,
Pfizer spokesman Bryant Haskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Celebrex had global first-quarter sales of $598 million,
making it one of Pfizer's top products. The world's largest
drugmaker declined to provide Canadian sales of the medicine,
saying it generally does not break out revenue from its drugs
in individual overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haskins said government agency Health Canada earlier
indicated that, on Tuesday, it would "de-list," meaning
invalidate, a separate patent protecting Celebrex. That patent
concerns how Celebrex is used, Haskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But with today's court decision, Celebrex will be
protected in Canada until 2014 no matter what Health Canada
does," Haskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Israel-based Teva declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer in December won an important round in another patent
battle with Teva, when a Canadian federal court prevented the
Novopharm affiliate from launching a generic version of
Pfizer's Lipitor cholesterol fighter until a patent expires in
July 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teva, the world's biggest maker of generic medicines, has
appealed the Lipitor decision -- which had been rendered by the
Canadian Federal Court in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Far more is at stake in the Lipitor patent battle because
the cholesterol drug -- with annual sales of about $13 billion
-- is a far bigger product than Celebrex.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds Microsoft comment, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS, April 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O),
the world's largest software maker, said on Monday it plans to
offer a streaming video service that stores and hosts video for
its new Silverlight online media platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Silverlight, which is now available for download in a test
version, is a rival to Adobe Systems Inc.'s (ADBE.O) dominant
Flash player and a new application to deliver video, games and
animation through a Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Silverlight Streaming by Windows Live is one of the first
applications announced by Microsoft to take advantage of the
company's heavy investments in building a data center
infrastructure backbone for its Web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it will store and host up to 4 gigabytes
of video for Web developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You should consider this as a sign of things to come in
terms of our software and services platform," said Ray Ozzie,
Microsoft's chief software architect, in a keynote speech at
its MIX 07 conference for Web developers and designers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in building a
network of massive data centers filled with computer servers,
data storage and network systems to provide the company with
the computing power needed to compete with leading Web services
provider Google Inc. (GOOG.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's "software plus services" strategy aims to
bring a host of new Web services -- some supported by
subscriptions and others provided for free with advertising --
without compromising its cash cow desktop software business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company further announced it will begin on Monday
shipping Microsoft Expression Studio, a suite of graphic design
and animation tool software that allows designers to create
applications for both the Web and Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expression Studio and Silverlight constitute a shot across
the bow of Adobe, which has dominated the graphics and designs
tools software market with its Creative Studios line and Flash

with the Windows Media format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Silverlight works on most Web browsers including
