&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said on 
Saturday it completed its $1.4 billion Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N 
takeover, capping the demise of a Wall Street firm that 
survived the Depression and numerous slumps in its 85 years but 
could not navigate the mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Weakened by its massive exposure to mortgage markets and 
the embarrassing blow-up of two of its hedge funds, Bear was 
driven to the brink of bankruptcy in March by traders who&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; drained about $17 billion of the firm's cash in a matter of 
days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federal officials, worried a Bear bankruptcy would drag the 
rest of the markets down with it, strong-armed the bank to 
accept JPMorgan's $2-a-share offer, backed by a Federal Reserve 
bailout of $30 billion in Bear assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A week later JPMorgan raised its offer five-fold to 0.21753 
of a share for each Bear share. Based on JPMorgan's current 
market price of $43, that bid valued Bear at $9.35 a share, 
well below the $57 those shares fetched before traders began 
their run on Bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In exchange for the higher price, Bear had to sell a 39.9 
percent stake to JPMorgan. Combined with other purchases, 
JPMorgan amassed a controlling 49.5 percent stake and 
effectively locked up Bear for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, JPMorgan, which under CEO Jamie Dimon largely 
steered clear of credit losses that hobbled its rivals last 
year, has been sorting through Bear's people and assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a fire-sale price, JPMorgan will gain a new 
headquarters tower in Midtown Manhattan, some of Wall Street's 
largest clearing, prime brokerage and energy trading arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear's name will survive on Wall Street through its retail 
brokerage business, which Morgan is keeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal dealt a crushing blow to Bear employees, who 
collectively held 33 percent of the firm's stock and saw 
billions of dollars in their personal wealth wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only 6,500 staffers were offered jobs, casting about 7,000 
analysts, bankers and traders into the streets at a time when 
the rest of Wall Street is shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan now faces many significant and some unknown risks. 
Dimon disclosed this month that the cost of shedding Bear 
assets, litigation expenses and other merger-related costs 
would soar to $9 billion from an earlier rough guess of $6 
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result, JPMorgan expected to record a second-quarter 
gain of $1 billion, though it is expanding during a period that 
Dimon worries could be a prolonged recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - Shares of General Electric Co

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) struck a deal with the world's largest personal computer maker, Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), to place a toolbar on new PCs that leads to its Live Search engine, the companies said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal is Microsoft's latest attempt to chip away at the dominance of search leader Google Inc (GOOG.O). The agreement, which takes effect next January for new PCs in the United States and Canada, displaces a similar one HP has with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, Microsoft's search engine will also be the default service on the Internet Explorer browser preloaded on new HP computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not disclose the terms of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the most significant distribution deal for Live Search that Microsoft has ever done," said Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platform and services division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number-two PC maker Dell Inc DELL.O and Google have an agreement to preinstall Web and desktop search software on Dell's consumer computers. It expires in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Dell spokesman said the company has not decided if it will continue with Google after the current deal expires, but said it was "open to alternative" partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google continues to extend its lead in Web search. Research firm comScore said Google's U.S. Web search market share rose to a record 61.5 percent in April, while Yahoo's share declined to 20.4 percent and Microsoft's slipped to 9.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has stepped up its efforts to catch Google with a number of initiatives. Last month, it announced a new "cashback" rewards program to encourage people to use its search engine to shop for items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, it made an offer to buy Yahoo that was rejected by the Web company's board. Microsoft shelved its offer over disagreement on price, but restarted talks with Yahoo last month to buy its search service, said a source familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft were down 63 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $27.69, while HP was down 2 percent at $46.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Labaton Sucharow LLP, Klafter &amp; Olsen LLP and IBM announce that
they have received preliminary approval for an agreement to settle the
securities class action titled In re IBM Securities Litigation, No.
1:05-cv-6279 (AKH) (S.D.N.Y.), for $20 million in cash.

   The settlement is subject to final Court approval. The settlement
will resolve claims brought on behalf of the class of persons who
purchased IBM's common stock between April 5, 2005 and April 14, 2005.

class were damaged by misrepresentations and omissions in IBM's April
5, 2005 announcement that it would begin stock option expensing in the
first quarter of 2005. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that IBM
misled investors as to its expected financial results and the
anticipated size of its stock option expense for the quarter. IBM
disputes that it made any misrepresentations to investors, and denies
all allegations of wrongdoing.

&lt;p&gt;New Pfizer Data Presented on CP-751,871 across Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Ewing's Sarcoma

       ADVIGO CP-751,871 Global Phase III Clinical Trial Program
               Initiated (ADVancing IGF-1R in Oncology)
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer announced today results from several clinical trials
further describing the activity of its investigational compound
CP-751,871 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Ewing's Sarcoma,
both diseases with high unmet medical need. The three oral
presentations and one poster discussion underscore that the
insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) is increasingly
recognized by the medical community as a relevant target for
investigation in cancer research. The results were presented at the
44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) in Chicago, IL.

   Updated Response Data from the 1002 NSCLC Trial

   Updated study results from a Phase II, randomized, non-comparative
study showed 54 percent of patients with Stage III/IV treatment-naive
NSCLC receiving the combination CP-751,871 plus carboplatin and
paclitaxel (n=97) experienced objective responses. The response rate
observed for patients treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone
was 41 percent.

   Of note, 78 percent of a subset of patients with squamous cell
carcinoma (n=23) and 57 percent of a subset of patients with
adenocarcinoma (n=28) receiving 20 mg/kg of CP-751,871 plus
carboplatin and paclitaxel experienced objective responses. Response
rates were 46 percent and 25 percent, respectively, for squamous cell
(n=13) and adenocarcinoma patients (n=20) receiving carboplatin and
paclitaxel alone. No response advantage with CP-751,871 was seen in a
subset of patients with undifferentiated tumors (Not otherwise
specified, NOS).

   "Patients with advanced NSCLC typically face a poor prognosis and
we need to develop new strategies and new treatment combinations to
improve their survival," said lead investigator Daniel Karp, M.D.,
director of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Clinical and Translational
Research Center (CTRC). "The updated study results add to our growing
understanding of the potential safety and efficacy of CP-751,871. In
this trial, increasing the dose to 20 mg/kg in Stage 2 of the trial
resulted in an increased overall response rate in all differentiated
histologies, including adenocarcinoma, non-adenocarcinoma, and
particularly in squamous histologies, which we consider to be of
interest for future study."

   Dr. Karp also presented progression-free survival (PFS) results
from the study. At the dose level of 20 mg/kg, the observed
progression-free survival was 5 months in the CP-751,871 plus
carboplatin/paclitaxel arm and 4 months in the carboplatin/paclitaxel
only arm. The highest observed PFS was in the group of patients with
squamous histologies (5.6 months in the CP-751,871 plus
carboplatin/paclitaxel arm and 4.3 months in the
carboplatin/paclitaxel only arm) corresponding to the patients that
demonstrated the highest response rates. PFS was defined as either the
length of time before the cancer progressed or death.

   In this study, CP-751,871 was generally well tolerated. The most
common Grade 3 or 4 side effects reported were hyperglycemia
(increased blood sugar) (20 percent) and neutropenia (30 percent).

   Correlative Science Study Results Support Karp Data

   This abstract summarized ancillary studies conducted to
investigate the molecular make up of lung tumors and its relevance to
anti-IGF-IR therapy. Members of the IGF-IR pathway appear to be
expressed differentially across lung tumor histologies which may help
to explain the differential activity of CP-751,871 across these
histologies. Tumor differentiation also appears to play a role. Data
were also presented demonstrating that EGFR inhibition sensitizes
tumors to CP-751,871 treatment.

   "These results help us to understand better how CP-751,871 works,
provide support for our phase III trial strategy and underscore
Pfizer's commitment to bring science and innovation to the forefront
of drug development," said Antonio Gualberto, M.D., Ph.D., Global
Clinical Lead for the CP-751,871 program, Pfizer Global Research and
Development.

   ADVIGO Phase III Registration Program (ADVancing IGF-IR in
Oncology)

   Based on these data, Pfizer has initiated a large global Phase III
clinical trial program for CP-751,871 in NSCLC, including some studies
with patients with non-adenocarcinoma (ADVIGO 1016, ADVIGO 1018). The
program includes trials for patients who are newly diagnosed and for
those who have already been treated with other therapies.

   Pfizer has made a major commitment to CP-751,871 and has invested
significant resources in the Phase III program, which will include
more than 2,000 patients around the world.

   Preliminary Data Presented on CP-751,871 in Sarcoma

   Phase I data presented at ASCO showed single agent CP-751,871 was
generally well-tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory
sarcoma (n=22), including Ewing's sarcoma (n=9). A response of stable
disease or better was seen in 12 out of 20 evaluable patients,
including one confirmed partial response in a 12-year-old patient with
Ewing's sarcoma, the second most common malignant bone tumor in young
patients and the most deadly bone tumor.

   CP-751,871 was generally well tolerated in patients with relapsed
or refractory sarcoma. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related side effects
reported included Grade 4 uric acid increase (n=1) and Grade 3
bilateral deep-vein thrombosis (n=1).

   About CP-751,871

   CP-751,871, a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, is a highly
specific inhibitor of the IGF-1R pathway. It is believed that through
this inhibition, CP-751,871 blocks one of the key signaling pathways
in cancer cells that lead to uncontrolled growth and survival of tumor
cells.

   Pfizer recently initiated a global Phase III clinical trial
registration program for CP-751,871 in non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC. In
addition, Pfizer is studying CP-751,871 in clinical trials for the
treatment of many other cancers, including prostate, breast and colon
cancers and Ewing's sarcoma. To date, more than 500 patients have
participated in CP-751,871 clinical trials in multiple tumor types.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch has affirmed the following credit ratings of Coca-Cola Femsa
S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF):

   --Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-' ;

   --Local Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-';

   --National Scale Long Term Rating at 'AAA(mex)';

   --National Scale Short Term Rating at 'F1+(mex)';

   --Local Certificados Bursatiles at 'AAA(mex)';

   --Corporacion Interamericana de Bebidas S.A. de C.V. Foreign
Currency IDR at 'A-';

   --Corporacion Interamericana de Bebidas S.A. de C.V. Local
Currency IDR at 'A-';

   --Bond due 2009 (Corporacion Interamericana de Bebidas, S.A. de
C.V.)

   The Rating Outlook is Stable.

   The ratings reflect KOF's strong free cash flow generating
capacity, solid financial profile and excellent business position. The
ratings also factor in the company's strategic relationship with The
Coca-Cola Company (KO) and the explicit and implicit financial support
KOF has received from KO.

   For the last 12 months (LTM) ended March 31, 2008, Coca-Cola Femsa
generated US$1.417 billion of EBITDA and US$804 million of funds from
operations (FFO). These figures compare with US$1.354 billion of
EBITDA and US$899 million of FFO during 2007. As of March 31, 2008,
KOF had US$1.7 billion of debt and $714 million of cash and marketable
securities.

   Due to the growth in cash flow, KOF's interest coverage, as
measured by FFO to interest expense, improved to 5.3 times (x) as of
March 31, 2008 from 5x at December 2006. During this time period,
leverage, as measured by total debt-to- FFO, has declined to 1.7x from
1.8x. Further improvement in financial indicators is expected to occur
as the company continues to repay debt with internally generated cash.

   KOF has experienced some cost pressures over the past year and a
tight pricing environment in its main market, Mexico. Profitability
margins on a consolidated basis have remained relatively stable,
however, due to an improvement in the company's operations outside of
Mexico. These operations represented 43% of the company's EBITDA in
2007, an increase from 38% in 2006.

   The company's debt profile is well-balanced between dollar- and
peso-denominated debt. As of March 31, 2008, KOF had 41% of its total
debt denominated in U.S. dollars, 56% denominated in Mexican pesos,
and the rest in Argentine pesos. Given that the company generates
close to 60% of its EBITDA in Mexican pesos, the peso-denominated debt
eliminates a good portion of currency fluctuation risk. The company
has 66% of its debt at fixed rates and 34% at floating, with an
average cost of debt of 7.4%.

   Liquidity risk is manageable for Coca-Cola Femsa. As of March 31,
2008, only 20% of Coca-Cola Femsa's debt was short term. The most
significant portion of upcoming maturities are Certificados Bursatiles
(CBs) issued in the local market of US$120 million in April 2008 and
US$230 million in July 2008. The company repaid the US$120 million
bond with available cash during April and plans to do the same with
its CB maturing in July. With maturities no higher than US$390 million
in a given year, KOF's future amortization schedule remains
manageable.

   KOF's main activity is the production, distribution and marketing
of Coca-Cola products in its franchise territories. The company is one
of the Coca-Cola Company's main bottlers globally. With sales of over
2.1 billion unit cases (UC) per year, KOF is the largest Coca-Cola
bottler in Mexico and Latin America, and second largest in the world
in terms of sales volume. Currently KOF represents 10% of total
worldwide volumes in the Coke system, 35% of Latin America, 40% of
Mexico and 29% of Brazil. The company continues to use its cash flow
to expand its reach and beverage portfolio. Recent acquisitions
include Jugos del Valle, a leading manufacturer of juice products in
Mexico and the proposed purchase of Remil, a bottler of Coca-Cola
products in Brazil. The Remil transaction is expected to close later
this year. KOF is controlled by FEMSA through its 53.7% stake. The
second largest shareholder in KOF is The Coca-Cola Company with a
31.6% ownership stake.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - International Business
Machines Corp (IBM.N) will pay $20 million to settle an
investor lawsuit contending the company misrepresented its
stock option expensing, lawyers for the plaintiffs said on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The settlement is subject to final approval by the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, said law
firms Labaton Sucharow LLP and Klafter  Olsen LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a news release, the firms said that in agreeing to the
settlement, IBM "disputes that it made any misrepresentations
to investors, and denies all allegations of wrongdoing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The settlement will resolve claims brought on behalf of
shareholders who bought IBM common stock duing the period April
5-14, 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the lawsuit, the investors contended that they were
harmed by alleged misrepresentations and omissions in an April
5, 2005, announcement from IBM about the start of option
expensing. IBM was accused of misleading investors about its
expected financial results and the anticipated size of its
option expense for the first quarter of 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares were down $2.24, or 1.7 percent, to $127.19 in
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The broader
market was also lower.

&lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
U.S. Bank has partnered with Visa to issue debit cards with the
Visa payWave feature to customers in four states. The program brings
the speed and convenience of Visa payWave transactions to U.S. Bank
debit cardholders in California, Colorado, Missouri, and Utah.

   Visa payWave technology enables customers to make a purchase by
simply holding their card near a secure reader at checkout instead of
swiping it. Cards must be held within two inches to be accepted, and
there is no need for the customer to hand the card to a cashier.

   "At U.S. Bank, we know our customers appreciate payment products
and services that are convenient and secure," said Lynn Heitman,
senior vice president of U.S. Bank Retail Payment Solutions. "Visa
payWave debit cards will allow our customers to make everyday
purchases faster and easier than having to fumble for cash."

   Each U.S. Bank Visa payWave-enabled card contains a tiny micro
chip that sends payment information to a contactless card reader via
short-range radio frequency waves. The information does not contain
the cardholder's name, and includes an encrypted security code that is
unique to each transaction. Payment cards with Visa payWave carry the
same zero liability protection and will have the same
behind-the-scenes fraud monitoring that is standard with all U.S. Bank
Visa debit cards.

   "Consumers today are constantly on-the-go and want fast and
convenient payment solutions," said Pam Zuercher, head of product
innovation, Visa Inc. "By offering Visa payWave debit cards, U.S. Bank
is providing its customers the convenience they demand, while also
delivering an added layer of security."

   U.S. Bank customers in Denver and Salt Lake City who already hold
a debit card can visit any local U.S. Bank branch and request a new
card with Visa payWave functionality. Select customers in California
and Missouri have automatically received an upgrade to the Visa
payWave card.

   Denver has seen a recent increase in investment from U.S. Bank as
the company has made Denver one of its "PowerBank" markets, complete
with more employees, refreshed branches, greater advertising and
special programs. Issuing check cards with Visa payWave in Denver
represents another way U.S. Bank is delivering on its PowerBank
commitment of increased investment through better products and
services.

   U.S. Bank is also working with USA Technologies to install 400
contactless vending machines in the Denver area, providing U.S. Bank
customers with Visa payWave-enabled cards even greater customer
convenience and more places to use their new contactless card.

   Visa operates the world's largest retail electronic payments
network providing processing services and payment product platforms.
This includes consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments,
which are offered under the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS
brands. Visa enjoys acceptance around the world and Visa/PLUS is one
of the world's largest global ATM networks, offering cash access in
local currency in more than 170 countries. For more information, visit

   U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), with $242 billion in assets, is the
parent company of U.S. Bank, the 6th largest commercial bank in the
United States. The company operates 2,522 banking offices and 4,844
ATMs, and provides a comprehensive line of banking, brokerage,
insurance, investment, mortgage, trust and payment services products

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Monday raised
Bear Stearns BSC.N debt ratings after JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) completed the takeover of the storied investment bank
that could not navigate the mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Fitch upgraded Bear Stearns' issuer default rating in line
with JPMorgan's to "AA-minus," the fourth highest investment
grade level, from "A-minus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has assumed the capital structure of Bear Stearns,
which was driven to the brink of bankruptcy in March before the
Federal Reserve helped orchestrate its rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When JPMorgan agreed to buy Bear Sterns, it guaranteed its
trading obligations and counterparty transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The guarantee agreement, which ends 120 days after the
merger is complete, did not cover Bear Stearns debt and capital
structures, but they are now part of JPMorgan's capital
structure, Fitch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rating agency said it has not been determined which of
these securities, if any, will be replaced with obligations
under JPMorgan's name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch also raised Bear Stearns senior debt to "AA-minus"
from "BBB," just a notch above junk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear Stearns 4.55 percent notes due in 2010 traded on
Monday at 223 basis points over U.S. Treasuries versus 219
basis points on Friday, according to MarketAxess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's 7.9 percent notes due in 2018 were the most
actively traded securities on Monday, according to MarketAxess.
They tightened 10 basis points to trade 407 basis points over
Treasuries.

&lt;p&gt;Eastern District of Virginia Federal Judge Walter D. Kelley, Jr. Joins Jones Day's Washington, D.C. Office

WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--

experience and credibility there, as well as becoming a leading figure
in our national practice."

   Prior to taking the bench, Judge Kelley was in private practice
for 23 years, specializing in commercial, antitrust and intellectual
property litigation. He handled cases in courts throughout the United
States and has tried more than twenty-five jury cases to verdict.
While in private practice, Judge Kelley was elected to Best Lawyers in
America and the Legal Elite of Virginia and held a number of bar
positions, including chairing the Virginia State Bar's Young Lawyers
Conference and its Section of Antitrust Law. He currently serves as
adjunct professor of law at Regent University, where he teaches
antitrust law and federal courts.

   Judge Kelley graduated from Washington &amp; Lee University in 1977
and magna cum laude from the University's School of Law in 1981. Upon
graduation, Judge Kelley clerked for Judge Ellsworth Van Graafeil and
of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New
York City.

&lt;p&gt;Updated CDX-110 Data in Glioblastoma Multiforme Presented at 44th Annual ASCO Annual Meeting

   Survival and Time-to-Progression Reported From Open-Label Phase II Studies
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


AVANT Immunotherapeutics (Nasdaq: AVAN) and Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today
announced the presentation of new data from two Phase 2 studies at the 44th
Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) for CDX-110,
an investigational immunotherapeutic vaccine that targets the tumor-specific
molecule epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII). CDX-110 was
generally well-tolerated with primary toxicity reported as local injection site
reactions.

Included in the presentation were updated data from the Phase 2 ACTIVATE trial
(n=21) and the continuation study, ACT II (n=23) of CDX-110 in patients with
newly diagnosed EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

-- In the ACTIVATE study, median survival time was 26 months (95% CI: 21.6,
infinity) and median time-to-progression (TTP) was 14.2 months. Median survival
in a historical matched cohort was 15.2 months (17/17) (95% CI: 13.9,
20.5).(p=0.0001) with median time to progression of 7.13 months (p=0,0001). No
significant adverse events were seen in this study.

-- Preliminary results from the ACT II study currently estimate median overall
survival to be 33.1 months, although the median has not yet been reached. The
survival of a matched historical control group was 14.3 months (95% CI: 13.0,
16.2) and a subgroup treated with temozolomide (TMZ) of 15.2 months (95% CI:
13.9, 20.5 p=0.0078). Overall TTP was 16.6 months (95% CI: 10.8, infinity)
compared with 6.4 months for the historical control group (95% CI: 5.0, 14.1).
In this study, primary toxicity was reported as local injection site reactions.

"Vaccination with CDX-110 together with standard of care temozolomide in
patients with glioblastoma multiforme increased time to progression and overall
survival compared with a matched historical control group in these Phase 2
studies," said John Sampson, M.D., Associate Professor of Neurosurgery at Duke
University Medical Center, who presented the data. "This is encouraging news for
patients with this specific type of brain tumor, who are currently facing very
limited treatment options. This treatment is being further studied in a
randomized Phase 2b/3 trial to confirm these results."

Study design

The ACTIVATE trial studied CDX-110 vaccine in 21 patients with newly-diagnosed
EGFRvIII-expressing GBM who had undergone surgical (gross-total) resection
followed by conformal radiation therapy with concurrent oral temozolomide (75
mg/m2 per day) without tumor progression. CDX-110 mixed with
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (142 mcg) was
administered intradermally. Sixteen patients received CDX-110 at two week
intervals for three doses, while five patients received saline in a blinded
fashion for the first three vaccinations. Thereafter, all patients received
monthly CDX-110 injections mixed with GM-CSF until tumor progression. Safety was
assessed through evaluation of adverse events, complete physical and
neurological exams, and routine clinical laboratory studies. The ACT II study
enrolled a total of 23 patients. The patient population and treatment scheme
were similar to ACTIVATE, except that no early placebo was given and two dose
schedules of maintenance temozolomide were studied (13 patients received 200
mg/m2 daily times five every 28 days, while 10 received 100 mg/m2 daily times 21
days every 28 days for a maximum of 12 cycles). Monthly CDX-110 vaccination
mixed with GM-CSF was given on day 21 of each cycle until tumor progression.
Safety was assessed in a similar fashion to ACTIVATE.

About EGFR vIII

EGFRvIII is a mutated form of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is
only expressed in cancer cells and not in normal tissue and is a transforming
oncogene that can directly contribute to cancer cell growth, as it does in about
40 percent of GBM tumors.

AVANT is currently enrolling the Phase 2b portion of a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial
called ACT III, which is evaluating CDX-110 in 90 patients at over 20 cancer
centers across North America. The Phase 3 portion will not open until data is
available from Phase 2b and pending further discussions with FDA.

About CDX-110

CDX-110 is an investigational immunotherapy that targets the tumor specific
molecule EGFRvIII, a functional variant of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), which is a protein that has been well validated as a target for cancer
therapy. This particular variant, EGFRvIII, was discovered in a collaborative
effort between Bert Vogelstein, M.D. and Albert Wong, M.D. at Johns Hopkins
University and Darell Bigner, M.D., at Duke University. Application of this
discovery toward the development of the CDX-110 vaccine was further advanced by
Dr. John Sampson, M.D. and his colleagues at the Duke University Brain Tumor
Center in collaboration with Amy Heimberger, M.D. at the M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center. Unlike EGFR, EGFRvIII is not present in normal tissues, suggesting this
target will enable the development of a tumor-specific therapy for cancer
patients. Furthermore, EGFRvIII is a transforming oncogene that can directly
contribute to cancer cell growth. While originally discovered in GBM, the most
common and aggressive form of brain cancer, the expression of EGFRvIII has also
been observed in various tumors such as breast, ovarian, metastatic prostate,
colorectal, and head &amp; neck cancers. Celldex owns the rights to EGFRvIII
vaccines and is pursuing the development of CDX-110 for GBM therapy, as well as
in other cancers through additional clinical studies.

On April 16, 2008, Pfizer, Inc. and Celldex Therapeutics, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AVANT Immunotherapeutics, entered into an agreement that granted
Pfizer an exclusive worldwide license to CDX-110.

About Glioblastoma Multiforme

GBM is the most common form of primary brain tumor. It is an aggressive tumor
with very poor prognosis. There are an estimated 10,000 new cases of GBM
annually in the United States, and it predominantly affects adults aged 45 to
70. Current GBM treatment options include surgical resection, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy.

About AVANT Immunotherapeutics, Inc.

AVANT Immunotherapeutics is a NASDAQ-listed company discovering and developing
innovative vaccines and targeted immunotherapeutics for the treatment of cancer,
infectious and inflammatory diseases. AVANT focuses on the use of tumor-specific

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) completed it acquisition of The Bear
Stearns Companies, Inc. (BSC) on May 30, 2008. As a result, Fitch
Ratings has upgraded the ratings of BSC and removed them from Rating
Watch Positive, where they were originally placed on March 17. As the
direct and sole owner of BSC, JPM has assumed the capital structure of
BSC. It is the opinion of Fitch that JPM will accord BSC the same
managerial and financial resources that are available to its other
wholly-owned subsidiaries. As such, the ratings of BSC have been
aligned with those of JPM and its subsidiaries.

   Following the announcement of the proposed merger, Fitch upgraded
the Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) for BSC and its subsidiaries, and
placed BSC's IDRs and debt ratings on Rating Watch Positive. These
upgrades acknowledged JPMC's guarantee of all trading obligations and
counterparty transactions of BSC and its subsidiaries, and JPM's
assumption of operational oversight, both effective immediately.

   Under the Guaranty Agreement, the Guaranty Period ends 120 days
after the merger has been consummated. Upon termination, the Guaranty
ends for new liabilities, but remains in effect for obligations
guaranteed during the Guaranty Period. The Guaranty did not cover
BSC's bond debt and capital securities. However, these instruments are
now components of JPM's capital structure. It has not been determined,
which of these securities, if any, will be replaced with obligations
under JPM's name.

   Fitch has upgraded the following ratings and removed them from
Rating Watch Positive:

   The Bear Stearns Companies Inc:

   --Long-term IDR to 'AA-' from 'A-';

   --Short-term IDR to 'F1+' from 'F2';

   --Short-term debt to 'F1+' from 'F3';

   --Senior debt to 'AA-' from 'BBB';

   --Subordinated debt to 'A+' from 'BBB-' ;

   --Preferred stock to 'A+' from 'BB+';

   --Individual to 'B' from 'F'.

   Bear Stearns Securities Corp.:

   --Long-term IDR to 'AA-' from 'A-';

   --Short-term IDR to 'F1+' from 'F2'.

   Custodial Trust Company:

   --Long-term IDR to 'AA-' from 'A';

   --Long-term deposits to 'AA' from 'BBB+';

   --Short-term IDR to 'F1+' from 'F2';

   --Short-term deposits to 'F1+' from 'F2';

   --Senior debt to 'AA-' from 'BBB';

   --Individual to 'B' from 'C';

   --Support to '1' from '2'.

   Bear Stearns Capital Trust III:

   --Trust preferred stock to 'A+' from 'BB+'.

   Fitch has also withdrawn the following rating:

   The Bear Stearns Companies Inc:

   --Support '1'.

   The Rating Outlook is Stable for all ratings.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Jun 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced software and programs to help clients more
quickly and effectively deliver software in a global team environment.

    IBM is announcing Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration, a proposed
industry-wide initiative aimed at simplifying collaboration across the
software delivery lifecycle.  Through the initiative, IBM is inviting business
partners, developers, ISVs and customers to collaborate on a common
architecture, based on open Internet standards, to effectively integrate their
software development processes.

    Currently, software development tools vendors work with private
vocabularies,
formats and data repositories, which act as barriers to openly sharing
resources across the software lifecycle.  With Open Services for Lifecycle
Collaboration, IBM is proposing an open architecture to help ensure the
interoperability of software development resources, such as project
requirements and test plans, which would ultimately allow a customer to
assemble their ideal software development platform using preferred tools and
vendors.  Interested participants can join the initiative at www.jazz.net.

    IBM is also announcing new software being developed by IBM business partners
Black
DuckSoftware, CAST Software, CM-Logic, iRise, Mainsoft, QSM, Ravenflow,
SourceIQ, Surgient, VMLogix and WebLayers to integrate with new IBM Rational
Jazz-based products announced today at the IBM Rational Software Development
Conference.  The new offerings help customers deliver more reliable,
higher-quality software to market while managing costs.

    Furthering its global software development strategy, IBM is also
announcingthe IBM Rational Ensemble, a free Jazz technology offering for IBM
businesspartners, that provides independent software vendors (ISVs), resellers
and
systems integrators with education and services for IBM Jazz-based technology to
quickly accelerate customer awareness and adoption.  The Rational Ensemble
provides Web portal access with links into Jazz community pages and content,

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Jun 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new software that will transform how people
will
collaborate thereby driving greater value and performance from their globally
distributed software investments. In front of more than 3,500 customers and
business
partners attending the IBM Rational Software Development Conference, IBM
announced 20 products that break down the walls that inhibit organizations from
trulycollaborating with partners, suppliers, customers and their employees.
These new
offerings use IBM's Jazz collaborative technology to help geographically
distributed software delivery teams work together in an open, real-time and
transparent manner to more effectively deliver and source software solutions.

    The challenges of globalization are forcing companies to become more nimble,
using an increasingly geographically-dispersed and virtual workforce to remain
competitive. In the world of software delivery, this means around the clock
collaboration with specialized teams around the globe to pick up where
another left off. For other stakeholders in an organization, such as
lawyers, a finance department, CIO or CEO, there is an increased need for
visibility into how the software is delivered on a global scale. 
Technologies built on, or using, Jazz can interoperate with software from
other vendors allowing customers to significantly improve their ability to
communicate data within and between their enterprise.

    "Currently, organizational, geographical and technical silos inhibit
business
agility and return on software investments.  In a globally integrated
enterprise,
organizations need to transform how they collaborate to get the job done," said
Dr.
Daniel Sabbah, general manager, IBM Rational Software.  "IBM's Jazz platform
breaks down location, infrastructure and organizational barriers,
transforming the practice of global software delivery."

    According to Forrester Research*, only 37% of stakeholders are satisfied
with the
speed of internal application development, and just 42% are satisfied with
the quality.  IBM's new Jazz platform can transform software delivery into a
dynamic integration of people, processes and projects.  As the scope of
software development and delivery broadens in this era of globalization, IBM
is incorporating social networking and Web 2.0 practices into the new versions
of
its market-leading software delivery platform.

    Twenty products infused with Jazz by end of 2008

    By the end of 2008, IBM and its business partners expect to release 20
products harnessing the collaborative capabilities of Jazz.  The new IBM
software will help development teams of all sizes improve productivity and
manage project requirements in real time.

    Available on June 30, 2008, IBM Rational Team Concert incorporates social
networking technologies, such as instant messaging and presence awareness, into
the
management of a software delivery project on a global scale.  IBM Rational
Team Concert helps software teams collaborate in real time in the context of
specific roles and processes.  Integrated version control, work item and build
management capabilities help distributed teams overcome geographic and
functional
barriers to think and work in unison.  IBM Rational Team Concert includes
automated data gathering resulting in significantly less documentation and
provides real-time project health information required to reduce project risk.

    Making effective software delivery a reality for the small development team,
IBM is
introducing IBM Rational Team Concert Express-C Edition, a free version
available for download from www.jazz.net using open source Tomcat and Derby. 
IBM Rational Team Concert Express-C is designed to help consultants and
students gain experience with a global software delivery environment.  IBM
Rational Team Concert Express can help mid-sized and departmental teams
embrace global collaboration quickly using transparent development,
out-of-the-box
processes and supports up to 50 users per server. IBM Rational Team Concert
Standard Edition, optimized for corporate teams, includes an expanded set of
capabilities such as customizable process, real-time project health, enterprise
scalability and supports up to 250 users per server.  In 2009, IBM Rational
Team Concert Enterprise Edition will provide the broadest array of capabilities
that
any size team can use, including feature-rich work item management and greater
sourcecode and configuration management capabilities.

    IBM is introducing IBM Rational Requirements Composer to help software
delivery
teams gain consensus on how a project should be designed using familiar
business artifacts such as storyboards, sketches, scenarios and models. 
Currently in beta, this new software will help teams visualize commitments
thereby
reducing rework and review cycles on requirements.

    IBM is also announcing the beta of IBM Rational Quality Manager,
comprehensive
test planning and process software which provides a single view into all aspects
of a quality plan.  With 100% distributed access and Web 2.0-based
collaboration, this new software traces where a project stands in the software
delivery cycle to help key stakeholders prioritize issues for resolution.

    By Jazz enabling the following products, IBM is helping its current
customers
scale to better take advantage of opportunities presented
by
globalization:


--  New versions of IBM Rational ClearCase, IBM Rational ClearQuest and
    IBM Rational BuildForge now support global scalability and performance with
    24/7 global server monitoring, enhanced security with access control lists,
    a new web 2.0 style client and Agile process support.
--  The new version of IBM Rational RequisitePro integrates with the new
    Rational Quality Manager to swiftly drive project requirements into test
    plans.
--  The new version of IBM Rational Asset Manager integrates with the Jazz
    technology in IBM Rational Team Concert to help software delivery teams
    manage how development assets are used.
    

    
At the foundation of these new offerings is Jazz collaborative
technologywhich provides a platform of services enabling powerful integration.
Similar to what
Eclipse did to consolidate the desktop, Jazz will transform the industry by
supporting interoperability across a broad array of collaborative
application lifecycle management solutions.  Over the next several years, most
of the IBM Rational portfolio will evolve to incorporate Jazz technology to
improve team collaboration and make it easier to integrate IBM products and
those from IBM's business partners. This will provide both new and existing IBM
customers with a flexible on-ramp to the Jazz platform of the future.

    IBM is developing Jazz and future products in conjunction with the
softwaredevelopment community at www.jazz.net.  At Jazz.net, members of the
community
can transparently collaborate with IBM and each other, provide input on
requirements, report bugs and ultimately contribute to the development of
IBM's industry-leading software delivery platform. By opening up the
software development community as a transparent software supply chain, the
Jazz.net community will drive the evolution of standards and common components
incorporated in future IBM software releases.

    Independent software vendors, through the Ready for IBM Rational software
validation program, are working with IBM on integrating and validating their
offerings to IBM Rational Team Concert and other IBM Rational Jazz-enabled
offerings.  Black Duck Software is integrating its Governing IP Compliance
solution to IBM Rational Team Concert.  CAST Software is integrating its
Automated

integrating their Virtual Test Lab management support solutions to IBM Rational
Quality Manager, and WebLayers is integrating its Automated Design Time
Governance solution with IBM Rational Team Concert.

    Driving value from software investments

    To help organizations drive greater value from their current software
investments,
IBM is announcing new services that map an organization's business value to best
practices in software delivery.  The IBM Rational Measured Capability Framework,
Rational Health Assessment, Rational Self Checks and IBM IT Governance
Services help organizations improve insight into their business outcomes by
automating, deploying, adapting and measuring proven best practices.  IBM's
IT Governance Services can help organizations establish governance priorities
and identify strengths and gaps putting them on an IT governance roadmap for
improved software effectiveness.

    In addition to these IBM Jazz-based technology integrations, IBM is also
announcing new programs, services and offerings to enable business

Among these were Schwartz, chief financial officer Sam Molinaro, controller Jeffrey Farber and general counsel Michael Solender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, JPMorgan said it had completed its $1.4 billion takeover of Bear Stearns, capping the demise of a Wall Street firm that was felled by the mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Quentin Bryar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IGEL's Latest Microsoft(R) Windows(R) XP Embedded Firmware Allows Customers to Access their Virtual PCs Using an Open Hypervisor Strategy

     The Inclusion of the Ericom(R) PowerTerm(R) WebConnect Client
Allows Customers to Choose from 14 Hypervisors When Delivering Virtual
   PCs. New Functionality also Gives Higher Degrees of Control that
  Result in More Environmentally Friendly Devices that are Remarkably
                               Flexible
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
IGEL Technology today announced the availability of its latest
Microsoft(R) Windows(R) XP Embedded firmware on the broadest and most
powerful range of thin clients on the market. The latest firmware
gives users increased choice of hypervisors for virtual PCs, improved
device management and further energy saving capabilities.

   IGEL Universal Desktops powered by Microsoft Windows XP Embedded
now have additional Ericom features included as standard. The new
firmware version includes the Ericom(R) WebConnect client. This
provides users with secure, local and remote access to applications
and desktops running on Windows Terminal Servers, Virtual Desktops
(VDI), Blade PCs and legacy host systems. With support for 14
hypervisors, including VMware(R) ESX, Citrix(R) XenServer, Microsoft
Hyper-V, Oracle(R) VM, Virtual Iron and others, Ericom(R) PowerTerm(R)
WebConnect enables organizations to flexibly choose the VDI
environment that best suits user requirements.

   Following research from the renowned German Fraunhofer Institute
last year, which showed IGEL thin clients used up to 50% less power
than conventional business PCs, the new firmware also delivers even
more environmentally friendly control.

   Using the IGEL Remote Management Suite software bundled with every
thin client, the power management configurations of each unit deployed
across an organization can be controlled centrally. Sleep times can be
set and managed remotely, ensuring that thin clients are powered down
across the business when not in use - saving power and reducing CO2
emissions. User experience is also improved with sessions able to
remain active during sleep mode and allowing faster power return,
meaning users can instantly return to work without lengthy reboot and
connection times.

   The latest firmware also includes File Based Write Filter (FBWF)
which delivers improved security and management capabilities to the
IGEL thin client by allowing tightly defined, secure access rights to
the flash memory to deploy local applications that require permanent
local files, such as anti-virus updates and browser cookies. All
features on FBWF can be configured at the local set-up console or
using IGEL'S Remote Management Suite.

   Additional features in the firmware include the Internet Explorer
7 web browser with its improved tabbed browsing, instant search and
improved security features. Users will also experience enhanced video
performance and support for a broader range of media with the latest
Media Player 11. A feature to enable and disable IP v6 has also been
included to increase network performance if IP v6 is not required.

   "These latest features ensure that our Windows XP Embedded based
products provide more digital services, are easier to manage and more
environmentally friendly than ever before," explained Stephen Yeo,
worldwide strategic marketing director for IGEL Technology. "The
inclusion of Ericom's PowerTerm(R) WebConnect client is particularly
exciting since it gives our customers freedom of choice in hypervisor
when designing their virtual PC infrastructures."

   The IGEL Windows XP Embedded firmware is immediately available at
www.MyIGEL.com.

   About IGEL Technology

   IGEL Technology is the world's number three thin client vendor and
is market leader in its home country of Germany (Q4 2007 IDC). The

&lt;p&gt;President of Chevron's Global Manufacturing Operation Named
   Recipient of Prestigious 2008 University of Washington College of
                       Engineering Diamond Award
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Jeet Bindra, president of Chevron Global Manufacturing, was
honored for his career achievements by being named a 2008 recipient of
the University of Washington (UW) College of Engineering's prestigious
Diamond Award. Bindra, who earned his master's degree in Chemical
Engineering from UW, was recognized for Distinguished Achievement in
Industry, alongside other esteemed alumni, at a ceremony on May 30 in
Seattle.

   "Jeet Bindra embodies the attributes of the Distinguished
Achievement in Industry Diamond Award," said Matt O'Donnell, Frank &amp;
Julie Jungers Dean of Engineering, University of Washington. "He was
selected for his outstanding knowledge and significant contributions
to the field of engineering as well as his academic and personal
accomplishments. We are thrilled to have this opportunity to celebrate
Jeet's many achievements and honor him with this award."

   "Jeet has made significant contributions to the success of Chevron
over the course of a distinguished career, and this award is a
testament to his strong leadership and commitment to excellence," said
Mike Wirth, executive vice president, Global Downstream. "I
congratulate Jeet for this great honor and am pleased to see his alma
mater recognize his many achievements and remarkable life's journey."

   Breaking Barriers to Success

   Early on, Bindra faced a future fraught by hardship and suffering.
Raised in a low income family in India, Bindra recognized that
education was his ticket out of poverty.

   "Growing up as I did in India, I learned the value of hard work
and sacrifice," Bindra said. "I believe my success has come through
perseverance and values I hold to this day: treat everyone with
respect and dignity, always maintain your integrity; work hard; never
stop learning; and, most importantly, dream big."

   In 1969, he earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering
from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur. Soon after, Bindra
set his sights on immigrating to the United States to pursue a
master's degree. He took out a loan for his plane ticket to Seattle,
Wash. and arrived at the University of Washington with USD 8 to his
name. He earned his master's degree at the university's College of
Engineering in 1970.

   Bindra joined Chevron in 1977 as a research engineer and for the
next 31 years moved up to many leadership positions within Chevron,
including president of Chevron Pipe Line Co. and managing director and
CEO of Caltex Australia. In 2004, Bindra was named president of Global
Refining, which was later changed to Global Manufacturing in January
2008. Among his many successes during his 31-year Chevron career,
Bindra lead an effort to negotiate financing, design and construction
of a critical pipeline to move crude from the Tengiz field in
Kazakhstan to the Black Sea. He was the founding chairman of the board
of the South Asian American Leaders of Tomorrow (SAALT), past vice
chairman of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines and served on the boards
of Caltex Australia Limited and Reliance Petroleum Limited (India). He
now serves on the board of directors for GS Caltex.

   Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated
energy companies with subsidiaries that conduct business across the
globe. The company's success is driven by the ingenuity and commitment
of approximately 59,000 employees who operate across the energy

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background, year to date league table)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, June 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) on Monday
announced two new co-heads to its Asia investment banking group,
excluding Japan, highlighting a shift of talent by Western banks
to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said Ravi Sinha, relocating to Hong Kong from New
York, would become co-head of the investment banking division
together with Asia veteran Mark Machin, according to a memo
obtained by Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Campbell-Breeden, relocating to Hong Kong from
London, will become co-head of MA in AEJ, together with another
Asia veteran, Johan Leven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sinha and Campbell-Breeden will focus on expanding their
groups across Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Asian region is of significant importance to our global
franchise and to many of our clients around the world," the memo
said, calling Asia "a strategic priority for the firm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The memo was signed by John Weinberg, Michael Evans and David
Solomon, all members of Goldman's management committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street and European investment banks have sent a steady
stream of talent into Asia in the past few months alone, as the
credit crunch tightens its grip on investment banking activity
across the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though elements of the credit crunch have reached Asia, the
region has taken much less of a hit than the United States or the
UK. With several Asian economies growing at more than three times
the pace of major Western countries, investment banks are moving
managers to Hong Kong and Mumbai to capitalise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are just a few of
the Western banks that have moved high-level bankers to Hong Kong
in the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sinha joined Goldman's MA group in 1989 and become partner
in 2000. Campbell-Breeden also joined the MA group in 1989 and
became partner in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman ranks No. 2 in the Asia (including Japan) league
tables year to date, behind UBS, according to Thomson Reuters, up
from No. 4 in the same year ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York firm is one of the few Wall Street investment
banks to emerge from the credit crunch without major troubles or
capital needs, underscoring its reputation as one of the best
risk managers in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Michael Flaherty; Editing by Anne Marie

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI, June 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and India's
Shriram Credit have called off an agreement, which would have
given the U.S. investment bank a 20 percent holding in the
Indian firm, the Times of India said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman had signed the deal in March to buy the stake for 3
billion rupees ($71 million) in the non-banking financial
services company that would have given Goldman an indirect
entry into the equity and commodity brokerage business in
India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman Sachs is among those assessing the losses they
would incur because of the subprime issue. They were delaying
things here and we said drop it," the newspaper quoted Shriram
group Chairman R. Thiagarajan as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Goldman declined comment on the report,
while Shriram was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citing sources familiar with deal, the newspaper said the
deal failed after Goldman wanted to scale down the valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the deal the Shriram group was to transfer the
brokerage and distribution services business to Shriram Credit,
the paper said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is returning to PBS 
as a national sponsor, renewing its financial relationship with 
the public television broadcaster four years after it ended its 
backing of "Masterpiece Theatre."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded company, 
will partially underwrite the news program "Nightly Business 
Report" and the science series "NOVA" starting June 9, PBS said 
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until Exxon stopped sponsoring "Masterpiece Theatre" in 
2004, the oil company had doled out more than $250 million to 
sponsor the PBS Sunday drama series over more than 30 years. 
This time around, Exxon Mobil will sponsor two shows with 
closer ties to business and science for PBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sponsorship deals come at a time when Exxon is taking 
in big earnings -- and scrutiny from politicians and consumer 
groups -- from sky-high oil prices. In the first quarter alone, 
it reported a profit of nearly $11 billion, the second-highest 
for any company in U.S history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are very pleased that ExxonMobil will sponsor 'NOVA' 
and 'Nightly Business Report,' both of which play significant 
roles in the discussion of the most important topics in science 
and commerce," PBS Chief Executive Paula Kerger said in a 
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PBS counts heavily on corporate underwriting to fund its 
programs, and the loss or addition of a big sponsor can quickly 
change the fortunes for individual programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One well-known PBS show, "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer," is 
under pressure since losing a key backer last summer when 
Archer Daniels Midland ended its 14-year sponsorship of the 
show. Only part of that money has been replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the U.S. economic downturn, there are concerns across 
the TV industry that advertising dollars may dry up as 
corporations trim budgets and look to other media, like the 
web, to promote their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while PBS still wins sponsorship from corporations 
interested in supporting the arts, philanthropy, too, is 
competitive, and signing longer-term TV sponsorship deals has 
fallen out of favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's sponsorship deals calls for it to support both 
programs through the end of the year, with a renewal option. 
Financial terms were not released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "NOVA" is produced by WGBH in Boston, while "Nightly 
Business Report" is produced by WPBT in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;65 Houston Area Nonprofits Receive Much Needed Summer Help Thanks to ExxonMobil's Community Summer Jobs Program

    Houston Nonprofit Organizations Receive Summer Interns Through
              ExxonMobil's Community Summer Jobs Programs
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil and Volunteer Houston announced the commencement of the
11th Annual ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program. ExxonMobil
recognized the 65 participating agencies and the selected interns at a
breakfast reception held at the Junior Achievement of Southeast Texas
- BizTown. The program enables 65 full-time college students to gain
hands-on experience and knowledge of the nonprofit sector, while
lending a helping hand to the agencies during the busy summer months.
The goal of the ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program is to promote
the importance of community service and cultivate future community
leaders.

   At the reception, ExxonMobil presented the third annual Volunteer
Spirit Award to Patricia Rosenberg for her continuing support to area
nonprofits through her volunteerism and advocacy. In addition, Peyton
Robey and Stephanie Kirkpatrick, both former Community Summer Jobs
Program interns and now pursuing full-time careers in the nonprofit
sector, will receive the Community Champion Award.

   As an ExxonMobil national program, the Community Summer Jobs
Program in Houston began in 1998 with 25 nonprofit charitable
organizations receiving summer interns. Today, the program has grown
to 65 nonprofit organizations and college interns, respectively. Each
college student will intern for eight weeks at a participating
nonprofit where they will assist with the enormous workload during the
agencies' peak season. During the eight-week internship, the 65
interns will participate in community service projects, network at
lunch gatherings and attend a professional development seminar that
will be held in July.

   ExxonMobil provided grants totaling more than $195,000 for the
interns' salaries and to assist Volunteer Houston with the
administrative expenses associated with the program.

   "As this program has grown over the years, it's been inspiring to
see the number of college interns who ultimately pursue a career in
the nonprofit sector," said Stephen Cassiani, President, ExxonMobil
Upstream Research Company. "ExxonMobil has a long tradition of giving
back to the communities where we live and work, and this program not
only helps nonprofits during a critical time of need, but strives to
create a whole new generation of leaders who understand the importance
of helping others," he concluded.

   Volunteer Houston administers the program and assists in training
the agencies on recruiting, interviewing, and selecting the intern, as
well as how to organize and manage the summer internships. The interns
are selected by the participating agencies and must be a full-time
sophomore, junior or senior college student.

   "We are proud to continue our partnership with ExxonMobil on the
Community Summer Jobs Program," said Carrie Moffitt, executive
director of Volunteer Houston. "The program brings the best and the
brightest of our area future leaders to nonprofits."

   Since the program began in 1971 in New York City, ExxonMobil has
provided more than $8.4 million to support almost 4,000 community
summer job internships in ten states, including Alabama, Alaska,
California, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia and
Wyoming, and internationally in Angola. In the Houston program alone,
ExxonMobil has provided more than $1.3 million placing more than 500
college students in summer internships.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced InfoSphere Change Data Capture, new software
that
allows organizations to react faster to changing business conditions, improve
response time and access the most current information for decision-making.

    Having up-to-the-minute information has never been more critical.
Retailersneed it to stock store shelves and satisfy shoppers, manufacturers need
it
to maintain supplies, and financial services organizations need an immediate
view of the market and their clients. This requires a real-time view of what
information has been changed and updated in order to make timelier decisions
about customers, inventory and transactions.

    InfoSphere Change Data Capture software, derived from the company's
acquisitionof DataMirror in 2007, recognizes when data, such as a customer
address or
product code, has changed and then immediately transmits that change to the
systems that rely upon the data. This helps bring real-time data analysis
closer to actual business processes, and supports operational reporting,
business
intelligence, and synchronization of applications, allowing organizations to be
more
competitive and generate more value from their information.

    Today's announcement supports IBM's cross-company Information on Demand
business
initiative, aimed at capturing the growing market opportunity for enabling
customers to use information as a strategic business asset.  At the core of
Information on Demand is IBM's services and consulting expertise, combined with
software that accelerates the delivery of trusted information to improve the way
organizations do business.

    Retailers can use the technology to provide customers the most up-to-date
pricing
information. Manufacturers can use it to provide real-time inventory levels to
ensure maximum efficiency. It can also be used to consolidate customer data
in real-time across multiple regions, departments and business units to help
organizations more effectively react to customer demands and make better, more
accurate decisions.

    InfoSphere Change Data Capture enables high volume, two-way replication of
massive amounts of data while maintaining the integrity and performance of
the source applications. This ensures critical systems are always
availableand provides users access to the most accurate information from every
system.
It does this by accessing and integrating data in applications or production
systems at all times, lightening the load on batch windows.

    When used in combination with IBM Information Server to help analyze and
cleanse the data, it helps detect and respond to relevant business changes to
deliver timely trusted data for better business decisions. It is also widely
used for scalable, high performance heterogeneous data movement among databases
such as IBM DB2, SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, Teradata and Informix. IBM
clients often use the software for high-performance, bidirectional integration
in Oracle
and DB2 environments that can scale to replicate massive volumes of data and
information-intensive projects such as loading real-time information into IBM
System z servers.

    "The new software announced today adds to IBM's existing replication
solutions
providing our customers real-time capabilities for both information
integration and dynamic warehousing," said Jim Welch, vice president, IBM
Information Platform Solutions. "Today's announcement is indicative of IBM's
ability to quickly integrate new technologies from strategic acquisitions to
bring real value to customers and help them optimize their business."

    IBM's Change Data Capture software is already in use by more than 2,200
clients
and partners globally across such industries as manufacturing, financial
services and
banking, telecommunications, healthcare and pharmaceuticals. The software,
part of the IBM InfoSphere portfolio of products designed to accelerate the
delivery of trusted business information, is now available from IBM and IBM
Business Partners.

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is making its Windows operating system available to low-cost desktop PCs, as cheaper laptops enjoy booming demand globally, the software giant said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Distributors, retailers or end-users, people are really looking for Windows-based devices," Steven Guggenheimer, vice president for Microsoft's original equipment manufacturing business, told reporters at Computex, the world's second largest computer show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's customers and partners have made it clear that they want Windows on their Netbooks and Nettops, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netbooks are low-cost laptops that target students and other first-time PC users in the emerging markets, while Nettops are desktop computers that are much cheaper than typical desktops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asustek Computer Inc's low-cost Eee PCs are gaining popularity worldwide, and many other PC vendors are joining the march to launch similar models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have seen much demand for Windows on the Eee PC," Asustek Chief Executive Jerry Sheen said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is great that Microsoft is addressing this customer demand and providing a Windows solution on these devices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asustek expects sales of Eee PC laptops to double to around 10 million units in 2009 as sales of the low-cost laptops will likely hit 20-30 million units globally next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Microsoft's shares fell 1.8 percent, lagging the Dow's 1.06 percent decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Baker Li; Writing by Lee Chyen Yee; Editing by Louise Heavens)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) will offer help desk service for its Symphony line of software, raising the competition with rival Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) suite of Word, Excel and PowerPoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programs from International Business Machines Corp have been available for free on its Web site since September 2007, but businesses can now buy contracts for help desk support for a flat fee of $25,000 per year, IBM said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies and home users that don't want that support can continue to obtain the word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the latest challenge to Microsoft Corp's Office, which faces new competition from companies such as Google Inc (GOOG.O) and as well as free collaboratively developed software such as OpenOffice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Wettemann, an analyst with Nucleus Research, said that businesses are likely to give the IBM programs a serious look, just as they have other Office rivals, including Google's Web based offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google also sells support for its programs that rival Word, Excel and PowerPoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wettemann, whose firm advises companies on how to cut costs on computers and software, said IBM may have a tough time convincing businesses to pay for support of the relatively easy-to-use programs in Symphony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why do I need support for documents and spreadsheets?" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software is available at symphony.lotus.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program Welcomes 75 New Interns for Summer of Service; Honors Outstanding Alumni

  Reception Kicks off Program and Announces 2008 Community Champions
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil today kicked-off the 18th annual ExxonMobil Community
Summer Jobs Program (CSJP) in Dallas during a reception at the Dallas
Arboretum. The program, now in its 37th year nationally, pairs 75
undergraduate college students with local nonprofits for a paid
internship. Agencies receive the benefit of a talented staff member
during the busy summer months, while students gain real world
experience, learn more about the role of nonprofits in the community
and earn a paycheck. ExxonMobil supports the program with a $237,000
grant, which funds the interns' salaries and expenses for
administering the program.

   "This is more than simply a summer job, but rather a unique
experience," said Truman Bell, senior program officer for education
and diversity, ExxonMobil Foundation. "In addition to on-the-job
skills, these 75 interns will also gain tools for professional
development and valuable insight into the operations of some of the
most respected nonprofit organizations in the Dallas community.

   "We hope that this is only the beginning of a lifetime of service
for these young people. Whether they make a career in the nonprofit
world or become active volunteers, understanding the important role
these agencies play in our community is one the key goals of our
program."

   During the reception, two former CSJP summer interns who have
pursued full-time careers in the nonprofit world were honored as the
2008 ExxonMobil Community Champions. Betsy Edmond and Christian
Yazdanpanah, who participated in the program in 2003, were recognized
for their outstanding work and ongoing dedication to the nonprofit
community. Edmond is currently the associate director of membership
and development for the Friends of Katy Trail and Yazdanpanah serves
as a college preparatory coordinator with Southwest Key Programs in
Austin, Texas.

   The Dallas program is administered by the Volunteer Center of
North Texas, which manages the internships and trains agencies to
better recruit, interview and select candidates. Each nonprofit is
responsible for interviewing and hiring its own interns. This process
helps ensure that the unique needs of each agency are best met.

   "We are proud of our ongoing partnership with ExxonMobil on the
Community Summer Jobs Program, which continues to match talented
college students with Dallas nonprofits that benefit immensely from
their skills and enthusiasm," said Phyllis Bernstein, chair, Volunteer
Center of North Texas' Dallas County Council on Volunteerism. "The
addition of one full-time intern has a large impact on each of the
selected nonprofits, many of which operate with limited resources and
staff members. We look forward to seeing the outstanding work these
interns produce to benefit their agencies over the course of the
summer and beyond."

   Since the program began in 1971 in New York City, ExxonMobil has
provided more than $8.4 million to support nearly 4,000 internships in
10 states, including Alabama, Alaska, California, Kansas, Louisiana,
Montana, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming, and internationally in
Angola. Since the Dallas program began 18 years ago, ExxonMobil has
funded more than 1,325 internships with grants totaling more than $2.7
million.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc executives dismissed a search-advertising deal with Google due to antitrust concerns, one day before Microsoft Corp made its takeover offer earlier this year, according to court documents made public on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The position came to light in a complaint filed by attorneys representing two Michigan pension funds in a shareholder lawsuit that aims to revoke Yahoo takeover defenses and press the company to renew merger talks with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are focused on long-term value creation rather than short-term gains," said a Yahoo document prepared for Yahoo executives ahead of an "all hands" internal meeting on January 30 -- the day before Microsoft made its merger offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bracing for employee questions over whether Yahoo should outsource its search-ad sales to Google, executives were prepared to argue that any short-term gains would derail Yahoo's long-term push to become a "must buy" for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Short-term analysis of the revenue potential of outsourcing monetization may not take into account the longer term impact on the competitive market if search becomes an effective monopoly," an excerpt from the company document said. Monetization refers to sales of search-related ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These comments appear to contrast with Yahoo's subsequent position when it announced on April 9 that it was conducting a test with rival Google, the market leader in Web search and related advertising, to rely on Google to sell its search ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TURNABOUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The turnabout was part of a strategy by Yahoo management to seek alternatives for its business instead of settling for Microsoft's cash-and-stock offer at $31 per share, which the company's board had rejected as undervaluing Yahoo's assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft challenged the possible Google-Yahoo tie-up as anti-competitive, citing Google's growing dominance of the Web search business and its even larger share of ad sales tied to Web search results. Government regulators also rushed to say they would investigate any Google-Yahoo partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web search is increasingly strategic as most people find information on the Internet via such systems. Search-based advertising, because of its high degree of targeting, has become a great money spinner for Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has acknowledged that a gap exists between what it makes running its own advertising alongside its search results and the improved payback it could see by using Google's ad-sales systems in conjunction with Yahoo's search operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We, in fact, have some understanding of what they (Google) could do for us and what we could do for them," Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang told a conference last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Delaware Chancery Court judge ruled on Monday that excerpts from confidential Yahoo company documents could be made public in the investor suit after initially sealing some of the information in a filing made last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yahoo statement said the company was disappointed at the judge's ruling to unseal Yahoo internal documents but said it would have little bearing on the outcome of the case. A company spokeswoman would not comment on papers revealed in the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of
Riverbed Technology (RVBD.O) with a "sell" rating, saying it
expects the networking company's market share to flatten as a
result of a stronger competitive responses and some unfavorable
industry trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The advent of desktop virtualization will diminish the need
for wide area network (WAN) optimization, a technology used by
Riverbed's customers to access data, as it reduces traffic over
the WAN, analyst Simona Jankowski said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Riverbed gained share rapidly in the last two years largely
at the expense of Packeteer Inc PKTR.O, which was early to
market but mis-executed, and Juniper Networks Inc JNPR.O,
which experienced a disruption around the integration of the
Peribit acquisition, the analyst wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage expects increased adoption of desktop
virtualization and increased focus by Cisco Systems Inc
(CSCO.O) and Juniper on the space will focus the market on
decelerating growth rate of the WAN optimization segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While Riverbed's solution remains technically superior to
competition in most respects, we expect the pace of its share
gains to slow down," Jankowski wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jankowski, who also added the company to the Americas sell
list, has a price target of $15 on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the San Francisco-based company, which have lost
more than a third of their value since January, fell nearly 5
percent to $16.27 in morning trade on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;  WEST KINGSTON, RI, Jun 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 APC, a global leader in integrated critical power and cooling services, today
announced plans to integrate APC and TAC software management platforms with
IBM Tivoli Monitoring energy management software.  APC and TAC, part of global
energy management specialist Schneider Electric, offer innovative physical
infrastructure and building management systems, respectively, to customers
worldwide.  The integration, currently in development, will allow APC's
InfraStruXureCentral(R) management platform, TAC's building management system
and IBM
Tivoli Monitoring software to share key data points including alarm
notifications, historical data and asset tracking information.  The combined
solution will deliver the visibility, control and automation needed for a more
efficient enterprise by enabling optimization of data center physical
infrastructure and building systems while maintaining IT service levels.

    By integrating InfraStruXure Central and TAC with IBM Tivoli Monitoring
software,
administrators will be able to view, correlate and profile the dependencies
of business process and IT assets to the underlying physical infrastructure. 
The
result will help monitor and manage efforts to reduce risk, raise data center
system availability levels and increase energy efficiency.

    "Once we complete the integration with the IBM Tivoli Monitoring software,
IT
administrators will have the ability to make informed decisions about critical
business processes, their physical infrastructure and building management
systems
and how to efficiently deploy their infrastructure," says John DiPippo, senior
vice
president, APC Data Center Solutions, Software and Services.

    "For example, a user may choose to move business critical applications to an
alternate rack, row or even data center in the event of loss of redundancy
in cooling, or may choose to leave a less critical application running in the
higher
risk environment.  Customers soon will have the ability to not only determine
optimum location (physical or virtual) of IT assets, but also adapt their
application usage based on historical and real-time information regarding
energy use and power and cooling availability."

    "We are delighted to have APC and TAC partner in IBM's efforts to help
customers become more energy efficient," said Stuart McIrvine, director,
Emerging
Markets, IBM Tivoli.  "Working together, we have a comprehensive suite of
management
capabilities that will provide clients with the proper tools to proactively
manage and control their power consumption and energy costs, but not at the
expense of critical business services."

    APC's suite of innovative enterprise software solutions enable the efficient
management of company-wide IT physical infrastructure including floor space,
power,
cooling, cabling and threat protection.  APC InfraStruXure Central lowers
support costs and prevents downtime through rapid problem resolution of physical
and environmental issues.

    "InfraStruXure Central gives us a great level of visibility and control,"
said
David Shaw, executive director of data center services at Sisters of Mercy
Health System in St. Louis, Mo. "Information systems infrastructure is a
critical
element in our ability to deliver the highest quality health care. 
InfraStruXure Central provides both the monitoring tool and the management
reporting required to maintain the infrastructure foundation of our
environment.  This allows us to proactively resolve areas of risk or address
interruptions before they become service outages.  By sharing alerts and
notifications with the IBM Tivoli Monitoring software, we will be able to
further understand the mission-critical applications that may be affected by
problematic events and, in turn, determine the best course of action to take
to eliminate downtime."

    TAC Building Management Systems today provide integration with IBM Tivoli
Monitoring software via SNMP, thus supporting timely exchange of critical
process
data and alarms.  Through this integration, administrators will have
visibility and control of the facilities systems that manage electrical
distribution, heating, ventilation, lighting, air conditioning as well as
security. 
This will provide a complete dashboard for energy management that can report on
when and what is consuming the most energy. Administrators will be able to
enable
manual or automated facility controls based on need, power consumption and cost.
 
Furthermore, the integration will centralize security functionality including
access
control, intrusion detection, event notifications and digital video management.

    "TAC is very excited about working with APC and IBM Tivoli to deliver a
comprehensive energy management and monitoring solution that can help
customers increase energy efficiency across data centers and building systems,"
said Rodman St. Amand, TAC's director of strategic accounts. "The new solution
expands on our level of alarm notification and redundancy."

    The combined APC, TAC and IBM Tivoli Monitoring solution will allow a
user
to:


--  Detect and monitor real-time changes in power and cooling as well as
    understand the corresponding IT assets and business applications that may
    be affected by the change;

--  Track moves, additions and changes of physical IT assets;

--  Optimize utilization of actual power, cooling and rack capacities
    while right-sizing the IT environment;

--  Better predict and avoid potential downtime due to hardware failures
    or energy events;

--  Track historical information regarding usage of IT assets and
    subsequent power and cooling requirements to better implement current and
    future data center strategy;

--  Integrate and centralize data center security functionality such as
    access control, intrusion detection and digital video management;

--  Gain visibility of enhanced building management controls for heating,
    ventilating and air conditioning.
    

    
APC expects that customers will have access to the integrated APC
InfraStruXure Central, TAC building management system, and IBM Tivoli Monitoring
solution worldwide in 2009.  Today, clients can contact any of the
participating companies to start the process of evaluating their current
facilities and data center strategy to better manage and control their energy
consumption and costs.

    APC InfraStruXure Central is available worldwide and starts with an
estimated resale price of less than $10,000. For more information about

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, June 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co.'s  (JPM.N)
Boston-based fund services group, one of the industry's
biggest, will add more than 300 new jobs in the next five
years, the company said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The new jobs will be created to meet customers' growing
demands as the unit, which has roughly $4.7 trillion in assets
under administration worldwide, expects to see a 40 percent
jump this year in the roughly $1 trillion in assets it
administers out of Boston alone, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A month ago, Daniel Kramer, managing director of the Fund
Services Operations in Boston, told Reuters that the unit would
hire roughly 400 hundred employees in the next three years as
clients add billions of dollars in new assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fund services units provide accounting and financial
reporting to thousands of portfolios and while the business is
not glamorous it can be lucrative because it is essential to
anyone who buys and sells stocks or bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boston has traditionally been a hub for mutual fund
management and by extension for fund services as well. State
Street Corp (STT.N)., one of JPMorgan's most prominent rivals,
is  headquartered here and the Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N),
another large competitor, also has a big presence in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kramer said in early May that JPMorgan would would hire
outsiders as well as possibly bringing people on board from
Bear Stearns, the collapsed investment bank it bought this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Boston area's many universities and the concentration
of other companies specializing in fund servicing nearby offer
a large pool to choose from.

&lt;p&gt;Unstructured Data Classification Solution Enhances SharePoint
Records Manager to Extend Policy Management and Enforcement Across the
             Enterprise Ensuring Compliance at the Desktop
ROCKVILLE, Md.--(Business Wire)--
FileTek, Inc., a pioneer developer of innovative information and
data management solutions, today announced the introduction of the
Trusted Edge Desktop Compliance Suite for Microsoft SharePoint. This
new Trusted Edge solution integrates with Microsoft(R) Office
SharePoint(R) Server 2007 to enhance the records management
functionality of SharePoint to help companies deploy effective
eCompliance and data management strategies addressing the latest
regulatory developments such as updated FRCP, SOX, HIPAA and SEC rules
and regulations.

   By utilizing a unique approach to data classification, Trusted
Edge is a perfect complement to SharePoint's baseline ECM
functionality, providing a controlled collection methodology that
stores unstructured data (content, documents, and files) into the
SharePoint repository. Trusted Edge solves a key problem facing
businesses today - how to successfully implement a "best practices"
digital records management policy across the entire enterprise
network, including the desktop, where 80% of documents are created.
Unlike traditional ECM solutions, Trusted Edge enforces the mandatory
categorization of desktop-generated data from MS Office and other
applications extending SharePoint's control to files stored inside and
outside the repository, dramatically reducing risks associated with
unknown or unidentified copies.

   According to Enterprise Strategy Group research, organizations
will archive nearly 90 exabytes of unstructured content in the next
five years to meet compliance, records management, legal preservation
and improved information access requirements. "There are two dynamics
that make Trusted Edge's announcement timely," said Brian Babineau,
Senior Analyst with Enterprise Strategy Group. "First, a large amount
of unstructured information will be managed within SharePoint, and
second, much of the data will be created at the desktop." As a result,
organizations are going to need a means to classify data at the point
of creation and then leverage solutions like SharePoint that enforce
policies based on the various information categories.

   "Our Trusted Edge solution delivers unique functionality for
SharePoint extending records management controls from the very edge of
the network to the core of the enterprise," said Philip Pascarelli,
President of FileTek. "By intelligently enhancing SharePoint, Trusted
Edge gives organizations a powerful solution that better manages
unstructured data and mitigates the risks associated with electronic
content. In addition, the Trusted Edge solution can route content to
multiple repositories allowing the SharePoint ecosystem to leverage
opportunities involving other ECM and archival applications and extend
the value proposition."

   The Trusted Edge Compliance Suite for Microsoft SharePoint plays a
pivotal role in managing unstructured data through the capture,
classification and control of information created, used and stored on
the desktop and at the network's edge. Following the deployment of
Trusted Edge, businesses can apply corporate policies to desktop
information, and subsequently manage documents and emails based on
internal and external policies. The solution improves retention
compliance, reduces litigation risk and optimizes enterprise storage
costs by classifying and routing files to their appropriate location.
In addition, Trusted Edge works with various ECM solutions to enforce
repository-based functions back out to the desktop to ensure
end-to-end policy compliance. Trusted Edge also features a unique
architecture allowing the business utilization of auto-classification
or user-classification policies.

   FileTek's technology partners for Trusted Edge include Microsoft,
Open Text, Symantec, and Clearview Software.

SAN JOSE, Calif., June 3, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Networked storage expert

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats story from late on Monday)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Eric Auchard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, June 2 (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) CEO
Jerry Yang ordered up a draft press release rejecting a
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) takeover bid months before January's
unsolicited bid, company documents unsealed on Monday show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Selective details from Yahoo board minutes and other
confidential company documents in an investor suit, unsealed by
a Delaware Chancery Court judge on Monday, paint a picture of
how Yahoo has rebuffed Microsoft's courtship since early 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attorneys working on behalf of Yahoo investors aiming to
force the company to drop its anti-takeover defenses -- opening
the way to a Microsoft deal -- got the papers from the company
and were allowed by a judge to make them public on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Minutes of Yahoo's board meeting last October said
directors discussed "the likelihood that a third party would
make an offer to purchase the company." Yang then obtained
approval to reject any offer, drawing up a standby press
release for an offer that only arrived late in January 2008.
The suit alleges the "third party" was Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While many events described in the shareholder complaint
have enjoyed wide media coverage over the past year-and-a-half
-- dating back to reports of Yahoo's decision to reject a
Microsoft offer of $40 per share in January 2007 -- the new
disclosures bring to light Yahoo's resistance to a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In notes from a phone conversation between Yang and
Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer held the day before
Microsoft made public its takeover bid for Yahoo, Yang sought
to delay Microsoft, but Ballmer said he would wait no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You don't lose anything by waiting a week," Yang is cited
as saying, according to notes taken by an unidentified Yahoo
participant and released in the shareholder suit on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer responded with words to the effect that "If you
really don't want to sell the biz, then (I) don't want to wait"
according to the previously undisclosed notes of the call.
Ballmer also encouraged Yang to make a counterproposal and said
Microsoft would forego making its bid public if Yahoo did so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The records do not indicate whether Yahoo countered.
Microsoft went public the following day, Feb. 1, with its
$31-per-share cash-and-stock offer, worth nearly $45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The suit seeks to paint Yang as a Microsoft-hater, but
Yang's public statements and willingness to meet with Microsoft
several times in recent months suggest he is seeking to wring a
better price from Microsoft, not scotch a deal at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We did not walk away from that proposal, Microsoft did,"
Yang told a hi-tech conference last week. "Microsoft is no
longer interested in buying the company and we are talking
about other things," he said, adding that "we are listening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUIT DEMANDS YAHOO DROP MERGER DEFENSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The attorneys representing two Michigan pension funds are
demanding that Yahoo drop barriers to a potential merger deal.
They depict Yahoo as rushing to adopt an employee severance
plan aimed at derailing a deal, according to their complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo attorneys had previously asked the Delaware court to
seal details from confidential company documents for fear they
could be used against Yahoo in an upcoming proxy battle the
company faces at its shareholder meeting set for late July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When first released in mid-May, the amended shareholder
complaint had crucial sections redacted. Chancery Court Judge
William Chandler III on Monday ruled there was no reason to
shield the Yahoo documents from investors and lifted the seal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In ordering the Yahoo documents to be made public, the
judge acknowledged that the plaintiffs may be mischaracterizing
some of the facts or otherwise taking them out of context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Judge Chandler dismisses these concerns in ruling that:
"The proper remedy is for defendants (Yahoo) to release the
full text of any communications they believe have been taken
out of context or selectively quoted to the public."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo said in a statement it was disappointed by the ruling
but that it would make no difference in the outcome of the
suit, which the company said it believes is without merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bulk of the complaint against Yahoo released on Monday
centers on whether the court should cancel a generous employee
severance plan that plaintiffs' attorneys argue is nothing more
than a move to make any takeover prohibitively expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The suit contrasts a $1.5 billion Microsoft employee
retention plan Ballmer mentioned to Yang in their Jan. 31 phone
call to Yahoo's quickly arranged employee severance plan that
would add an estimated $2.1 billion in costs in the event of a
merger. The plaintiffs maintain that Yahoo's severance plan has
the perverse effect of keeping Yahoo employees in place for now
but would encourage them to leave if Yahoo is eventually sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Were Microsoft to offer a $35-per-share price, the Yahoo
severance plan would add nearly $2.4 billion in merger costs,
the suit alleges, reducing Microsoft's willingness to boost its
offer beyond it final verbal offer of $33 made in early May to
Yang. The plaintiffs seek to unwind the plan in the hopes of
enticing Microsoft back to negotiate a full-scale merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo defended its severance plan, saying it was the right
thing for employees and shareholders alike at a time when it
needed to keep its employees focused on their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We adopted this plan to preserve the company's most
valuable asset -- its employees -- at an unprecedented time in
the company's history," the Yahoo statement reads.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, details and background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By George Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI, June 3 (Reuters) - Bank of Shanghai, in which HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) (0005.HK) holds an 8 percent stake, has
hired a China joint venture of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to help it
list on the domestic stock market this year, a senior executive
said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is too early to indicate the scale of the initial public
offering of shares, he said, as the financial adviser,
Beijing-based Goldman Sachs Gaohua Securities, and the
underwriters have not yet settled on financial details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of Beijing (601169.SS), which raised 15 billion yuan
($2.16 billion) in an IPO last year, could be viewed as a
potential point of reference as it is similar in terms of asset
size, the executive told Reuters, although the final decision
would depend on market conditions and regulatory approvals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of Shanghai, a mid-sized commercial lender with a
business focus in eastern China, hopes to proceed with the
listing this year but the timing will mainly depend on the
market environment, after China's benchmark stock index .SSEC
fell as much as 50 percent from a record high set last October,
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have been prepared for this for many years but it was
the city government's decision to let us go ahead with the
listing now," the executive said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of Shanghai will be listing on the Shanghai bourse, the
bigger of the country's two national stock exchanges, as its IPO
plan is linked to the city's ambitions to build itself into a
global financial centre over the next several years, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We now have the full support of the city government, which
will also help us to win approval from the relevant regulators
in Beijing," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HSBC STAKE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank has also hired three domestic brokerages, Guotai
Junan, Shenyin Wanguo and CITIC Securities (600030.SS), China's
top stock broker, as joint lead underwriters for its IPO, the
executive said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The executive declined to be identified before an official
announcement, which is expected late on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai government, which controls Bank of Shanghai,
the city's third-largest bank behind Bank of Communications
(3328.HK) (601328.SS) and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank
(600000.SS), once considered merging it with Pudong Development
Bank, industry sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pudong Development Bank Chairman Ji Xiaohui told Reuters in
March that his bank, in which Citigroup Inc (C.N) holds nearly 4
percent, had no intention of acquiring Bank of Shanghai, playing
down long-running market speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shanghai International Group, an investment arm of the city
government, controls Pudong Development Bank with a more than 30
percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The executive said Bank of Shanghai's listing plan had
received HSBC's blessing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Of course, HSBC supports Bank of Shanghai's IPO plan and I
believe HSBC has been waiting for this to take place for years,"
he said, although he declined to comment on whether HSBC may
dispose of or raise its stake after the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HSBC also owns nearly 20 percent of Bank of Communications,
which is based in Shanghai and is controlled by China's Ministry
of Finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HSBC has consistently referred to Bank of Communications as
a strategic partner in China while regarding its holdings in
Bank of Shanghai as a financial investment.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc CEO Jerry Yang ordered up a draft press release rejecting a Microsoft Corp takeover bid months before January's unsolicited bid, company documents unsealed on Monday show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selective details from Yahoo board minutes and other confidential company documents in an investor suit, unsealed by a Delaware Chancery Court judge on Monday, paint a picture of how Yahoo has rebuffed Microsoft's courtship since early 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys working on behalf of Yahoo investors aiming to force the company to drop its anti-takeover defenses -- opening the way to a Microsoft deal -- got the papers from the company and were allowed by a judge to make them public on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minutes of Yahoo's board meeting last October said directors discussed "the likelihood that a third party would make an offer to purchase the company." Yang then obtained approval to reject any offer, drawing up a standby press release for an offer that only arrived late in January 2008. The suit alleges the "third party" was Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many events described in the shareholder complaint have enjoyed wide media coverage over the past year-and-a-half -- dating back to reports of Yahoo's decision to reject a Microsoft offer of $40 per share in January 2007 -- the new disclosures bring to light Yahoo's resistance to a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In notes from a phone conversation between Yang and Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer held the day before Microsoft made public its takeover bid for Yahoo, Yang sought to delay Microsoft, but Ballmer said he would wait no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't lose anything by waiting a week," Yang is cited as saying, according to notes taken by an unidentified Yahoo participant and released in the shareholder suit on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer responded with words to the effect that "If you really don't want to sell the biz, then (I) don't want to wait" according to the previously undisclosed notes of the call. Ballmer also encouraged Yang to make a counterproposal and said Microsoft would forego making its bid public if Yahoo did so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The records do not indicate whether Yahoo countered. Microsoft went public the following day, February 1, with its $31-per-share cash-and-stock offer, worth nearly $45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit seeks to paint Yang as a Microsoft-hater, but Yang's public statements and willingness to meet with Microsoft several times in recent months suggest he is seeking to wring a better price from Microsoft, not scotch a deal at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did not walk away from that proposal, Microsoft did," Yang told a hi-tech conference last week. "Microsoft is no longer interested in buying the company and we are talking about other things," he said, adding that "we are listening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUIT DEMANDS YAHOO DROP MERGER DEFENSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorneys representing two Michigan pension funds are demanding that Yahoo drop barriers to a potential merger deal. They depict Yahoo as rushing to adopt an employee severance plan aimed at derailing a deal, according to their complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo attorneys had previously asked the Delaware court to seal details from confidential company documents for fear they could be used against Yahoo in an upcoming proxy battle the company faces at its shareholder meeting set for late July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When first released in mid-May, the amended shareholder complaint had crucial sections redacted. Chancery Court Judge William Chandler III on Monday ruled there was no reason to shield the Yahoo documents from investors and lifted the seal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ordering the Yahoo documents to be made public, the judge acknowledged that the plaintiffs may be mischaracterizing some of the facts or otherwise taking them out of context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Judge Chandler dismisses these concerns in ruling that: "The proper remedy is for defendants (Yahoo) to release the full text of any communications they believe have been taken out of context or selectively quoted to the public."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo said in a statement it was disappointed by the ruling but that it would make no difference in the outcome of the suit, which the company said it believes is without merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the complaint against Yahoo released on Monday centers on whether the court should cancel a generous employee severance plan that plaintiffs' attorneys argue is nothing more than a move to make any takeover prohibitively expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit contrasts a $1.5 billion Microsoft employee retention plan Ballmer mentioned to Yang in their January 31 phone call to Yahoo's quickly arranged employee severance plan that would add an estimated $2.1 billion in costs in the event of a merger. The plaintiffs maintain that Yahoo's severance plan has the perverse effect of keeping Yahoo employees in place for now but would encourage them to leave if Yahoo is eventually sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were Microsoft to offer a $35-per-share price, the Yahoo severance plan would add nearly $2.4 billion in merger costs, the suit alleges, reducing Microsoft's willingness to boost its offer beyond it final verbal offer of $33 made in early May to Yang. The plaintiffs seek to unwind the plan in the hopes of enticing Microsoft back to negotiate a full-scale merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo defended its severance plan, saying it was the right thing for employees and shareholders alike at a time when it needed to keep its employees focused on their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We adopted this plan to preserve the company's most valuable asset -- its employees -- at an unprecedented time in the company's history," the Yahoo statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michele Gershberg; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Releases Four ''Strong Buy'' or ''Buy'' Stocks: ZOLL Medical, Microsoft, Murphy Oil and StatoilHydro

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Four free stock picks are being made available today on Zacks.com.
The industry's leading independent research firm highlights a Zacks #1
Rank Strong Buy stock or a Zacks #2 Rank Buy stock for each of the

notable even during volatile and down times. For example, during the
last bear market, 2000-2002, the market tumbled -37.6% - but Zacks #1
Rank stocks gained +43.8%.

   To see the secret behind this performance, investors are invited

   The Zacks Rank Discovery

   Underlying the four free stock picks is a simple truth that first
appeared in a Financial Analysts Journal article published in 1979.
Leonard Zacks, a Ph.D. in Mathematics from M.I.T. found that "earnings
estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock
prices." Zacks #1 Rank is awarded to a stock when analysts sharply
upgrade their estimates of what the company will earn.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI, June 3 (Reuters) - Bank of Shanghai, in which HSBC

&lt;p&gt;  THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS, Jun 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled an integrated approach to managing
enterprise content with software that helps customers control and derive value
from all types of content created and shared by workgroups across an
organization.

    IBM's new Business Content Services strategy helps businesses of all sizes
to
address the explosive growth of content, including business documents created
individually and collaboratively across diverse, and often global, workgroups.
As
part of the company's Enterprise Content Management (ECM) software portfolio,
this approach combines IBM's market-leading ECM capabilities with a variety
of collaboration and social software options.

    Organizations can select the convenience of a complete solution from IBM
featuring the social software and collaboration capabilities of Lotus Quickr
and also use IBM's ECM offerings to manage business content created in a variety
of applications, such as IBM Lotus Notes, Microsoft Office and Microsoft
Office SharePoint Server, in a secure, scalable ECM platform.

    "IBM's commitment to delivering market-leading ECM infrastructure
solutionsallows workers to create content in familiar desktop applications and
document collaboration tools, while enabling organizations to more efficiently
and cost-effectively meet their content management and compliance goals,"
said Lee Roberts, general manager, IBM Enterprise Content Management. "Our
Business
Content Services approach is focused on bridging the gap between the simple
management of business documents and a comprehensive ECM infrastructure."

    AMEC Paragon, the oil, gas and pipeline subsidiary of AMEC, the
international
engineering and project management company, relies on IBM ECM offerings to
improve management of its project document lifecycle.

    "Today, we populate Microsoft SharePoint with documents controlled and
managed by our IBM ECM infrastructure, then use the SharePoint interface
tocollaborate on these engineering and design documents with other groups in
AMEC, outside agencies and partners," said Marc-Henri J. Cerar, Project IT &amp;
Information Systems Manager, AMEC Paragon. "IBM's strategy for extending
SharePoint
will enable AMEC to address current business content management needs within our
ECM
infrastructure and allow us to meet upcoming challenges -- including integrated
records and email management -- while streamlining business processes."

    The flexibility of IBM's ECM strategy also represents a significant
opportunity for
IBM Business Partners. Ascendant Technology, a leading technology integrator, is
ready to help their customers bring together key collaboration and social
networking features within their larger enterprise content management strategy.

    "The advanced Web 2.0 capabilities and easy-to-use interface of Lotus Quickr
combined with IBM's world class ECM capabilities will offer businesses
unmatched flexibility and features set," said Jim Deters president of Ascendant
Technology. "We expect tremendous demand from our customers for this type of
flexible ECM strategy."

    IBM's Enterprise Content Management Offerings

    IBM ECM Services for Lotus Quickr will enable customers to collaborate on
business content, leveraging IBM ECM for business process optimization,
auto-classification and regulatory compliance. The new services allow IBM
customers to mix the Web-based collaboration and desktop integration of
Lotus Notes, IBM Lotus Sametime, Microsoft Office, and Windows Explorer with IBM
ECM capabilities. The IBM ECM Services for Lotus Quickr are the subject of a

&lt;p&gt;  THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS, Jun 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced availability of IBM solidDB, in-memory
relational
database software to deliver performance-critical data at extreme speeds -- up
to
10 times faster than conventional database software.

    Whereas conventional database technology stores data on computer hard disks,
IBM solidDB keeps data in main memory at all times, making it an order of
magnitude faster. solidDB can be deployed as a cache to IBM DB2 data
server or Informix Server (IDS), or as a standalone in-memory database to
allowapplications to quickly access performance-critical data using the
familiarSQL programming language.  The solidDB architecture can support tens of
thousands of transactions per second with predictable response times measured
in microseconds.

    The introduction of IBM solidDB supports IBM's global Information on
Demandbusiness strategy, which is allowing clients to rapidly use information to
accelerate business growth by responding to changing demands in real-time,
and enabling the rapid delivery of new business services at lower cost. 
IBM's approach enables businesses to use technologies like solidDB to access,
manage and deliver information more efficiently, as well as to capture and
integrate information in real-time across their enterprises.

    "Real-time information availability is becoming increasingly critical to our
clients and solidDB answers the challenge with real-time performance and
uninterrupted data access at a low cost," Inhi Cho, vice president, IBM Data
Management Marketing.  "The addition of solidDB also allows IBM's DB2 and IDS
clients to deliver new services to their customers and gain real-time insight
by maximizing their existing information management technology investments."

    solidDB's extreme speed is a vital resource for clients in many
industries,such as ticketing and reservation service providers, web retailers,
telecommunications companies and capital market firms which require
instantand reliable handling of dynamic business information.  Data from DB2 or
IDS
can be cached in solidDB to support peak workloads experienced by such
applications as web collaboration, on-line mobile phone charging and stock
trading. This fast access to information can also provide web retailers with the
ability to personalize their sites for targeted audiences and maximize
up-selling and cross-selling opportunities.

    "Iskratel has been using solidDB in-memory database as a core technology for
its
leading SI3000 Multi Service Control Node product line," said Franc Dolenc,
Director of Products and Solutions, Iskratel.  "Having the ability to process 1
million busy-hour call attempts (BHCA) per CPU, and to also have Carrier Grade
availability, was a major challenge for our NGN/IMS fully featured Call Server.
The extreme performance and data resilience of solidDB has proven to be a
solid foundation for our extreme requirements. We are excited to continue this
collaboration with IBM and their highly focused team, in evolving the solidDB
technology to meet our growing needs as we extend our offerings further into
multi-media and Web solutions."

    IBM solidDB represents the first in-memory software technology to be
integrated in the Information on Demand portfolio as part of the
acquisitionof Solid Information Technology.

    IBM solidDB, solidDB Cache for IDS and solidDB Cache for DB2 will be
available starting June 24.  For more on IBM solidDB, please go to

&lt;p&gt;New Pfizer Data Presented on CP-751,871 across Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Ewing's Sarcoma

 ADVIGO CP-751,871 Global Phase III Clinical Trial Program Initiated (ADVancing
                               IGF-1R in Oncology)
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer announced today results from several clinical trials further describing
the activity of its investigational compound CP-751,871 in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) and Ewing's Sarcoma, both diseases with high unmet medical need.
The three oral presentations and one poster discussion underscore that the
insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) is increasingly recognized by the
medical community as a relevant target for investigation in cancer research. The
results were presented at the 44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago, IL.

Updated Response Data from the 1002 NSCLC Trial

Updated study results from a Phase II, randomized, non-comparative study showed
54 percent of patients with Stage III/IV treatment-naive NSCLC receiving the
combination CP-751,871 plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (n=97) experienced
objective responses. The response rate observed for patients treated with
carboplatin and paclitaxel alone was 41 percent.

Of note, 78 percent of a subset of patients with squamous cell carcinoma (n=23)
and 57 percent of a subset of patients with adenocarcinoma (n=28) receiving 20
mg/kg of CP-751,871 plus carboplatin and paclitaxel experienced objective
responses. Response rates were 46 percent and 25 percent, respectively, for
squamous cell (n=13) and adenocarcinoma patients (n=20) receiving carboplatin
and paclitaxel alone. No response advantage with CP-751,871 was seen in a subset
of patients with undifferentiated tumors (Not otherwise specified, NOS).

"Patients with advanced NSCLC typically face a poor prognosis and we need to
develop new strategies and new treatment combinations to improve their
survival," said lead investigator Daniel Karp, M.D., director of the M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC). "The
updated study results add to our growing understanding of the potential safety
and efficacy of CP-751,871. In this trial, increasing the dose to 20 mg/kg in
Stage 2 of the trial resulted in an increased overall response rate in all
differentiated histologies, including adenocarcinoma, non-adenocarcinoma, and
particularly in squamous histologies, which we consider to be of interest for
future study."

Dr. Karp also presented progression-free survival (PFS) results from the study.
At the dose level of 20 mg/kg, the observed progression-free survival was 5
months in the CP-751,871 plus carboplatin/paclitaxel arm and 4 months in the
carboplatin/paclitaxel only arm. The highest observed PFS was in the group of
patients with squamous histologies (5.6 months in the CP-751,871 plus
carboplatin/paclitaxel arm and 4.3 months in the carboplatin/paclitaxel only
arm) corresponding to the patients that demonstrated the highest response rates.
PFS was defined as either the length of time before the cancer progressed or
death.

In this study, CP-751,871 was generally well tolerated. The most common Grade 3
or 4 side effects reported were hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar) (20
percent) and neutropenia (30 percent).

Correlative Science Study Results Support Karp Data

This abstract summarized ancillary studies conducted to investigate the
molecular make up of lung tumors and its relevance to anti-IGF-IR therapy.
Members of the IGF-IR pathway appear to be expressed differentially across lung
tumor histologies which may help to explain the differential activity of
CP-751,871 across these histologies. Tumor differentiation also appears to play
a role. Data were also presented demonstrating that EGFR inhibition sensitizes
tumors to CP-751,871 treatment.

"These results help us to understand better how CP-751,871 works, provide
support for our phase III trial strategy and underscore Pfizer's commitment to
bring science and innovation to the forefront of drug development," said Antonio
Gualberto, M.D., Ph.D., Global Clinical Lead for the CP-751,871 program, Pfizer
Global Research and Development.

ADVIGO Phase III Registration Program (ADVancing IGF-IR in Oncology)

Based on these data, Pfizer has initiated a large global Phase III clinical
trial program for CP-751,871 in NSCLC, including some studies with patients with
non-adenocarcinoma (ADVIGO 1016, ADVIGO 1018). The program includes trials for
patients who are newly diagnosed and for those who have already been treated
with other therapies.

Pfizer has made a major commitment to CP-751,871 and has invested significant
resources in the Phase III program, which will include more than 2,000 patients
around the world.

Preliminary Data Presented on CP-751,871 in Sarcoma

Phase I data presented at ASCO showed single agent CP-751,871 was generally
well-tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory sarcoma (n=22), including
Ewing's sarcoma (n=9). A response of stable disease or better was seen in 12 out
of 20 evaluable patients, including one confirmed partial response in a
12-year-old patient with Ewing's sarcoma, the second most common malignant bone
tumor in young patients and the most deadly bone tumor.

CP-751,871 was generally well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory
sarcoma. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related side effects reported included Grade 4
uric acid increase (n=1) and Grade 3 bilateral deep-vein thrombosis (n=1).

About CP-751,871

CP-751,871, a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, is a highly specific
inhibitor of the IGF-1R pathway. It is believed that through this inhibition,
CP-751,871 blocks one of the key signaling pathways in cancer cells that lead to
uncontrolled growth and survival of tumor cells.

Pfizer recently initiated a global Phase III clinical trial registration program
for CP-751,871 in non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC. In addition, Pfizer is studying
CP-751,871 in clinical trials for the treatment of many other cancers, including
prostate, breast and colon cancers and Ewing's sarcoma. To date, more than 500
patients have participated in CP-751,871 clinical trials in multiple tumor
types.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) struck a deal 
with the world's largest personal computer maker, 
Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), to place a toolbar on new PCs that 
leads to its Live Search engine, the companies said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The deal is Microsoft's latest attempt to chip away at the 
dominance of search leader Google Inc (GOOG.O). The agreement, 
which takes effect next January for new PCs in the United 
States and Canada, displaces a similar one HP has with Yahoo 
Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the agreement, Microsoft's search engine will also be 
the default service on the Internet Explorer browser preloaded 
on new HP computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft did not disclose the terms of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is the most significant distribution deal for Live 
Search that Microsoft has ever done," said Kevin Johnson, 
president of Microsoft's platform and services division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Number-two PC maker Dell Inc DELL.O and Google have an 
agreement to preinstall Web and desktop search software on 
Dell's consumer computers. It expires in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Dell spokesman said the company has not decided if it 
will continue with Google after the current deal expires, but 
said it was "open to alternative" partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google continues to extend its lead in Web search. Research 
firm comScore said Google's U.S. Web search market share rose 
to a record 61.5 percent in April, while Yahoo's share declined 
to 20.4 percent and Microsoft's slipped to 9.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has stepped up its 
efforts to catch Google with a number of initiatives. Last 
month, it announced a new "cashback" rewards program to 
encourage people to use its search engine to shop for items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, it made an offer to buy Yahoo that was 
rejected by the Web company's board. Microsoft shelved its 
offer over disagreement on price, but restarted talks with 
Yahoo last month to buy its search service, said a source 
familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft were down 63 cents, or 2.2 percent, to 
$27.69, while HP was down 2 percent at $46.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Braden

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc said on Wednesday that deal talks are ongoing with Microsoft Corp as the company resisted an attack by billionaire critic Carl Icahn, who called its recent actions "deceitful."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo President Susan Decker trumpeted new ad partnerships with Wal-Mart Stores Inc and others as Icahn, an activist investor, stepped up pressure on Yahoo over its rebuff of Microsoft's $47.5 billion buyout offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said some form of deal with Microsoft could still come about, sending Yahoo shares up 2.7 percent for the day, despite Icahn's later blistering attack on Chief Executive Jerry Yang's leadership at Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an invective-filled letter to Yahoo, Icahn used terms like "deceitful," "self-destructive," "misleading" and "insulting to shareholders" for moves by Yang and the board to retain employees in a severance plan likely to make a deal with Microsoft more costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He called on Yahoo to rescind anti-takeover defenses and merge with Microsoft, writing "even I am amazed at the length Jerry Yang and the Yahoo board have gone to in order to entrench their positions and keep shareholders from deciding if they wished to sell to Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo fired back, in kind, saying Icahn's attack on the company "seriously misrepresents and manipulates the facts" regarding dealings between Microsoft and Yahoo and that it relied on allegations from an error-filled lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company labeled as "patently untrue" key assertions contained in the complaint filed by lawyers for two Detroit pension funds who seek to unwind its anti-takeover defenses in order to force Yahoo to accept a full Microsoft merger deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Notably, you accuse us of turning down a $40 per share offer and 'sabotaging' a $33 per share offer," Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock said in a reply to Icahn that argues he lacks a credible plan for Yahoo other than selling out to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn's criticisms stem from arguments made in a legal complaint attacking Yahoo that was unsealed this week and which purports to shed light on Yahoo's long resistance to Microsoft's entreaties. That suit refers to media reports that assert Yahoo rejected a $40-per-share Microsoft merger offer in early 2007 and to a $33-a-share verbal offer Microsoft has said it made early last month that was again rebuffed by Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn has proposed an alternate board ahead of Yahoo's annual meeting on August 1. He told cable business channel CNBC later on Wednesday that "we have good odds" in the Yahoo proxy battle and said an alternate deal in which Microsoft would buy only parts of the company would not serve shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WAR OF WORDS HEATS UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decker told the Advertising 2.0 conference in New York that a deal could happen in many forms. "There are ongoing, engaged conversations," she said. "There are many ways in which a combination with Microsoft could be very beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some Wall Street investors say Icahn cannot be easily denied. "Carl is a very, very tough adversary to have. They (Yahoo) should have taken him more seriously in the beginning," bankruptcy specialist Wilbur Ross told Fox Business News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decker defended Yahoo's severance plan, saying it was meant to keep intact its employee base, a key asset of any deal it might hope to make. She stopped short of saying whether Yahoo's talks with Microsoft concern a full merger or a partial deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between Yahoo and Microsoft are focused on finding a price for buying Yahoo's search business, and these discussions are likely to conclude in the "next week or so," a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the finer points under discussion include what Microsoft would pay Yahoo for the right to run advertising alongside Yahoo search queries, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Yahoo continues to talk with Google Inc, and could end up striking a deal with the Web search giant if Microsoft and it do not reach terms, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's new ad deals include a multi-year partnership with Wal-Mart to be the primary ad sales channel for Walmart.com. Yahoo will become the exclusive portal to resell the site's display inventory. In another deal, Yahoo signed up the digital unit of advertising holding company Havas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third agreement calls for Yahoo to carry CBS Corp content, like clips from TV shows, as part of a broader plan by the media company to add new outlets for its TV programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is also adding 94 titles to its newspaper advertising consortium, bringing the total to 779. Among other things, Yahoo provides technology to serve up brand advertising on the websites of newspapers working to offset lost classified ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Anupreeta Das and Eric Auchard in San Francisco, Editing by Braden Reddall and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is interested in moving further into unconventional natural gas resources, the head of the company's natural gas business said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We like to get a hold of a resource where we can apply not only our technology, but also our prowess in operations of some scale -- a lot of rigs, a lot of running room," Andrew Swiger, president of ExxonMobil Gas  Power Marketing, told the Reuters Global Energy Summit in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unconventional resource plays are pockets of oil and gas historically unrecoverable in substances like shale. In recent years, new drilling technology and high energy prices have triggered a frenzy of activity among companies tapping into those sources that were considered too expensive and difficult to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded company by market capitalization, has more than 300,000 acres where it is drilling for "tight gas" in the Piceance basin in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to look for other ones that would be in that same category," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its 70 percent-owned subsidiary Imperial Oil (IMO.TO) recently acquired 115,000 acres of exploration lands in the Horn River region of northeastern British Columbia, a region that has garnered attention for massive natural gas reserves trapped in shale rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiger also said the company remains optimistic that there will be ample demand for liquefied natural gas in the United States over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems very likely that LNG is going to play an important role as we go over time," Swiger said. "We don't worry right now about little fluctuations in the near term, or how a market might be month to month, year to year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LNG shipments to the United States have dropped since last year. Two regasification terminals have opened recently and analysts say they can expect few shipments of the fuel in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has its own terminal, located on the Texas Gulf Coast, scheduled to open next year and has proposed building another off the New Jersey coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the company's Gulf Coast terminal "is part of an integrated project -- it is built for the long term... We think that North America, anchored by a foothold on the Gulf Coast of the U.S., is going to be a market that we are going to want to be in for LNG supply over a long period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Anna Driver, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A top Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) executive said on Wednesday the company was on track to start up two liquefied natural gas regasfication terminals that will deliver gas to Europe this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Swiger, president of Exxon Mobil's natural gas and power business, said the South Hook LNG terminal, located in Wales, will start up in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A project to export Qatari gas to the terminal -- Qatargas II train 4 -- will start up later this year, Swiger told the Reuters Global Energy Summit in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Qatargas' chief executive said the project would start in June, but Swiger declined to specify a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiger also said the company's Adriatic LNG terminal, which will be located offshore Italy, will start up "very late this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flooding started at the drydock where the project is currently situated last week, the first step to moving it to its eventual location, but "getting it over there and setting it in place and hooking everything up will take a bit of time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman, Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc said on Wednesday that talks were still on with Microsoft Corp and trumpeted new advertising deals, but failed to appease critic Carl Icahn, who called its board's moves "deceitful."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo President Susan Decker unveiled new ad partnerships with Wal-Mart Stores Inc and others as Icahn, a billionaire activist investor, stepped up pressure on Yahoo over its rebuff of Microsoft's $47.5 billion buyout offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And she said some form of deal with Microsoft could still come about, sending Yahoo shares up 2.7 percent for the day, despite Icahn's later blistering, personal attack on Chief Executive Jerry Yang's leadership at Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an invective-filled letter to Yahoo, Icahn used terms like "deceitful," "self-destructive," "misleading" and "insulting to shareholders" for moves by Yang and the board to retain employees in a severance plan likely to make a deal with Microsoft more costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He called on Yahoo to rescind anti-takeover defenses and merge with Microsoft, writing that "even I am amazed at the length Jerry Yang and the Yahoo board have gone to in order to entrench their positions and keep shareholders from deciding if they wished to sell to Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn has proposed an alternate board ahead of Yahoo's annual meeting on August 1. He told cable business channel CNBC later on Wednesday that "we have good odds" in the Yahoo proxy battle and said an alternate deal in which Microsoft would buy only parts of the company would not serve shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decker told the Advertising 2.0 conference in New York that a deal could happen in many forms. "There are ongoing, engaged conversations," she said. "There are many ways in which a combination with Microsoft could be very beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between Yahoo and Microsoft are focused on arriving at a value for Yahoo's search business, and these discussions are likely to conclude in the "next week or so," a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two are currently discussing terms of a potential deal in which Microsoft buys Yahoo's search business, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some Wall Street investors say Icahn cannot be easily denied. "Carl is a very, very tough adversary to have. They (Yahoo) should have taken him more seriously in the beginning," bankruptcy specialist Wilbur Ross told Fox Business News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn's latest criticisms stem from a lawsuit filed by two Detroit pension funds that was unsealed on Monday and shed light on Yahoo's response to Microsoft's courtship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decker defended Yahoo's severance plan, saying it was meant to keep intact its employee base, a key asset of any deal. She stopped short of saying whether Yahoo's talks with Microsoft concern a full merger or a partial deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person familiar with the matter said executives and advisers from both companies are focusing on establishing a price for Yahoo's search. Some of the finer points under discussion include what Microsoft would pay Yahoo for search queries and traffic acquisition costs, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Yahoo continues to talk with Google Inc, and could still end up striking a deal with the Web search giant if it fails to agree to terms with Microsoft, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WAL-MART EYEBALLS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's new ad deals include a multi-year partnership with Wal-Mart to be the primary ad sales channel for Walmart.com. Yahoo will become the exclusive portal to resell the site's display inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement gives Yahoo a major participant for its new AMP ad management system, a linchpin of the company's strategy to reach outside its own base of users and increase its position as the "must buy" location for online advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMP aims to simplify the process of buying and selling online ads for advertisers, ad agencies, fast-growing ad trading networks and website publishers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another deal, the digital unit of advertising holding company Havas will work with Yahoo globally on AMP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third agreement calls for Yahoo to carry CBS Corp content, like clips from TV shows, as part of a broader plan by the media company to add new outlets for its TV programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is also adding 94 titles to its newspaper advertising consortium, bringing the total to 779. Among other things, Yahoo provides the technology to serve graphical display ads on the websites of newspapers involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Anupreeta Das and Eric Auchard in San Francisco, Editing by Braden Reddall and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment and Yahoo
representatives were not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No final dollar value has been put on the table for Yahoo's
search business because any amount would be tied to how
revenue-sharing and other deal terms are structured, said the

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is interested in moving further into unconventional natural gas resources, the head of the company's natural gas business said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A top Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) executive said on Wednesday the company was on track to start up two liquefied natural gas regasfication terminals that will deliver gas to Europe this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc executives dismissed a 
search-advertising deal with Google due to antitrust concerns, 
one day before Microsoft Corp made its takeover offer earlier 
this year, according to court documents made public on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The position came to light in a complaint filed by 
attorneys representing two Michigan pension funds in a 
shareholder lawsuit that aims to revoke Yahoo takeover defenses 
and press the company to renew merger talks with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are focused on long-term value creation rather than 
short-term gains," said a Yahoo document prepared for Yahoo 
executives ahead of an "all hands" internal meeting on January 
30 -- the day before Microsoft made its merger offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bracing for employee questions over whether Yahoo should 
outsource its search-ad sales to Google, executives were 
prepared to argue that any short-term gains would derail 
Yahoo's long-term push to become a "must buy" for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Short-term analysis of the revenue potential of 
outsourcing monetization may not take into account the longer 
term impact on the competitive market if search becomes an 
effective monopoly," an excerpt from the company document said. 
Monetization refers to sales of search-related ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These comments appear to contrast with Yahoo's subsequent 
position when it announced on April 9 that it was conducting a 
test with rival Google, the market leader in Web search and 
related advertising, to rely on Google to sell its search ads.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TURNABOUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The turnabout was part of a strategy by Yahoo management to 
seek alternatives for its business instead of settling for 
Microsoft's cash-and-stock offer at $31 per share, which the 
company's board had rejected as undervaluing Yahoo's assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft challenged the possible Google-Yahoo tie-up as 
anti-competitive, citing Google's growing dominance of the Web 
search business and its even larger share of ad sales tied to 
Web search results. Government regulators also rushed to say 
they would investigate any Google-Yahoo partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Web search is increasingly strategic as most people find 
information on the Internet via such systems. Search-based 
advertising, because of its high degree of targeting, has 
become a great money spinner for Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo has acknowledged that a gap exists between what it 
makes running its own advertising alongside its search results 
and the improved payback it could see by using Google's 
ad-sales systems in conjunction with Yahoo's search operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We, in fact, have some understanding of what they (Google) 
could do for us and what we could do for them," Yahoo Chief 
Executive Jerry Yang told a conference last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Delaware Chancery Court judge ruled on Monday that 
excerpts from confidential Yahoo company documents could be 
made public in the investor suit after initially sealing some 
of the information in a filing made last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Yahoo statement said the company was disappointed at the 
judge's ruling to unseal Yahoo internal documents but said it 
would have little bearing on the outcome of the case. A company 
spokeswoman would not comment on papers revealed in the case.&lt;/p&gt;

increase.

member value through initiatives such as nationwide surcharge-free access," said

reimbursement strategy while satisfying a broader member need for surcharge-free

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS, June 4 (Reuters) - Nigeria's state oil firm and the
local arm of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) began work on Wednesday on
plans for a natural gas to liquid petroleum plant, a project the
country hopes will reduce its dependence on imported fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nigeria is the world's eighth biggest oil exporter but its
four state-owned refineries have frequent production problems,
largely due to mismanagement and vandalism, saddling it with an
annual fuel import bill of some $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With oil prices expected to continue hitting record highs,
those costs are likely to rise. International oil companies are
meanwhile using higher price assumptions for business planning,
making a greater range of project viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The project will use the latest technology to convert gas
to liquid for petrol and will significantly reduce the nation's
importation of petrol," Nigeria's Oil Minister Odein Ajumogobia
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is in line with government's aspiration to utilise the
nation's abundant natural gas resources," he said at a ceremony
launching two committees to oversee the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Chaplin, managing director of Exxon's subsidiary Mobil
Producing Nigeria, said the project will involve the building of
port facilities in the southeastern state of Akwa Ibom and said
Exxon was committed to being a "catalyst for development".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil said its chairman and chief executive, Rex
Tillerson, had discussed the project with Nigerian President
Umaru Yar'Adua during a visit in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said the project was still in the planning
stages and gave no details of a timeframe or production
potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For full Reuters Africa coverage and to have your say on the

&lt;p&gt;Nine Businesses to be Honored for Fighting Diseases
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been awarded the 2008
Malaria Award by the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria in recognition of the corporation's Africa
Health Initiative and its role in the battle against malaria.

   "The prospects for winning the fight against global epidemics are
stronger now than ever before," said Ambassador Richard Holbrooke,
president and chief executive officer of Global Business Coalition on
HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, a group of more than 220 companies that
leverage the private sector's reach and skills to keep epidemics on
the global agenda.

   "Business action is making a critical difference, and ExxonMobil
is showing the world what strategic private sector interventions
against malaria can achieve. We need many, many more to make their own
contribution."

   ExxonMobil is one of nine companies to be honored at an event in
New York on June 10 that will feature UN Secretary General Ban
Ki-moon; Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS; President Jorge
Sampaio, UN Special Envoy for Tuberculosis; Ray Chambers, UN special
envoy for malaria; Michel Kazatchkine, executive director of the
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, and many others.

   Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil
Corporation, said he was proud of the recognition by the Global
Business Coalition, but equally proud of the difference the
corporation's efforts are making in the fight against malaria.

   "In the eight years since we launched our African Health
Initiative, the way the world thinks about malaria has changed," said
Tillerson. "We understand through our employees in Africa what an
impact malaria has on peoples' lives and the community's economic
development. We are committed to winning the battle against malaria."

   The 2008 Malaria Award will be accepted on behalf of ExxonMobil by
Dr. Steven Phillips, ExxonMobil's medical director of global issues
and projects. Dr. Phillips serves on the board of Malaria No More, a
non-profit organization with the mission to end deaths due to malaria,
and Roll Back Malaria, a partnership launched in 1998 by the World
Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United
Nations Development Programme and the World Bank.

   ExxonMobil is the largest non-pharmaceutical corporate donor to
malaria research and development efforts and has committed more than
$130 million to organizations engaged in important community and
social development projects in Africa, which includes $50 million to
the fight against malaria through the company's Africa Health
Initiative.

   The Initiative was established in 2000 in support of the Abuja
Declaration on Roll Back Malaria in Africa and its goal to halve
malaria deaths by 2010. Since then, ExxonMobil has developed
on-the-ground public-private partnerships to fight malaria at the
community level, progress treatment and vaccine research and raise
awareness and international support.

   According to Roll Back Malaria, malaria is a life-threatening
disease caused by a parasite and transmitted to humans by mosquito
bite. With between 1 million and 3 million deaths annually and 3,000
children deaths daily, it remains one of the globe's leading
infectious killers. The majority of its victims are children under the
age of five and pregnant women.

   About Exxon Mobil Corporation

philanthropic arm of Exxon Mobil Corporation in the United States,
engage in a range of philanthropic activities that advance education,

&lt;p&gt;Lea Salonga Performs One Night Only at the Walt Disney Concert Hall on Friday, July 11, 2008

LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Tony Award Winner Lea Salonga has been captivating audiences
around the world, and now she will take the stage at the iconic Walt
Disney Concert Hall on Friday, July 11, 2008 at 8:30 p.m., for one
show only.

   Having created the role of the orphaned "Kim" in Miss Saigon and
brought to life the singing of the title role in Disney's Mulan
("Reflection") and Princess Jasmine in Disney's Aladdin - it's truly
"A Whole New World," for Salonga and her angelic voice.

   Salonga has captivated audiences the world over - playing packed
houses from Carnegie Hall to Hong Kong's Opera Hall and has become the
treasure of her Philippine homeland.

   In this, her final North American 2008 show, Salonga will perform
in Walt Disney's prestigious namesake theatre. Thereafter she will
embark on her Asian tour of Roger's and Hammerstein's "Cinderella" in
the starring role.

   Salonga has been singing since the age of ten when she made her
theatrical debut in the King and I. and has gone on to release three
studio albums. She began an illustrious career in Broadway musicals
when she was cast to play Kim in Miss Saigon after a world-wide talent
search. Additional Credits Include Les Miserables, My Fair Lady,
Grease, The Sound of Music and Annie among many others.

   Earlier this year, Lea was presented the Order of Lakandula, rank
of Kumandante (Commander), by the President of the Philippines. This
is the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a Filipino civilian.

   In the field of musical theater, she is recognized for having won
the Olivier, Tony, Drama Desk, Outer Critics, and Theatre World
Awards, and the first to win various international awards for a single
role. She was also the first Asian to play Eponine in the musical Les
Miserables on Broadway.

   Tickets are priced at $115.00/ 95.00/ 75.00/ 60.00/ 45.00/ 30.00
and will be available at the Walt Disney Concert Hall Box office,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is returning to PBS 
as a national sponsor, renewing its financial relationship with 
the public television broadcaster four years after it ended its 
backing of "Masterpiece Theatre."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded company, 
will partially underwrite the news program "Nightly Business 
Report" and the science series "NOVA" starting June 9, PBS said 
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until Exxon stopped sponsoring "Masterpiece Theatre" in 
2004, the oil company had doled out more than $250 million to 
sponsor the PBS Sunday drama series over more than 30 years. 
This time around, Exxon Mobil will sponsor two shows with 
closer ties to business and science for PBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sponsorship deals come at a time when Exxon is taking 
in big earnings -- and scrutiny from politicians and consumer 
groups -- from sky-high oil prices. In the first quarter alone, 
it reported a profit of nearly $11 billion, the second-highest 
for any company in U.S history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are very pleased that ExxonMobil will sponsor 'NOVA' 
and 'Nightly Business Report,' both of which play significant 
roles in the discussion of the most important topics in science 
and commerce," PBS Chief Executive Paula Kerger said in a 
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PBS counts heavily on corporate underwriting to fund its 
programs, and the loss or addition of a big sponsor can quickly 
change the fortunes for individual programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One well-known PBS show, "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer," is 
under pressure since losing a key backer last summer when 
Archer Daniels Midland ended its 14-year sponsorship of the 
show. Only part of that money has been replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the U.S. economic downturn, there are concerns across 
the TV industry that advertising dollars may dry up as 
corporations trim budgets and look to other media, like the 
web, to promote their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while PBS still wins sponsorship from corporations 
interested in supporting the arts, philanthropy, too, is 
competitive, and signing longer-term TV sponsorship deals has 
fallen out of favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's sponsorship deals calls for it to support both 
programs through the end of the year, with a renewal option. 
Financial terms were not released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "NOVA" is produced by WGBH in Boston, while "Nightly 
Business Report" is produced by WPBT in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sciona Announces Creation of New Software Platform Utilizing Microsoft's Latest Tools For the Science of Personal Genetics

BOULDER, Colo.--(Business Wire)--
Sciona, Inc. (www.mycellf.com), a pioneer in the science of
Personal Genetics for lifestyle and nutritional guidance, today
announced its collaboration with the NTUA (National Technical
University of Athens) to develop a new software platform named RE2,
using Microsoft's latest application platform and development tools.
RE2 marries state-of-the-art technology with the burgeoning science of
Personal Genetics, and expands exponentially the possibilities of the
software applications.

   "This project is a prime example of the value of software in the
Personal Genetics industry," said Patrick Malone of Microsoft Hellas
(Greece). "The teams from NTUA and Sciona skillfully combined our
latest technologies, including Visual Studio 2008, .NET Framework 3.5
and the soon-to-be-released SQL Server 2008, to create a very
scalable, customizable and secure software platform. Working with the
new Microsoft Office document format, Open XML, they managed to
present the processed results in a human-readable and understandable
way, giving clear and actionable advice to their customers, based on
their genetic profile."

   Professor Dimitris Koutsouris, Director of Biomedical Engineering
Laboratory of NTUA, said: "For the NTUA, the biggest reward is to
witness Sciona's scientists using our system, converting the
accumulated knowledge in genetic research into comprehensive
personalized advice for the individuals. This project is an example of
Biomedical Engineering Science fulfilling its goals."

   "Our laboratory has been using Microsoft's tools and technologies
for some years now, mainly because it provides us the best underlying
layer of software infrastructure to build applications of the highest
standards in a number of different critical aspects of today's
software: security, scalability, connectivity, usability, performance.
Microsoft has helped us to embrace its latest technologies, and we are
very proud that our work for this project was presented as a use case
in its latest 2008 launch event," said Professor Koutsouris.

   President and CEO of Sciona Peter Vitulli said, "The development
of RE2 is truly a milestone. It increases the functionality of our
proprietary Sciona Genostic Rules Engine to an extent never before
possible, opening the way to greater integration of nutritional,
biological and genetic information. Truly groundbreaking, it enriches
the input parameters of Sciona's Lifestyle Questionnaire, giving rise
to a greatly expanded range of biomedical and biophysical data that
can now be input into our recommendations to individuals (e.g.
cholesterol levels, blood pressure etc), making them infinitely more
effective and useful in making lifestyle decisions. In addition, we
will be able to easily add new genes and information to the RE2 logic
as the rapidly evolving scientific developments in gene research
occur."

   mycellf(TM) DNA Personalized Genetics Analysis Kits

   The mycellf(TM) DNA Personalized Genetics Analysis Kits assist in
structuring optimal nutritional and fitness programs to achieve
overall wellness. By allowing individuals to specifically address
factors unique to them based on their personal genetic makeup, it
offers new insights into how their genetic makeup affects metabolism,
diet, nutritional processing and lifestyle. According to Vitulli, RE2
will increase both the breadth and the overall accuracy of such
recommendations to individuals, leading to greater health and
well-being.

   mycellf(TM) DNA Personalized Genetics Analysis Kits instruct
individuals in using a special cotton swab to collect cells from the
inside of the cheek. The individual then completes a lifestyle
questionnaire about his or her diet and exercise habits. The swab and
completed questionnaire are sent to Sciona, where the individual's DNA
is analyzed on the basis of 27 specific genes which have been proven
in numerous studies to respond to changes in nutrition, diet, exercise
and lifestyle. The outcome is a completely personalized Action Plan
for the individual.

   The sophisticated, confidential mycellf(TM) DNA Personalized
Genetics analysis will now enjoy greatly enhanced functionality thanks
to the RE2 software platform, the collaborative brainchild of Sciona,
the Biomedical Engineering Laboratory of NTUA (National Technical
University of Athens), and Microsoft's state-of-the-art technology and
software tools.

   Dr. Rosalynn Gill, Chief Science Officer and Co-Founder of Sciona
commented, "Software is critical to our business because there are
literally an infinite number of possible combinations of DNA and
lifestyle questionnaire results. A major challenge for our business
has been to identify the right software solutions that would allow us
to grow with the science, so that as the science identifies more genes
and more relevant information, we can produce more genetically
personalized solutions. The RE2 software allows us to meet that
challenge in a way never before possible, with hugely beneficial
ramifications for consumers, namely a leading-edge scientific tool to
assist individuals seeking optimal health in reaching their goals more
effectively."

&lt;p&gt;OEM Agreement Unites XMetaL With WebSphere Information Integrator
   Content Edition; Allows XMetaL to Work With Virtually Any Content
                              Repository
THE HAGUE, Netherlands &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JustSystems, the largest independent software vendor in Japan and
a worldwide leader in XML and information management technologies,
today announced an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) agreement
with IBM to bring XML and component-based authoring to the enterprise.

   Under the terms of the agreement, JustSystems will embed and
resell IBM WebSphere Information Integrator Content Edition (IICE)
with its new XMetaL for ECM offering, which was announced today (see
"JustSystems Announces XMetaL Integrated Authoring Solution with
Support for 20+ Commercial Repositories" press release).

   By combining XMetaL with IICE, XMetaL becomes the only structured
authoring application that seamlessly connects to more than 20
commercial repositories and file systems. The integration of XMetaL
with WebSphere IICE will allow organizations to broaden XMetaL
deployments and to leverage the repositories they're currently using
to store and manage content.

   "Organizations are looking to broaden deployments of structured
authoring beyond traditional tech pubs to take advantage of the speed,
cost, quality, and reuse advantages it provides," said Jake Sorofman,
senior vice president of marketing and business development for
JustSystems. "This agreement allows us to deliver more value to
customers who want to deploy XMetaL more broadly, in conjunction with
the variety of enterprise repositories they're currently using."

   "The combination of XMetaL and IICE will allow customers to easily
and cost-effectively create, store and manage content across a wide
range of content management systems they currently have," said Rob
Thomas, vice president, IBM Information Management. "Through our
expanded relationship and collaboration with JustSystems, we can help
clients improve their ability to use information as a competitive
business asset."

   XMetaL on IICE

   XMetaL is JustSystems' market-leading structured authoring
application. XMetaL lets organizations dramatically improve the
quality and consistency of product and technical documentation,
policies, procedures and other published content, while improving
reuse and reducing the time and cost of creation, localization and
maintenance.

   Combining IBM WebSphere IICE, XMetaL for ECM will enable
organizations to pursue a content reuse and single-source publishing
strategy using the repositories they already have, without the cost
and complexity of creating and maintaining custom integrations.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, Jun 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 BLUEROADS, a leading provider of Partner Opportunity Management (POM)
solutions,
has signed a strategic partnership agreement with Microsoft Corp. to provide a
seamlessly integrated opportunity and marketing management solution to companies
who
rely on sophisticated, multi-tier sales channels. The solution will enable
enterprises and their channel partners to drive, track and manage referrals,
leads and opportunities from first interaction to revenue and beyond across
all sales touch points. The solution will also enable cross-channel sales teams
to collaborate and more effectively team on opportunities. The expected
results include increased revenue, improved sales forecast visibility and
accuracy, enhanced tracking and measurement of marketing investments, and lower
total
cost of ownership.

    A Powerful Combination

    "As a leader in partner management solutions, BLUEROADS plays a critical
role in
helping companies and their channel partners grow their revenues and improve
sales
predictability," said Brad Wilson, general manager of Microsoft Dynamics
CRM. "By combining the power of BLUEROADS with the Microsoft Dynamics CRM
product, we will be able to offer one of the most advanced and comprehensive
solutions for companies needing to manage both marketing and sales processes
within, outside and across their entire organization."

    The new integrated solution from Microsoft Dynamics CRM and BLUEROADS will
enable customers to:


--  Align each lead or opportunity with the best fit sales resource(s)
    across both direct and indirect channels. The "best fit" sales resource
    criteria can be based on a number of items, including historical success,
    account profile, pre-existing relationships, industry, expertise and
    location. The result is accelerated sales cycles, increased conversion
    rates and reduced channel conflict.

--  Effectively drive opportunities from first interaction to cash with
    contextual sales tips and sales cycle guidance. The combined solution will
    deliver sales tips right into the context of the lead or opportunity at the
    moment of the selling interaction. The sales tips can include discovery
    call questions, product information, competitive information or information
    on the campaign the lead was generated from. The guided selling gives
    alerts to both the vendor and partner about progress of the lead or
    opportunity which enables the vendor and partner sales teams to identify
    issues in the sales cycle for an opportunity and apply resources to move
    the opportunity along. The result is accelerated sales cycles and increased
    conversion rates.

--  Establish a seamless, unified team focused on driving revenue by
    enabling direct and indirect sales reps to work on deals collaboratively as
    appropriate. Vendors and partners (or partners and other partners) can team
    up on the same opportunity, make opportunity updates, share documents and
    sales tips into the opportunity, provide deal guidance throughout the
    lifecycle, establish individual sales rep incentives, and jointly target
    and market to specific opportunities.

--  Enhance opportunity tracking and measurement through a real-time,
    cross-channel view of total forecast down to the sales rep level that
    allows tracking of opportunity pipeline and marketing campaign performance
    across both direct and indirect teams.

--  Increase lead performance by ensuring that the right lead gets to the
    right sales rep in real time. The combined solution will enable leads from
    any source including marketing campaigns, influencer referrals, web site,
    conferences and inside sales to be delivered to the sales rep with the
    highest likelihood of winning the deal. The solution also includes sales
    tips, guided selling and alerts to ensure that the leads move through the
    lead and opportunity pipeline and turn into cash at the highest possible
    rate. If a lead isn't acted on in a pre-defined manner at any stage of the
    lead to cash cycle, both vendor and partner are alerted for escalated
    action.

--  Improve marketing campaign performance by ensuring that all leads are
    delivered into a closed-loop tracking and management solution. The combined
    solution will give unified visibility across all sales reps on lead
    conversion through the lead and opportunity funnel to clearly understand
    critical metrics such as which marketing investments have the highest
    performance and which reps are moving leads through each stage to cash most
    effectively.

--  Surface more opportunities by leveraging your broad partner and
    influencer base through closed-loop lead referral. The combined solution
    will enable a broad partner and influencer base to refer a lead and be
    compensated for their participation or role in the ultimate opportunity.
    The solution enables compensation at any stage of the lead to opportunity
    cycle and any form of compensation, including currency, points, percentage,
    etc. The referring partner can also audit the progress of their referred
    lead all the way to payment or rejection. The lead is put into the standard
    lead pipeline and will be routed to the direct or indirect sales rep most
    likely to win the opportunity.

--  Effectively use and improve processes by employing consolidated
    workflow rules and data structures that allow for flexible and powerful
    sales processes to be built across both Microsoft Dynamics CRM and
    BLUEROADS. Companies can optimize their incentive and compensation
    management policies to reward the right behaviors, as well as the Lead-to-
    Cash workflow process (including quote and order management).
    

    
"Forming a strategic partnership with Microsoft Corporation is the
logicalnext step in our overall strategy to provide the most comprehensive
channelmanagement solution on the market," said Shinya Akamine, CEO at
BLUEROADS.
"Microsoft is undeniably one of the most recognized and influential companies in
the
world, and their Microsoft Dynamics CRM product is perfectly suited to
complement BLUEROADS' partner opportunity management solution. We view our
integrated solution as a way for customers to rapidly deploy channel industry
best practices while taking advantage of the Microsoft technologies and
Dynamics platform that they trust and rely on."

&lt;p&gt;Software Solutions Company Wins Windows Embedded Partner
   Excellence Awards in System Integrator and Distributor Categories
BELLEVUE, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
BSQUARE Corporation (Nasdaq: BSQR), a leading software solutions
provider to the global embedded device community, was recognized with
two prestigious awards last night at the Microsoft TechEd Tradeshow.
Microsoft presented BSQUARE with Windows Embedded Partner Excellence
Awards in both the System Integrator and Distributor categories,
making BSQUARE the only company to receive both awards in the same
year -- a feat it has achieved twice now.

   "BSQUARE's Windows Embedded CE expertise and strong reputation as
a leading systems integration company make them highly deserving of
these two awards," said Kevin Hawkins, OMAP35x marketing manager,
Texas Instruments (TI). "Their added experience with OMAP(TM) based
development platforms helps customers develop high performance,
multimedia-rich embedded devices easily and quickly."

   "It's an honor to be recognized by Microsoft for our system
integration and distribution capabilities," said Brian Crowley,
president and CEO of BSQUARE. "We have developed world-class expertise
in Microsoft Embedded Operating Systems. With this expertise we can
create an entire device for a customer, or take on portions of the
device that demand deep expertise and understanding, such as power
management, high-performance multimedia, audio management and radio
interface design. We strive to offer our customers a complete range of
BSQUARE products and services as well as Microsoft Embedded licenses.
Our goal is to have valuable offerings for our customers in each phase
of their device design cycle. These Microsoft awards demonstrate the
progress we have made working steadily over the last few years to
improve the depth and breadth of our offerings."

   Leading System Integrator

   In presenting BSQUARE with a Windows Embedded Excellence Award for
system integration, Microsoft commended the company for its leadership
role in providing a broad range of engineering services for a wide
assortment of Windows Embedded CE and Windows XP Embedded devices,
ranging from secure, mobile devices to complex connected medical
devices to point-of-sale solutions. In 2007 alone, BSQUARE
successfully completed over 200 engineering service engagements for
such well-known companies as Motorola, Qualcomm, and Palm. BSQUARE
also maintains strategic relationships with leading silicon
manufacturers, including Freescale(TM) Semiconductor, Intel(R),
Marvell(R), and Texas Instruments, enabling it to offer
silicon-specific development tools -- such as the BSQUARE's DevKit
development platforms for both the Marvell PXA 27x/3xx and Texas
Instruments OMAP 25x/35x Application Processor families -- that help
its OEM customers get their products to market faster.

   Top Distributor

   In awarding BSQUARE a Windows Embedded Excellence Award for its
role as a distributor, Microsoft observed that the company has
continued to raise the bar in providing customers with world-class
professional services and logistics capabilities. The company's
success as a distributor is evident from its 2007 results, which
showed double-digit growth in toolkit sales, OEM pre-installation kit
(OPK) sales, and operating system license sales.

   "We congratulate BSQUARE on winning Microsoft Embedded Excellence
Awards in both the System Integrator and Distributor categories," said
Anne Bonaparte, president and CEO, Solidcore. "This exceptional
achievement and recognition further validates our selection of BSQUARE
as a primary distributor of Solidcore's security and change control

&lt;p&gt;Intermec Selects IBM Cognos 8 Controller for Financial Consolidation &amp; Corporate Reporting

        IBM Cognos 8 Controller improves closing efficiency and
  centralizes financial reporting for leading global supply chain and
                        technology manufacturer
THE HAGUE, Netherlands--(Business Wire)--
Cognos, an IBM company, and the world leader in business
intelligence and performance management solutions, today announced
that Intermec has selected IBM Cognos 8 Controller to automate and
manage its financial consolidation and corporate reporting processes.
A developer and manufacturer of technologies that identify, track, and
manage supply chain assets, Intermec is using IBM Cognos 8 Controller
to consolidate, certify and report on financial data from its 25
subsidiaries.

   Intermec's core technologies include RFID, mobile computing and
data collection systems, bar code printers and label media. Intermec
serves thousands of companies worldwide, including 75% of Fortune 500
companies and 60% of the Fortune 100. The organization wanted to
improve the financial reporting process by using a centralized
consolidation and reporting system. Having already used automated
consolidation systems, the finance department was looking to replace
the legacy system and update its solution so that all subsidiaries
could contribute to the close process.

   The organization wanted to revolutionize the process by
centralizing control and management, while providing distributed
access over the web and ensuring contribution to a single set of
numbers. Historically, the consolidation process consisted of the
automated collection of distributed databases which rendered the
process time consuming and error prone. The selection of a web based
solution allows many more users to contribute quickly to a central set
of numbers.

   "With Cognos 8 Controller in place we now have a greater number of
individuals with more timely and complete access to performance
reports," said Gary Evans, Sr. Manager, Finance, Intermec. "These are
important benefits because while we've centralized all the data
collection and control, we've been able to decentralize the reporting.
The intuitive interface of the report writer gives every user the
capability to write management reports, saving us time and allowing us
to focus on our close process. In addition, SOX requirements which
call for robust passwords and security restrictions are all met via
the software's built-in role-based security controls."

   Organizations are looking to improve their closing process made
difficult by business changes, new SOX, IFRS, and local compliance
requirements and disparate data and systems. IBM Cognos 8 Controller
delivers a single, secure, and robust financial consolidation solution
eliminating manual activities on the financial close each month and
the risk of error and misstatement associated with spreadsheets IBM
Cognos 8 Controller automates and structures the entire financial
consolidation process, provides centralized control and collection of
data, supports the improvement of the internal controls environment
and ensures delivery of certified and auditable financial performance
information for internal and external reporting. Customers get a
transparent, accurate and timely enterprise view of financial
performance.

   "With IBM Cognos 8 Controller, Intermec has an automated process
with built-in financial consolidation capabilities and controls for
reliable and timely corporate reporting," said Doug Barton,
vice-president, product marketing, Cognos. "In the face of the
fast-changing business environment and regulatory scrutiny, this
finance-owned application compresses the time for finance to close the
books and eliminates the risks associated with more manual processes,
spreadsheets and legacy systems, thus enabling business stakeholders
to speed decisions and report with confidence."

   Given its successful IBM Cognos 8 Controller implementation,
Intermec is preparing to deploy a complete performance management
solution by adding more Controller licenses to the 45 active users in
place, and by integrating with IBM Cognos BI and Planning solutions in
the coming months.

   Cognos performance management solutions provide a single line of
sight across all time horizons. Planning and consolidation combine the
forward management view of the business (planning, budgeting and
forecasting) with the current and historical view of the business
(consolidations, reporting, and financial analytics.) This integrated
operational and financial view lets customers proactively address
business challenges and opportunities for greater operational
effectiveness.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 4 (Reuters) - European banks will likely take further
mark-to-market writedowns of 9.5 billion euros for the rest of
the year, according to J.P. Morgan Securities, which now
expects total writedowns for 2007 and 2008 to be higher at
about 30.6 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which previously saw writedowns for 2007 and
2008 totaling 24.9 billion euros, said the estimate change was
mainly due to writedowns on monoline counterparty exposures
that have risen by 4.8 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan estimates that Germany's Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE)
will need to take additional write-downs of 3.6 billion euros
while Swiss bank Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) will have to take
write downs of 2.1 billion Swiss francs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) will need to
further write-downs of 1.8 billion euros while Natixis SA
(CNAT.PA) will need to record writedowns of 1.4 billion euros
more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan, however, said the worst of the markdowns appear
to have been taken, adding that capital remained scarce in the
banking industry and that it saw ongoing pressure to
de-leverage driven by credit investors, rating agencies, and
local regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan maintained its "neutral" view on the European
wholesale and investment banks sector.

&lt;p&gt;  THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS, Jun 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that online retailer Findel Direct, a
division of Findel Plc., has selected IBM to create a single source of master
data on all of its products.  The aim of the project is to enhance Findel
Direct's ability to focus on customers and customer service.

    Following the acquisition of several online businesses and brands, Findel
Direct
needed to consolidate its e-commerce, merchandising and supply chain systems
into a centralized application architecture.

    Through this project, Findel expects to enhance its merchandising
capabilities, speed
new product introduction, plan and forecast more accurately, improve promotion
planning and pricing, and to gain increased visibility and collaboration across
its
supply chain.

    IBM's WebSphere Product Center software will serve as Findel Direct's core
product information management infrastructure, underpinning both the newly
acquired business' product information requirements, as well as the
group'shome shopping operations in the future.  Using this software, Findel
Directwill be able to provide a single version of product information across the
enterprise and to all its customer touch points.

    "Findel Direct is committed to providing its customers with great products
combined with excellent service," said Tim Broughton, IT director for Findel
Direct. "With such a diverse set of brands we needed a master data management
solution which was capable of delivering the flexibility that our business
needs for both short term consolidation and as a platform to support organic
business growth. With WebSphere Product Center, we will have a much better
handle on product information, consistent processes across multiple business
units,
a better understanding of what our customers want, and the ability to respond
quickly and effectively to their needs."

    "In an age when richer information is increasingly driving consumers'
shopping
decisions, providing the right products and services together with the right
information is critical," said Jeff Paul, vice president, Software Group, IBM
UK,
Ireland and South Africa. "Visionary on-line retailers like Findel Direct are
using IBM's master data management technology and linking their supply chains,
merchandising and on-line commerce systems to anticipate and better serve their
customers. This is the key to achieving a long term competitive advantage in
the marketplace."

    As part of the planned infrastructure, Findel Direct will also be using
IBM's
WebSphere Commerce, Tivoli and DB2 technologies.

&lt;p&gt;NEW BRUNSWICK, New Jersey (Reuters) - Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N) said on Thursday it expects its $16.6 billion acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Health to break even or increase earnings modestly by 2009, a year earlier than previously expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colleen Goggins, worldwide chairwoman of JJ's Consumer Group, speaking to analysts at a company meeting focusing on medical device, diagnostic and consumer businesses, said the integration of Pfizer Consumer Health is expected to result in cost savings of $500 million to $600 million in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of the Pfizer unit, which closed in late 2006, brought JJ big brand names, which Goggins said JJ can expand using its extensive global infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the brands include Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette stop-smoking chewing gum, and over-the-counter allergy medication Zyrtec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it has aggressively expanded its Listerine product line, which had double-digit growth last year and in the first quarter. Extensions of the Listerine line, for instance, include Listerine Whitening Quick Dissolving Strips and Listerine Smart Rinse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's impressive that we've seen this kind of growth in Listerine's 127th year," said Marc Robinson, company group chairman of Consumer Healthcare, OTC  Nutritionals. "It's testimony to the brand and benefits from the infrastructure and talent of JJ."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goggins said the company is still looking at possible acquisitions, albeit not on the scale of Pfizer Consumer Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still have an appetite for acquisitions," Goggins said. "That being said, the PCH acquisition is really big and really complex and we've been really consumed with integrating it. I don't think we've got the appetite to do anything the size of PCH anytime soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretax operating profit was 15.8 percent of sales in its consumer division, which generated $14.5 billion in sales in 2007. Profit margins were held back because of the acquisition, JJ Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been competitive and expect to be more competitive in the future," he said, referring to its consumer business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, JJ said it plans to file in 2010 for U.S. approval of Cypher Elite, an improved version of its Cypher drug-eluting stent already on the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said it will seek European and U.S. approvals for its Nevo Sirolimus-eluting heart stent in 2009 and 2011, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have begun clinical trials on Nevo," said Caruso, noting that it is using Sirolimus, which is the drug used on its existing stent, Cypher, on the stent platform it acquired when it bought Conor Medsystems last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's also a redesign of the stent itself," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JJ, whose stent sales fell some 34 percent in 2007, projected only 1 percent compound annual growth for all drug-eluting stents worldwide between 2007 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said the total market for these devices, which prop open diseased arteries and deliver medication to keep them clear, will be $4 billion by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past several years, JJ and Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) had the only U.S. approved drug-eluting stents, but concerns about safety have tempered their use recently. In addition, there's more competition from other manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seth Fischer, Group Chairman, Worldwide Franchise Chairman at Cordis, JJ cardiovascular products business, said the use of drug-eluting stents versus conventional bare metal stents has stabilized around 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not see a return to the near 90 percent seen earlier this decade, but we believe we can drive share growth despite new competition," Fischer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Conor's reservoir stent technology, the company can use more than a single drug on a stent, including antiplatelet agents to mitigate the risk of developing blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe it has the potential to become a market disrupter," said Cordis Chief Technology Officer Dr. Campbell Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fischer said Cordis plans to capitalize on opportunities outside the United States and diversify so that it is not so reliant on stent sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has not been an easy time for Cordis as of late," he said referring the softening stent market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the total worldwide market for all cardiovascular products is expected to swell to $36 billion by 2012, making it the largest market in the medical device sector. In 2007, the market was $26 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Asset Management, looks for single-digit sales growth from the whole company for the foreseeable future, with the medical device, diagnostic and consumer units making solid contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He forecast high single-digit earnings in 2008 and 2009, held back somewhat by expected generic competition later this month for its blockbuster schizophrenia drug Risperdal and generic competition next year for its epilepsy drug Topamax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's meeting, Jonas said, "reassures me that you will get a solid return from JJ."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of JJ were up 32 cents at $66.87 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Debra Sherman in Chicago; editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from company and investor, details, byline,
updates stock)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., June 5 (Reuters) - Johnson  Johnson
(JNJ.N) said on Thursday it expects its $16.6 billion
acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Health to break even or increase
earnings modestly by 2009, a year earlier than previously
expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colleen Goggins, worldwide chairwoman of JJ's Consumer
Group, speaking to analysts at a company meeting focusing on
medical device, diagnostic and consumer businesses, said the
integration of Pfizer Consumer Health is expected to result in
cost savings of $500 million to $600 million in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition of the Pfizer unit, which closed in late
2006, brought JJ big brand names, which Goggins said JJ can
expand using its extensive global infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the brands include Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette
stop-smoking chewing gum, and over-the-counter allergy
medication Zyrtec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it has aggressively expanded its Listerine
product line, which had double-digit growth last year and in
the first quarter. Extensions of the Listerine line, for
instance, include Listerine Whitening Quick Dissolving Strips
and Listerine Smart Rinse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's impressive that we've seen this kind of growth in
Listerine's 127th year," said Marc Robinson, company group
chairman of Consumer Healthcare, OTC  Nutritionals. "It's
testimony to the brand and benefits from the infrastructure and
talent of JJ."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Goggins said the company is still looking at possible
acquisitions, albeit not on the scale of Pfizer Consumer
Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We still have an appetite for acquisitions," Goggins said.
"That being said, the PCH acquisition is really big and really
complex and we've been really consumed with integrating it. I
don't think we've got the appetite to do anything the size of
PCH anytime soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pretax operating profit was 15.8 percent of sales in its
consumer division, which generated $14.5 billion in sales in
2007. Profit margins were held back because of the acquisition,
JJ Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have been competitive and expect to be more competitive
in the future," he said, referring to its consumer business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, JJ said it plans to file in 2010 for U.S.
approval of Cypher Elite, an improved version of its Cypher
drug-eluting stent already on the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said it will seek European and U.S. approvals for its
Nevo Sirolimus-eluting heart stent in 2009 and 2011,
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have begun clinical trials on Nevo," said Caruso,
noting that it is using Sirolimus, which is the drug used on
its existing stent, Cypher, on the stent platform it acquired
when it bought Conor Medsystems last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's also a redesign of the stent itself," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JJ, whose stent sales fell some 34 percent in 2007,
projected only 1 percent compound annual growth for all
drug-eluting stents worldwide between 2007 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said the total market for these devices, which
prop open diseased arteries and deliver medication to keep them
clear, will be $4 billion by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the past several years, JJ and Boston Scientific Corp
(BSX.N) had the only U.S. approved drug-eluting stents, but
concerns about safety have tempered their use recently. In
addition, there's more competition from other manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seth Fischer, Group Chairman, Worldwide Franchise Chairman
at Cordis, JJ cardiovascular products business, said the use
of drug-eluting stents versus conventional bare metal stents
has stabilized around 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not see a return to the near 90 percent seen earlier
this decade, but we believe we can drive share growth despite
new competition," Fischer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Using Conor's reservoir stent technology, the company can
use more than a single drug on a stent, including antiplatelet
agents to mitigate the risk of developing blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe it has the potential to become a market
disrupter," said Cordis Chief Technology Officer Dr. Campbell
Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fischer said Cordis plans to capitalize on opportunities
outside the United States and diversify so that it is not so
reliant on stent sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It has not been an easy time for Cordis as of late," he
said referring the softening stent market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the total worldwide market for all cardiovascular
products is expected to swell to $36 billion by 2012, making it
the largest market in the medical device sector. In 2007, the
market was $26 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Asset

held back somewhat by expected generic competition later this
month for its blockbuster schizophrenia drug Risperdal and
generic competition next year for its epilepsy drug Topamax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thursday's meeting, Jonas said, "reassures me that you will
get a solid return from JJ."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of JJ were up 32 cents at $66.87 in afternoon New

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Thursday turned up public relations efforts to defend its drug to help smokers quit after a recent report said there have been hundreds of problems with patients taking Chantix since its 2006 approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest drug maker, which is counting on robust Chantix sales to spur growth and help right its foundering share price, defended the product's safety and effectiveness at a panel discussion for reporters with its medical and safety officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph Feczko, Pfizer's chief medical officer, said more than 90 percent of the reported adverse events that created the wave of fresh negative publicity last month was old news that Pfizer had already shared with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, FDA officials said last week they were taking a closer look at Chantix following the report released by the nonprofit Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) and Wake Forest University that included incidents of heart problems, blurred vision, dizziness and loss of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chantix, known chemically as varenicline, had previously been liked to reports of depression, suicidal thoughts, strange dreams and other psychological effects. The ISMP report added to a cloud already hanging over the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gretchen Dieck, Pfizer's head of safety and risk management, attempted to throw some cold water on the ISMP report, saying it had not been peer reviewed or published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that you can't tell by numbers of reported incidents whether they represent a true safety signal. Dieck noted that jumps of reports of problems tend to coincide with increased media reporting of adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to carefully controlled clinical trials, the company insisted it was very difficult to determine from anecdotal reports whether a problem is caused by the drug, symptoms of nicotine withdrawal or unrelated health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nicotine is a very powerful addiction," said Ponni Subbiah, vice president of Pfizer Medical and head of the Chantix team. "We don't know what is causing what, but the withdrawal phenomenon is important to bear in mind and it is something we're going to have to do more research on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trial data often fails to mirror the effect of a medicine once it is in wide use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Gonzales, co-director of Oregon Health  Science University's Smoking Cessation Center who led pivotal studies of Chantix, noted that "patients in the trials are not terribly reflective of the population of smokers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gonazales, who attended the discussion but was not part of the Pfizer panel, said smokers with a host of mental and physical health problems are excluded from placebo controlled trials due to fears of exacerbating their conditions but exist in large numbers in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it does not believe the Chantix label needs stronger safety warnings. Analysts have said sales would be hard hit if the FDA adds a stronger black box warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We strongly believe that the current label really reflects what is the current evidence with regards to the safety and efficacy profile of the product," Dieck said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which halted direct-to-consumer Chantix advertising in January, resumed an ad campaign this month that does not mention the drug by name but urges smokers trying to quit to seek information from their doctors. It has not yet decided when it will bring back ads for Chantix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, which had sales of $277 million in the first quarter, has already been used by 6 million people worldwide, 5 million of them in the United States, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chantix works by blocking the nicotine receptors in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the safety profile of this drug is particularly good," said Gonzales, who has conducted smoking cessation studies for 20 years on a variety of drugs, including many that were never approved for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said no more than 5 percent of people who attempt to quit smoking without drugs or nicotine replacements are successful. In trials, Chantix helped more than 40 percent of patients quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any of the (smoking cessation) drugs out there are substantially better than doing it on your own," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Today, IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced IBM Mashup Center will be hosted as a free
trial on the Web with which non-technical business people can use to experiment
and
build customized mashups following the success of early corporate adopters
Boeing
Corporation (NYSE: BA) and Carrefour Group (PARIS: CA).

    On schedule for mid-year delivery, the IBM Mashup Center allows business
people to
create situational applications, or  mashups, by remixing information from
anywhere to gain business insight and do their jobs smarter and more
effectively.
Using IBM's mashup technology, even non-technical users will be able to exploit
standards and Web-based technology to gain access to myriad information, such
as Web sites and feeds, spreadsheets, databases, applications, unstructured
textfrom an email, video, audio and other information on the Web, and make sense
of it all in minutes.

    In the coming weeks, IBM will offer customers the opportunity to
experimentwith IBM Mashup Center and gain hands on experience for free through
IBM
LotusGreenhouse. Lotus Greenhouse is a Web site where anyone can register and
try out
IBM Mashup Center, and many other collaborative products, such as IBM Lotus
Connections, Lotus Quickr, Lotus Sametime and WebSphere Portal. IBM Mashup
Center
will be hosted on Greenhouse, giving customers a safe environment to try
the technology and evaluate mashup potential without installing anything in
their
own environment. The hosted version of IBM Mashup Center will include
widgets from IBM, and a growing network of IBM Mashup Center Business
Partners, like StrikeIron and Kapow Technologies.

    This comes at a time in which innovative companies of every size are
beginning to realize the possibilities of Web 2.0, but require security,
management
and governance capabilities to responsibly take advantage of these
possibilities. IBM Mashup Center gives users the freedom to create new, light
weight applications on the fly and get customized views of disparate
information, but with the stability corporations require. IBM's deep history in
open standards, information integration and emerging Internet technologies, make
the company an undeniably strong partner in a new technology era.

    "As an established innovator, Boeing believes in the power of Web 2.0 and
embraces it not only for collaborative work, but also for the heavy
liftingof enterprise planning and execution," said Paul Comitz, Program Manager,
NEO
Demonstration, Boeing Corp. "The IBM Mashup Center is playing a key role in
our visionary approach to strategic asset management. It's critical to know
where
your major assets are and how to use them at any given time, situation or
condition."

    IBM Mashup Center breaks new ground in ease of use and speed at which
business
users can solve everyday business problems in any size enterprise. It includes
an
intuitive browser-based tool to easily assemble of new mashups, thus allowing
non-technical users -- anyone in a business -- to literally drag and drop mashup
components from personal, enterprise and Web sources to easily create, deploy
and
share customized Web applications in minutes.

    This upcoming offering includes a set of out-of-the-box, business-ready
widgets, as well
as a catalog for finding and sharing widgets and mashups. To create new widgets,
IBM Mashup Center includes an easy-to-use development environment to construct
new
widgets from enterprise systems and the Web. Users can also take advantage of
built-in Web 2.0 community features like ratings, tagging and commenting to
guide
users the to the most valuable and useful widgets.

    IBM Mashup Center also provides extensive and powerful capabilities for
managing information feeds from enterprise sources. Information from a
widevariety of sources can be mixed, filtered and mashed together to create
newinformation sources and output in many different forms, such as RSS, ATOM or
XML. With the ability to merge, transform, filter, annotate or publish
information in new formats, IBM Mashup Center helps create a single view
ofdisparate sets of information in a highly re-usable manner. Feeds are an
easy way to service-enable systems that do not natively provide RESTful
interfaces, and thus provide an on-ramp for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).

    France-based Carrefour is a multi-billion dollar retail company that
servesover two billion customers per year, and is now evaluating IBM Mashup
Center.
The company maintains more than 12,000 hypermarket and supermarket stores in
more
than 30 countries and offers a wide range of food and non-food products.

    "We are interested in the potential benefits of mashup software to help us
quickly create applications to solve a variety of business challenges. One
example is transporting food and other items to thousands of stores on time,
despite bad weather, custom delays, traffic jams and road closures. This new
type
software could help warn us of these problems before they happen, allowing us
to anticipate supply chain incidences and risk of product unavailability in
store," said Olivier Raynal, Innovation Manager, Carrefour Emerging Trend and
Innovation Division.

    As enterprise mashups continue to climb in popularity and deliver more value
for business, IBM is working with an ecosystem of Business Partners to help
customers get the most out of situational applications. IBM Business Partners
such as Jibes, JustSystems, Kapow Technologies and StrikeIron are introducing
solutions that, when combined with IBM Mashup Center, enable rapid access to
information and new and compelling uses for new types of data.

    For example, IBM Mashup Center users can easily connect to data in the
StrikeIron Web Services Marketplace to reduce the complexity for
developersor business users who want to integrate live data from a number of
sources.In addition, by connecting to StrikeIron's Lite services, users can
create demos
to show how easily live data can be integrated with a mashup to create
powerful Web applications without having to register or purchase the service.

    "Enterprise mashups are emerging as one of the most important
opportunitiescompanies will seize over the next few years," said Bob Brauer,
president and
founder, StrikeIron. "StrikeIron's focus on delivering a broad range of
rich, enterprise-class data in the form of XML Web services, and IBM's
expertise in providing the infrastructure for enterprise-class mashups, together
provide key components of a company's mashup strategy."

    Jibes demonstrates the business value of mashups in the enterprise market by
providing industry-specific information fabrics for the semi-conductor, airline
and media
industries on top of IBM Mashup Center. JustSystems provides a rich presentation
layer for information accessed by IBM Mashup Center, allowing users to interact
with dynamic, or living, documents that combine static and dynamic
information. Together, this enables new uses for enterprise mashups such as
the sharing of design and development information across collaborative research,
or
for use by development teams for reconciling supply and demand among trading
partners.

    Kapow Technologies provides solutions that allow IBM Mashup Center users
tounlock the unstructured data of the public and private Web for use in
theirmashups. Currently, there are less than 1,000 publicly available
application
programming interfaces, or APIs, compared to more than 165 million registered
Web sites for potential access. Using the Kapow Mashup Server, companies can
obtain access to unstructured data and sites without a public API, then extract
and transform it instantly into a Web service or feed that can be used in
IBM Mashup Center.

    "A massive number of people have the skills to assemble widgets into very
useful business applications but do not have the time or desire to become
programmers," said Larry Bowden, Vice President, Portals and Mashups, IBM
Software Group. "IBM Mashup Center is designed for the majority of
businessusers to create situational applications immediately to fill a need --
iterate and innovate as they desire, share mashups with others and be
empowered, all while letting IT managers sleep at night, knowing the
technology is secure and managed at the enterprise level."

    An on-premise version of IBM Mashup Center is expected to be delivered
mid-year,
and pricing details will be made public at that time.

&lt;p&gt;June 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street investment banks are likely
to disclose Tier 1 capital ratios for the first time when they
report quarterly earnings in two weeks, a new metric that is
likely to put Goldman Sachs (GS.N) at the top of the industry,
influential analyst Meredith Whitney said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Whitney, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co, does not expect
any of the firms to be under-capitalized. She sees their Tier 1
capital ratios in a range of 8 percent to 11 percent, placing
Merrill Lynch MER.N at the bottom of the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst believes the brokers are broadly overvalued and
disclosure of the ratios could provide investors additional
insight into their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In sum, with these new disclosures, capital will once
again be at the forefront of investors' minds over the next six
weeks," said Whitney, who shot to prominence last year after
pointing to Citigroup's (C.N) deepening credit losses and
correctly predicting it would cut its dividend and go on a
capital-raising spree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She said it was in the best interest of financial companies
to remain well capitalized. "With continued industry headwinds,
we expect the potential for continued capital raises throughout
this year and potentially into next."

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS, June 5 (Reuters) - A Nigerian oil workers' union will
hold talks with the local unit of Chevron (CVX.N) next week to
avert a potentially crippling strike at the company, union
leaders said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Senior staff union PENGASSAN had issued Chevron a 7-day
ultimatum to transfer the expatriate managing director out of
the Nigeria unit or risk a total shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ultimatum expired on Thursday but the union was yet to
begin the threatened lockout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PENGASSAN national president Babatunde Ogun said a meeting
with Chevron management had been fixed for next Tuesday but the
local branch could still go ahead with the strike if it wished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The ultimatum expired today, so the union can no longer
guarantee industrial harmony in the company. The unit has our
approval to embark on a strike if they want," Ogun told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron officials in Nigeria were not immediately available
for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The union accused the Chevron managing director of violating
basic safety standards, having too many expatriate staff and of
a lack of respect for Nigerian employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The problems started when the MD came, once he goes all the
other issues can be resolved. The workers have no confidence in
him because he is not protecting their interests," Ogun said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another union leader said PENGASSAN had written to President
Umaru Yar'Adua and other relevant stakeholders to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have asked them to look into the issues raised by the
union before the matter snowballs into a serious action,"
PENGASSAN secretary general Bayo Olowoshile said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A strike at Chevron would further slash output in Africa's
top oil producer, where a fifth of capacity has been shut in
since early 2006 when ethnic militants in the oil-producing
Niger Delta began a violent campaign against the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nigerian unit of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) was forced to shut
in about 800,000 barrels per day oil output for eight days in
April due to a strike by the local branch of PENGASSAN.

&lt;p&gt;Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP Files Class Action Lawsuit against JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP has commenced a class
action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York seeking to recover damages on behalf of all persons who
purchased or acquired Auction Rate Securities from JP Morgan Chase &amp;
Co., and J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc.("Defendants") between May 16,
2003 and February 1, 2008, inclusive (the "Class Period').

   The complaint alleges that Defendants violated Sections 10(b) and
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by deceptively offering
for sale Action Rate Securities, and represented to investors that
these securities were the equivalent of cash or money-market
substitutes, and/or other short term investments that were highly
liquid and could be purchased with a minimum investment of $25,000.
Defendants were deceptive in that they failed to disclose to consumers
that auction rate securities are long-term financial instruments with
maturities of 30 years to perpetuity, and that such securities were
only liquid due to Defendants and other broker-dealers creating an
artificial market for auction rate securities by manipulating the
auction process. On or about February 13, 2008, Defendants and other
major broker-dealers withdrew their support of these securities,
causing holders of auction rate securities offered by the defendants
as being highly-liquid investments to be left with no means of
liquidating their holdings.

   If you purchased or acquired auction rate securities from JP
Morgan Chase &amp; Co., or J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. during the Class
Period, and continue to hold such securities as of February 1, 2008,
you may, no later than July 15, 2008, request that the Court appoint
you as lead plaintiff.

   A lead plaintiff is a representative that acts on behalf of other
class members throughout the litigation. To be appointed lead
plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is
typical of the claims of all class members, and that said class member
will adequately represent the class. Under certain circumstances,
multiple class members may serve as "lead plaintiffs." Your ability to
share in any recovery is not affected by the decision whether or not
to serve as lead plaintiff.

   If you have any questions concerning this Notice, or your rights
as a potential class member or lead plaintiff, please contact:

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, CANADA, Jun 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Nemx Software, leaders in email compliance, content control and security
solutions for Microsoft Exchange, today announced availability of
SecurExchange for Microsoft's Exchange 2007 platform. Nemx is the first
vendor to offer a full suite of rich, powerful and flexible email
compliance functionality for the Exchange 2007 platform.

    Accuracy and contextual comprehension are the cornerstones for the
precise content detection necessary for effective email compliance and
policy enforcement. Scanning content for the presence of simple key words
and phrases, like Exchange 2007 does, produces high rates of false
positive and false negative detections, resulting in frustration, soaring
administration costs and leaving the organization exposed to unacceptable
risk and potentially expensive liability.

    SecurExchange enhances Exchange 2007 by transparently adding more
sophisticated content analysis supporting "concept" scanning. Concept
scanning incorporates a variety of linguistic techniques, dictionaries,
semantic inference as well as positional analysis to achieve
substantially higher accuracy in all detection activities as well as
significantly lower false positive and negative rates than Exchange 2007
on its own.

    For instance, the presence of the term 'confidential' in the text of an
attached Word document isn't enough to know if the document is actually
confidential and should be blocked from being delivered or automatically
encrypted. However, if 'confidential' is contained in the footer of the
document it is almost assuredly a confidential document. Concept
scanning, used by SecurExchange, has the ability to differentiate between
these cases and recognize the significance of detecting confidential in
the footer versus elsewhere in the content.

    "Without a doubt, Nemx's SecurExchange features some of the most complete
and comprehensive content analysis techniques and capabilities of any
product I've seen in the market," states Michael Osterman, president
Osterman Research. "Its unique concept scanning is far more effective and
context sensitive than the key word/phrase and limited semantic
techniques used in many products."

    "Enforcing compliance policies without imposing an undue and costly
administrative burden, creating user frustration and truly protecting the
organization through contextually accurate detection is the value
SecurExchange adds to any Exchange 2007 installation" stated John Young,
president of Nemx Software Corporation. "It's really about finding what
the user means, rather than just what word(s) were used, that's the
difference between concept scanning and key words."

    SecurExchange for Exchange 2007 Features

    SecurExchange plugs the gaps in Exchange 2007 with concept scanning - for
improved detection accuracy; policy management tools - that significantly
reduce the administrative burden associated with email control; and, the
richest set of smart action triggers available on the market.  Key
features of SecurExchange for Exchange 2007 include:

    - advanced "concept" scanning accurately detects context, plurals,
tenses, similar meaning terms and more

    - policy administration tool supports reusable, independently managed
policy objects, that eases the burden associated with defining and
maintaining email compliance policies

    - Attachment scanning

    - 100% email protection - scanning inbound, outbound and internal email
traffic

    - Optional policy-driven secure mail automatically encrypts or digitally
signs email with no requirement for a desktop plug-in or user intervention

    - Real-time integration with Active Directory

    Pricing and Availability

    SecurExchange for Exchange 2007 is available immediately directly through
Nemx, and its authorized reseller partners. Pricing ranges from $25 to $7
per mailbox, plus annual support and options.

    About SecurExchange

solution designed specifically for all versions of Microsoft Exchange
Server. SecurExchange takes the risk out of corporate email by putting
you in control of 100% of your email traffic - inbound, outbound and your

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a 10-year, $324 million Business
Transformation Outsourcing (BTO) agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb to
transform and support many of the company's global human resource (HR)
functions.

    The contract with IBM will allow Bristol-Myers Squibb to provide flexible
and
available HR services to ensure that its employees across the globe have access
to information and services wherever they may be.

    "Dynamic change in the pharmaceutical industry is forcing companies to
become more streamlined in their operations," said Philip Guido, IBM general
manager, Managed Business Processing Services, Americas.  "In order to manage
talent within an organization, a company must have an integrated view into its
employee population and workforce data.  The approach that Bristol-Myers
Squibb is taking for its HR function will be integral to helping it better
serve its customers and support its strategic transformation to a BioPharma
leader."

    Under the agreement, IBM will provide compensation, benefits, recruiting,
learning,
payroll administration, call center support and related IT systems services
to Bristol-Myers Squibb.  Additionally, IBM will implement a SAP solution and
integrate Bristol-Myers Squibb's global workforce data into one portal that
can be accessed by employees, managers and HR professionals around the
globe.  The services will support Bristol-Myers Squibb's operations in the
United
States, Puerto Rico, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and
Belgium, as well as, limited support to 40 of its additional country locations
in
Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas. Through the agreement Bristol-Myers
Squibb seeks to achieve a more integrated and improved employee experience,
reduced costs, improved operational efficiency and access to innovative
solutions.

    IBM's call centers in Manila and Budapest, as well as its delivery centers
in the
United States will support Bristol-Myers Squibb's global operations.

    The master agreement between IBM and Bristol-Meyers Squibb was executed in

localagreements have been executed, is $324 million.

 IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Michigan Technological University today announced
several initiatives to help students develop the multi-disciplinary skills
required in a growing number of jobs and professions around the world.

    Businesses today are looking to the next generation of IT and business
experts for
so-called "T-shaped" skills, which encompass both deep business skills,
represented by the horizontal line of the "T," and technical understanding,
represented by the vertical line. Top prospects will understand the dynamics
of the globally integrated enterprise, can work across geographically
distributed teams, and have experience using open source technologies to
address real world business challenges.

    IBM is teaming with Michigan Tech to develop curricula and sponsor an 'on
the
job' learning program to encourage the development of these sought after skills.
In an effort to encourage the use of open source technologies, IBM has donated
WebSphere software with the agreement that any assets created through these
programs will be made available to other universities around the world at no
charge.

    Michigan Tech Curriculum Maps to the Future of Work

    Michigan Tech recently introduced a Service Systems Engineering program to
address the expansion of the services sector, which the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics reports represents more than 80 percent of the U.S. economy and is
continuing to grow.

    Over the past five years, IBM has been working with more than 150
universities around the world to grow the adoption of Services Science,
Management and Engineering (SSME) which is similar to Michigan Tech's
program. Taking a multi-disciplinary approach to education, SSME looks at how
factors such as technology, relationship, culture, economics, and processes
inform and impact the service business.

    IT Oxygen Invigorates Students

    Moving beyond the classroom, IBM and Michigan Tech want to give students a
chance to apply their academic expertise and problem solving skills to
realworld business challenges. Unlike an internship or a cooperative work
experience, Michigan Tech's Enterprise program brings together a small group of
students that study different disciplines in a start-up business environment --
the students are compensated for their work and they pay rent and other overhead
costs.

    IT Oxygen, partially sponsored by IBM, is a student-run team focused on
using cross-disciplinary expertise to solve some of the most challenging
business process issues facing the university. By working in a team that
spans academic disciplines, the students get natural exposure to new ways of
thinking and problem solving.

    "The program brings together students from various geographies and
academicdisciplines, closely reflecting what it's like to work in today's
globally
integrated enterprise," said Jim Frendewey, associate dean of business and
economics, Michigan Technological University. "Giving students access to IBM
technologies and thought leaders provides our students with an advantage
when they reach the workforce."

    As part of the program, IT Oxygen team members are getting a chance to apply
a service oriented architecture (SOA) approach to improve business processes at
Michigan Tech. SOA is a business strategy that helps a company reuse existing
technology to more closely align with business goals resulting in greater
efficiencies, cost savings, agility, and productivity. SOA represents a $160
billion market
opportunity, and a growing source of jobs worldwide, making it an essential part
of
an employee's skills base.

    IT Oxygen is getting hands-on training by developing solutions to improve
Michigan Tech's course scheduling tools with regard to classroom, student, and
professor availability.  Using WebSphere software, the students can model and
simulate how the processes can be transformed before they actually go in and
do the work. The team is also using business process management (BPM) enabled by
SOA to streamline many processes associated with submitting a grant research
proposal. IT Oxygen creates open source solutions to address all of these
challenges, making them available for reuse by other universities.

    "Michigan Tech's Enterprise Program operates in a way that is very similar
to
IBM's Extreme Blue internship program, putting a small group of cross-discipline
students together
in effectively a start-up business," said John Soyring, vice president,
solutions
and software, IBM. "The program provides the students with a chance to build
SOA skills while seeing what the future of work looks like in terms of
bringing together individuals with different areas of expertise to solve
difficult
business challenges."

    Much of this is made possible through IBM's Academic Initiative, a program
offering a wide range of technology education benefits to meet the goals
ofcolleges and universities. As a member of this initiative, participating
schools
receive free access to IBM software, discounted hardware, course materials,
training and curriculum development. Nearly 2,000 universities and 11,000
faculty
members worldwide have joined IBM's Academic Initiative.

    Michigan Tech is also part of the  World Community Grid which is focused
on creating the world's largest public computing grid to tackle projects that
benefit humanity.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Nvidia Corp
(NVDA.O) to "buy" from "neutral," saying the graphics chipmaker
will remain the performance leader in desktop graphics
processing units for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Santa Clara, California-based company has 60 percent of
the global graphics card industry and competes with Advanced
Micro Devices Inc (AMD.N) and Intel Corp (INTC.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that Nvidia's high-end product launch in late
June will largely blunt the nearly simultaneous launch of AMD's
new desktop products," the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it expect the new product announcements,
coupled with market data suggesting healthy demand, to drive
the stock higher in the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage added that taken together, these
opportunities will be key profit drivers for Nvidia as the
number of professional graphics workstations continues to
increase, and general-purpose computing with GPUs begins to
take hold.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Pfizer Inc
(PFE.N) and removed the world's biggest drug maker from its
Americas conviction list, citing the stock's underperformance
and said it does not expect near-term catalysts to drive
valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which cut its rating on Pfizer to "neutral"
from "buy," said the company's share price has fallen 28.7
percent since Jan. 4, 2007, versus a 2.9 percent decline in the
Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX and a 20.4 percent fall in
its coverage universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it cut its price target on Pfizer to $22 from
$26 as near-term pipeline products decrease in value and recent
safety issues pressure the brokerage's forecasts for the
company's anti-smoking drug Chantix and cancer drug Sutent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers had recently said hundreds of patients taking
Chantix reported serious accidents, vision problems and heart
trouble, while some patients who took Sutent, a pill used to
treat kidney and stomach cancers, developed heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman added Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) to the Americas
conviction list and retained its "buy" rating on the stock.
However, it lowered its price target on the stock by $2 to $58,
reflecting multiple contraction in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it upgraded Schering-Plough Corp SGP.N
to "buy" from "neutral" as new pipeline additions have raised
its risk-adjusted sales estimates.
 Goldman raised its price target on Wyeth WYE.N, which it
rates "neutral," to $50 from $48.
 The brokerage cut its price targets on Merck  Co (MRK.N) to
$43 from $48 and on Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) to $24.50
from $28, while keeping its "neutral" rating on both the
stocks.

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney World Resort in 3D Takes Vacation Planning to New
 Heights as the Most Detailed 3D Rendering Within Google Earth to Date
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Walt Disney Parks and Resorts is harnessing the power of Google
Earth(TM) to build an interactive, three-dimensional tour of Walt
Disney World Resort that brings you one step closer to a true park
experience. With direct links to Disney's online travel-planning
tools, Walt Disney World Resort in 3D will re-invent how people plan
and book vacations.

   Beginning today, Disney guests can use Google Earth, a program
which offers a 3D digital model of the world, to virtually tour Walt
Disney World's four theme parks, as well as its 22 hotels and resorts.
An overview of Walt Disney World Resort in 3D, along with instructions
on how to get started, can be found at www.disneyworld.com/3dparks.
Existing Google Earth 4.3 users can see Walt Disney World Resort in 3D
by enabling the "Gallery" folder within Google Earth, or by selecting
any of the 3D buildings within the resort.

   "You know the phrase 'next best thing to being there'? Walt Disney
World Resort in 3D is going to deliver on that," said Jay Rasulo,
chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. "Guests and travel planners
can now explore our world with just a few clicks of a mouse, and they
can book vacations while being immersed in what the destination has to
offer."

   Disney's digital mapping project, Walt Disney World Resort in 3D,
will become the ultimate online travel guide for Walt Disney World
Resort, integrating the Google Earth 3D experience with the planning
features of Disney.com. Whether guests book through the Disney
reservation center, a travel agent or online, nearly nine out of ten
Walt Disney World guests use the internet to plan their vacations and
Walt Disney World Resort in 3D provides the latest technology
available to enhance that experience. From Google Earth, guests and
travel planners can click on images of their favorite attractions and
hotels to purchase tickets, make reservations, and map out the
vacation that is right for their families - in 3D and with the click
of a mouse. Disneyworld.com visitors can view videos and other
information about viewing Walt Disney World in 3D at
www.disneyworld.com/3dparks.

   The depth and vivid detail of Walt Disney World Resort in 3D
project makes this a unique, truly immersive experience within Google
Earth. Visitors begin their virtual tour of Disney World with a
stratospheric view of the globe, a starting point familiar to anyone
who has ever used Google Earth. A skydive takes visitors past the
flatlands of Florida to a view of the Seven Seas Lagoon in the Magic
Kingdom. Guests can then fly through the streets and explore in and
around the hotels and resorts, down Main Street to Cinderella Castle,
from the heights of The Tower of Terror to base of the Tree of Life.
To enter the virtual park:

   --  Download Google Earth 4.3 by visiting
        www.disneyworld.com/3dparks.

   --  Launch Google Earth and search for 'Disney World'

   --  Click the Gold Mickey Ears to open an info window.

   --  In the info window, click "Show Disney World in 3D." Now
        explore!

   "This is the most detailed 3D rendering undertaken within Google
Earth to date," continued Rasulo. "The work done here will provide a
professional counterpart to the wealth of Disney images and 3D models
from around the world contributed by thousands of volunteers. The
difference Walt Disney World Resort in 3D provides is one of scope and
interaction."

   During the project's first phase, eight photographers worked for
10 days to shoot all the visible surfaces of Walt Disney World,
including every building facade. A total 100,000 photos were taken in
all; these became the start for some 1,500 3D models that populate the
virtual tour. Walt Disney World Resort in 3D creates a new level of
usability for vacation planners and makes detailed information about
one of the world's foremost destinations available to Google Earth's
350 million users, furthering the Google Earth team's goal of
recreating the world as it really is.

&lt;p&gt;  SUGAR LAND, TX, Jun 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Researched by Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land, Texas) -- The Rockefellers
have decided to pressure ExxonMobil's board of directors to make them more
responsive to social policy: to force them to spend stockholder money to develop
alternativeforms of "green" energy. BizRadio's on-air think tank gets a visit
from
financial and publishing giant, Steve Forbes, who reveals the skinny: good or
bad deal?

    Mr. Forbes: "Exxon has got a certain expertise in gas and exploration, oil
and exploration, refining -- and to think that they are going to lead the
charge in coming up with alternative energies just goes against the whole
history of entrepreneurship. Big breakthroughs in the industries come not
from incumbents but from outsiders. Even IBM, which was at the forefront
ofthe PC, did not realize the significance of it. Others, like Microsoft,
didand Dell and others, HP, and they ran with it."

    Dan Frishberg:  "So, first of all, Steve, you're saying essentially that
itwasn't the horse guys who invented cars or the railroads who invented
airplanes,
it was entrepreneurs taking a chance, not established businesses."

    Arthur Laffer: "You know the stockholders own the company, and whatever
thestockholders want to be done with the corporate resources, it is their right
to
do it, whether they make a mistake or not. I think sometimes these people come
in and really screw things up, but it is their company after all."

    Mr. Frishberg:  "Personally, that would make me sell the company if they
were
going to do that stuff in a big way."

    Dr. Laffer:  "If I owned it and these guys were going to take over and do
this silliness, I would sell my stock."

    Mr. Forbes: "In the case of Exxon, I think that if those proposals go on the
ballot, I think they are going to be overwhelmingly rejected, including by
members
of unions who don't want their workers' pensions put at risk by a company
they thought was in a fairly mature business. If you want to go in venture
capital, by all means do it."

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Highlights: Coca-Cola FEMSA, Acorda Therapeutics, XTO Energy, SiRF Technology and Hallmark Financial Services

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Coca-Cola FEMSA (NYSE: KOF) as
the Bull of the Day and Acorda Therapeutics (Nasdaq: ACOR) as the Bear
of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on
XTO Energy (NYSE: XTO), SiRF Technology (Nasdaq: SIRF) and Hallmark
Financial Services (Nasdaq: HALL).

   Full analysis of all these stocks is available at
http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676.

   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

   Bull of the Day: Coca-Cola FEMSA (NYSE: KOF)

   We are keeping our Buy recommendation on Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A. de
C.V. The company posted better-than-expected results for the first
quarter of 2008. The results in the Mercosur division were
particularly impressive, and its Mexican results also showed a
considerable improvement. Additionally, the short-term outlook for
Latin American economic growth remains positive, despite the difficult
economic environment in the U.S. and its effects on Mexico.

   Bear of the Day: Acorda Therapeutics (Nasdaq: ACOR)

   Acorda Therapeutics released top-line results from its phase III
MS-F204 clinical trial and the stock soared 30% on the news. Now, with
two positive phase III trials designed under an SPA under its belt,
the odds are very good that Fampridine-SR receives FDA approval late
2009 or early 2010.

   However, despite the fact that the MS-F204 trial offered up
positive results, we remain unconvinced that Fampridine-SR will see
significant use upon approval. And, at the current level, we believe
Acorda's stock is significantly overvalued and expectations for
profitability and future cash flow are entirely too high.

   Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog:

   XTO Energy (NYSE: XTO)

   XTO Energy, Inc. is expected to maintain its impressive
production-growth momentum in 2008. The company's move into the
oil-rich Bakken Shale area of North Dakota and Wyoming with a $1.85
billion purchase of producing properties and undeveloped acreage has
now established the company as a leading producer and leasehold owner
in this emerging oil shale play.

   We have increased our 2008 and 2009 EPS estimates to reflect
increased production volumes and a higher price deck. However, we
believe that the stock's current valuation already reflects XTO's
strong production-growth profile and competitive cost structure.

   SiRF Technology (Nasdaq: SIRF)

   We maintain our Hold recommendation on SiRF Technology Holdings,
Inc., as the current market valuation appears reasonable. Several
end-markets that have the potential to significantly revise
expectations upwards don't appear to be near-term catalysts. A number
of SiRF's customers and several providers into the Personal Navigation
Devices (PNDs) market have indicated softness in the marketplace.

   SiRF is the leading supplier of Global Positioning System, or GPS,
semiconductor solutions designed to provide location awareness
capabilities in high-volume mobile consumer and commercial systems.
Its problems over the past three quarters stem from its inability to
compete in the cellular handset market.

   Hallmark Financial Services (Nasdaq: HALL)

   We maintain our Hold rating on Hallmark Financial Services Inc.,
as we anticipate the company to leverage its suite of products by
broadening its geographical niches as well as its current product
offerings within its existing markets in the coming years. However, it
is difficult to expect the shares to retest their recent
priced-to-perfection level over the near-to-medium term.

   Given the soft market conditions, we expect HALL to experience a
reduction in writing premium, thereby causing a reduction in profit
margins and revenues. Accordingly, increased competition and rate
pressure have challenged premium volume growth by the Standard
Commercial Segment and really do not see the potential for premium
volume improvement in 2008.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, June 6 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) was
weighing its options after the planning commission in Richmond,
California, voted to limit the types and amounts of crude and
feedstocks its refinery in the San Francisco Bay-area city can
use after a planned upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "This is in our knowledge unprecedented in the industry,"
Chevron spokesman Sean Comey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Richmond Planning Commission's vote does not affect
current operations at the 243,000-barrel-per-day refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State and regional environmental regulators routinely
impose restrictions when issuing refinery operating permits,
but city design and zoning permits are usually limited to
construction and siting issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We need the caps because we already have a lot of
pollution in the city of Richmond," said Commissioner Nagaraja
Rao, who voted in favor of the limits. "Some people think it's
a toxic dump."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's planned upgrade will allow the refinery to run
crude oil with higher sulfur content than it can now, but won't
add to the refinery's throughput. The project will also give
the refinery more flexibility in the products it manufactures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Using cheaper yet higher-sulfur crude oil will lead to
higher levels of pollution, Rao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron believes upgrading inefficient refinery units, some
first built 70 years ago, will reduce pollution from the
refinery, Comey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Planning Commission will consider a formal draft of the
limits at a June 19 hearing. If the limits are adopted, Chevron
can ask the Richmond City Council to overturn them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery upgrade will take up to five years to
complete, once state and local permits are granted.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, June 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
said on Friday the company will on July 31 shut down Windows
Live Expo, a two-year-old, online classified advertising site
the software giant created to compete with Craigslist.com,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A notice on the Windows Live Expo site at
expo.live.com informs visitors that the service will be
discontinued at the end of July. Effective immediately, the
site has quit accepting new accounts or listings, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All current listings will remain on expo.live.com until
they expire," the notice said. "We thank you for your patronage
and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expo was one of several lesser known Windows Live services
that Microsoft has shuttered recently. In late May, Microsoft
said it would shut off its Windows Live Search Books service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was introduced in February 2006 as a classified listings
service where members could buy and sell merchandise, discover
local events, find a new job or place to live. Products on Expo
were listed by postal code, giving users the option to search
for items within a 25 mile radius of their location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like other Windows Live services, Expo was designed to
showcase the utility of combining different Microsoft Internet
services. To ensure trust, the classifieds service allowed
customers to limit listings to known associates listed within
their Microsoft e-mail or instant messaging contact lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; San Francisco-based Craigslist attracts an overwhelming
percentage of visitors to U.S. online classified sites. It
offers local classifieds in 500 cities and more than 50
countries. Online auctioneer eBay Inc (EBAY.O) operates a rival
classifieds site it calls Kijiji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft pursued a mega-merger with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O)
earlier this year to bolster the company's position relative to
Internet services market leader Google Inc (GOOG.O). A month
ago, Microsoft withdrew its unsolicited takeover offer after
Yahoo sought a higher price. The companies continue to talk
about alternate deals that fall short of an outright merger,
Yahoo executives said this week.

customers increased access to bank offices and continued use of the

   J. William "Bill" Douglas will continue in his role as President
and CEO of the expanded AFB Benjamin E. "Ben" Garrett, current
President and CEO of NBWC, will transition into an executive
leadership role with AFB Once the transfer of assets is complete,
AFB will have a total asset size of $1.6 billion with 19 locations
and 323 team members with a full range of products and services.

   "Customers of NBWC will now be doing business with AFB but will
still enjoy the same local relationships with the expert bankers they
know and trust, plus access to more locations, capital and products,"
Garrett said.

&lt;p&gt;  (Previous ALMATY, adds Nazarbayev quotes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Olzhas Auyezov&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATYRAU, Kazakhstan, June 6 (Reuters) - U.S. oil company
Chevron (CVX.N) agreed with Kazakhstan on Friday to press ahead
with a new domestic oil pipeline, part of a broader $3 billion
project to link Caspian oil deposits with international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan pumps most of its oil through Russia but it has
irritated Moscow in past years by announcing plans to build more
pipelines and diversify exports towards western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pipeline, to be built along Kazakhstan's western coast
on the Caspian Sea, was discussed at a meeting between senior
Chevron officials and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is very important that we reached agreement with
Chevron," Nazarbayev told reporters in the oil city of Atyrau
after the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 750 km (466 mile), $1.5 billion pipeline is due to feed
oil from Kazakhstan's biggest oilfields -- Tengiz, developed by
a Chevron-led group, and Kashagan, which has yet to start
production -- into the BP-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nazarbayev said the link, also known as the South Caspian
pipeline, will have an initial capacity of 23 million tonnes
which would later be increased to 56 million tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron is pleased with the opportunity to develop the
Southern Route jointly with Kazakhstan," Chevron's Kazakhstan
office said separately in emailed remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This strategic asset will provide an additional export
route to deliver Kazakh crude to the world markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two sides did not say when the pipeline would be built.
It is not expected to come onstream until the giant Kashagan
deposit starts pumping oil after 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan's Yeskene-Kuryk portion of the pipeline, together
with a planned trans-Caspian undersea route, are estimated at a
total of $3 billion, according to government estimates.

&lt;p&gt;ATYRAU, Kazakhstan, June 6 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (XOM.N)
urged Kazakhstan on Friday against revising taxes for oil
companies, saying the proposed measure would hinder fresh
investment in the oil-rich Central Asian state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan has introduced an oil export duty and announced
plans to impose new taxes on the booming sector dominated by
Western oil majors, as part of proposed legislation changes due
later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Albers, Exxon's Senior Vice President, told a foreign

proposed changes would hurt Kazakhstan's business climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Restructuring fiscal agreements or revising fiscal
legislation with an assumption of sustainable high oil prices
might seem to generate additional revenue for the government,
but in fact hinders new investment, undermining investor
confidence and increasing risks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Causing further concern, the Kazakh government has also
threatened to review a contract with a Western oil consortium --
which includes Exxon -- developing the giant Kashagan oil field
due to disagreement over costs and production schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say Kazakhstan, emboldened by its booming economy
and high global oil prices, is unhappy with the terms of some
oil contracts signed in the 1990s and is trying to get a greater
share of revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Stability and predictability are important in making sure
that both the government and the investors are confident about
the optimal pace of development," Albers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the proposed changed, the government plans to
introduce a subsoil extraction tax and make all existing
contracts, including Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs)
subject to parliamentary approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Olzhas Auyezov)

&lt;p&gt;ALMATY, June 6 (Reuters) - U.S. oil company Chevron (CVX.N)
agreed with Kazakhstan on Friday to press ahead with a new
domestic oil pipeline, due to be part of a broader $3 billion
project to link Caspian oil deposits with international markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan pumps most of its oil through Russia but it has
irritated Moscow in past years by announcing plans to build more
pipelines and diversifying exports towards western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the new pipeline, due to be built along
Kazakhstan's western coast on the Caspian Sea, was discussed
this week at a meeting between senior executives of Chevron and
Kazakh state oil company KazMunaiGas [KMG.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron is pleased with the opportunity to develop the
Southern Route jointly with Kazakhstan," the company's
Kazakhstan office said in emailed remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This strategic asset will provide an additional export
route to deliver Kazakh crude to the world markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 750 km (466 mile) pipeline is due to feed oil from
Kazakhstan's biggest oilfields -- Tengiz, developed by a
Chevron-led group, and Kashagan, which has yet to start
production -- into the BP-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan's Yeskene-Kuryk portion of the pipeline, together
with a planned trans-Caspian undersea route, are estimated at a
total of $3 billion, according to previous government estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron did not say when the pipeline would be built.
KazMunaiGas sees its maximum capacity at up to 56 million tonnes
a year. Kazakhstan sees this year's oil production at 67.6
million tonnes (1.35 million barrels per day).

&lt;p&gt;Album Features 12 All-New Songs from Upcoming Disney Channel
   Original Movie Performed by Jonas Brothers, Demi Lovato and More!
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Platinum-selling artists and Disney hit sensations the Jonas
Brothers, Demi Lovato and more are featured on the highly-anticipated
soundtrack to "Camp Rock," set for release on June 17. The
album features 12 all-new songs from the highly anticipated Disney
Channel Original Movie, which launches in an unprecedented,
far-reaching cross-platform rollout on Disney Channel, the ABC
Television Network (as part of the "Wonderful World of Disney"
franchise), ABC Family, Radio Disney and Disney.com in Disney XD,
Friday, June 20 through Monday, June 23 in the U.S. It will also
premiere on Family Channel Canada and on Quebec's VRAK.TV (dubbed in
French) on Friday, June 20 and on Disney Channels around the world
beginning in August.

   Following in the footsteps of the highly successful,
record-breaking "High School Musical" franchise, "Camp Rock" uses
songs to tell much of its story with the themes "believe in yourself,"
"express yourself," and "be proud of who you are" carried through the
lyrics. Together, the songs tell the story in this celebratory, song
and dance-filled movie.

   Starring platinum-certified Hollywood Records' recording artists
and Top 40 and Radio Disney hit-makers Jonas Brothers (Joe, Kevin and
Nick) and singer/songwriter/actress Demi Lovato (of Disney Channel's
"As the Bell Rings"), "Camp Rock" is the story of a talented yet
unsure teen who yearns to share her songs with the world, and of a
tempestuous young superstar who's lost his passion for music and is
sent packing by his band mates. Together, at a camp for aspiring young
music artists, they learn to believe in themselves and to value the
freedom to be who they really want to be.

   The accomplished songwriters who contributed songs to the
soundtrack are: Andy Dodd, Adam Watts, Mitch Allan, Greg Wells, Pam
Sheyne, Toby Gad, Antonina Armato, Tim James, Jamie Houston, Robbie
Nevil, Matthew Gerrard, Nikki Hasman, Adam Anders and Kara Dioguardi.

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Rackable Systems, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and California Pizza Kitchen

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: Rackable Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:
RACK), Dell (Nasdaq: DELL), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ), IBM (NYSE:
IBM) and California Pizza Kitchen, Inc. (Nasdaq: CPKI).

   Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the
free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

   Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog:

   Going Green at Rackable Systems

   Rackable Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: RACK) continues to lead in green
technologies for lower power consumption, high-density servers, and is
gaining ground in the higher-margin storage business. Thus, we
maintain a Hold rating on RACK shares.

   Rackable plans to restate first quarter results, which should
result in higher gross margins and a lower loss per share. However,
RACK competes against much larger companies, such as Dell (Nasdaq:
DELL), HP (NYSE: HPQ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM), and we believe that as
energy concerns come to the forefront, the market for efficient
servers will become increasingly competitive.

   We do not believe that Rackable's servers contain enough
proprietary technology to insulate them from price competition, and as
a result, the company has had to cut prices in order to maintain
volumes, resulting in falling revenue and profit margins. We believe
Rackable is at a disadvantage with its small size as it will have to
continue a high level of R investment in an attempt to differentiate
itself and compete against the likes of Dell and HP.

   California Pizza Kitchen Cools Off

   We downgrade California Pizza Kitchen, Inc. (Nasdaq: CPKI) to a
Hold from Buy, as we expect the company to continue from suffering
declining traffic, the de-leveraging of its rent expense, and
shrinking return on equities throughout 2008. Moreover, the shares are
trading at 20.5x our estimates and 17.8x consensus, well above CPKI's
growth at a time when there is reduced visibility and above-average
estimate risk.

   However, we expect CPKI can rebuild momentum in 2009, grow
earnings at a mid-teens average rate over the next five years by
adding full-service restaurants in existing and new markets,
increasing comps and restaurant margins through its new prototype
restaurant design, further penetrating the fast casual market with the
new ASAP concept, repurchasing shares, and building its lucrative
Kraft frozen pizza licensing business. With a chain of just 239
restaurants, we think the company can grow the units at an average
rate of 10 percent annually, while keeping an eye on profitability.

&lt;p&gt;As Gas Prices Continue to Rise, Walt's Offers Simple Auto Care Tips to Help Conserve Fuel

  Inexpensive Fixes Can Significantly Improve Fuel Efficiency as Gas
             Prices Rise During the Summer Driving Season
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
With gas prices on the rise, Walt's Auto Care Centers is offering
tips to improve fuel efficiency during the summer driving season. Doug
Danstrom of Walt's shares maintenance ideas to make each tank last
longer as gas prices shoot past $4.00 a gallon. Walt's is a locally
owned neighborhood repair shop with over 20 Puget Sound locations
(www.waltswrench.com).

   "A well-maintained car uses gas better," said Danstrom. "To cope
with high gas prices, drivers can reduce the number of trips to the
pump during the summer driving season with a few preventative
measures."

   According to the Federal Energy Information Administration (EIA),
the nationwide average for regular gas is $3.93, up 19 percent from
2007. Washington's gas prices are higher, according to the American
Automobile Association (AAA), with an average of $4.14. AAA Washington
also indicates many are taking trips closer to home to manage costs.

   Walt's tips include:

   Replace the air filter. Replacing a dirty filter can improve fuel
efficiency as much as 10 percent, saving about $.41 per gallon. Most
manuals recommend replacing filters every 9,000 miles.

   Change engine oil every 3,000 to 5,000 miles. Dirty oil can cause
vehicles to lose 1 to 2 percent, or $.04 to $.08 per gallon.

   Perform a fuel system tune-up. A tune-up can improve
fuel-efficiency as much as 4 percent.

   Perform a transmission flush. A transmission not at peak
performance can decrease fuel efficiency. Symptoms of a transmission
needing service include rough shifting and gear slippage.

   Check tire pressure. Under-inflated tires can significantly reduce
fuel efficiency. Check to ensure proper inflation and save 3 percent
or $0.12 per gallon.

   Danstrom also advocates some common sense tips. Removing
unnecessary weight, like luggage racks, can increase fuel efficiency 1
to 2 percent for every 100 pounds of weight removed. Fuel efficiency
also decreases at speeds of 60 miles per hour or more. Save as much as
$0.26 to $0.86 per gallon by observing speed limits.

Sound for almost 50 years. With over 20 locations, Walt's continues to

&lt;p&gt;NRF Welcomes Senate Bill Requiring Visa and MasterCard to Negotiate Over Hidden Annual Fee

WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The National Retail Federation welcomed today's introduction of
Senate antitrust legislation that would require Visa and MasterCard to
negotiate with merchants over hidden credit card processing fees that
cost the average family more than $400 a year and total $48 billion
annually.

   "The introduction of this bill shows momentum is building in
Congress and that both the House and Senate are ready to bring the
credit card companies' greed under control," NRF Senior Vice President
and General Counsel Mallory Duncan said. "This is a fee most consumers
don't even know about, but it's the equivalent to half a dozen tanks
of gas or a month's worth of groceries. If consumers knew how much
they were paying for credit cards, most would say it isn't worth the
price, particularly in today's economy."

   "Negotiation is important because these fees are set behind closed
doors and imposed on a take it or leave it basis," Duncan said. "This
bill would give retailers the opportunity to negotiate terms on behalf
of themselves and their customers that reflect the actual cost of the
services provided rather than credit card companies' attempt to reap
windfall profits from soaring prices."

   Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., today introduced
the Credit Card Fair Fee Act of 2008. The legislation is a companion
measure to H.R. 5546, also named the Credit Card Fair Fee Act of 2008,
introduced by House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers,
D-Mich., in March. Both measures would require credit card systems
possessing "substantial market power" to negotiate with merchants to
reach a voluntary agreement on credit card terms and conditions. If an
agreement could be reached, both sides would be required to submit
their final offers to binding arbitration by a three-judge panel
appointed by the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission.

   At issue is credit card "interchange," a non-negotiable fee
averaging close to 2 percent that Visa and MasterCard banks charge
merchants every time a credit card or signature debit card is used to
pay for a transaction. Visa and MasterCard effectively force merchants
to pass the fees on to consumers by requiring them to be included in
the advertised price of items and making cash discounts difficult. But
interchange is largely unknown to most consumers because Visa and
MasterCard keep merchants from disclosing it on receipts and don't
disclose the fee on monthly statements.

   According to NRF estimates, the average U.S. family will pay $427
in hidden credit card interchange fees in 2008. The figure is based on
the $48 billion Visa, MasterCard and their banks are projected to
collect in interchange divided by the U.S. Census Bureau's estimate of
112.4 million households. The number is up from $378 in 2007, and has
nearly tripled from the $159 paid in 2001, the year NRF began tracking
interchange.

   A 2006 report by Chicago's Diamond Management and Technology
Consultants Inc. found that only 13 percent of the interchange fee is
needed for actual transaction processing costs, with most of the rest
going to the cost of card issuers' rewards programs and profits.
Durbin was one of four senators who wrote to both Visa and MasterCard
last month asking for an explanation of how the fees are set and how
they are used.

   Duncan testified before the House Judiciary Committee's Antitrust
Task Force last summer on how Visa and MasterCard banks work through
each of the two credit card companies to set interchange rates that
all banks agree to charge regardless of which bank's name is on a
card. In doing so, the two card companies each operate as illegal
price-fixing cartels in violation of antitrust law, he said.

   The National Retail Federation is the world's largest retail trade
association, with membership that comprises all retail formats and
channels of distribution including department, specialty, discount,
catalog, Internet, independent stores, chain restaurants, drug stores
and grocery stores as well as the industry's key trading partners of
retail goods and services. NRF represents an industry with more than
1.6 million U.S. retail companies, more than 25 million employees -
about one in five American workers - and 2007 sales of $4.5 trillion.
As the industry umbrella group, NRF also represents over 100 state,
national and international retail associations. www.nrf.com

&lt;p&gt;ST PETERSBURG, June 7 (Reuters) - There is no trust in
Russia's judicial system today, and that must change if it is to
attract major foreign investment, the chairman and CEO of
ExxonMobil Corporation (CVX.N), Rex Tillerson, said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The one thing Russia must advance in order to attract large
scale foreign investors...it must improve the functioning of its
judicial system. There is no confidence in the rule of law in
Russia today," Tillerson told an economic forum in Russia's
second largest city of St. Petersburg.

&lt;p&gt;ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - The Western financial 
crisis means the fast-growing economies of Brazil, Russia, 
India and China will grow their share of the world economy even 
faster than originally forecast, the founder of the four-nation 
BRIC concept told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The term BRIC was coined by Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs 
to describe how the four rising economies are likely to rival 
and overtake many of the West's leading economies over the next 
half century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jim O'Neill, the Goldman Sachs economist who originated the 
term in 2003, said the financial crisis that began in U.S. 
mortgage security markets was allowing the BRIC countries to 
take a bigger share of world gross domestic product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On a relative basis it definitely allows the BRICs to 
develop faster as they are going to take an even bigger share 
of GDP sooner," O'Neill told Reuters in an interview at an 
economic forum in Russia's former imperial capital of St 
Petersburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a financial crisis of the West and we must not 
forget that of the world's 6 billion people most of them are 
not affected by this," he said. "I was in India four weeks ago 
and there were no signs of India being affected by all of 
this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Neill, head of global economic research at Goldman, said 
China, India and Russia were actually growing faster than 
originally predicted by his research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Of the four BRICs, Russia, China and India have all grown 
on average 2 percent more than we suggested," he said. "It is a 
hell of a lot so they are now collectively 16 percent of global 
GDP so it is all happening a lot quicker."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The four BRIC countries have been seeking to form a 
political club to convert their growing economic power into 
greater geopolitical clout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, the four 
sought to formalize their club at the first stand-alone meeting 
of BRIC foreign ministers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would hope that Western leaders take note of that 
meeting and start to accelerate bringing them into the G8 club 
and the IMF because the world doesn't want a separate club just 
looking after the growing countries the same as it doesn't need 
an old club looking after the declining -- it needs a better 
club involving them both," O'Neill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think that the lack of progress by the G8 and the 
Western leaders to change is really bad and is one of the 
biggest problems in the world today," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Neill says the combined GDP of the BRIC countries could 
overtake the combined economic might of the G7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Detractors say optimistic predictions about the BRIC 
economies ignore major hurdles to their development such as 
future political instability, rampant corruption and decrepit 
infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Economists repeatedly forecast in the 1950s and 1960s that 
Brazil would become one of the world's top economic powers, 
only for its once-rapid growth to stall dramatically in the 
debt crisis of the 1980s and to stagnate throughout the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has said Russia will 
become one of the top five economies of the world by 2020, but 
admits the rule of law needs to be strengthened and corruption 
has to be rooted out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Neill said Russia should speed up some of its 
infrastructure projects and that corruption could sap Russia's 
economic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the core of it is a stronger self-confidence in a rule 
of law that everybody likes," he said. "In some ways Russia 
enjoys stability almost too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Russian people like stability which given Russia's 
history is very understandable and admirable but it should not 
come at the expense of things which are needed for private 
sector risk-taking, which are stronger property rights and a 
stronger rule of law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Michael Stott and Matthew Jones)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Non-OPEC oil supply is
unlikely to grow much since some regions are holding back from
aggressive production and other regions have limited supply,
according to a Barron's interview with a top energy analyst at
investment firm Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Countries that have large quantities of recoverable oil
such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Russia do not need the
incremental revenue from oil production so they are not on
track to increase their supply aggressively, Goldman's Arjun
Murti told the business news magazine in its June 9 edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is crimping supply to the rest of the world and
boosting prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst has said he expects oil to spike to a range of
$150 to $200 per barrel and "we're getting close to the end
game here," he told Barron's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil at $200 a barrel would mean gasoline prices of about
$5.75 per gallon at the pump in the United States, he said. But
the higher price of oil is also likely to meaningfully reduce
demand globally, and he said he did not believe oil at $200 was
sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is Goldman's top pick among major
oil companies because it has more oil in OECD (Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development) countries, Murti told
Barron's. He also said he likes oil and exploration companies,
including Cabot Oil  Gas Corp (COG.N), because of its exposure
to some specific shale plays, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of ConocoPhillips closed at $92.17 on Friday, while
Cabot's shares closed at $68.03.

"It is a hell of a lot so they are now collectively 16 percent of global GDP so it is all happening a lot quicker."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four BRIC countries have been seeking to form a political club to convert their growing economic power into greater geopolitical clout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, the four sought to formalize their club at the first stand-alone meeting of BRIC foreign ministers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would hope that Western leaders take note of that meeting and start to accelerate bringing them into the G8 club and the IMF because the world doesn't want a separate club just looking after the growing countries the same as it doesn't need an old club looking after the declining -- it needs a better club involving them both," O'Neill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that the lack of progress by the G8 and the Western leaders to change is really bad and is one of the biggest problems in the world today," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill says the combined GDP of the BRIC countries could overtake the combined economic might of the G7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detractors say optimistic predictions about the BRIC economies ignore major hurdles to their development such as future political instability, rampant corruption and decrepit infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists repeatedly forecast in the 1950s and 1960s that Brazil would become one of the world's top economic powers, only for its once-rapid growth to stall dramatically in the debt crisis of the 1980s and to stagnate throughout the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has said Russia will become one of the top five economies of the world by 2020, but admits the rule of law needs to be strengthened and corruption has to be rooted out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill said Russia should speed up some of its infrastructure projects and that corruption could sap Russia's economic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the core of it is a stronger self-confidence in a rule of law that everybody likes," he said. "In some ways Russia enjoys stability almost too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Russian people like stability which given Russia's history is very understandable and admirable but it should not come at the expense of things which are needed for private sector risk-taking, which are stronger property rights and a stronger rule of law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Michael Stott and Matthew Jones)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) warned on Sunday that Russian growth could soon slow to about 3 percent a year, far below Kremlin forecasts predicting Russia will be one of the world's top five economies by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim O'Neill, head of global economic research at Goldman Sachs, presented a study at a major investment forum showing growth would slow to 3.3 percent in 2010-2015 and to 2.9 percent in 2015-2020, much less than the 8.1 percent seen in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Russian officials seemed shocked by the figures in the presentation and Economy Minister Elvira Nabiullina said the numbers O'Neill had used were half current government forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know that a number of people that saw these numbers wanted to throw tomatoes and various other bits of fruit at me because they are very conservative assumptions for Russian GDP growth," O'Neill told his audience at the St Petersburg Economic Forum. "This is deliberately conservative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His estimates showed Russian nominal gross domestic product (GDP) would more than double to $3 trillion in 2020, becoming the world's eighth largest, from about $1.3 trillion in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has adopted an ambitious 12-year plan to propel Russia to fifth place in the world economic rankings by 2020. It currently ranks 11th in GDP, just after Brazil, according to the most recent World Bank data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to be big you have to have a lot of people working...and it certainly seems to us, definitely at the moment, that there are going to be less people working because the (Russian) population will be smaller in 2020 than it is today," O'Neill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's economy is booming for a tenth straight year amid record oil prices and soaring domestic demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But O'Neill said oil prices may not be high for ever and that for Russia to unlock more of its potential it needed to improve the rule of law, cut corruption and boost investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of the current fiscal position and the external balance of payments position, Russia scores particularly highly," he said. "I emphasize that I suspect that is greatly because of the benefits of the oil price and that might not always be the same."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill is the economist who coined the BRIC term to describe how the four rising economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China are likely to rival and overtake many of the West's leading economies over the next half century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Russia was at a significant disadvantage compared to the other BRIC countries because of its relatively small population, which some forecast will decline over the next decades from about 142 million today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is likely that between now and 2020 the increase in India's population will be over 300 million people, so in the next twelve years India will create more than double the number of people that are currently in Russia," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where Russia does not score too well is life expectancy, which links to the demographics, the rule of law and corruption," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that of all the BRICs, Russian would be the richest in 2020 with per capita income of about $21,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The R is higher than the B, I and the C, so for those involved in consumer and durable businesses this should be particularly good news because it suggests Russian people will continue to see their wealth rise rapidly," O'Neill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Michael Stott)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) wants roughly $6 billion in damages from larger rivals Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) in a long-running antitrust lawsuit, court documents made public on Monday show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claim was cited in court papers that previously were kept confidential in the case, first filed four years ago. Discover contends that Visa and MasterCard violated antitrust law and harmed Discover's business by preventing their member banks from issuing credit cards for Discover's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We remain very confident in our strong cases against both Visa and MasterCard that seek damages for the harm their anti-competitive practices have caused us," Discover said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Visa and MasterCard disputed Discover's damages claim, which could potentially be tripled if Discover prevails at trial. A trial has been set for September in U.S. District Court in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of damages sought by Discover "is dramatically overstated," San Francisco-based Visa said in a statement. MasterCard, based in Purchase, New York, said that Discover's damages claim "is baseless."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of all three companies were down in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Visa was down 3 percent, MasterCard was down 1.2 percent and Discover was down 2.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a Visa court filing, Discover has put forward a damages theory "that totals approximately $6 billion, before trebling, and is based upon multiple banks issuing credit or debit cards on the Discover network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2007, Visa agreed to settle a similar lawsuit with American Express Co (AXP.N) for about $2.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa previously placed $3 billion into a U.S. litigation escrow account with net proceeds from its March initial public offering -- funds that were withheld from its U.S. member banks' distribution in the IPO. The company said this account has been used to pay the American Express legal settlement and "will be used to pay for any future settlement of, or judgment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;in" other related litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover, formerly a unit of Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and American Express brought their lawsuits in 2004, soon after the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling in a lawsuit that found that Visa and MasterCard violated antitrust laws. That lawsuit had been filed by the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard stock was down 6.34 to $289.39 on Monday afternoon, Visa was down $2.53 to $81.12, and Discover was down 46 cents at $15.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Martha Graybow; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN (Reuters) - Four developing countries have appealed against the adoption of Microsoft's (MSFT.O) Office Open XML document format as an international standard, the International Organisation for Standardisation said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISO said in a statement the national standards bodies of Brazil, India, South Africa and Venezuela had appealed against the positive outcome of a vote it held in March after a controversial fast-track ratification process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gave no details of the substance of the appeals. At the time of the vote, several parties complained that the discussion and subsequent voting process was muddled and rushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaining the final ISO stamp of approval would help Microsoft win more public-sector contracts, as some government bodies are nervous about storing archives in a proprietary format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adoption of OOXML as an ISO standard will remain on hold until the appeals are resolved, which could take several months, ISO said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say OOXML is not fully translatable into other document formats, notably the open-source Open Document Format that is already recognized as an international standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISO's secretary-general and the general secretary of the International Electrotechnical Commission are considering the appeals and will submit them to their respective management boards for consideration by the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boards will then decide whether to proceed with the appeals process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  WALTHAM, MA, Jun 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Highlighting one of the major features of its Summer 2008 release, Awareness,
Inc.
today unveiled platform integration with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007
and Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0. This integration, developed by
workingwith Microsoft, brings the value of social media to Microsoft Office
SharePoint
Products and Technologies and enables users to directly engage with
Awareness-powered, external-facing Web 2.0 communities.

    Increasingly, many companies are turning to social media as a means to
participate in more transparent conversations with customers, prospects, and
partners. The scalable and searchable backend of Microsoft Office SharePoint
Server 2007 and Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 -- ideal for broad
information-sharing within an enterprise -- combined with Awareness'
expertise in powering social media communities, gives companies an effective way
to tie their internal collaboration closely to their external Web communities.

    This strategic relationship between Awareness and Microsoft is valuable
forusers that "live" in Microsoft Office SharePoint Products and Technologies
and need to
engage with groups outside the enterprise, such as customers, partners,
prospects,
etc. By integrating internal-facing environments with social networking
participation points from external-facing Web 2.0 communities, it becomes
much easier to pull valuable information into the enterprise where people can
use it.

    "This integration with Awareness communities extends the value of
MicrosoftOffice SharePoint Server 2007 and Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services
3.0,
allowing users to work in a much more social and collaborative way," said Deb
Bannon, senior product manager for Microsoft's SharePoint Server Partner Group.
"Companies are increasingly seeking to combine their internal collaboration
with customer-facing social media and social networking and this strategic
relationship with Awareness will allow them to do just that."

    As part of its broader widget strategy and integration with other third
party
offerings such as Facebook, Awareness has packaged its inventory of Web 2.0
widgets to operate as web parts. When Awareness creates a Web 2.0 community for
an
organization, it can provide the SharePoint Products and Technologies
administrators with a set of customizable web parts that they can add to
their sites. These web parts allow users to monitor community content (e.g.,
recent posts, most popular posts), contribute content (e.g., create a post,
start
or edit a wiki, start or respond to a discussion, etc.), display user details
and status, search content, and monitor community participation metrics directly
fromwithin SharePoint Products and Technologies.

    The integration makes possible the following features within Microsoft
Office
SharePoint Server 2007 and Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0:

    -- Dashboard of Awareness community activity;

    -- Integration with Microsoft identity management (Single Sign-On) allows
for a
seamless user experience;

    -- Integrated search of SharePoint Products and Technologies and Awareness
content;

    -- Access to Awareness community social networking functionalities,
including
people lists, updateable and customizable status and profile; and

    -- Enhanced user-generated content functionality, including voting and
commenting on content.

    "Our work with Microsoft extends the options for our customers to broadly
gather,
organize, and distribute content through the power of social media," said John
Bruce, CEO, Awareness. "Now organizations can integrate their Awareness-powered
Web
2.0 communities with SharePoint Products and Technologies, Facebook, and
literally any website through our widgets and APIs. This integration is a
natural step in extending the use of our platform into another environment to
further facilitate and enhance social media for the enterprise."

    About Awareness

    Awareness helps companies build and operate branded Web 2.0 communities.
These online
communities let customers, prospects, employees and partners connect with each
other and share content. At the core of the Awareness solution is an on-demand
social media platform that combines the full range of Web 2.0 technologies --
blogs, wikis, discussion groups, social networking, podcasts, RSS, tagging,
photos, videos, mapping, etc. -- with security, control, and content
moderation. Awareness builds these features into complete communities for
companies, or customers use the Awareness API and widgets to integrate Web
2.0 technologies into their own web properties. Major corporations such as
McDonald's, Kodak, the New York Times Company, Northwestern Mutual and Procter
&amp; Gamble use Awareness to build brand loyalty, generate revenue, drive new
forms of marketing, improve collaboration, encourage knowledge-sharing and build
a
"corporatememory." Find out more at http://www.awarenessnetworks.com.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst's comment about U.S. corn prices in paragraph
11, updates stock prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WINNIPEG, Manitoba, June 9 (Reuters) - Shares of Potash
Corp (POT.TO), the world's largest fertilizer company, surged
to a record high on Monday after Goldman Sachs said prices for
potash and phosphate should continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Potash stock rose as high as 5 percent to C$232.60 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday, and was up C$8.92 to $229.72
at midday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock has climbed 195 percent during the past year as
world grain prices rallied to historic highs, giving farmers
the ability and the incentive to apply more fertilizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, world supplies of potash and phosphate are
tight, propelling fertilizer prices to new peaks, which
prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its targets for Potash Corp and
competitor Mosaic Co (MOS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mosaic shares were up 6 percent or $8.07 at $141.43 in New
York on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We find the risk/reward still compelling and would be
aggressive buyers of (Mosaic) and (Potash)," wrote analyst
Edlain Rodriguez in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rodriguez raised his price target by $50 to $285 for Potash
Corp's New York-listed stock, which was up $7.58 at $224.43 on
Monday, and raised his 2008 earnings estimates to $11.50 per
share from $11.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He raised Mosaic's target by $30 to $195.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another analyst, who declined to be named, said confidence
in biofuel production was a bigger factor in the climb in
fertilizer makers' shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Potash stock has risen more than 9 percent since Thursday,
when a U.N. summit on high food prices focused on trade
barriers and aid rather than on cutting the use of food crops
for ethanol production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A third analyst, who also declined attribution, said
flooding in the U.S. Midwest, which sent U.S. spot corn futures
to a record high on Monday, propelled fertilizer shares
higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his report, Rodriguez said it was a "matter of time"
before Canpotex, which exports for Potash Corp, Mosaic and
Agrium Inc (AGU.TO), raised potash prices to $1,000 per tonne,
a level already being charged by Russian competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canpotex has already raised prices to Brazil and Southeast
Asia to $750 per tonne, and has contracts with major consumers
China and India for $650 and $625 a tonne, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In our view, once global prices reach the $1,000, prices
in China and India will eventually reach that level once their
contracts are up for renewals," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Rodriguez said he expects potash producers would give
customers time to absorb the change before more price hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=$1.02 Canadian)

of its Kikeh project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said beginning in 2009, the oil producer and
refiner will face accelerated cost recovery and therefore lower
realizations for the Kikeh site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kikeh is Murphy Oil's flagship project in Malaysia and
under a production sharing contract, supplemental payments will
be made when the crude oil selling price is higher than a
contractual base price, determined at the time of the contract
signing and escalated annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Supplemental payments need to be made to the contractor and
the government once the company has recovered its capital
costs. High crude oil prices have accelerated cost recovery at
Murphy's Kikeh project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Murphy will have recovered its initial $1.8 billion in
capital costs from Kikeh by the end of 2008, meaning that the
supplemental payments for Kikeh will be payable beginning in
early 2009," the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once costs are recovered, supplemental payment is expected
to have a significant impact on oil price realizations for
Kikeh, essentially resulting in a windfall profits "take"
across nearly one-third of Murphy's production, reducing
earnings by 15 percent in 2009 and 20 percent in 2010, the
brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Assuming production of 70 kbpd of crude oil and a tax rate
of 38 percent in Malaysia, the supplement payments result in an
after-tax reduction in earnings and cash flow of about $350
million annually, or about $1.80 a share, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a separate research note, Goldman Sachs added Murphy Oil
to its "Americas Buy List", saying it believes Murphy's shares
will be major beneficiaries of Goldman's bullish crude oil
view, as the company is also in the midst of a major volume
ramp-up at the Kikeh field in deepwater Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were up about 3 percent at $96.01 in
midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;June 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Investment
Technology Group Inc (ITG.N), an agency brokerage and
technology firm, to "neutral" from "sell" and removed it from
the America's sell list on valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs had added Investment Technology Group to the
sell list in January. The brokerage said the stock has declined
19 percent since, and now reflects its expectation for
softening market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which has a price target of $45 on the
stock, said it expects growth in international revenue to be
quicker than that in the United States. Increasing business in
Europe and Asia should help earnings growth over the next few
years, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Investment Technology Group were trading down 2.4
percent at $38.35 on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co.'s (JPM.N) takeover of Bear Stearns might have looked like a smart buy at fire-sale prices three months ago, but it won't be good for shareholders, a well-known banking analyst said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon was hailed in March for stepping in to snap up Bear Stearns at $2 a share -- a sale price that was later revised to $10, or about $1.5 billion. The higher price was still considered cheap at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fact that the only asset that JPMorgan talks about now is Bear Stearns' headquarters on Madison Avenue says a lot, analyst Richard Bove of Ladenburg Thalmann  Co, a Miami-based brokerage and investment bank, told the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders will bear the brunt of a bad deal, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jamie Dimon did one for the United States. He's a patriot -- but he didn't do one for JPMorgan," Bove said. "I respect Jamie Dimon for buying the company -- he did a patriotic thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns lost about $1 billion in recent years, and since the takeover was announced March 17 the bank has lost about 40 percent of its customers, Bove said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's not getting anything that will add to JPMorgan's profits. Bear Stearns should have gone bankrupt because there's nothing there (but) a great building in New York -- big deal!" Bove said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon in May said JPMorgan faced many significant and some unknown risks from the Bear takeover. He disclosed that the cost of shedding Bear assets, litigation expenses and other merger-related costs would soar to $9 billion, or 50 percent more than earlier estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jamie Dimon is very candid to tell you that this company is not going to make any significant money for the next year," Bove said. "Basically speaking, JPMorgan is at risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Kaiser Permanente, the biggest health maintenance organization in the United States, announced a pilot program on Monday to link patient records to Microsoft Corp's consumer health platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test will initially be limited to Kaiser employees who volunteer to have their records transferred, but access could be widened to the HMO's 8.7 million members later this year, said Anna-Lisa Silvestre, vice president of online services at Kaiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said more than 2 million members have signed up to use Kaiser's own online health records service, My Health Manager, and the agreement with Microsoft will dramatically expand availability of online health information, services and tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People today do a lot of things for their health outside of a formal healthcare system," Silvestre said, adding that the HMO is looking for ways to help members improve their health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser is the first large health provider to link to the Microsoft health platform, called HealthVault, but Microsoft "expects to connect with lots and lots of source data providers," said Peter Neupert, vice president of Microsoft's Health Solutions Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the Microsoft platform currently offers about 30 tools for consumers, with more to be announced this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival Google Inc last month unveiled Google Health, a U.S. health information service that combines the leading Web company's classic search services with a user's personal health records online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser and Microsoft, as well as Google, said their sites adhere to federal standards for data exchange and include advanced safeguards to protect members' personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CapMed Connects Its Award-Winning Personal Health Record Technology with Microsoft HealthVault

  Strategic relationship with Microsoft helps ensure that consumers'
 critical health information is available when and where it is needed
                                 most
NEWTOWN, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
CapMed, a Division of Bio-Imaging Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:
BITI), a leader in interactive personal health management solutions,
will demonstrate how its onlinePHR(TM) and icePHR(TM) products connect
with Microsoft HealthVault (www.healthvault.com), Microsoft's consumer
health platform, at the HealthVault Solutions Conference, June 9-10,
2008, in Bellevue, WA. CapMed's onlinePHR provides consumers with
robust health management tools, while its icePHR provides consumers
with an in case of emergency (ice) personal health record (PHR)
designed for use in emergencies.

   "CapMed's strategic relationship with Microsoft, which was
announced at the launch of HealthVault in October 2007, will give
millions of Americans greater access to their personal health records
- a move that promises to empower patients with better control of and
access to their health information, bridging the pervasive information
gaps that exist between patients, clinicians and
institutions," said Wendy Angst, General Manager for CapMed
(www.capmed.com). "CapMed's onlinePHR and icePHR work with Microsoft
HealthVault to provide consumers with private and timely access to
personal health information in a security-enhanced environment,
virtually whenever and wherever they need it. By collaborating with
HealthVault, we know that CapMed's products will provide consumers
with a personal health record that is secure and accessible from any
computer."

   CapMed's subscription-based onlinePHR allows consumers to better
manage their health information online with the simple click of a
mouse and a secure ID and password. Once within onlinePHR, consumers
can take advantage of multiple tools and features to manage their
family's information, including email reminders and alerts for
preventive care, drug interaction checks, risk assessments, common
medical forms, and even the ability to import data from remote
healthcare monitoring devices. Consumers also have the ability to
authorize providers, family members, and caregivers to view all or
part of the data within the PHR and to transfer their medical
information to multiple physician practices.

   With CapMed's icePHR, consumers update personal health information
through a secure, password-protected, personalized Web site accessible
from any computer. Consumers receive a unique web address for
accessing securely stored information, and providing access to
emergency personnel for themselves and up to 10 family members. Such
information can range from demographics and blood type to allergies,
conditions, medications, implantable devices, health insurance
information, emergency contacts and active health orders such as the
existence of a living will. Consumers can also depend on icePHR
technology when they fill out or update health and medical forms at
physician practices, schools and the workplace.

   "CapMed's icePHR, with HealthVault, gives consumers peace-of-mind
that they can access and make available their critical health data to
people they trust - when and as needed," said David Cerino, general
manager, Microsoft Health Solutions Group. "Innovative solutions like
icePHR are critical to improving the quality of care."

   HealthVault is a free Web-based platform designed to put people in
control of their health data. It provides people with a choice of
third-party applications and devices to help them manage things such
as fitness, diet and health. HealthVault also provides a privacy- and

from medical providers and health and wellness device manufactures to
health associations - can build innovative new health and wellness
management solutions to help put people in control of their own health
and the health of their families.

   The unique features and benefits of CapMed's PHR have earned the
company the Best PHR Award at the 2006, 2007 and 2008 sessions of the
Toward an Electronic Patient Record (TEPR) conference, sponsored by
the Medical Records Institute.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - CIT Group, (CIT.N) a commercial finance company struggling to secure funding for billions of dollars of debt maturing this year, said on Monday it has secured $3 billion of financing from Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's share price climbed 11 percent on the announcement to $10.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said the facility has a 15-year average life and is tied to securities originated by CIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vince Breitenbach, analyst at Barclays Capital, said the cost of the facility "looks a bit expensive" at $85 million a year whether or not CIT uses the funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breitenbach noted the transaction was not one of the many financing options the company had previously discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think they are trying to show that there are lenders out there that have confidence in the company," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, CIT drew down on its entire $7.3 billion of bank lines, $2 billion of which come due in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a conference last week, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Leone said CIT was just over halfway toward selling its railcar leasing business and was also considering the sale of part of its portfolio of subprime mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breitenbach said he expects the railcar business to be sold in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $3 billion financing, coupled with the railcar business sale "probably gets them pretty far in to next year," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lease financing company GATX Corp is understood to be among the parties looking at buying CIT's railcar leasing business. GATX, based in Chicago, controls one of the largest railcar fleets in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay, editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 9 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan raised Eaton Corp (ETN.N) to
"overweight" from "neutral," saying the diversified
manufacturer is more positive on the outlook for certain end
markets than most industrial companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said Eaton expects non-residential
construction to grow mid-single digits in 2008 and be modestly
positive in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current commodity price levels are baked into the company's
current outlook and most of its industrial peers appear to be
struggling with rapidly rising input cost, J.P. Morgan said in
a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also raised its second-quarter and 2008
profit estimates for Eaton, whose product lines include
electrical power distribution and control equipment, engine
components, and hydraulic and fluid power products for
aerospace, automotive, and other industrial uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan has a price target of $110 on the stock, which
closed at $93.37 Friday on New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Oil prices are likely to hit $150 a barrel this summer season, the global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs said on Monday, as tighter supplies outweigh weakening demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I would suggest that the likelihood of that happening sooner has increased tremendously ... sometime in summer," Jeffrey Currie told an oil and gas conference in the Malaysian capital, referring to oil at $150 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most active investment bank in energy markets and one of the first to point to triple-digit oil more than two years ago -- a once unthinkable level -- said last month oil could shoot up to $200 within the next two years as part of a "super spike."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecasts that oil could head towards $150 and above have multiplied over the past month as prices broke through several records, the latest being last Friday, when oil soared more than $11 a barrel on Friday, its biggest one-day gain ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil hit an all-time high of $139.12 on Friday on the back of a weak U.S. dollar and mounting tensions between Israel and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs forecast almost a month ago that U.S. crude would average $141 a barrel in the second half of 2008, up from a previous projection of $107, due to tight supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Demand for oil is weak but supplies are even weaker," Jeffrey Currie told the conference, citing supply disruptions in Nigeria and struggling output rise in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment bank Morgan Stanley, another big Wall Street energy player, said on Friday that crude may reach $150 by July 4 due to robust Asian demand and falling inventories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Chua Baizhen, writing by Maryelle Demongeot; Editing by Ben Tan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  WALTHAM, MA, Jun 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Highlighting one of the major features of its Summer 2008 release, Awareness,
Inc.,
today unveiled platform integration with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007
and Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0. This integration, developed by
working with Microsoft, brings the value of social media to Microsoft Office
SharePoint Products and Technologies and enables users to directly engage
with Awareness-powered, external-facing Web 2.0 communities.

    Increasingly, many companies are turning to social media as a means to
participate in more transparent conversations with customers, prospects, and
partners. The scalable and searchable backend of Microsoft Office SharePoint
Server 2007 and Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 -- ideal for broad
information-sharing within an enterprise -- combined with Awareness'
expertise in powering social media communities, gives companies an effective way
to tie their internal collaboration closely to their external Web communities.

    This strategic relationship between Awareness and Microsoft is valuable
forusers that "live" in Microsoft Office SharePoint Products and Technologies
and need to
engage with groups outside the enterprise, such as customers, partners,
prospects,
etc. By integrating internal-facing environments with social networking
participation points from external-facing Web 2.0 communities, it becomes
much easier to pull valuable information into the enterprise where people can
use it.

    "This integration with Awareness communities extends the value of
MicrosoftOffice SharePoint Server 2007 and Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services
3.0,
allowing users to work in a much more social and collaborative way," said Deb
Bannon, senior product manager for Microsoft's SharePoint Server Partner Group.
"Companies are increasingly seeking to combine their internal collaboration
with customer-facing social media and social networking and this strategic
relationship with Awareness will allow them to do just that."

    As part of its broader widget strategy and integration with other third
party
offerings such as Facebook, Awareness has packaged its inventory of Web 2.0
widgets to operate as web parts. When Awareness creates a Web 2.0 community for
an
organization, it can provide the SharePoint Products and Technologies
administrators with a set of customizable web parts that they can add to
their sites. These web parts allow users to monitor community content (e.g.,
recent posts, most popular posts), contribute content (e.g., create a post,
start
or edit a wiki, start or respond to a discussion, etc.), display user details
and status, search content, and monitor community participation metrics directly
fromwithin SharePoint Products and Technologies.

    The integration makes possible the following features within Microsoft
Office
SharePoint Server 2007 and Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0:

    -- Dashboard of Awareness community activity;

    -- Integration with Microsoft identity management (Single Sign-On) allows
for a
seamless user experience;

    -- Integrated search of SharePoint Products and Technologies and Awareness
content;

    -- Access to Awareness community social networking functionalities,
including
people lists, updateable and customizable status and profile; and

    -- Enhanced user-generated content functionality, including voting and
commenting on content.

    "Our work with Microsoft extends the options for our customers to broadly
gather,
organize, and distribute content through the power of social media," said John
Bruce, CEO, Awareness. "Now organizations can integrate their Awareness-powered
Web
2.0 communities with SharePoint Products and Technologies, Facebook, and
literally any website through our widgets and APIs. This integration is a
natural step in extending the use of our platform into another environment to
further facilitate and enhance social media for the enterprise."

    About Awareness

    Awareness helps companies build and operate branded Web 2.0 communities.
These online
communities let customers, prospects, employees and partners connect with each
other and share content. At the core of the Awareness solution is an on-demand
social media platform that combines the full range of Web 2.0 technologies --
blogs, wikis, discussion groups, social networking, podcasts, RSS, tagging,
photos, videos, mapping, etc. -- with security, control, and content
moderation. Awareness builds these features into complete communities for
companies, or customers use the Awareness API and widgets to integrate Web
2.0 technologies into their own web properties. Major corporations such as
McDonald's, Kodak, the New York Times Company, Northwestern Mutual and Procter
&amp; Gamble use Awareness to build brand loyalty, generate revenue, drive new
forms of marketing, improve collaboration, encourage knowledge-sharing and build
a
"corporatememory." Find out more at http://www.awarenessnetworks.com.

&lt;p&gt;Company to Showcase Its Integrative Health and Productivity
        Offering at Microsoft HealthVault Solutions Conference
BELLEVUE, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Limeade, Inc., an online employee wellness company, was selected
as a main stage presenter at Microsoft's HealthVault Solutions
Conference. The Limeade solution will demonstrate how they seamlessly
incorporate health assessment, goal tracking, fitness monitoring,
biometric screening and additional data from HealthVault partner
services into a cohesive user experience -- one that boosts employee
productivity and helps control employer health spending.

   "Effective wellness solutions must be engaging and easy to use --
they have to fit with the way people live," said Henry Albrecht,
Limeade's CEO. "Working with HealthVault helps us deliver an
experience that employees not only use but like, and that creates a
healthier, happier and more productive workforce for employers. We
provide companies with a range of leading devices and services from
other HealthVault partners in a seamless, private, secure way."

   "Limeade gives us a glimpse of what is possible with HealthVault.
They embody the type of innovation Microsoft loves to support," said
David Cerino, general manager, Microsoft Health Solutions Group.
"Limeade fits in well with HealthVault because it connects products
and services from like-minded companies passionate about employee
health, productivity and performance."

   Limeade was selected for a main stage presentation at the
HealthVault Solutions Conference due to its ability to integrate other
HealthVault partners' data in an engaging, easy-to-use interface.
Leveraging HealthVault's secure information sharing capabilities,
Limeade brings together previously independent wellness data from
services including health coaching, biometric screening and fitness
tracking into a cohesive user experience. Employees can view combined
health information using Limeade, allowing for better goal setting,
targeted improvement plans, and ultimately improved productivity.
Employers can use aggregate information to optimize performance or
address key health cost drivers -- which vary by company.

   Limeade's demonstration during the HealthVault Solutions
Conference will show how a typical person might benefit from this
approach. The demo combines a Limeade health assessment with blood
test data from a biometric screening company to provide people with
the most accurate picture of their health. With the assistance of a
health coach, a user can then set achievable goals in Limeade's goal
tracking system. Finally, activity data from fitness tracking devices
such as Omron(TM) pedometers and Polar(TM) heart rate monitors flows
through HealthVault to Limeade, making progress tracking as easy as
wearing a watch.

   "Before HealthVault, bringing together data from disparate health
information systems was difficult for us as a small software company,
and it was impossible for ordinary people," said Albrecht. "Now,
individuals and companies can gain fresh insights into their health
and have access to the tools to start improving."

   HealthVault is a free Web-based platform designed to put people in
control of their health data. It helps them collect, store and share
health information with family members and participating healthcare
providers, and it provides people with a choice of third-party
applications and devices to help them manage things such as fitness,
diet and health. HealthVault also provides a privacy- and
security-enhanced foundation on which a broad ecosystem of providers
-- from medical providers and health and wellness device manufactures
to health associations -- can build innovative new health and wellness
management solutions to help put people in control of their and their
family's health.

   Limeade brings together its evidence-based assessment and

person accomplish the goals they set, Limeade connects with physical
activity data from a Polar heart rate monitor or an Omron pedometer.
Information flows back into Limeade through HealthVault, making
tracking life-changing health goals as easy as going for a walk.

   "Our pedometers make it easier for people to monitor their daily
progress toward achieving a healthier lifestyle," said Ranndy Kellogg,
Vice President Marketing and Product Development for Omron. "They're a
plug-and-play part of an effective wellness program."

   "Regardless of one's age or athletic ability, a Polar heart rate
monitor enables a person to exercise at the right intensity level to
achieve their health and fitness goals," said Jeff Padovan, President
of Polar.

   "PWN's webLAB makes it safe, easy and affordable for HealthVault
users to order general wellness lab tests," said John Eastman,
business development for Physicians Wellness Network. "Consumers no
longer need to go through the lengthy and often expensive process of
scheduling multiple doctor appointments."

&lt;p&gt;WorkLight Announces Strategic Relationship with Microsoft to Bridge Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 with Consumer Web 2.0

     New product to allow employees to use Windows Live, iGoogle,
      Facebook and other popular Internet tools to interface with
              Microsoft's enterprise collaboration suite
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
WorkLight(TM) Inc. today launched a new product that allows
employees, for the first time, to securely access and update Microsoft
Office SharePoint Server 2007 information using popular Internet
consumer tools. Titled "WorkLight for SharePoint," the new offering
combines the consumer Web experience and Office SharePoint Server 2007
to deliver secure, enterprise-class collaboration tools with an
easy-to-use interface of familiar tools like Windows Live, iGoogle,
Facebook and others.

   This announcement, made at the Enterprise 2.0 Conference in Boston
as part of a new strategic relationship between WorkLight and
Microsoft, marks yet another milestone in the introduction of consumer
Web 2.0 technologies into the corporate world.

   WorkLight for SharePoint addresses both enterprise and employee
needs by combining the collaborative capabilities of Office SharePoint
Server 2007 with popular consumer social networks such as Facebook,
personalized homepage gadgets, desktop widgets, RSS, mobile devices
and more. Companies can now take advantage of SharePoint Server 2007's
collaboration, portal, enterprise search, enterprise content
management, business intelligence and business process capabilities
using popular consumer Web-based gadgets - the same type of gadgets
they use in their personal lives.

   "By bridging SharePoint's social computing and enterprise search
capabilities with popular consumer Web 2.0 services, employees and
enterprises benefit from the best of both worlds," said Deb Bannon,
senior product manager for Microsoft's SharePoint Server Partner
Group. "WorkLight's latest offering enhances SharePoint's highly
popular collaboration platform by extending its reach to familiar
consumer tools such as Windows Live and others. We are excited to work
together with WorkLight in allowing employees and partners to do
business with Web 2.0 securely."

   With WorkLight for SharePoint, companies and employees are able
to:

   --  Access SharePoint Server 2007 information such as document
        updates and contact information via consumer Web-based and
        desktop gadgets, running on a wide variety of platforms - e.g.
        Windows Live, Vista Sidebar, iGoogle, Netvibes, etc., or from
        within Facebook

   --  Receive notifications originating from SharePoint Server 2007
        on mobile devices such as iPhone and BlackBerry

   --  View and revise enterprise application data from secure
        gadgets running as SharePoint Server 2007 Web Parts, enabling
        employees to perform daily tasks like time reporting, task
        acknowledgement and purchase approvals right from their
        SharePoint Server 2007 dashboard

   --  Search for colleagues and expertise in the organization across
        both SharePoint Server 2007 and Facebook, using WorkLight's
        secure Facebook application, WorkBook

   "With 96 percent of enterprises considering or having already
deployed at least some part of Microsoft Office System server software
according to Forrester Research, it's only natural that we merge
WorkLight's unique capabilities with Microsoft's SharePoint," said
David Lavenda, VP marketing &amp; product strategy, WorkLight. "Doing so
allows companies to harness its industry-leading collaboration
features, while giving employees familiar, secure interfaces through

&lt;p&gt;Synchronization of Health Information Opens New Possibilities for
Personal Health Management, Allows Consumers to Streamline Portability
                         of Their Health Data
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
WorldDoc, Inc. today announced the integration of its consumer
care management systems with Microsoft HealthVault, Microsoft Corp.'s
consumer health platform. Now users of WorldDoc's systems will be able
to pull data from their personal HealthVault record into WorldDoc's
systems, as well as make updates to their HealthVault record from
within the WorldDoc system. The enhanced accessibility and portability
of health information resulting from this coordination opens new
possibilities for improved and personalized health management.

   HealthVault is a free, web-based platform designed to put
individuals in control of their health data. It helps them collect,
store and share health information with family members and
participating health care providers. HealthVault provides a privacy-
and security-enhanced foundation that providers of wellness and care
management solutions, such as WorldDoc, can connect to in order to
synchronize health data. The individual consumer determines what
information is stored in the HealthVault record and who is allowed
access to that information.

   WorldDoc's solutions allow consumers to make better health care
decisions, leading to decreased costs and improved health. The core
component of WorldDoc's consumer care management systems, WorldDoc
24/7, is an intuitive, interactive personal health management
application that empowers users to evaluate symptoms, understand their
health issues, assess health risks and take steps to decrease those
risks. WorldDoc 24/7 collects, analyzes and integrates a user's
medical, prescription and personal health data to provide a
comprehensive care management solution that includes personalized
medical goals, care gap identification and communication with
targeted, actionable treatment suggestions. Integration with
HealthVault greatly increases the relevance and effectiveness of the
interventions and decision support that WorldDoc users receive.

   "The ability to synchronize health data between the HealthVault
and WorldDoc systems enhances our users' experience, because they can
now manage their health data from multiple sources," said Rahul
Singal, MD, president and CEO of WorldDoc, Inc. "For example, WorldDoc
members can integrate blood pressure and heart rate data from
HealthVault compatible devices into WorldDoc's system which then
provides up to date, targeted recommendations to the member."

   "WorldDoc's consumer application helps make health data
understandable to consumers," said Peter Neupert, corporate vice
president for the Health Solutions Group at Microsoft Corp. "Both of
our organizations strive to empower the health care consumer to take
control of their health care via actionable information. Through our
cooperative efforts, we will further enable people to make informed
choices regarding their health by putting them in control of their
health information."

&lt;p&gt;Springbok Now Offers Visa-Branded Prepaid Card Programs
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. &amp; SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Springbok Services, Inc. and Visa Inc. have forged an agreement
that now enables Springbok to offer Visa-branded prepaid card
programs. The addition of the Visa brand allows Springbok to pass
along Visa-specific advantages to its clients, which use Springbok
prepaid cards for reward, incentive, promotion and rebate programs.
Springbok prepaid card programs are designed to positively motivate
behavior and enhance loyalty among corporate employees and/or their
customers.

   Springbok prepaid card programs are tailor-made to support the
business goals of each individual client. Human resource, sales,
marketing and management professionals appreciate Springbok's
all-encompassing service offering, from program and card design to
manufacturing and fulfillment to reporting and program measurement. By
offering Visa-branded prepaid cards, Springbok expands its service
offering and now provides clients access to benefits that only Visa
provides through Visa-sponsored discounts and promotions.

   "Adding Visa to our product portfolio extends the features and
benefits we are able to pass along to our clients, and underscores our
reputation as a highly trusted vendor," said Taylor Ohlsen, CEO,
Springbok Services. "We value our relationship with Visa and each of
our clients, and expect this addition to our service offering to be
mutually beneficial for everyone."

   According to an August 2007 survey conducted by the Network
Branded Prepaid Card Association (NBPCA), of which Springbok is a
founding member, reloadable prepaid cards are quickly gaining
popularity due to the following advantages they provide:

   --  Security - Consumers value safeguards such as funds
        replacement if their card is lost or stolen, reduced need to
        carry large amounts of cash, and ability to shop online with
        less exposure to their lines of credit or funds in their
        checking accounts.

   --  Convenience - Prepaid cards enable card carriers to pay for
        purchases almost anywhere.

   --  Control - Prepaid cards offer the ability to budget and track
        spending, and thus avoid over-spending, overdrafts and
        interest charges.

   "Visa prepaid cards are an innovative solution for businesses to
provide employee and customer incentives, and are an effective tool to
help meet rebate and promotional objectives," said Brian Triplett,
global head of prepaid products, Visa Inc. "We look forward to working
closely with Springbok Services to offer prepaid solutions that best
meet the needs of their unique customer base."

   Visa prepaid card programs from Springbok are issued by Meta
Payment Systems, a division of MetaBank.

   About Springbok Services

   Springbok Services has been a leading provider of customized
MasterCard(R) and Visa(R) prepaid card programs since its inception in
1998. End-to-end creation and management of these programs uniquely

&lt;p&gt;New Connector Will Allow Patients to Use Two Online Services to
      Centralize and Share Information and Manage Personal Health
NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The TriZetto Group Inc. (NASDAQ: TZIX) today announced an
agreement with Microsoft Corp. under which TriZetto will develop a
connector for its payer customers that enables members of health plans
to use TriZetto's Member Benefit Profile(TM) application with
Microsoft HealthVault(TM).

   The Member Benefit Profile software gives plan members a
Web-based, personalized healthcare financial statement. A display
summarizes information about health status, medical treatments,
insurance claims, remaining deductibles, status of pre-authorizations,
reimbursements and medical account fund balances, available online or
as a hard-copy. HealthVault is a secure Web-based platform that helps
patients collect, store and share health information with family
members and participating healthcare providers. It brings together
third-party applications and tools that enable individuals to manage
their fitness, diet and health.

   TriZetto will make the connector between the Member Benefit
Profile application and HealthVault available to its payer customers
later this year.

   "This agreement is another example of our commitment to enabling
Integrated Healthcare Management (IHM), the systematic application of
processes and shared information to optimize the coordination of
benefits and care for the consumer," said Jeff Hensley, chief
technology officer at TriZetto. "With IHM, we empower consumers with
tools to take a more active role in managing their own health and care
through access to information. The connector between the Member
Benefit Profile software and HealthVault will provide improved
portability of information for consumers, as well as provide a health
information portability solution for payers that will enhance their
ability to serve employer groups."

   "Today's health plans face significant challenges when it comes to
getting and keeping consumers engaged in their health," said Dennis
Schmuland, MD, health plan industry solutions director for Microsoft's
U.S. health and life sciences group. "By giving consumers the option
to use the Member Benefit Profile application within their HealthVault
accounts, TriZetto is enabling health plans to engage and keep
consumers engaged within the context of their digital lifestyles."

   TriZetto and Microsoft may extend their association to other
online tools for consumers. TriZetto software and technology services
are used by more than 350 payer organizations covering some 150
million people in the United States.

&lt;p&gt;Updates to Check Point SmartDefense services secure enterprise
                     networks from latest attacks
REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Check Point(R) Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq:CHKP), the
worldwide leader in securing the Internet, today announced that
through Check Point SmartDefense(R) services, users of VPN-1(R) NGX
R62, NGX R65, and VSX NGX R65 gateways are protected from new
Microsoft vulnerabilities disclosed today. SmartDefense subscribers
gain immediate protection against Active Directory, Pragmatic General
Multicast (PGM), DirectX, WINS, and ActiveX vulnerabilities well
before deploying the patches provided by Microsoft.

   The vulnerabilities were announced today in Microsoft Security
Bulletin for June and affect users of Microsoft Windows based
desktops, laptops and servers (for a full list of vulnerable products
visit: www.microsoft.com/technet/security/current.aspx). When
exploited, the vulnerabilities allow remote hackers to execute
malicious code on a targeted system and denial of service (DoS)
attacks.

   "It often takes several weeks for enterprises to deploy patches on
all their Microsoft machines," said Juliette Sultan, head of global
marketing at Check Point. "Businesses cannot afford to go unprotected
for so long. Check Point SmartDefense services close an attacker's
window of opportunity by providing immediate protection against the
latest threats."

   Check Point released SmartDefense updates for the following
vulnerabilities announced today by Microsoft:

   --  Active Directory vulnerability (Microsoft Security Bulletin
        MS08-035)

   --  Pragmatic General Multicast vulnerabilities (MS08-036)

   --  DirectX vulnerability (MS08-033)

   --  WINS vulnerability (MS08-034)

   --  Speach API ActiveX vulnerability (MS08-032)

   Check Point's SmartDefense services maintain the most current
preemptive security for the Check Point security infrastructure. To
help defenses stay continuously ahead of today's constantly evolving
threat landscape, SmartDefense provides ongoing and real-time updates
and configuration advisories for defenses and security policies.

   More information about the vulnerabilities and SmartDefense
protections can be found at Check Point's Microsoft Security website:

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. said on Tuesday it 
expects retail sales of licensed merchandise to top $30 billion 
worldwide in fiscal 2008, helped by its popular Disney Princess 
and High School Musical brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Last year, the company said its sales of licensed Disney 
merchandise rose to $27 billion, more than doubling from five 
years earlier. Disney receives a licensing fee, usually between 
8 percent and 10 percent, of total retail sales of product 
associated with its brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retail sales of merchandise aimed at "tweens" -- children 
aged 9 to 12 -- such as the Disney Channel's High School 
Musical and Hannah Montana, is expected to surge to $2.7 
billion in fiscal 2008 from $400 million a year earlier, Disney 
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney also projected that its Fairies and Princess 
franchises aimed at younger girls would reach $5 billion, and 
that merchandise based on the hit Disney-Pixar film "Cars" 
would reach $2.5 billion in worldwide retail sales this fiscal 
year, which closes in the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares rose 1.5 percent to $33.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Paul Thomasch in New York and Gina Keating in

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney will stream full-length movies on its Web site for the first time, as part of its "Wonderful World of Disney" series on ABC. The films are scheduled to stream through August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Finding Nemo" is available at www.Disney.com/WWoD (www.Disney.com/WWoD) through Friday, after the film's airing Saturday on Disney-owned ABC. "Monsters, Inc.," "Haunted Mansion," "Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen," "Princess Diaries 2," "Freaky Friday" and "Peter Pan" also will be available on the site this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney spokesman said the decision to stream movies for free marks an "evolution" in the company's online strategy. Fox, Universal, Lionsgate and MGM have all previously placed titles on Hulu, the NBC Universal/News Corp.-owned site, while Disney has gone the pay route and kept its films, for the most part, on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Channel does, though, stream episodes of its series online for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesman said that the "advertising strategy has not been finalized" for the films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movies will be on Disney.com from Monday through Friday after their ABC broadcast the preceding Saturday night as "Wonderful World of Disney" presentations. "Peter Pan" will be the last movie to stream, ending its run August 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney.com also will stream the Disney Channel original movie "Camp Rock" on June 23 at www.Disney.com/CampRock for a 24-hour window after its June 20 TV premiere and subsequent airings June 21 on ABC and June 22 on ABC Family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team Protects Users from Latest
        Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer Vulnerabilities
COLUMBIA, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Open source innovator and SNORT(R) creator, Sourcefire, Inc.
(Nasdaq:FIRE), a leader in Enterprise Threat Management, announced
that the Sourcefire(R) Vulnerability Research Team (VRT) has delivered
rules to protect Sourcefire customers and Snort users from six
Microsoft vulnerabilities disclosed today. These vulnerabilities
impact Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer.

   "In the first half of 2008, we saw a number of serious
vulnerabilities that could create significant security issues for
today's dynamic businesses," said Matt Watchinski, Director of the
Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team. "Detection and patching are
essential to protecting against the latest identified vulnerabilities,
but only a proactive approach to securing assets from unknown threats
can truly safeguard an organization's most critical assets.
Sourcefire's innovative solutions, backed by the VRT's leading-edge
discovery and response, provide customers and open source users with
the tools to protect their networks, even when the threat has not yet
been identified."

   Following Microsoft's disclosure earlier today, the Sourcefire VRT
created, tested and delivered Snort rules designed to detect attacks
targeting the Microsoft vulnerabilities listed below. These new rules
are included in the latest Sourcefire Security Enhancement Update
(SEU) released today.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-031 -- Critical
        vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution or
        information disclosure if a user viewed a specially crafted
        Web page using Internet Explorer.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-032 -- A moderate
        vulnerability in the Microsoft Speech API could allow remote
        code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Web page
        using Internet Explorer and has the Speech Recognition feature
        in Windows enabled.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-033 -- Critical
        vulnerabilities in Microsoft DirectX could allow remote code
        execution if a user opens a specially crafted media file. An
        attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities
        could take complete control of an affected system.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-034 -- An important
        vulnerability in the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
        could allow elevation of privilege. A local attacker who
        successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete
        control of an affected system.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-035 -- An important
        vulnerability in implementations of Active Directory could be
        exploited to allow an attacker to cause a denial of service
        condition. An attacker who successfully exploited this
        vulnerability could cause the system to stop responding or
        automatically restart.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-036 -- Important
        vulnerabilities in the Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM)
        protocol could allow a denial of service if malformed PGM
        packets are received by an affected system. An attacker who
        successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a user's
        system to become non-responsive and require a restart to
        restore functionality.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. economy faces a mild recession at worst, given the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate cuts and various liquidity programs, Goldman Sachs' senior investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cohen told the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York that these moves should help the benchmark Standard  Poor's 500 index end the year with a fair value at 1,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she has been "extraordinarily impressed" with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and the U.S. central bank's performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think that the second half of this year is really the point at which we should start to see some benefit, if there is going to be a benefit," Cohen said. "We think that there will be, but I think that some were simply not patient enough."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen, known in the business world as one of Wall Street's most respected and influential stock analysts, began her career as an economist at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's fair to say it will not be as deep a recession, if it is a recession, as many people had feared not that long ago. There certainly is not a black hole developing in the U.S. economy," Cohen said. "Also, it is entirely possible we will not have a single quarter of negative GDP."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is little inflation pressure from wages, she said, commodity prices are a "complicating factor." She said the United States is importing commodity price inflation from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a Fed that now has to worry about the global economy. Are we importing inflation from elsewhere? Well, yes we are," she said. "As a result what we import will become more expensive. ... Can the Fed address this directly? No, it can't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Cohen said, U.S. equity markets are not pricing in some of the better news. She said her 1,500 forecast for the SP 500 assumes interest rate increases and includes low earnings expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the SP 500 was trading at 1,356.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen, whose forecasts for the end of 2007 were too optimistic, said she had underestimated the severity of the credit crisis, and said that, like the Fed, she is watching further developments carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said U.S. exporters are doing quite well and that is helping boost multinational technology companies in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you take a look at things like technology, which have been among the better performers, this is something that we had expected and we expect will continue," she said. She added that while U.S. companies have cut some kinds of expenditures, they are still spending for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen also believes energy securities should continue to do well as the long-term bias for oil prices is higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kristina Cooke; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Jun 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Enterprise 2.0 -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the next wave of social
networking tools for business. Lotus Connections 2.0 and IBM Atlas for Lotus
Connections feature a mix of new capabilities that blend IBM's expertise in
business software with the Web 2.0 capabilities popular in consumer social
networking Web sites.

    The newest version of IBM Lotus Connections -- successor to the fastest
growing
new IBM software product -- is taking a cue from public social networks.  Now
people can quickly grow their professional network of contacts by adding
colleagues.This business equivalent of "friending" helps people effectively
manage their
network and find expertise.

    The new home page streams feeds from various components of Lotus Connections
and shows people what is happening within their network. Widgets let
peoplecustomize the main page and add links to external communities such as
Facebook or custom business applications used within the organization.

    Drawing on its experience in enterprise collaboration, IBM is expanding
thetagging abilities of Lotus Connections to include people tagging. With the
latest
version, people can tag themselves or others based on a key topic or area of
expertise.  This allows individuals to instantly identify and retrieve live
intellect on any given topic and tap into the collective wisdom of a larger
group or
pinpoint rare, niche expertise from the general population.  Tag clouds are
displayed on a person's profile and throughout communities, making it easy to
associate people with areas of expertise.

    Additional new features in Lotus Connections include the ability to send
orreceive notifications to others about interesting social bookmarks, discussion
forums and integration with wiki providers Atlassian and Social Text.

    "Social networking is the new frontier in business collaboration," said Jeff
Schick, vice president of social software, IBM. "From the business-minded
projects of IBM Researchers, to our expertise in Web 2.0, Lotus Connections is
the perfect blend of business-ready tools and Web 2.0 innovations."

    For Lotus Connections beta program participant Imerys, the need to improve
operation efficiencies by bringing together teams to support 250 locations in 45
countries was critical. As a recognized leader for their process and product
innovations, Imerys needed collaboration technology that would build on this
tradition of excellence.

    Turning to IBM Business Partner Optimus Solutions, Imerys selected the
richfeature set and ease of use of Lotus Connections to help meet the
challengeof the geographically dispersed teams across multiple business
functions.

    "We needed a social networking solution that was built with business-grade
collaboration
and security features," said Dave Bailey, Sr. Manager: Collaboration Services
and
Integration for Imerys. "Connections was easy to get up and running and we
didn't experience any down time. No other vendor could provide that blend of
features and stability that integrated so well with our existing global
collaboration platform."

    With more than 20,000 students and employees, Saxion is a university of
applied sciences based in the Netherlands. As part of its mission to be
theleader in quality education, Saxion wants to create an environment where
students can learn based on their own preferences and in context to their
location, time and objectives.

    Saxion is implementing Lotus Connections to improve student satisfaction,
increase
graduation levels, drive new students to the university and give people a
better way to connect within the organization. Lotus Connections will support
students in finding experts via profiles and social bookmarking. They will form
communities around knowledge subjects and allow students a podium for their
thoughts, ideas and discussions using blogs. Activities are also being used to
coordinate group learning.

    As a complementary offering to Lotus Connections, Atlas is a corporate
social
networking visualization and analysis tool. Atlas has four Web 2.0-based
components -- My Net, Find, Reach and Net. These components help users spot
the important connections and the relationships between various groups and
navigate their personal and corporate networks.

    The latest version includes several new features that help people find the
right experts, while being able to quickly get a sense of activity within their
network. New Atlas widgets can be added to a person's home page to show them
how they are linked to someone, or suggest communities or blogs that people
like them are participating in. This discovery process helps foster the
exchange of ideas that leads to the creation of new products and services for
customers.

    Lotus Connections version 2.0 is now available in twenty-three different
languages.
 The list price of Lotus Connections is $110 per user for a one-time
perpetual license. Businesses can purchase the profiles or activities
component of Lotus Connections at a list price of $55 per user for a perpetual
license.

    Atlas version 2.0 is expected to be available via services engagements
through IBM
Software Services for Lotus at the end of June.

  First patient dosed in 12-month study examining the effects of the
 investigational drug apixaban in patients with blood clots in the leg
                            veins or lungs
PRINCETON, N.J. &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE)
announced today the start of a new Phase 3 clinical trial to assess
the effect of apixaban in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE),
a potentially fatal disease process that begins with blood clots in
the leg veins or lungs. Apixaban, which is currently being developed
by the two companies, is an investigational oral, highly selective
factor Xa inhibitor, a new class of agents with therapeutic potential
to prevent and treat blood clots.

   The AMPLIFY (Apixaban after the initial Management of Pulmonary
embolism and deep vein thrombosis with First-line therapy) trials are
part of the EXPANSE program - the global Phase 3 clinical development
trial program for apixaban. AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT are two major
clinical trials involving approximately 7,300 patients with deep vein
thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in the vein, or pulmonary embolism
(PE), a potentially fatal condition caused by a blood clot blocking a
vessel in the lung.

   "The initiation of this apixaban Phase 3 trial represents
Bristol-Myers Squibb's and Pfizer's commitment to furthering research
in the treatment of VTE, a serious disease that affects 1.3 million
people annually in the US and Europe," said Jack Lawrence, Vice
President, Research and Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb. "Current
oral drug treatment options for the treatment of patients with VTE are
primarily vitamin K antagonists (VKA), such as warfarin. Limitations
of VKAs include a slow onset of action, a narrow therapeutic window
necessitating regular coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment, and
multiple food and drug interactions."

   New Apixaban Phase 3 Clinical Trials

   The AMPLIFY-EXT (Apixaban after the initial Management of
PuLmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis with First-line therapY-
EXTended treatment) trial has initiated enrollment and will include
approximately 2,430 patients who will receive, for an extended
12-month period, apixaban 2.5 mg dose or 5 mg twice daily compared to
patients taking placebo to determine the effects of apixaban on
recurrent VTE. Prior to entering the trial, patients will have
completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for DVT or PE.

   The AMPLIFY trial is expected to begin in the next few months, and
will enroll approximately 4,800 patients with acute DVT or PE and will
investigate the safety and efficacy of apixaban 10 mg twice daily for
1 week followed by 5 mg twice daily for 6 months compared to
enoxaparin plus warfarin, the two drugs used as the current standard
of care.

   About Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)

   Venous thromboembolism can take two forms: either as a deep vein
thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in a vein, usually in the leg that
partially or totally blocks the flow of blood, or as a pulmonary
embolism (PE), a blood clot blocking a vessel in the lungs. PE can be
associated with significant hemodynamic deterioration or death.

   VTE continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
the western world, with an incidence of one to two per 1000 people,
and represents one in 10 hospital deaths. In addition, post-thrombotic
syndrome and pulmonary hypertension occur in 10 percent of DVT and
five percent of PE patients, respectively.

   The first year incidence of recurrent VTE is approximately 7.7
percent, and the risk of recurrence continues after anticoagulant
treatment ends at an average of 3% per year over the next ten years.

   About the Apixaban Phase 3 Program: EXPANSE

   The EXPANSE apixaban clinical trial program has seven ongoing
Phase 3 clinical studies involving approximately 45,000 patients
worldwide. In addition to the recently initiated VTE treatment
program, the EXPANSE program also includes trials studying potential
use for prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing
orthopedic surgery and in hospitalized medically ill patients at high
risk of VTE, and trials studying prevention of stroke and other
thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The
VTE prevention program consists of:

   --  ADVANCE-1, 2, and 3 trials are investigating the safety and
        efficacy of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily compared to enoxaparin
        in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. Results from
        the first trial are targeted for presentation at the American
        Society of Hematology in December 2008.

   --  The ADOPT study is investigating apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily
        for one month compared to standard of care (enoxaparin for at
        least 6 days followed by placebo) for the prevention of VTE in
        hospitalized patients who are medically ill and at risk of
        VTE.

   Apixaban is also in Phase 3 trials studying the prevention of
thrombotic events, such as stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation
(AF). The AF program consists of:

   --  The ARISTOTLE trial, which is investigating apixaban 5 mg
        twice daily compared to warfarin in approximately 15,000
        patients with atrial fibrillation.

   --  The AVERROES trial, which is investigating apixaban 5 mg twice
        daily compared to aspirin in approximately 5,600 patients with
        atrial fibrillation who are ineligible for VKA treatment or
        haven't tolerated previous VKA treatment.

   Apixaban has also recently completed enrollment in a Phase 2 trial
in patients with acute coronary syndrome (the APPRAISE trial). The
results of this trial will be presented at the European Society of
Cardiology meeting in September 2008.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today that a Power Systems(TM) server shattered
another milestone, demonstrating nearly three times the performance per
processor core of HP Superdome at a lower cost. According to a Transaction
Processing Performance Council (TPC-C) benchmark result, the IBM UNIX system is
the
first and only server to achieve more than six million transactions per minute.

    IBM's POWER6(TM) processor-based Power 595 enterprise server running the
AIX(R) operating system, with DB2(R) 9.5 data server and DS4800 storage,
delivered
a performance record of  6,085,166 tpmC at $2.81/tpmC.(1)

    The performance of the Power 595 enables customers to replace three 128 core
HP Superdomes (384 cores spanning six computer racks) with two 64 core Power
595 servers (128 cores spanning just two computer racks), reducing the number of
processor cores by 66 percent, saving 20 percent on energy costs(2) and 55
percent on software licensing purchased by the core,(3) and reducing floor
space by 59 percent.(4)

    Per core performance matters to customers as most major UNIX software
vendors
charge per core for software licenses. DB2 9.5 offers a range of technology
advances, including pure XML data management capabilities and row-based data
storage compression technology, which yields significant disk, I/O and memory
savings.

    According to Gartner, "More than 70 percent of the world's Global 1000
organizations will have to modify their data center facilities significantly
during
the next five years."(5)  IBM Power Systems offerings are a key element in this
transformation, delivering dramatic improvements in virtualization capabilities
to
help customers consolidate server capacity, save energy and more effectively
manage their IT costs.

    Customer Acceptance

    Clients worldwide are leveraging IBM Power Systems to dramatically reduce
bottom-line operating costs. For instance, the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center (UPMC), a nearly $7 billion integrated health care enterprise and one
of the most renowned academic medical centers in the United States, replaced
HP and Sun servers with IBM Power systems and initiated a server
consolidation and virtualization project designed to curb steadily rising
data center costs and improve operational efficiencies.

    "Our four-year experience with IBM Power Systems has provided us with
unprecedented levels of performance and reliability," said Paul Sikora, UPMC's
vice president of IT transformation. "Initially, IDC estimated that UPMC could
avoid almost $20 million in  technical infrastructure costs over the first
three years of our project, but most recently tells us that number has
improved to $30 million. Our early testing with the POWER6-based IBM Power 595
can
only lead us to believe that we will be even more successful in delivering 
high performance, low cost computing power that will help power the many
health care solutions  used by our doctors, nurses, clinicians, and patients."

    The European Patent Office (EPO), based in The Netherlands, adopted IBM
Power
Systems for increased energy efficiencies. The EPO provides a uniform
application
procedure for individual inventors and companies seeking patent protection in up
to 38 European countries.

    "The energy-saving capabilities of the Power 595 were pivotal in our
buyingdecision," said Michel Fombellida Lopez, director of system engineering,
EPO. "With
the new system and PowerVM virtualization, we'll be able to save on energy
costs and reduce floor space."

    Kubus IT is the newly founded IT service provider for the AOK Bavaria,
Saxony and
Thuringia, health insurance providers for more than seven million people in
Germany.

    "Due to the very good experiences we have had with our two IBM System p5 595
servers in terms of reliability and virtualization capabilities, we are sure
the recently installed two Power 595 systems also will provide high-performance
capabilities, reliability and cost-efficiency. The flexibility that IBM's
virtualization provides is key to running our SAP applications more
efficiently," said Andre Rentsch, general manager of kubus IT.

    AIX 6 Security Certification

    In other news, IBM has achieved significant security certifications that are
closely watched by government agencies and commercial accounts around the world,
often as a bid prerequisite requirement. IBM AIX V6.1 with Workload Partitions
and the POWER6 processor-based IBM Power 570 system have been certified
compliant under the Controlled Access Protection Profile under the Common
Criteria
for Information Security Evaluation (CC), at the Evaluation Assurance Level 4
Augmented  (commonly referred to as CAPP/EAL4+). Under Common Criteria,
products are evaluated against strict standards that validate the product's
design process, development environment, functionality, vulnerability handling,
testing and documentation. This is the first set of security certifications
for AIX 6 and for systems based on the POWER6 processor.

    Power Systems Availability

    The Power 595, which began shipping in May in 32-core configurations with
support for AIX, is now available in full 64-core configurations and is
thehigh-end server in IBM's Power Systems family. Support for the i operating
environment is planned for September with Linux(R) support scheduled for
October.

    In the second quarter, IBM has been right on target in meeting customer
availability dates for all Power Systems models, including the Power 570
mid-range server, entry-level Power 520 and 550 models, the Power 575
water-cooled "Hydro-Cluster" supercomputer, BladeCenter(R) JS12 and i
Edition for BladeCenter S.

    Dramatic Increase in Virtualization

    Initial orders and shipments suggest a dramatic increase in the use of
virtualization on the new Power Systems. PowerVM virtualization orders
withthe Power 570 are up 40 percent over previous POWER5-based models and have
more than tripled on the new Power 550 UNIX system from 20 percent to 70
percent, signifying a major expansion in the use of virtualization beyond the
enterprise to mid-market clients. The new Power 595 penetration of PowerVM
virtualization is even higher, estimated at more than 90 percent.

a brokerage upgrade of Coca-Cola (KO.N), but the SP 500 and
Nasdaq fell as worries about higher interest rates prompted
investors to unload technology shares and other
growth-sensitive sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy stocks fell as U.S. crude oil futures dropped about
$3 a barrel. The SP index of energy shares .GSPE was down
3.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Semiconductor makers and software developers fell. Analysts
said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's warning the Fed
would strongly resist rising inflation expectations could mean
increases in borrowing costs that would damp down consumer and
business buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whenever there is uncertainty, there's a flight to safety,

&lt;p&gt; * Coca-Cola rises as investors seek stable earnings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Oil prices reverse gains, energy shares weak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Fed to strongly resist rising inflation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Cal Mankowski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks shifted gears
and climbed at midday on Tuesday as investors bought Dow
industrials like Coca-Cola and other companies with steady
earnings, while a drop in oil prices helped ease concerns
about inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) was the biggest contributor to gains
in the blue-chip Dow average and helped lift the Standard 
Poor's 500 after Deutsche Bank upgraded the soft drink maker's
stock to a "buy" from a "hold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy shares slid as U.S. crude oil futures fell more
than $2 to trade below $132 a barrel at midday, down from last
Friday's record above $139. The SP index of energy shares
.GSPE was down 2.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nasdaq was boosted slightly by Apple Inc (AAPL.O),
whose stock gained 2.6 percent to $186.36 a day after the
introduction of a faster iPhone. Earlier Tuesday, Lehman
Brothers and Citigroup raised their price targets on the
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market's turnaround followed a morning of stocks
trading mostly lower after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke said the central bank would strongly resist rising
inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's a pre-emptive statement so the market will
not be surprised when the Fed holds rates steady," said Peter
Jankovskis. director of research at OakBrook Investments LLC
in Lisle, Illinois, referring to Bernanke's comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jankovskis said gains in stocks like Coca-Cola showed that
"people seem to be gravitating toward safe-haven companies"
where earnings tend to be steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 78.89 points,
or 0.64 percent, to 12,359.21. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX advanced 4.46 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,366.22. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC added 5.22 points, or 0.21
percent, to 2,464.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other Fed officials echoed Bernanke's concerns about
inflation. Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard
Fisher said the Fed will not allow inflation to get out of
control. Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren
said rising food and energy costs were still trickling through
the economy, complicating the outlook for inflation.
[ID:nN10328162]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Coca-Cola rose 4.7 percent to $58.51 on the New

Chevron Corp (CVX.N) were among the top drags on the Dow.
Exxon Mobil fell 1.8 percent to $87.45 and Chevron declined

&lt;p&gt;  STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN, Jun 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 The Stockholm Congestion Charging System, rolled out in August last year
following a successful pilot, has reduced traffic in the Swedish capital by 18
percent, and the proportion of green, tax-exempt vehicles has risen to 9
percent. Access to the city has improved significantly with a reduction in
travel
times on inner city streets and approach roads. These are the results of the
latest study by the Stockholm City Traffic authorities on the innovative scheme.

    IBM (NYSE: IBM), as prime contractor responsible for solution design,
development
and operation, worked closely with the Swedish Road Administration and the
city of Stockholm to develop the congestion charging system. The project
involved
collaboration between IBM consulting, research and technology specialists, to
ensure successful delivery of an accurate and effective technical solution.

    The system, which covers a 24 square kilometre area of the inner city, was
introduced after the Swedish National Parliament voted to permanently
adoptthe road charging scheme trialed by IBM and the Swedish Road
Administrationin Stockholm in 2006. During the 2006 pilot, traffic was reduced
by an
overall 22 percent over seven months, and has not returned to previous levels.
This is viewed by the Swedish Traffic authorities as a positive residual effect
of
the trial.  Although road traffic in Stockholm county has increased overall,
traffic to the inner city has not risen at the same rate, in spite of an
increase in the number of residents and jobs.

    "Traffic has remained substantially lower since the pilot with IBM, which
has
brought significant benefits to Stockholm residents. The scheme is meeting
the objectives set by the city of reducing traffic volumes, improving
accessibility for buses and cars, and improving the environment," said Birger
Hook,
Director of the Swedish Road Administration's traffic registry.

    The Stockholm system is the largest of its kind in Europe, with 18
barrier-free control points around the charging zone equipped with cameras and a
beacon system to identify vehicles and provide evidence to support the
enforcement of non-payers. Payment channels include automatic direct debit, a
Giro system at banks, over the Internet, and at retail stores such as The
congestion charge is a national tax, with revenues returned to the Stockholm
region for investment in road infrastructure.

    "The system is based on an innovative business model, and is a landmark
development for effective traffic management. The successful roll-out is
certain to have a major influence on many other cities considering ways to
better manage congestion, improve urban environmental conditions and increase
economic competitiveness," says Jamie Houghton, IBM Global Road User Charging
Leader.

    In addition to working with the city of Stockholm, IBM is also assisting the
cities
of London, Singapore and Brisbane to address traffic management and congestion
challenges. IBM has established a global team of Intelligent Transport System
professionals working on a range of technologies and solutions, including
researching, testing and developing new traffic information management
capabilities.

&lt;p&gt;Fiscal Sales Of Licensed Disney Merchandise Expected To Cross $30

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
In the paragraph under the header Disney Tween Franchises Expected
To Reach $2.7 Billion Mark, first sentence of release should
read: Retail sales of DCP's tween products have mushroomed from $400
Million in 2007 and are expected to reach an astounding $2.7 billion

(sted $2.7 billion for High School Musical and Hannah Montana
respectively in FY08).

   The corrected release reads:

   DISNEY CONSUMER PRODUCTS POISED FOR RECORD GROWTH AT RETAIL

   Fiscal Sales Of Licensed Disney Merchandise Expected To Cross $30
Billion; Tween Franchises Expected To Break $2 Billion Mark

   Retail sales of licensed Disney merchandise by Disney and its
licensees are currently on track to exceed $30 Billion in global
retail sales in fiscal 2008 (FY08), a record for Disney products,
which in 2007 more than doubled retail sales from $13 billion to $27
billion in just five years; it was announced today by Disney Consumer
Products (DCP) Chairman Andy Mooney at the International Licensing
Expo in New York City.

   (Editor's note: for more information and high resolution
media-ready images, please visit
www.disneyconsumerproducts.com/press/us)

   "It's the Disney difference that accounts for this unprecedented
growth fueled by unmatched content and rich franchises nurtured across
The Walt Disney Company," said Mr. Mooney. "In just five years, retail
sales of Disney products have doubled and we have diversified our
portfolio of brands with smash hits like High School Musical,
evergreens like Disney Princess and expanding franchises in
Disney/Pixar's Cars and Disney Fairies. Our product offerings now
reach all ages. Simply put, there is no better time to be aligned with
Disney."

   DCP expects retail sales of Disney merchandise to grow 12% over
the prior year as it continues to command the licensing industry as
the world's top licensor ranked by the International Licensing
Industry Merchandiser's Association (LIMA). At the cornerstone of this
global growth lies DCP's strength in deepening diversified retail
distribution, broadening and refining consumer segments and bringing
innovative products to market. Disney products have also reached
significant milestones across many franchises.

   Disney Tween Franchises Expected To Reach $2.7 Billion Mark

   Retail sales of DCP's tween products have mushroomed from $400
Million in 2007 and are expected to reach an astounding $2.7 billion
for High School Musical and Hannah Montana combined in FY08. Both
franchises boast unique merchandise programs at leading mass retailers
around the world. With the upcoming theatrical release of High School
Musical 3: Senior Year, a fourth title in development, and Hannah
Montana: The Movie as well as the fan favorite series on Disney
Channel, DCP's tween retail business is poised for exponential growth.
Additionally, new programming from Disney Channel such as Camp Rock
and JONAS (starring Jonas Brothers) are expected to further licensing
opportunities in this coveted demographic segment.

   The Fairy Tale Continues for Disney Girls Franchises

   With combined global retail sales projected to reach the $5
billion mark, DCP's girls franchises, Disney Princess and Disney
Fairies, are supported by companywide synergy and creative merchandise
assortments that keep them alive year round on retail shelves
worldwide. The return of favorite fairytales and the release of new
ones provide an ongoing basis for the success of these franchises-
from the Platinum Edition DVD release of Sleeping Beauty this fall and
the theatrical release of Walt Disney Studios The Princess and the
Frog in 2009, to Rapunzel in 2010 and Disney/Pixar's The Bear and the
Bow in 2011. An enhanced DisneyPrincess.com Web site will soon immerse
girls in new interactive fairytale experiences.

   The Disney Fairies franchise will take flight with four Disney
Video Premiere releases beginning with Tinker Bell this fall under the
helm of chief creative officer, John Lasseter, and Walt Disney Toon
Studios and one in each of the following three years. The popularity
of this franchise continues to explode with more than 385 books
published worldwide and nearly 6 million unique fairy avatars created
at DisneyFairies.com. Later this year, Disney Fairies virtual world,
Pixie Hollow (www.pixiehollow.com), will launch and enable girls to
make their fairy avatars fly and interact with other fairy friends

Nintendo DS title releasing this fall, Disney Fairies: Tinker Bell.

   Disney/Pixar's Cars Nears the $2.5 Billion Finish Line

   Playing with cars for boys is a timeless and enduring play pattern
just as fantasy role-play and dress-up is for girls with Disney
Princess. Add to that powerful storytelling and timeless characters
and it's no wonder why Disney/Pixar's Cars has become among the
fastest growing franchises on track to generate a projected $2.5
billion in global retail sales of licensed merchandise in FY08 or $5
billion in sales since its box office debut. The theatrical release of
Cars 2 from Disney/Pixar in Summer 2012 will further extend the
vitality of this franchise as it coincides with the grand opening of
"Cars Land" - part of the transformation of Disney's California
Adventure. Coming next year, boys will have a chance to create their
own car avatar and rev up their engines in a new immersive virtual
world featuring Lightning McQueen on Disney.com and a host of other
characters from the film.

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Chemical Introduces New Transparent and Translucent TPE Grades to Inspire Design

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical has introduced new transparent and translucent
thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) grades designed for grip applications in
the kitchenware, consumer electronics, tools, small appliance and
stationery markets. ExxonMobil TPE F471-60 exhibits excellent
transparency with 82 percent light transmittance. The translucent
grade, ExxonMobil TPE F371-60, has a light transmittance of 10
percent.

   Both new grades offer a unique combination of properties that make
them dishwasher safe and ideal replacements for flexible polyvinyl
chloride (PVC). These TPEs also accept a range of special effects such
as metallic, iridescent or transparent colors.

   "The consumer product market is very dynamic with OEMs and
industrial designers always looking for something new and inspiring,
the next trend. These transparent and translucent TPE grades provide
exciting design opportunities enabling brand differentiation in
rapidly evolving markets," said Lynell Maenza, industry segment
manager, ExxonMobil Chemical TPEs.

   The high-flow grades, with a hardness of 60 Shore A, provide a
soft and dry rubbery touch. They are odor-free and exhibit good
chemical resistance.

   Adhering well to polypropylene, the new grades can be processed
using two-shot injection molding or overmolding techniques. This
eliminates the need for adhesives, bonding agents and physical or
mechanical interlocks. This reduces processing steps which can improve
product development cycle times and lower system costs.

   "These new grades, which complement our existing portfolio of
grades for grip, aesthetic and comfort applications, have been
developed using our 25 years' experience and knowledge of these
markets. We are excited about the design potential they will bring to
the consumer product market," said Maenza.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


In a novel experiment to advance new drug discovery and development, as well as
stimulate basic research, Pfizer, Inc. and UCSF have launched a collaboration
that spans many disciplines, several UC campuses and multiple Pfizer research
units.

The three year agreement, with research and other support up to $9.5 million,
establishes a university team to help identify promising areas of mutual
interest and facilitate project management. The innovative effort already has
templates in place to allow swift industry-university agreements.

The Pfizer-UCSF agreement will encourage collaborations between the company and
UCSF's unit of QB3, the multi-campus California Institute for Quantitative
Biosciences, headquartered at UCSF. The effort will be managed by QB3. All
interested UCSF scientists will be eligible to participate, as will scientists
at QB3's two sister university campuses - UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz.

The collaboration was announced today.

Corey Goodman, Ph.D., president of Pfizer's Biotherapeutics and Bioinnovation
Center (BBC), will lead the collaboration for the company. The BBC, a
newly-formed division of Pfizer, is a small, entrepreneurial business unit
created to build the technology platforms expected to deliver a steady pipeline
of biotherapeutics and to stimulate such grassroots collaborations. Goodman, a
member of the National Academy of Sciences, is a former biotechnology company
executive and a University of California research professor.

At QB3, Daniel Santi, Ph.D., UCSF professor of pharmaceutical chemistry and
co-founder and former CEO of the biotech company Kosan, will manage the
collaboration. QB3 involves 180 university scientists at the three UC campuses,
collaborating on research with each other and, increasingly, with biotech and
pharmaceutical companies. Its goals are to speed the translation of basic
research discoveries into diagnostics, drugs and other treatments.

"The need to find better ways to bridge the gap between biomedical research and
drug discovery could not be more acute," Pfizer's Goodman said. "The great
discoveries from basic research must be better translated to develop new
medicines for unmet medical needs."

"This new approach captures the best of both biotech and pharmaceutical worlds -
and it benefits everyone: Pfizer, the university, patients and public health."

"This alliance speaks to the core goals of QB3," said Reg Kelly, Ph.D., director
of QB3 and a principal architect of the novel plan. "The institute was created
by the state of California to spur research needed to advance health and expand
the state's economy. The new collaboration intimately links the scientific
talent of UCSF with the extraordinary expertise of a pharmaceutical company like
Pfizer."

"This can be a boon to the company and to the university, but also to the
taxpayers who hope their support for basic research can lead to better health."

QB3's Santi will head up a UCSF team to identify promising collaborative
projects and help facilitate projects, which he expects will greatly increase
the probability of project success.

In traditional industry/academia collaborations, pharmaceutical companies engage
university researchers by looking for a specific line of research that can aid
their on-going projects, and the research is conducted solely by the university
scientist, Santi explains. The new venture assembles teams of Pfizer and
university scientists to work on projects, in health-related areas of mutual
interest.

Recently, Pfizer and some other major pharmaceutical companies have created
small, entrepreneurial arrangements with universities, but these generally focus
on single promising fields, such as immunology. In one planned project, UCSF and
Pfizer scientists will perform collaborative research that enables innovative
computational and structure-based approaches to develop monoclonal
antibody-based therapeutics for important disease targets.

Discussions on the collaboration began in late November, and moved swiftly. By
the time of the signing of the agreement last week, three Pfizer-UCSF
collaborative projects were ready to begin, Goodman said.

"This is definitely an exciting opportunity," he said. "This collaboration
allows our scientists to interact in a grassroots way to advance basic
scientific findings that have potential biomedical application. I am confident
that this will provide tremendous benefit for Pfizer, for UCSF and for the
health of society."

UCSF is a leading university dedicated to promoting health worldwide through
advanced biomedical research, graduate-level education in the life sciences and
health professions, and excellence in patient care.

Pfizer Inc. is the world's largest research-based biomedical and pharmaceutical
company, employing approximately 87,000 colleagues in more than 150 countries.
In 2007, Pfizer invested $8.1 billion in research and development. The Pfizer
Biotherapeutics and Bioinnovation Center is based in the San Francisco Bay Area
and combines cutting-edge biology, new platform technologies, and advanced
research tools to discover and develop new medicines. Located in one of the hubs
of biotechnology, the BBC has the entrepreneurial spirit of biotech and will
collaborate broadly with the academic, biotech, and venture communities to focus
on discovering and developing new medicines.

&lt;p&gt;Version 2.6 of award-winning Lifecycle APM Solution now supports
           Microsoft's market-leading collaboration platform
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
dynaTrace software, the award-winning leader in lifecycle
application performance management for distributed .NET and Java
applications, today announced that the newest version of dynaTrace
extends lifecycle performance management to individual Microsoft
Office SharePoint Server 2007 sites running inside Microsoft's
Internet Information Services (IIS), enabling performance diagnosis
during development, testing and production operations of Office
SharePoint Server 2007 applications.

   "SharePoint Server 2007 is exploding as a platform, both in terms
of usage and complexity," said dynaTrace CEO Bernd Greifeneder. "More
companies are using SharePoint Server to collaborate on
mission-critical business data, and are building custom applications
to further facilitate that collaboration. Out of the box, dynaTrace
can now help them diagnose - at any point in the lifecycle -
performance issues in those applications that may impede
collaboration, taking advantage of existing investments in Microsoft
Visual Studio and VS Test."

   "We are excited about the support for SharePoint Server 2007 in
dynaTrace 2.6," said Cathy Walton, senior product manager for
SharePoint at Microsoft Corp. "As SharePoint Server grows as a
platform, we expect our customers will desire visibility into their
SharePoint-based applications to manage performance and drastically
reduce mean-time-to-repair of any performance issues. dynaTrace works
seamlessly with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Team System Test
Edition in order to isolate such issues early in the lifecycle, and
this helps our customers to attain optimal performance from day one in
production."

   dynaTrace's core is PurePath Technology(R): technology enabling
transaction tracing across physical and logical tiers, whether.NET or
Java. While tracing, PurePath measures the performance of individual
servers, components and method borders (where problems occur),
enhancing those findings with correlated contextual information such
as logs, exceptions and method arguments (why problems occur).

   dynaTrace 2.6 enables Office SharePoint Server 2007 customers to
manage performance and service-level fulfillment of individual
SharePoint Server 2007 sites running inside the same IIS6+ instance,
identify slow SharePoint Web Parts, and diagnose the root cause of
performance problems in individual Web Parts.

   Furthermore, dynaTrace 2.6 assists Office SharePoint Server 2007
customers in managing the performance of SharePoint Server 2007
applications across the entire life-cycle: in development via
code-link integration with Microsoft Visual Studio; in testing,
through incorporation with Visual Studio Team Edition for Software
Testers powering automated tests of entire SharePoint sites or pages
running on Office SharePoint Server 2007 consisting of multiple Web
Parts; and in production with 24x7 monitoring/diagnostics tracing
discrete transactions from individual SharePoint sites, so operations
can send the PurePath of any poor-performing SharePoint Server 2007
transaction directly to development or testing for root-cause
analysis.

   For further information, visit dynaTrace at TechEd IT
Professionals booth 1531, or contact dynaTrace at
takeaction@dynatrace.com.

   About dynaTrace software, Inc.

   dynaTrace is the leader in lifecycle application performance
management for business-critical Java and .NET applications.
dynaTrace's PurePath Technology(R) is the only solution that captures
data on all individual transactions down to code level by tracing
their "PurePath" across multiple physical and logical tiers - even
24x7 under load in production - enabling customers to move beyond
monitoring to diagnosis and prevention. In each application lifecycle
stage - development, QA, staging, production - IT personnel now can
see and understand where and why performance issues exist. With
dynaTrace, enterprises gain better understanding of their
applications' dynamic behavior and how it impacts their business,
allowing them to rapidly reconstruct problems to identify the
root-cause and fix it.

&lt;p&gt;Automated reconciliation technology handles high volumes and reduces risk in OTC
                                   derivatives
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan, faced with explosive demand for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
processing, announced today the launch of a solution designed to help financial
institutions handle higher volumes, lower position breaks and reduce credit
risk.

JPMorgan, which currently services more than $70 billion in derivatives
collateral, is offering the new automated reconciliation technology globally,
representing the latest enhancement to its Derivatives Collateral Management
(DCM) solution. This technology, which is designed to work in conjunction with
TriOptima's triResolve automated position reconciliation service, increases the
efficiency and risk management of trading records.

"The trading volumes of OTC Derivatives are expanding exponentially and our
clients need better and better tools to provide security against exposures,"
said Kelly Mathieson, global head of JPMorgan's Collateral Management business.
"Accuracy and transparency are crucial to the derivatives marketplace," she
said, adding, "Investment professionals can no longer afford the risks
associated with manual processing."

The amount of collateral in circulation in the marketplace is estimated to be
well over $2.1 trillion, according to industry estimates. The amount is expected
to increase significantly, as institutional investors continue to use collateral
coverage to help reduce the credit risk of dealing with counterparties,
Mathieson added.

"Trade life cycle management has proven particularly challenging to the OTC
derivatives community, as most firms may not have the infrastructure or
expertise to address the need themselves," said Colm Gaughran, global product
head for JPMorgan DCM. "The growth in OTC derivatives usage, combined with the
ever growing number of participants and instrument types, is creating a strong
demand for an automated reconciliation tool. By integrating TriOptima's
automated triResolve service, we can now offer a scaleable reconciliation
solution that significantly enhances the dispute resolution process."

This is the latest innovation launched by JPMorgan, widely recognized as an
industry leader for being the first to introduce a full-service DCM solution in
2005. The service is available to its global client base, which includes asset
managers, pension fund managers, governments, government sponsored agencies,
hedge funds, corporates and financial institutions. With TriOptima's triResolve
functionality, JPMorgan DCM clients will receive these additional benefits:

    --  Automated OTC position reconciliations

    --  Early warnings for discrepancies, better risk mitigation and greater
        reconciliation transparency.

    --  Identification and resolution of booking errors and discrepancies in
        trade valuations, trade populations, single-sided records, splits and
        structured trades.

JPMorgan DCM covers many of the post-trade functions of the collateral
management value chain such as Credit Support Annex (CSA) management, margin
call processing, re-hypothecation, settlement and custody. JPMorgan has been a
leader in collateral management (CM) since the firm pioneered tri-party
collateral management in 1992. The firm offers a full range of services
including: Securities Collateral Management, Derivatives Collateral Management
and Cash Collateral Management.

&lt;p&gt;Fiscal Sales Of Licensed Disney Merchandise Expected To Cross $30
      Billion; Tween Franchises Expected To Break $2 Billion Mark
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Retail sales of licensed Disney merchandise by Disney and its
licensees are currently on track to exceed $30 Billion in global
retail sales in fiscal 2008 (FY08), a record for Disney products,
which in 2007 more than doubled retail sales from $13 billion to $27
billion in just five years; it was announced today by Disney Consumer
Products (DCP) Chairman Andy Mooney at the International Licensing
Expo in New York City.

   (Editor's note: for more information and high resolution
media-ready images, please visit
www.disneyconsumerproducts.com/press/us)

   "It's the Disney difference that accounts for this unprecedented
growth fueled by unmatched content and rich franchises nurtured across
The Walt Disney Company," said Mr. Mooney. "In just five years, retail
sales of Disney products have doubled and we have diversified our
portfolio of brands with smash hits like High School Musical,
evergreens like Disney Princess and expanding franchises in
Disney/Pixar's Cars and Disney Fairies. Our product offerings now
reach all ages. Simply put, there is no better time to be aligned with
Disney."

   DCP expects retail sales of Disney merchandise to grow 12% over
the prior year as it continues to command the licensing industry as
the world's top licensor ranked by the International Licensing
Industry Merchandiser's Association (LIMA). At the cornerstone of this
global growth lies DCP's strength in deepening diversified retail
distribution, broadening and refining consumer segments and bringing
innovative products to market. Disney products have also reached
significant milestones across many franchises.

   Disney Tween Franchises Expected To Reach $2.7 Billion Mark

   Retail sales of DCP's tween products have mushroomed from $400
Million in 2007 and are expected to reach an astounding $2.7 billion
for High School Musical and Hannah Montana respectively in FY08. Both
franchises boast unique merchandise programs at leading mass retailers
around the world. With the upcoming theatrical release of High School
Musical 3: Senior Year, a fourth title in development, and Hannah
Montana: The Movie as well as the fan favorite series on Disney
Channel, DCP's tween retail business is poised for exponential growth.
Additionally, new programming from Disney Channel such as Camp Rock
and JONAS (starring Jonas Brothers) are expected to further licensing
opportunities in this coveted demographic segment.

   The Fairy Tale Continues for Disney Girls Franchises

   With combined global retail sales projected to reach the $5
billion mark, DCP's girls franchises, Disney Princess and Disney
Fairies, are supported by companywide synergy and creative merchandise
assortments that keep them alive year round on retail shelves
worldwide. The return of favorite fairytales and the release of new
ones provide an ongoing basis for the success of these franchises-
from the Platinum Edition DVD release of Sleeping Beauty this fall and
the theatrical release of Walt Disney Studios The Princess and the
Frog in 2009, to Rapunzel in 2010 and Disney/Pixar's The Bear and the
Bow in 2011. An enhanced DisneyPrincess.com Web site will soon immerse
girls in new interactive fairytale experiences.

   The Disney Fairies franchise will take flight with four Disney
Video Premiere releases beginning with Tinker Bell this fall under the
helm of chief creative officer, John Lasseter, and Walt Disney Toon
Studios and one in each of the following three years. The popularity
of this franchise continues to explode with more than 385 books
published worldwide and nearly 6 million unique fairy avatars created
at DisneyFairies.com. Later this year, Disney Fairies virtual world,
Pixie Hollow (www.pixiehollow.com), will launch and enable girls to
make their fairy avatars fly and interact with other fairy friends
online. The excitement will continue with the first Disney Fairies
Nintendo DS title releasing this fall, Disney Fairies: Tinker Bell.

   Disney/Pixar's Cars Nears the $2.5 Billion Finish Line

   Playing with cars for boys is a timeless and enduring play pattern
just as fantasy role-play and dress-up is for girls with Disney
Princess. Add to that powerful storytelling and timeless characters
and it's no wonder why Disney/Pixar's Cars has become among the
fastest growing franchises on track to generate a projected $2.5
billion in global retail sales of licensed merchandise in FY08 or $5
billion in sales since its box office debut. The theatrical release of
Cars 2 from Disney/Pixar in Summer 2012 will further extend the
vitality of this franchise as it coincides with the grand opening of
"Cars Land" - part of the transformation of Disney's California
Adventure. Coming next year, boys will have a chance to create their
own car avatar and rev up their engines in a new immersive virtual
world featuring Lightning McQueen on Disney.com and a host of other
characters from the film.

   Preschool Franchises Primed for Growth

   DCP will continue to grow the preschool category with new product
lines inspired by the adventures of Little Einsteins, the imagination
of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, the problem-solving skills of Handy Manny
and the friendships made in My Friends Tigger &amp; Pooh. Backed by the
tremendous success of these Disney Channel hit preschool shows on
Playhouse Disney, DCP will leverage its recent Disney Stores
acquisition to further expand its connection with parents and kids
alike.

   About Disney Consumer Products

   Disney Consumer Products and affiliates (DCP) is the business
segment of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) that extends the Disney
brand to merchandise ranging from apparel, toys, home decor and books

&lt;p&gt;  RALEIGH, NC, Jun 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Recent business practices point to a trend of large corporations selecting
digital shops to lead online advertising efforts rather than larger traditional
agencies. In keeping with that trend and based on its extensive online
expertise and nimble infrastructure, advertising agency Media Two Interactive
was chosen by
Microsoft to develop display creative for the release of Office 2008 for Mac.
The display campaign launched in mid-December 2007, to advertise a
mid-January rollout of the product.

    With this campaign, Microsoft was looking to create a globally
recognizablead platform, with campaign creative geared toward international
recognition. The
campaign was also developed to be compelling particularly to Mac users; a
diverse,
creative message for a diverse, creative audience.

    In 2005, Media Two began working with Microsoft's Messenger division through
a
partner agency. Media Two conducted a small media buy on behalf of the company,
which became one of the most successful campaigns they've run in terms of high
conversion rates and low CPCs. Based on the success of that initial
engagement, Media Two was engaged by seven additional divisions of Microsoft.
Last
year, Media Two began working with the Mac Business Unit, and has executed
four promotions prior, many centered around special events/seasonal releases
through the year.

    Microsoft turned to Raleigh, NC-based Media Two because, based on their
previous relationship, they knew Media Two had the ability to quickly turn
around a top-quality creative design project due to its nimble infrastructure,
dedicated and experienced creative/strategy team. The entire project, from
contact to delivery, was delivered within a month. In recent years, Raleigh
has begun to grow into a hub for interactive marketing and technology
innovation.
Specialized digital agencies in Raleigh are turning out a quality of work
that was once only available on Madison Avenue, but in a fraction of the
time.

    "Media Two has been a great partner. When I need a project turned around
quickly, the Media Two team always delivers," said Amanda Lefebvre, Microsoft
Mac
BU Senior Marketing Manager. "And while speed is key, a well targeted and
effective campaign is always the goal. We have been impressed with their
campaign
optimization capability which is based upon immediate reporting and a highly
engaged, easy to work with account management team."

    About Microsoft:

    Founded in 1975, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is the worldwide leader in
software, services and solutions that help people and businesses realize their

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Electronic Payment Methods Reduce Paper Consumption,
                         Strengthen Compliance
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase announced today that it has renewed its contract
with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for purchase,
travel and fleet charge card services. The annual volume of the card
program is expected to exceed $80 million with nearly 20,000 cards
serviced. The four-year task order award, which includes two
three-year renewable options, is part of the U.S. General Services
Administration's (GSA) SmartPay(R) 2 program, the largest government
charge card program in the world. JPMorgan has served as EPA's charge
card provider since 2004 under the current GSA SmartPay(R) program.

   JPMorgan's charge card programs help government agencies reduce
the time and administrative costs associated with authorizing,
tracking, paying, allocating and reconciling purchases. The company's
online PaymentNet visibility and reporting tool helps agencies improve
compliance and auditing practices by providing real-time access to
spending. PaymentNet(R) also provides comprehensive controls that help
manage spending efficiently and enforce spending policies before a
transaction is even initiated.

   "In addition to improving compliance and cost-cutting initiatives,
JPMorgan's electronic payment methods and online reporting tool will
continue to support the EPA's goals of eliminating or reducing the
paper consumption associated with procurement operations, such as
purchase orders, paper checks and petty cash requests," said W.
Stephen Kouns, executive project manager with JPMorgan Federal Card
Solutions. "We look forward to partnering with the EPA as they work to
protect human health and the environment."

   JPMorgan is a member of The PayItGreen Alliance, a coalition of
financial services companies, led by NACHA -- The Electronic Payments
Association, committed to educating consumers and businesses about the
positive environmental impact of choosing electronic payments, bills
and statements instead of paper.

   The GSA SmartPay(R) program, implemented in 1998, handled more
than $27 billion in sales and over 91 million transactions in 2007.
The program is used by federal agencies and organizations to obtain
purchase, travel, fleet and integrated charge card services. JPMorgan
has been a GSA SmartPay(R) card provider since the original master
contract, providing card services to public sector clients for more
than 20 years. To date, JPMorgan has been awarded more than a dozen
GSA SmartPay 2 contracts, including charge card programs with the U.S.
Departments of Commerce, Interior and Transportation, the Appalachian
Regional Commission, Library of Congress, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, the Smithsonian Institution, the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Museum, U.S. Office of Personnel Management and U.S. Social
Security Administration.

   JPMorgan also is listed on multiple GSA Schedules, including: GSA
Schedule 520 - Financial and Business Solutions (FABS), GSA Schedule
36 - Office Imaging and Document Solutions and GSA Schedule 874 -
Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services (MOBIS). This allows
Federal agencies to contract directly with JPMorgan for these
services. JPMorgan also provides treasury solutions to over 3,000
state governments and municipalities, helping them with tax processing
and enterprise content management, electronic benefits transfer
programs such as food stamp and Women Infant and Children (WIC)
payments, disaster preparedness, child support payments, unemployment
insurance, and license, fee and violations processing.

  16,000 Network Engineers Rely on Thwack to Get Help, Share Advice,
  Interact with Product Experts and Contribute to Ongoing Innovation
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
SolarWinds announced today that its online community for network
engineers, Thwack, celebrated its first anniversary. To commemorate

   To mark the anniversary, SolarWinds has released another free tool

        problems, such as transport failures, Internet connection
        failures or virus activity

   --  Monitoring the server that Exchange is physically running on
        for disk usage, CPU utilization and memory utilization

   "Thwack enables users of SolarWinds products to leverage community
knowledge and technical contributions to quickly resolve problems and

AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Neverfail, a leading global software company providing affordable
continuous availability and disaster recovery solutions, today
announced Neverfail ClusterProtector(TM) as the latest enhancement to
its Neverfail Continuous Availability Suite. Also unveiled was
Neverfail Version 5.4 which supports Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and
is being tested with the latest version of Hyper-V.

   Neverfail ClusterProtector offers continuous data replication for
Microsoft Windows Failover Clustering ensuring businesses can
continuously access their mission-critical applications and data.
Replication of application data is done in real-time over a wide area
network to the remote disaster recovery site. Should a failure affect
either the cluster site or its shared storage, Neverfail acts as a
failsafe to keep businesses up and running with no need to reconnect
any application. Neverfail ClusterProtector is available for Microsoft
Exchange Server, Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Office SharePoint
Server.

   "Neverfail ClusterProtector is an ideal complement to Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 failover clustering," said Jason Hermitage,
director, Windows server marketing at Microsoft Corp. "This powerful
combination extends the capabilities of multi-site clustering to
deliver continuous availability through any type of disaster."

   Through intelligent monitoring of the cluster, Neverfail
ClusterProtector can proactively distinguish whether the cluster
itself can handle a node failure or whether failover to the disaster
site is necessary. If failover is necessary, Neverfail seamlessly
provides access to an identical copy of the protected application and
its data at the disaster recovery site. Once the issue is resolved,
Neverfail will seamlessly failback through a simple click of a button.

   Currently in beta, Neverfail ClusterProtector will be available in
July. For those who have not yet implemented Microsoft Windows Server
2008, Neverfail ClusterProtector also offers extended protection for
Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) SQL and Exchange deployments.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 10 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded
Rothmans Inc ROC.TO to "neutral" from "underweight," and
raised its price target on the stock of Canada's No. 2
cigarette maker to C$28 from C$25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Growth will continue on pricing and balanced brand
portfolio for Rothmans, which is known for its Craven A,
Rothmans and Benson  Hedges brands, J.P. Morgan analyst Erik
Bloomquist wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rothmans' fiscal 2008 performance shows that pricing in the
U.S. tobacco market can offset potential tax increases given
the company's significant earnings before interest and tax
growth, Bloomquist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For fiscal 2009, Bloomquist expects a 9 percent
earnings-per-share growth for Toronto-based Rothmans, Canada's
only publicly traded cigarette maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, the brokerage sees increased competition for Rothmans
in low priced segment from Imperial Tobacco Canada, owned by
British American Tobacco Plc (BATS.L), due to higher promotions
and launches in the segments and distribution efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Rothmans closed at C$26.02 Monday on the Toronto
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Quest Software Supports Microsoft with the Release of Enhanced Products to Manage SQL Server Environments

    Powerful New Features Are Added to Capacity Manager and Change
                               Director
ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Quest Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: QSFT), today announced the release
of two products that will enable customers to manage growth and change
in SQL Server environments. Capacity Manager for SQL Server 2.5
enables better control of disk space, growth rates and database
performance, while Change Director for SQL Server permits easier
implementation and control of enterprise-wide changes.

   "In many organizations, SQL Server professionals are charged with
both developing and managing their environments," said Billy Bosworth,
vice president and general manager of Quest's SQL Server business
unit. "The latest releases of these tools, along with other Quest SQL
Server solutions, help organizations maximize return on investment
while lowering total cost of ownership."

   Capacity Manager for SQL Server 2.5 offers capacity planning for
SQL Server databases and the applications they support, such as
SharePoint. Database administrators (DBAs) now have a centralized
console that provides a holistic view of capacity across the database
so they can see past and present events, and predict future growth
trends.

   In addition, Capacity Manager offers intelligent index maintenance
to ensure rebuilding takes place during appropriate windows of time so
performance is not impacted, and simplifies table partitioning to
improve the performance of the database. It also collects data
constantly through integration with Spotlight on SQL Server
Enterprise's data repository to make sure that information is on hand
for consolidation projects, and offers advice as to which servers
would be good candidates for consolidation. For more information about
consolidation and details on Quest's recently published consolidation
guide (see related release), visit: www.quest.com/consolidate.

   "Capacity Manager from Quest Software is a valuable tool for
anyone involved with capacity planning, forecasting and trend
analysis," said Thomas LaRock, database engineering team lead, ING
Investment Management. "As a database administrator, I am responsible
for over one hundred servers in addition to other daily tasks.
Capacity Manager saves time by allowing me to quickly see which
servers need my immediate attention."

   Quest's latest release of Change Director for SQL Server - a
solution that allows DBAs to automate the deployment and migration of
database schema changes - can now more easily implement
enterprise-wide changes by using optional middle-tier architecture.
The introduction of a middle tier affords more flexibility and
scalability by offloading schema comparisons, impact analyses, script
generation and job scheduling to a persistent processing tier. In
addition, Change Director offers clustered environment support for
both passive/active and active/active clusters and new compare and
sync functions that perform comparisons between DDL scripts, previous
database snapshots and live databases. This new release allows DBAs to
better manage, control, and track schema changes across even the most
dynamic of enterprises.

   Pricing and Availability

   Capacity Manager for SQL Server is available now with North
American pricing starting at $995 (USD) per server; more information
is available at http://www.quest.com/capacity-manager-for-sql-server.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Enterprise Customers Gain Speed, Security with Gemalto's Instant Issuance for Converged Badges

ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Gemalto, the world leader in digital security, today announced
Instant Badge Issuance (IBI)--a smart card identity badge creation
system that complements Microsoft's Identity and Access solutions and
enables enterprises to produce employee IDs locally in minutes. In
addition to printing graphics and personalizing applications on a
magnetic stripe or ISO 14443 compatible contactless chip, IBI works
directly with Microsoft Active Directory and Identity Lifecycle
Manager (ILM) to load digital certificates directly onto the smart
card. The result is a single, converged badge that gives employees
secure access to facilities, networks and applications throughout the
enterprise.

   "Our latest innovation gives enterprises the flexibility to issue
locally with very high security," said Jerome Denis, marketing
director for Identity Access Management, Gemalto.

   Gemalto's IBI consists of a smart card badge printer and a
provisioning and personalization system that works seamlessly with
ILM. This combination makes issuance a one-step process that is more
efficient and more secure. IBI provides ID printing, placement of the
Microsoft generated PKI certificates onto the smart card module, and
encoding of the contactless chip or magnetic stripe for secure access
to facilities and other applications. Graphical design capabilities
include photo capture and support for multiple card templates for
employees, contractors, visitors and others.

   "Being able to personalize badges locally while at the same time
have certificates provisioned on them using ILM '2' is a great new
option for our customers," said John "JG" Chirapurath, director,
Identity &amp; Access Marketing, Microsoft Corp. "Overall it helps to make
deploying a converged badge for both physical and information security
more cost-effective and much easier to accomplish."

   When used with Gemalto .NET smart cards, IBI provides the optimal
level of integration for deployment of a secure identity management
system because Gemalto .NET smart card technology is supported
natively in Windows Vista and Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and
through the update for the current Microsoft BaseCSP on Windows XP.

   About Gemalto

   Gemalto (Euronext NL 0000400653 GTO) is the leader in digital
security with pro forma 2007 annual revenues of over EUR 1.6 billion,
more than 85 offices in 40 countries and about 10,000 employees

&lt;p&gt;Quest Software Provides Two-Factor Authentication for Microsoft Identity Lifecycle Manager

     Teams with Avaleris to Enable Integration for Smart Cards and
                                Tokens
ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Quest Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: QSFT) and professional services
provider Avaleris have joined forces to provide two-factor
authentication that is fully integrated with Microsoft's Active
Directory and Identity Lifecycle Manager platform, increasing security
across the enterprise organization.

   In addition, Quest is a launch partner with Microsoft for its
release of Identity Lifecycle Manager "2." Quest continues to invest
in and develop new integration and interoperable points with Microsoft
platforms and, specifically, Identity Lifecycle Manager, to ensure
enterprise customers have unified solutions that optimize their IT
infrastructure.

   "Organizations are looking beyond the traditional security methods
of a username and password because the demand to secure information
has increased exponentially over the years," said Jackson Shaw, senior
director, product management, Quest Software. "By integrating
two-factor one-time password devices with Identity Lifecycle Manager's
Certificate Management capabilities, organizations can now manage
their security needs from a single view, minimizing the effort for
administrators and empowering end users with self-service
capabilities."

   Quest Defender is a two-factor authentication solution that uses a
smart card or token to create strong authentication for an
organization's infrastructure. Avaleris created an extension for Quest
Defender which enables seamless integration with Identity Lifecycle
Manager's Certificate Management capabilities. Together, the two give
organizations the flexibility to offer both one-time password devices
and smart cards to solve challenging use-case scenarios. Once the
credentials of users are issued to one-time password devices or smart
cards, the lifecycles can be managed by Identity Lifecycle Manager.

   "We are excited to work with Quest to produce an integrated
provisioning and lifecycle management experience for our customers,"
said Conrad Bayer, senior vice president of identity &amp; access
management strategy, Avaleris. "This enables organizations to manage a
range of authentication technologies including smart cards, one-time
password devices and certificate-based credentials across the
enterprise - as well as to further extend the value of their Active
Directory-based identity management infrastructure."

   "It is important to see two of our industry partners, Quest
Software and Avaleris, team up to help solve our mutual customers'
challenges around strong authentication," said John "JG" Chirapurath,
director of identity and access marketing at Microsoft Corp. "It is
exciting to have Quest as an Identity Lifecycle Manager '2' beta 3
launch partner."

   Availability and Pricing

   Quest Defender is available today with North American pricing
beginning at $75 per user (USD). For more information and to download

&lt;p&gt;Double-Take(R) Software Announces Extensive Product Line for Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V

     Company to Demo Hyper-V Protection Capabilities at Microsoft
                      Tech--Ed North America 2008
ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Double-Take(R) Software (NASDAQ: DBTK) today unveiled its
protection, availability and migration solutions for Windows Server
2008 Hyper-V here at the Microsoft Tech--Ed conference, booth #809.
Support includes real-time physical-to-virtual (P2V) full system
replication for migration and failover, and virtual-to-virtual (V2V)
replication and failover for maximum uptime. Double-Take Software will
release an edition of Double-Take(R) specifically designed for Windows
Server 2008 Hyper-V, allowing IT administrators to easily and
continuously replicate and failover entire virtual machines between
Hyper-V hosts for V2V disaster recovery and remote availability.

   Double-Take Software will also add Hyper-V support to its existing
P2V protection and migration solutions such as the Double-Take Virtual
Recovery Assistant. The company will round out its suite of solutions
by extending Hyper-V compatibility to its GeoCluster(R) product, which
provides additional capabilities to Microsoft failover clustering.
This functionality will extend the Quick Migration capabilities of
Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V so that administrators can quickly migrate
virtual machines from not just one host to another host, but also from
one location to another remote location and remove the risk of having
a single point of failure.

   "As customers begin to adopt Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V, we want
them to know that Double-Take Software offers the tools they need to
successfully migrate to and then protect their Hyper-V based virtual
infrastructure," said Dave Demlow, chief technology officer,
Double-Take Software.

   "Organizations adopting Hyper-V for their virtual infrastructure
will require data protection solutions to ensure the same business
resilience as in their physical environments. Double-Take Software's
cost-effective recovery platform reduces downtime and data loss,
ensuring ready access to data," stated Lauren Whitehouse, analyst with
Enterprise Strategy Group.

   Whitehouse cited a recent Enterprise Strategy Group report and
highlighted that, "an analysis of vendor preferences among planned
virtualization adopters revealed that, among planned server
virtualization users, Microsoft leads the pack: 69 percent of
respondents say they are evaluating or considering a Microsoft
solution."(a)

   Double-Take Software has a long history of working with Microsoft
to develop innovative data replication and failover solutions.
Expanding its product suite with a substantive Windows Server 2008
Hyper-V offering is the logical next step in the partnership in
addition to being a proactive response to customer needs. Double-Take
Software expects to release this extensive product line shortly after
the release of Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V.

   "Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V enables IT organizations to more
cost-effectively adopt virtualization, improve utilization, optimize
infrastructure, and rapidly provision new servers using systems
management tools for both physical and virtualized environments," said
Zane Adam, senior director of virtualization strategy at Microsoft
Corp. "Double-Take Software provides one of the leading real-time
software-based replication and failover products. Our work together
will ensure that our mutual customers have complete access to
innovative technology to manage their evolving IT infrastructure
needs."

&lt;p&gt;NetEffect the First Ethernet Company to Support Microsoft's NetworkDirect Interface; Achieving Network Performance on Par with Linux

      Sneak Peek at Early Performance Results Planned for ISC '08
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
NetEffect, Inc., the leader in 10Gb Ethernet connectivity
solutions, today announced it is the first Ethernet company to work
with Microsoft to support NetworkDirect interface, Remote Direct
Memory Access (RDMA) interface for high-speed, low-latency networks.
NetworkDirect support for NetEffect accelerated Ethernet adapters will
enable Windows HPC Server 2008 to take full advantage of iWARP RDMA,
achieving optimal cluster performance in enterprise and
high-performance HPC applications.

   The NetworkDirect API in Windows HPC Server 2008 dramatically
reduces latency and CPU utilization through RDMA techniques (RDMA
enable applications to bypass the operating system during many types
of network processing calls). NetEffect Ethernet adapters fully
implement iWARP (RDMA) as well as other accelerations that comprise
the IETF-approved iWARP extensions to Ethernet. Able to take full
advantage of RMDA in a standard Ethernet environment, upcoming version
of Windows HPC Server 2008 can achieve ultra-low latency, exceptional
throughput, and higher levels of server productivity on par with Linux
implementations of iWARP Ethernet, InfiniBand, or proprietary
clustering fabrics. Early performance results show latency under 6
microseconds and 10Gb wire rate performance with messages under 2KB.

   NetEffect adapters supporting NetworkDirect enable Windows HPC
Server 2008 to tackle massively parallel programs over standard
Ethernet infrastructures - such as those found in Financial Services,
Oil &amp; Gas, Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Engineering, and other
industries. In particular, latency sensitive applications, such as
computational fluid dynamics, financial services, reservoir
simulations, and finite element analysis, among others, benefit
immediately.

   "Our work with technology partners, such as NetEffect, is part of
Microsoft's long-term commitment to the HPC space," said Kyril Faenov,
General Manager of the HPC division at Microsoft. "New capabilities
are quickly making the latest releases of Windows HPC Server 2008 the
premier HPC solution for a broad range of commercial and in-house
applications. NetEffect, the first 10 Gigabit RDMA Ethernet provider
for NetworkDirect, is playing an important role in helping us bring
high performance and high-efficiency Windows solutions to our
customers."

   "HPC applications are extremely demanding, they require
exceptionally low latencies to sustain low wall clock and response
times," said Rick Maule, CEO and president, NetEffect. "We've worked
with Microsoft for some time now and are pleased to be first to
demonstrate accelerated Ethernet solutions that both open up new
markets and help existing Ethernet and Microsoft customers leverage
their existing Ethernet investments."

   In addition to delivering performance advantages, NetEffect
adapters also set the bar for the lowest energy consumption. Using 6.5
watts - less than half that of the competition - no other adapter
comes close to providing such energy savings.

   Availability

   NetEffect adapters are available now directly through the company
or through a nationwide network of resellers and systems integrators.
For more information visit: www.neteffect.com. Contact Microsoft for
availability of NetEffect 10GbE support for NetworkDirect in Windows
HPC Server 2008. For more information, visit: www.microsoft.com/hpc.

   Editors Note: NetEffect will be present to field questions at the
International Supercomputing Conference (ISC), June 17 - 19, Microsoft
Booth, B01-B12, in Dresden, Germany.

   About NetEffect

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian fund unit of JPMorgan (JPM.N) is positive on industrial and infrastructure sectors, despite a sharp fall in their share values and is not averse to raising its exposure if they fell further, it said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks from the sectors have under-performed primarily due to concerns over their ability to pass on higher commodity costs to customers as well as execution-related challenges, the firm said in its monthly factsheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have analysed each of the businesses in our portfolio... in most cases we have found that the stock price reaction has been exaggerated and expect the stock prices to be marked up subsequently as market refocuses on business performance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will not hesitate in adding to some of these businesses we like if the market sentiment brings the prices down to irrational levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BSE Capital Goods index .BSECG has plunged 41 percent this year, far more than the 27 percent decline in India's benchmark stock index .BSESN, Reuters data showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in engineering and construction firm Punj Lloyd Ltd (PUJL.BO) and transmission lines contractor Kalpataru Power Transmission Ltd (KAPT.BO) are down more than 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, JPMorgan said, the firms operating in these sectors had strong cash flows and would benefit from government policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indian government estimates $500 billion worth of investment is needed over the next four to five years to strengthen the country's transport and power backbone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to believe that industrial and infrastructure capex will be a multi-year theme despite what the current stock prices seem to suggest," the firm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm was overweight on the two sectors in both of its domestic equity funds and had Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL.BO) and Larsen  Toubro (LART.BO) among its top-10 holdings in JPMorgan India Equity Fund at the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OptionsNews on ONN.tv for June 10, 2008
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
OptionsNews, the daily news program on www.onn.tv, today reported
on the following companies:

   Monday's option volume for indexes and single stocks registered
just over 14 million contracts, in line with the year to date average
of 14 million contracts and lower than Friday's volume of nearly 15
1/2 million contracts. The CBOE volatility index, also known as the
VIX, ended the day at 23.12, down nearly 2% from Friday's close of
23.66.

   In a story reported yesterday by Reuters, banking analyst Richard
Bove commented that JP Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon is "a patriot" for
purchasing Bear Stearns, and intimated that he engineered the buy-out
of troubled Bear Stearns less out of business interests and more to
help save the US financial system. Bove, of Ladenburg Thalmann, said
that JP Morgan won't see any return on their investment because none
of Bear's businesses will add to profit. "Bear Stearns should have
gone bankrupt because there's nothing there but a great building in
New York," said Bove, who rates JP Morgan a "neutral." Comments like
these from an analyst as high-profile as Bove support the argument
that volatility could be a continued presence in the financial stocks.
As we have covered repeatedly on the options news, traders who think
that volatility could stick around might consider the XLF and its
options, since the XLF is an ETF that will track the returns of a
basket of stocks, rather than just one.

&lt;p&gt;Research and Markets: Available Now: General Electric - IT Sales Opportunities - 2008

DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/c94243) has announced the
addition of "General Electric - IT Sales Opportunities - 2008" to
their offering.

   General Electric (GE) is a diversified technology, media and
financial services company. With products and services ranging from
aircraft engines, power generation, water processing and security
technology to medical imaging, business and consumer financing, media
content and industrial products, it serves customers in more than 100
countries. The company operates in six segments: Infrastructure,
Commercial Finance, GE Money, Healthcare, NBC Universal and
Industrial.

   Industry trends and drivers have a direct or indirect affect on IT
spending of all companies operating within an industry. For example -
increase in sourcing from low cost countries might influence GE to
relook at their supply chains, resulting in selling opportunities for
SCM solutions, collaboration tools etc. Thus, we can conclude that
industry spending on any particular IT product or service is an
important indicator of the criticality of that product or service for
the industry. Based on the IT spend information available in
'TechNavio', we have computed a 'criticality score' for various IT
products and services, for GE

   Various company level developments and events are important
indicators of selling opportunities and drive the sales of IT products
and services. For example - an acquisition by GE might result in
opportunities for IT migration and integration services. By tracking
these sales drivers (using 'TechNavio'), we have arrived at a demand
score for each product and service.

   Through an in-depth analysis of industry trends and drivers and
company level developments and events, we have made the 'IT Selling
Opportunities Map' for hardware, software and IT services for GE.
These maps have been divided into four zones representing Level I,
Level II and Level III opportunity areas. Level I opportunity areas
have the highest scores and hence, there is a high probability that GE
will buy these products and services. Level II opportunity areas have
lower scores and hence, lower probability to sell to GE Level III
opportunities have the lowest scores and hence, unlikely to sell to
GE.

   The report is meant for IT vendors and intends to help them
identify selling opportunities within the company. Furthermore, the
identified sales drivers can be used to penetrate these accounts or
increase current share of the customer's wallet. Also, the report
lists key IT spending decision makers, which enables the salesperson
to directly contact the key executives within the company.

   TechNavio Insights is a set of reports based on TechNavio - a
market intelligence platform for the IT industry. It builds on the
intelligence available within TechNavio, and leverages on the custom
research experience of the 'Technology Navigators'. TechNavio is built
on years of experience of the author's in deep dive custom research
and consulting for over 30 Fortune 500 companies and numerous large
and mid-sized companies.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) 
wants roughly $6 billion in damages from larger rivals Visa Inc 
(V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) in a long-running antitrust 
lawsuit, court documents made public on Monday show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The claim was cited in court papers that previously were 
kept confidential in the case, first filed four years ago. 
Discover contends that Visa and MasterCard violated antitrust 
law and harmed Discover's business by preventing their member 
banks from issuing credit cards for Discover's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We remain very confident in our strong cases against both 
Visa and MasterCard that seek damages for the harm their 
anti-competitive practices have caused us," Discover said in a 
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Visa and MasterCard disputed Discover's damages claim, 
which could potentially be tripled if Discover prevails at 
trial. A trial has been set for September in U.S. District 
Court in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The amount of damages sought by Discover "is dramatically 
overstated," San Francisco-based Visa said in a statement. 
MasterCard, based in Purchase, New York, said that Discover's 
damages claim "is baseless."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of all three companies were down in late afternoon 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Visa was down 3 
percent, MasterCard was down 1.2 percent and Discover was down 
2.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a Visa court filing, Discover has put forward 
a damages theory "that totals approximately $6 billion, before 
trebling, and is based upon multiple banks issuing credit or 
debit cards on the Discover network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In November 2007, Visa agreed to settle a similar lawsuit 
with American Express Co (AXP.N) for about $2.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa previously placed $3 billion into a U.S. litigation 
escrow account with net proceeds from its March initial public 
offering -- funds that were withheld from its U.S. member 
banks' distribution in the IPO. The company said this account 
has been used to pay the American Express legal settlement and 
"will be used to pay for any future settlement of, or judgment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; in" other related litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Discover, formerly a unit of Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and 
American Express brought their lawsuits in 2004, soon after the 
U.S. Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling in a lawsuit 
that found that Visa and MasterCard violated antitrust laws. 
That lawsuit had been filed by the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MasterCard stock was down 6.34 to $289.39 on Monday 
afternoon, Visa was down $2.53 to $81.12, and Discover was down 
46 cents at $15.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Martha Graybow; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Live, onscreen chat functions for future installments of such titles as "Lost" and "High School Musical" are among the next-generation extras Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has up its sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the studio begins an aggressive push to transition consumers from standard DVD to Blu-ray Disc, it plans to introduce a suite of Web-enhanced special features that will include exclusive conversations with filmmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a presentation Monday night to officially unveil Disney's first BD Live title -- an elaborate 50th anniversary edition release of "Sleeping Beauty" -- division president Bob Chapek promised to add BD Live elements, which allow movie viewers to tap into the Web for a wealth of interactive options, to all upcoming Disney-branded releases beginning in the fourth quarter. To further hasten the transition to Blu-ray, Disney is including a standard DVD with "Sleeping Beauty" to make it easy for consumers to understand the difference between the two formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapek said the interactive extras on "Sleeping Beauty," from onscreen chat rooms to video messaging, are merely "our jumping-off point of what's to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to BD Live, future Disney releases could include such extras as live chats with filmmakers in which viewers use their BlackBerrys or other PDAs to type in their end of the conversation, which then appears on the screen, as the movie rolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chat function debuts with "Sleeping Beauty," out October 7, with an instant message window that enables viewers to chat with fellow viewers watching the Blu-ray Disc at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea of my little girl being able to experience the movie and chat in real time with her grandparents across the country is very exciting to me," Chapek said. "We are introducing this important feature on 'Sleeping Beauty,' but imagine the possibilities of extending this to other titles such as 'High School Musical' or, eventually, ABC's hit show 'Lost.' Can you imagine the level of excitement that will create with the tweens or the rabid fan base of 'Lost'?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the studio's video messaging, or "Disney Movie Mail," a viewer can insert a video message into a movie at any point and send it to another viewer for playback the next time the movie is watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Theoretically, it takes a greeting card and puts it on steroids," Chapek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapek said Disney's goal is to "reinvent the experience of watching movies in the home ... by laying in a level of interactivity and connectivity that has never before been attempted in any format. This interactive connectivity will help us to connect families all across the country and help make the family room relevant again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewers taking advantage of these and other BD Live functions, Chapek said, will accumulate "reward points" and be able to tap into a newly created Disney BD Live Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here, Blu-ray owners will be able to acquire studio updates, download new trailers and use their accumulated reward points to obtain wallpapers, ringtones, avatars and many other new exciting possibilities," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - Three Disney-licensed charm
bracelet sets and four "Charm It!" charms for children were
tested and found to contain illegal levels of lead, according
to the U.S. advocacy group Center for Environmental Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Disney-licensed charm bracelet sets "Disney Fairies,"
"High School Musical" and "Hannah Montana," which were bought
at Barnes  Noble (BKS.N), had between three and eight times
the federally permitted levels of lead in the bracelets'
coating, according to an independent laboratory commissioned by
the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federal law forbids paint to be used in children's products
if it has more than 600 parts per million of lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barnes  Noble asked its stores to remove the product from
shelves until they can be proved safe, said spokeswoman Mary
Ellen Keating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have already pulled the product from the web site,"
said Keating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A charm for young children called "Charm It!", which was
purchased at a toy store, also had high lead levels, with one
testing at more than 150 times the California state standard,
said the California-based group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The jewelry was made by the privately held High IntenCity
Corp of New Jersey, the group said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High IntenCity had no immediate comment and messages left
for Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) were not immediately returned.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alcoa Inc's (AA.N) stock fell nearly 8 percent on Wednesday after a brokerage firm cut its investment rating and profit estimate, expressing doubts Wall Street would like the new chief executive's strategy for the aluminum company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downgrade came amid speculation that Alcoa is an acquisition target and after the company warned second-quarter earnings would be 2 cents or 3 cents per share lower as a result of gas disruptions at its Australian operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the market will be disappointed with both the strategic direction from the new CEO, Klaus Kleinfeld, and the company's near-term earnings due to higher than expected input (raw material and energy) costs," J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Gambardella wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he supported Kleinfeld's approach to creating shareholder value by improving the performance of Alcoa's "downstream" consumer products businesses. Alcoa also has "upstream" operations which mine bauxite and produce alumina, which is smelted into aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(But) we believe the market is fixated on the quick value fix of extracting the downstream from Alcoa's upstream alumina and primary segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, we think the market will be very disappointed by Alcoa's intent to remain a conglomerate regardless of how effective Kleinfeld might be at creating value in the long term," Gambardella wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Alcoa was named in a Brazilian newspaper report as a possible target of miner Vale (VALE5.SA) (RIO.N), which is reported to be working on a more than $30 billion bid for one of the world's largest mining companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Hicks, co-manager of U.S. Global Investors' resources fund, said some investors had put money into Alcoa as a result of the merger speculation. "It (Alcoa) would fit into some portfolios, Vale being one and BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) (BLT.L) has also been mentioned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Hicks said, "a lot of money jumped back out" on Wednesday, dragging the stock down as material companies were relatively weak. Another producer, Kaiser Aluminum Corp (KALU.O) closed down 4.35 percent on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst David Lee Smith, of online investment service firm The Motley Fool, said Alcoa's stock had moved up on the Vale rumors earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But my feeling is that Alcoa is an unlikely candidate, it looks less likely it will be a target (of Vale)," he said. The "skittish market" combined with the J.P. Morgan downgrade and the earnings warning "weighed on the stock today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another analyst, Scott Burns of Morningstar in Chicago, said that with the dollar weak, most metals company stocks had been selling off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alcoa avoided that while there were rumors it would be taken out by Vale. Now there's a bit of catch-up going on as, with worries about the economy, all the metals are selling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wednesday's research note, J.P Morgan cut Alcoa's investment rating to "neutral" from "overweight" and lowered its 2008 earnings estimate to $2.18 per share from $2.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While aluminum prices might be 17 percent higher in the second quarter than the first, "these gains will be largely offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency trends," Gambardella wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcoa stock closed the day on the New York Stock Exchange down $3.40 at $39.32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Steve James; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The record wave of foreclosures darkening the U.S. housing market may actually be boosting consumer spending, Tom Lee, chief U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan Securities, said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many owners are stuck with mortgages that exceed the value of their homes after a double-digit national home price slump in the last two years. Conventional wisdom says owners who are unable to refinance or sell their homes are cash-starved and sharply curbing spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lee said that as an increasing number of "under water" homeowners return their keys to lenders and walk away from their mortgages and properties the reverse is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a perverse way, people who are leaving homes are actually helping the consumer spending picture," Lee told the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit on New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you were under water in a mortgage, and then you walked away, you literally stop paying the mortgage so your actual disposable income goes up," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be one reason why consumer spending hasn't gotten hit harder given the headwinds of the worst U.S. housing market since the Great Depression and sweeping oil price gains, according to Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales at U.S. stores open at least one year, a retail benchmark known as same-store sales, rose 2.5 percent in May, more than twice the average increase forecast by economists, for example, as consumers focused on discount prices and essentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While they don't have the consumption upside from wealth and therefore the propensity to spend" from money gained from home price appreciation, "if they walk away from their home, they actually can increase spending power," Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lynn Adler; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAINT-PAUL-EN-JARREZ, France (Reuters) - Former world champion Tom Boonen, under investigation for suspected cocaine possession, has been barred from competing in the Tour de France, race director Christian Prudhomme said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Belgian, who won the green jersey for the best sprinter of the Tour last year, is being investigated after traces of the drug were found in a urine sample taken last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Boonen will not be welcome," Prudhomme told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had to wait until this morning's press conference, until I had talked with Tom Boonen and Patrick Lefevere, his manager (before making a decision)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told them that Tom Boonen could not take part in the Tour de France. It is not a doping case, it is not about a rider who took substances to improve his performances but it is about a private matter," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly, this affair hits the integrity of the Tour de France and the integrity of the riders participating in the race. The link has been made with the Tour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the public prosecutor's office in the Belgian city of Turnhout said Boonen was being investigated. Police carried out a series of searches on Monday but found no evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boonen told a news conference earlier on Wednesday that his Quick Step team had assured him of their continued confidence, but he did not directly address the drug issue in a short statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIVATE MATTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am not going to conduct my defense here and now," Boonen said, adding only that he was "not perfect" and apologized for the embarrassment the affair had caused his friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boonen faces a spell of between three months to five years in prison if found guilty but does not risk sanctions from the International Cycling Union as positive cocaine tests out-of-competition do not carry a penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Belgian, who won the world road race championship in 2005, has six Tour stages to his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Tour of Switzerland organizers barred the 27-year-old from competing at this year's race but said the Quick Step team would be allowed to take part in the event starting on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Julien Pretot in Paris, additional reporting by Mark John in Wielsbeke, Belgium, editing by Justin Palmer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market will likely outperform all other global equity indexes in 2008 as a riskier investing environment will make its relatively low valuation and heavier volume more attractive, a top U.S. equity strategist said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor's 500 index is set to end the year at 1,450, or about 7 percent above its current level, Tom Lee, chief U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan Securities, told the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the U.S. is looking as the least risky equity class," said Lee. U.S. stock markets are the most regulated compared with their overseas counterparts and that should provide comfort to investors as turmoil in global financial markets hurts corporate balance sheets, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In volatile times, disclosure is really important," Lee said. "In February I was hosting a panel with several hedge funds and what they said is they have been so glad for Sarbanes-Oxley -- this is the only time -- because they realize companies' CFOs can go to jail if they lie."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sarbanes-Oxley corporate and accounting reform law was passed in 2002 after the Enron accounting scandal, and other accounting fraud scandals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Year-to-date, the SP 500 is down 8.3 percent, nearly equal to losses on Japan's Nikkei .N225. Europe's main benchmark, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3, is down by nearly twice as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging market indexes, which largely outperformed the United States by a wide margin last year, are split so far this year. China's Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC has far outpaced losses on the SP 500, tumbling 41.6 percent year-to-date. Latin American benchmarks, meanwhile, are ahead of the SP 500, with Brazil's Bovespa .BVSP up about 5 percent and Mexico's IPC index .MXX around 4 percent higher year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The EM story is less clear-cut," Lee said of the outlook for emerging markets. "Now you're starting to see the inflation, which was really nailing U.S. households for the better part of the last 12 months, is now really start to boil in emerging markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jennifer Coogan; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, June 11 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
offered Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) a role in a liquefied
natural gas regasification terminal on the U.S. East Coast,
Itar-Tass quoted Gazprom Deputy Chief Executive Alexander
Medvedev as saying on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Medvedev said Gazprom could have a role in the terminal's
facilities or become an investor, according to Russian news
agency Itar-Tass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russia's Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas producer,
has been expanding steadily around the globe, with projects in
the Middle East, Africa and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil hopes to build a $1 billion terminal off the
New Jersey coast to receive and regasify liquefied natural gas.
The company has not yet received the permits for the BlueOcean
Energy terminal, which would have the capacity to supply about
1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to New Jersey and
New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon was not immediately available for comment. But Andrew
Swiger, the executive who runs Exxon's natural gas business,
told Reuters last week that the company was looking at a number
of options to secure a gas supply for the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It may well wind up being an integrated value chain
project. It may be something else, but we are working a number
of things," he said.

&lt;p&gt;June 11 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded asset
management firm Annaly Capital Management Inc (NLY.N) to
"neutral" from "overweight," saying the stock is fairly priced
given the likelihood of short-term interest rate hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is likely that short-term rates will continue to rise
gradually through the end of this year, and spreads would begin
to compress as a result, said the brokerage, which lowered its
estimates for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top Federal Reserve officials on Tuesday hammered home the
U.S. central bank's determination not to allow inflation to get
out of control, cementing views that interest rates will rise
later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We also believe a tightening environment could slow or
even halt Annaly's recent pace of accretive follow-on
offerings," analyst Andrew Wessel said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the company had publicly offered 60 million
shares at $16.15 per share for estimated gross proceeds of
about $969 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the New York-based company were down more than 4
percent at $15.74 in noon trade on the New York Stock
Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today released the latest in its series of "Healthcare 2015"
vision statements, looking forward to redefine healthcare delivery models of the
future and the competencies that will be required from them.  In the study,
entitled,  Healthcare 2015 and care delivery: Delivery models refined,
competenciesdefined, the company also called on U.S. and international health
systems to
collaborate in achieving such new milestones in defining, measuring and
delivering
healthcare value, activating citizen-consumers who will become increasingly
responsible for their own healthcare, and promoting improved health promotion
and care delivery in the face of a growing litany of challenges.

    Placing a spotlight directly on the driving forces that are challenging
existing
healthcare delivery systems -- these include globalization, consumerism,
changing
demographics and lifestyles, diseases that are more expensive to treat, the
proliferation of medical technologies and treatments, financial constraints,
resource shortages, increasingly unrealistic societal expectations and norms,
and an
absence of information systems, among others -- IBM stated that the only cure
for
health systems around the world is a fundamental transformation of healthcare.

    In the near term, however, the study said such critical transformation
willbe frustrated by a series of near-term adjustments that will fall far
shortof the ultimate goal:


--  Piecemeal, incremental approaches to healthcare change, sometimes with
    poor results and unintended consequences
--  A struggle to seek a viable balance in public and private healthcare
    spending
--  An increasing portion of health-related financial responsibility
    transferred to individual citizens
--  The emergence of new and non-traditional local and global competitors
    and collaborators
--  A proliferation of health promotion and care-delivery models and
    capabilities.
    

    
"Historically, care-delivery organizations (CDOs) could declare broad
andabstract targets or even attempt to be 'all things to all citizens' and still
compete effectively," said Jim Adams, Executive Director, IBM Center for
Healthcare Management.  "But in the future, we believe it will be harder to
maintain an undifferentiated service-delivery model, whether it be a public
or private healthcare system model."

    Instead, Adams said the increasing focus on value, the rising need to
activate responsible citizens, and the changing requirements of health promotion
and care delivery will force many CDOs to adopt and develop service delivery
models with new and sharper strategic focus.  Regardless of their chosen service
delivery models, IBM predicts that CDOs will also require a core set of
enhanced and expanded competencies.

    At present, IBM notes that most CDOs already fit into one or more of four
generic service delivery models:


--  Community health networks, focusing on optimizing access across a
    defined geography
--  Centers of excellence, focusing on optimizing clinical quality and
    safety for specific medical conditions
--  Medical concierges, focusing on optimizing the citizen/patient
    experience and relationship
--  Price leaders, focusing on optimizing productivity and workflow.
    

    
However, as demands on care providers shift, IBM predicts that the
modelsfor promoting health and delivering care will follow suit.  CDOs and
clinicians will need to develop or improve a set of underlying
competenciesto successfully implement the service delivery models.  The new
study
recommends five such strategic competencies: Empowering and activating
consumer-citizens; collaborating and integrating; innovating; optimizing
operational
efficiencies; and enabling these through information technology.

    The study closes by offering a course of action for CDOs:


--  Fully recognize the need for and help to shape a more patient-centric,
    value-based, accountable, affordable and sustainable healthcare system
--  Identify the service delivery models and competencies needed to
    prosper in the new order
--  Assess their readiness in the competencies needed to implement the new
    or redefined service-delivery models
--  Develop and execute plans to transition to the new delivery models and
    develop new competencies required to support them.
    

    
"Status quo is not an option or healthcare systems in the U.S. and
manyother countries," said Dan Pelino, General Manager of IBM's Global
Healthcare
and Life Sciences Industry.  "Ultimately, the transformation of healthcare
systems will require commitment and follow-through on coordinated,
collaborative efforts among key stakeholders, particularly CDOs and clinicians
at the
epicenter of efforts to create more value-focused healthcare."

    IBM's new study is an extension of Healthcare 2015: Win-Win or Lose-Lose,
which was the company's original work detailing the broad case for healthcare
systemtransformation.  It was published in October 2006.  Another study,
Healthcare 2015 and U.S. Health Plans: New roles, new competencies, published
last September, presented a forward-looking view of required transformation
in the Health Benefits segment.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the results of a client survey that
concludes that businesses around the world are quickly moving from the adoption
phase of  a service oriented architecture (SOA) strategy to the actual
deployment of SOA technologies and services. According to the survey, the rate
of
SOA deployments is on the rise, an indication that business leaders are
seeking the benefits of SOA for today's challenging business environments.

    SOA is a business strategy that helps a company reuse existing technology to
more
closely align it with business goals, driving efficiencies, cost savings,
productivity, and enabling the creation of more modular and global business
designs. SOA has grown increasingly popular among businesses looking to
accelerate
cost savings and a return on investment (ROI).

    The survey was conducted for IBM by the Link Group and consisted of a
sampling of 300 clients at the IBM IMPACT 2008 event, the industry's largest SOA
conference, which drew nearly 6,300 technical and business leaders.

    Key findings of the study indicate that 50 percent of customers surveyed are
currently deploying SOA, with another 27 percent piloting it. In addition,
42 percent of customers surveyed indicated SOA was their company's top spending
priority in 2008. This is a strong endorsement given that many companies are
closely scrutinizing IT budgets.

    In most cases, these aren't small SOA projects. Sixty percent of customers
indicated that current SOA projects span either the scope of their enterprise
or an entire division. Among those customers, 96 percent described their most
recent SOA projects as either "very successful" or "somewhat successful"
this year.

    Among those companies working with IBM to establish an SOA strategy, many
are
quickly realizing the benefits. "Establishing an SOA based on IBM WebSphere
software has allowed us to serve our customers more efficiently and effectively
by
enabling total integration between our multiple business systems," said Chen
Gang,
director, Shanxi Mobile Communications Company.

    Additional findings from the survey include:


--  73 percent of customers indicated their CEO understands the business
    value of SOA; more than half say their IT staff is meeting once per month
    or more with business managers they support.
--  45 percent of customers indicated they spent between 10 percent and 29
    percent of their 2007 IT budgets on SOA.
    

    "These survey results clearly indicate SOA strategies are helping
clientsdeliver tangible benefits as they advance from the adoption to the
deployment
phase," said Sandy Carter, vice president, WebSphere and SOA strategy,
marketing and channels, IBM.


 In a related study*, IBM surveyed existing
customers on the current maturity of their SOA deployments. Some of the key
findings include:


--  SOA adoption is shifting from technology to business led: Business-
    centric SOA more than doubled, from 30 percent in 2006 to over 70 percent
    in 2007.
--  The banking and insurance industries lead in the maturity of their SOA
    deployments.
--  Improving business flexibility is the top benefit sought from SOA.
--  Business expertise is ranked as the top criteria to select an SOA
    vendor -- up 24 percent year to year.
--  35 percent of customers indicated Business Process Management (BPM) as
    focus area for SOA, with 32 percent citing reuse.
    

    
IBM helps companies to fully embrace an SOA strategy by providing a
broadportfolio of SOA software, services and support. By bringing together
thesecomponents for clients around the world, IBM has emerged as the SOA
industry
leader with 64 percent market share according to WinterGreen Research**. With
more
than 6,550 SOA customer engagements and 5,000 SOA Business Partners, IBM has
increased its SOA client and partner base by nearly 50 percent in less than
one year.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments, background and share price details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tenzin Pema&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGALORE, June 11 (Reuters) -J.P. Morgan Securities said
it expects Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N to post a loss in
2008, and substantially cut its second-quarter view for the
Wall Street investment bank mainly due to ineffective hedging,
slower client activity and likely writedowns from monoline
exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Merrill, which earlier fell to a new five-year
low of $36.16, pared some of its losses and were down more than
4 percent to $36.27 in morning trade on the New York Stock
Exchange. They have plunged 32 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the recent credit rating downgrades of the world's
largest two insurers, MBIA Inc (MBI.N) and Ambac Financial
Group ABK.N, Merrill may have to raise its credit reserves
for its $7.8 billion gross exposure to monolines, analyst
Kenneth Worthington said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While MER has reserved against its monoline exposure, it's
unclear if it reserved enough," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On June 5, Standard  Poor's stripped the bond insurance
units of MBIA and Ambac of their top ratings, formally ending
their "AAA"-guaranty business. The riskiest exposures banks
hold to the monolines is through insurance they purchased on
debt backed by risky assets such as residential mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, SP said Merrill has one of the largest
exposures to these types of assets, with $18.8 billion in super
senior asset-backed collateral debt obligations as of March 28.
Merrill wrote down $1.34 billion of this exposure in the fourth
quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worthington now expects Merrill to break even in the second
quarter, compared with his prior view of a profit of 62 cents a
share. For 2008, he expects Merrill to post a loss of 4 cents a
share, compared with his prior view of a profit of 86 cents a
share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among 17 analysts covering Merrill, Worthington ranks sixth
in the accuracy of his earnings estimates, according to data
compiled by Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INEFFECTIVE HEDGING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worthington is the latest in a growing line-up of Wall
Street research analysts to forecast losses at Merrill from
ineffective hedging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The performance of the cash positions and the index based
hedges have diverged, resulting in less effective or value
destroying hedges this quarter," Worthington said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leveraged loan exposure for Merrill continues to be a
burden, he said. He, however, expects asset sales during the
quarter to reduce exposure even with ineffective hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst maintained his "neutral" rating on the stock.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Standard  Poor's 500 financial sector .GSPF sank to a five-year low on Wednesday, led by declines in investment bank shares on a rumor that Goldman Sachs (GS.N) would report large writedowns when it reports quarterly figures next week, market participants said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There's been rumors of a large write-off to be announced at Goldman Sachs, which has caused a lot of the financial stocks to swoon a little bit.

The SP 500 financial index was off 1.6 percent at just below 304, up from a five-year low of 301.15 set earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman told Reuters the company does not comment on market rumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. said on Tuesday it 
expects retail sales of licensed merchandise to top $30 billion 
worldwide in fiscal 2008, helped by its popular Disney Princess 
and High School Musical brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Last year, the company said its sales of licensed Disney 
merchandise rose to $27 billion, more than doubling from five 
years earlier. Disney receives a licensing fee, usually between 
8 percent and 10 percent, of total retail sales of product 
associated with its brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retail sales of merchandise aimed at "tweens" -- children 
aged 9 to 12 -- such as the Disney Channel's High School 
Musical and Hannah Montana, is expected to surge to $2.7 
billion in fiscal 2008 from $400 million a year earlier, Disney 
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney also projected that its Fairies and Princess 
franchises aimed at younger girls would reach $5 billion, and 
that merchandise based on the hit Disney-Pixar film "Cars" 
would reach $2.5 billion in worldwide retail sales this fiscal 
year, which closes in the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares rose 1.5 percent to $33.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Paul Thomasch in New York and Gina Keating in

end market and the stock's high valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Almost every company we met with stated they are
experiencing a slowdown in demand from the Chinese consumer end
market due to the earthquake centered in Szechwan province,"
analyst Christopher Danely said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the slowdown should hurt Microchip, as the company
is roughly 34 percent exposed to the consumer end market, and
China represents over 20 percent of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Most companies are hopeful demand will stabilize and
improve just before the Olympic Games in late July/early
August," Danely added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the Chandler, Arizona-based company were trading
down about 8 percent at $31.51 in morning trade on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 As part of IBM's "Project Big Green" offerings, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced
new
storage virtualization software that helps clients more efficiently manage and
consolidate volumes of business data, providing clients with a storage solution
designed to help improve utilization rates, energy efficiency, availability, and
scalability of critical applications.

    The capabilities of the new IBM System Storage SAN Volume Controller (SVC)
4.3
software can help significantly improve the flexibility and responsiveness of
IT infrastructures by creating consolidated, virtual pools of information across
the enterprise, which enables IT departments to respond more quickly to
client needs and centrally manage resources. Storage virtualization technology
can
reduce requirements for additional physical storage hardware systems, which can
ultimately reduce overall energy usage in the data center.

    Virtualization is one of the five pillars of IBM's Project Big Green
offerings,
and a key component of IBM's new enterprise data center model, designed to help
clients improve IT efficiency and facilitate the rapid deployment of new IT
services for future business growth. The new model is based on best
practices for virtualization, green IT, service management and cloud computing.

    IBM remains the leader in storage virtualization with the fastest system
tested
in the industry(1). Since its introduction to the market in 2003, IBM has
shipped over 12,000 SVC engines running in more than 4,000 SVC systems.

    With the volume of data that clients have to store growing exponentially,
keeping
control of storage costs and improving storage utilization is taking on
increasing importance in the data center.  The improvements in SVC 4.3 can
help improve storage utilization even further, which helps reduce energy
consumption for a greener data center.

    "IBM is dedicated to helping its clients improve their information
infrastructures
through powerful virtualization technology," said Barry Rudolph, Vice
President, Storage Stack Solutions, IBM. "We have been the leader in storage
virtualization since SVC was introduced five years ago, and this latest
version from IBM further showcases our innovation and represents our
commitment to clients to incorporate green, efficient technologies into our
storage
portfolio to help clients manage the data center crisis of today."

    The IBM SVC 4.3 software announced today includes the
following
enhancements:


--  Space-Efficient Virtual Disks - uses disk space only when data is
    written instead of reserving disk space for the entire capacity of a
    virtual disk;
--  Space-Efficient FlashCopy - uses disk space only for changes between
    source and target data and not for the entire capacity of a virtual disk
    copy;
--  Virtual Disk Mirroring - helps improve availability for critical
    applications by storing two copies of a virtual disk on different disk
    systems;
--  Improved Interoperability - includes support for Microsoft Windows
    Server 2008, Mac OS X Server, as well as Pillar Axiom disk systems.
    

    
Although the impact of SVC's specific features and functions is highly
workload dependent and based on each client's individual data center
specifications, features such as SVC's new Space-Efficient FlashCopy could help
reduce space required for copies by as much as 75 percent or more.

    Also announced today is a new release of the IBM System Storage Productivity
Center (SSPC). As the management console for SVC systems, SSPC is designed to
provide clients with a superior management platform, integrating virtual and
physical infrastructure management. SSPC includes TotalStorage Productivity
Center
for Replication 3.4 preinstalled, providing simplified management of advanced
copy
services offered by SVC FlashCopy, and Metro and Global Mirror. IBM
TotalStorage Productivity Center software helps increase energy efficiency by
offering
a solution that helps customers reduce wasted disk space by identifying
duplicate data,
orphan data, temporary data, and non-business data; TotalStorage Productivity
Center
can also identify less frequently accessed data files that could be migrated to
even more energy-efficient storage systems such as tape.

    "Power consumption continues to be a top concern for our key large data
center
clients and IBM SAN Volume Controller is addressing this with the most
efficient storage utilization technologies," said Andy Slater, Chief Operating
Officer, Tectrade.  "Since its launch five years ago, SVC has continued to
evolve, and SVC 4.3 now offers the Space-Efficient FlashCopy feature, which uses
disk space only for changes between source and target data rather than for the
entire capacity of a virtual disk copy -- a real benefit for clients looking
to reduce their carbon footprint."

    IBM's storage virtualization enhancements help bolster Project Big Green,
the
company's effort to address the growing customer demand for greener storage
solutions. IBM's SVC cements itself as a key offering that enables customers to
improve the energy efficiency of their data center on multiple fronts,
including:


--  Non-Disruptive Data Migration - Supports migration of data from older
    to newer supported disk systems without disruption to applications,
    enabling customers to quickly start data migration immediately and
    disconnect from older, less energy-efficient storage solutions;
--  Simplified Tiered-Storage Implementation - Can help simplify
    implementation of a tiered storage infrastructure, improve performance of
    lower tier storage, and help move data between tiers without disruption.
    This can make it easier to match data types with the right storage, and to
    move data when requirements change.  Together, these abilities can also
    make it easy to blend different types of storage for a lower overall energy
    footprint and;
--  Improved Storage Utilization - Can pool storage volumes from IBM and
    non-IBM storage systems into a single reservoir of capacity for centralized
    management, helping to increase the utilization of storage and reduce
    requirements for additional storage in the future. This ability can reduce
    the total amount of storage hardware required, which helps reduce the
    energy usage of the storage configuration.
    

    
"IBM SAN Volume Controller really simplifies storage virtualization
for our clients because they don't have deal with re-architecting their entire
storage infrastructure.  SVC doesn't lock them to one vendor's solutions," said
Greg
Nightingale, Director of Storage Solutions, Sirius Computer Solutions, Inc. 
"The
technical elegance and managerial simplicity that the SVC is built around
promotes immediate ROI across multiple areas -- from non-disruptive data
migration and seamless data movement and copy to remote replication.  The new
version of SVC includes enhancements such as thin provisioning which
translates into even greater functionality, flexibility and value. Moreover,
IBM's
SVC captures the market's demand for greener storage solutions that maximize
storage utilization and minimize the power and cooling required to support the
IT infrastructure."

    In addition to helping clients create a more energy-efficient data center,
IBM's
storage virtualization solution also helps to unlock the proprietary hold that
vendors such as EMC, HP and Hitachi have had on organizations for years. With
IBM SVC, clients can choose any combination of storage devices from EMC, IBM,
HP,
Hitachi or other vendors, virtualize them and manage and deploy them easily
and with greater flexibility and independence than ever before.  Fitness club
company Lifestyle Family Fitness is benefiting from this feature.

    Lifestyle Family Fitness opened the doors to its first health club in
Lakeland, FL in 1982. Based in the Tampa Bay, Florida area Lifestyle
FamilyFitness now owns and operates health clubs throughout the Southeast,
Midwest, and
Mid-Atlantic with aggressive growth planned throughout the next five years.
According to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association
(IHRSA) Lifestyle Family Fitness is one of the top 20 fastest growing health
club companies in the world. The company's primary data center, based in St.
Petersburg, Florida, includes a combined storage and server infrastructure which
manages key applications for the entire club network, including employee
records, new club memberships, personal training contracts and sales and
services.

    Anticipating growth and increased IT complexity that is inevitable with an
expanding business, Lifestyle Family Fitness decided to upgrade its data
center infrastructure to solve the bottleneck input/output (I/O) issues
beginning to surface in some of their core applications. The company
turnedto IBM's SAN Volume Controller (SVC) for a storage virtualization solution
that
could solve the I/O issues while improving overall long-term energy usage,
saving costs and maximizing existing hardware. Implemented in November 2007,
the 2-node clustered SVC, running on EMC CLARiiON CX300 and IBM System
Storage DS4700 disk arrays with two IBM Brocade SAN switches, has already
provided
higher performance and increased scalability with no downtime.

    "The simplicity of IBM's storage virtualization system makes it extremely
attractive to a company such as Lifestyle Family Fitness," said Michael Geis,
Director IS Operations, Lifestyle Family Fitness. "We were looking to grow
our business but at the same time wanted to minimize our IT infrastructure
costs. With IBM's SVC system compatible with all storage hardware, regardless of
vendor, it has allowed us to realize cost savings by maximizing our existing
infrastructure, eliminate bottlenecks in accessing membership information
and improve numerous application benchmarks from 60 to 10 seconds.  At the end
of the
day, SVC has been the optimal system solution for us."

    The new IBM SAN Volume Controller 4.3 functions are available at no
additional charge and existing SVC customers will be able to take
advantageof these improvements when they upgrade to SVC 4.3. Space-Efficient
FlashCopy requires a
license for the FlashCopy function. The new SVC 4.3 software will be
available for download on June 27, 2008.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, background, share movement)

 June 11 (Reuters) - Marshall  Ilsley Corp's MI.N
larger-than-average exposure to the construction sector will
likely result in "elevated" loan losses this quarter, according
to Goldman Sachs  Co, which added Wisconsin's largest bank to
its "conviction sell" list.

 Twenty percent of the bank's loan portfolio is made up of
construction loans, nearly twice the industry average, and
includes $1.6 billion of high-risk residential land exposure in
Arizona, analyst Brian Foran said in a note to clients.

 The portfolio in Arizona, one of the states hardest hit by
the nation's housing slump, had a mark-to-market loan-to-value
ratio of 104 percent at the end of March, reflecting declining
home prices. Generally, mortgage portfolios with high LTV
ratios are seen as higher risk.

 Foran said he expects Milwaukee-based Marshall  Ilsley's
stock to trade about 12 percent below its current level.

 U.S. banks have been battered by mounting loan losses as
the slumping economy, skidding housing markets, record oil
prices, rising unemployment and tighter credit conditions make
it harder for borrowers to stay current on their debts.

 Goldman Sachs said it lowered its profit per share
estimates on Marshall  Ilsley to 31 cents for the second
quarter, and to $1.40 from $1.80 a share for the year. It also
lowered its 12-month price target to $18 from $21. It rates the
bank "sell."

 Shares of Marshall  Ilsley were down nearly 5 percent at
$19.35 in pre-market trading. They had closed at $20.34 Tuesday
on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tume Ahemba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAGOS, June 11 (Reuters) - Nigeria's white-collar oil
workers' union said on Wednesday it was optimistic that
negotiations to avert a strike at the local unit of Chevron
(CVX.N) would be productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron branch of the PENGASSAN union had threatened to
begin a potentially crippling strike last week to press for the
transfer of the expatriate managing director out of Nigeria, but
the national executive intervened to halt a walkout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As it is now, there won't be any strike, we are monitoring
the talks and are ready to intervene at anytime if the talks
stall," Lumumba Okugbawa, PENGASSAN's deputy national secretary,
told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said talks had resumed on Tuesday and would continue
later on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have not given the two parties any time-frame to reach a
deal, the issues could be resolved today or it may take them a
week, but we are optimistic," Okugbawa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron officials in Nigeria were not immediately available
for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The union accused the managing director of Chevron's local
unit of violating basic safety standards, having too many
expatriate staff and of a lack of respect for Nigerian workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Union leaders said PENGASSAN had written to President Umaru
Yar'Adua and other relevant stakeholders to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A strike at the U.S. energy giant would further depress oil
output in Africa's top producer, where a fifth of capacity has
been shut in since early 2006, when ethnic militants in the
Niger Delta began a violent campaign against the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is Nigeria's number three oil operator with an
estimated output of around 350,000 barrels per day (bpd).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nigerian unit of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) was forced to shut
in about 800,000 bpd oil output for eight days in April due to a
strike by the local branch of PENGASSAN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lockout was called off after the union's national body
and the government intervened.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it remained cautious
on U.S. Real Estate Investment Trusts and commercial real
estate, as the worst was yet to come, given the rising
capitalization rates, slowing growth rates and higher funding
costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said the REITs have outperformed the broader
market so far, as investors have favored the group's average
dividend yield of 4.4 percent and relatively stable cash flow
growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Goldman said the fundamentals are only starting to
deteriorate and current valuations do not fully reflect the
risk that growth expectations should moderate in second half of
2008 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which continues to underweight REITs, said
it expects a downside risk of 10 percent or more from current
levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it continues to favor long lease-term sectors
such as regional malls and New York City office, and
underweight short lease-term sectors like apartments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is also cautious on companies that derive a large
portion of income from transaction-based activities such as
development companies and merchant builders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage upgraded shares of CB Richard Ellis Group Inc
(CBG.N) to "neutral" from "sell," saying the property services
firm's valuation has become more attractive and the risk
profile has improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman cut its price target on the stock of Post
Properties Inc (PPS.N) to $32 from $36 based on its expectation
that capitalization rates are likely to rise in the apartment
owner's markets. The brokerage has a "neutral" rating on the
company's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said its top "buy" ideas are Simon Property
Group Inc (SPG.N), Taubman Centers Inc (TCO.N) and Vornado
Realty Trust (VNO.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's best "sell" ideas are AvalonBay Communities Inc

&lt;p&gt;Hispanic Heritage Foundation Presents Inspira Award to Texas Rep. Hinojosa, ExxonMobil CEO Tillerson

   Awardees Recognized for Leadership in Education and for Inspiring
                        Latino Youth in America
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The Hispanic Heritage Foundation (HHF) today honored U. S.
Representative Ruben Hinojosa (D-TX) and ExxonMobil Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Rex W. Tillerson, with the Inspira Award for their
leadership in education for Latinos and for inspiring a new generation
of Hispanic leaders in the United States.

   According to Jose Antonio Tijerino, HHF president and CEO, the
Inspira Award was created to honor Latino leaders who inspire youth in
the public and private sector, and in the media. Last year's Inspira
Awardee was Actor Wilmer Valderrama. Rep. Hinojosa and Tillerson were
honored on Capitol Hill during the 11th Annual Hispanic Heritage Youth
Awards in Washington, D.C., which also recognized more than 20
outstanding students from the region. Washington, DC was the last of
the 12 Regional Youth Awards ceremonies which have taken place and
recognized more than 200 Hispanic high school seniors across America
and provided more than $600,000 in educational grants.

   "The Inspira Award recognizes those who have taken a leadership
role in breaking barriers and creating opportunities for Hispanic
youth," said Tijerino. "We commend Rex Tillerson for his vision in
encouraging and facilitating young Latinos to focus on science,
technology, math and engineering through our Youth Awards and
countless other efforts including the National Math and Science
Initiative. We also applaud the lifetime of commitment of Rep.
Hinojosa who is our champion from barrios to Capitol Hill on the issue
of increasing educational opportunities for Latinos. They are truly an
inspiration."

   Rep. Hinojosa has played an instrumental role in helping to
improve educational and workforce-improvement programs for minorities
and low-income families. In addition to the many education initiatives
he has supported, Rep. Hinojosa founded a year-round program called
HESTEC in 2002. Held at the University of Texas-Pan American, HESTEC
emphasizes the importance of science literacy for Hispanics to
educators, students and parents.

   Rep. Hinojosa serves as chairman of the Education Task Force for
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and has had tremendous success in
vaulting Hispanic-Serving Institutions to a position of prominence. In
2007, Hinojosa helped pass the College Cost Reduction Act which will
allow students to pursue higher educational goals by making college
more affordable.

   "I am extremely honored to be selected for this prestigious
award," said Rep. Hinojosa. "Education is the cornerstone of
opportunity. It paves the way to improve technology, spreads new
knowledge, advances innovation and ultimately shapes our future. It is
vital that Hispanic-serving organizations, educational institutions
and corporations help America stay competitive by advancing our
educational system and capitalize upon the abundance of young and
talented Hispanic minds."

   Tillerson and ExxonMobil have a long history of support for
programs that improve opportunities for minorities and women in
science, technology, engineering and mathematics. These programs
recognize the urgent need to encourage more Hispanic students and
professionals to attain higher educational achievements and support
initiatives that deliver high-quality educational programs, which
prepare Hispanics for leadership in the workforce and in the
classroom.

   "To be recognized by the Hispanic Heritage Foundation is a great
honor," said Tillerson. "In today's challenging fields such as
technology and energy, our nation needs more brilliant minds than ever
before, that's why we support programs like the Hispanic Heritage
Foundation's Youth Awards' Engineering and Mathematics category, which
emphasize the importance of role models, including those who have
succeeded in the math and science fields, while celebrating the unique
Latino culture that brings added strength and dimension to our
nation's workforce."

&lt;p&gt;Colorado-Based Company Honored by Microsoft
SUPERIOR, Colo.--(Business Wire)--
Work Options Group is the single recipient of this year's
"Commitment to Excellence" award, given annually by Microsoft Benefits
to one of the company's U.S. benefit vendor partners.

   Since 2006, Work Options Group has offered a backup care benefit
to all 46,000 U.S. employees of Microsoft. The Backup Care Options
program acts as a "safety net" for employees with childcare or
adult/elder care responsibilities, by providing temporary care so
employees can get to work when their regular caregiving arrangements
are unavailable (ex - school holidays or closures, caregiver
vacations, loved ones recovering from illness or surgery).

   "We appreciate the strong partnership we have with Work Options
Group," stated Emily Gomez, Program Manager of U.S. Benefits at
Microsoft. "The company is continuously looking for ways to improve
our national family backup care program, and always has a can-do
attitude. We look forward to our partnership over the coming years."

   Work Options Group developed the Backup Care Options program to
provide employees, like those at Microsoft and more than 130 leading
companies, with access to trusted, affordable, temporary care for
their loved ones of any age, at any time of the day or night, whether
they are healthy or ill. The program is available in all locations
throughout the United States and Canada and features a 24-hour call
center staffed by specialists who manage every step of the process to
coordinate temporary care on behalf of employees. Work Options Group
has contracted partnerships with thousands of care providers -
licensed home care agencies, nanny agencies, childcare centers and
adolescent care centers - that have agreed to offer short-term care.

   The Backup Care Options program provides both employees and
employers with a win-win solution. Employees can work when they would
otherwise be unable to do so, and with the confidence that their loved
ones are receiving the care they need. At the same time, employers
boost productivity and performance by reducing unscheduled
absenteeism, plus they enhance recruitment/retention efforts by
offering their employees a much-needed tool to reduce stress and
improve work-life balance.

   During the first 18 months that the Backup Care Options program
was offered at Microsoft, employees used more than 58,500 hours of
backup care - hours that would otherwise be counted as absenteeism. As
a result, Microsoft saved more than $5 million in absenteeism and
productivity costs. Since the benefit's debut, more than 1,500
individual employees at Microsoft have relied on the benefit and
reported an average overall program satisfaction score of 4.7 on a
5-point scale. Microsoft's use of the benefit is predicted to reach
75,000 hours of care in 2008 and currently exceeds use by any other
corporate client of Work Options Group.

   "It's an honor to offer our backup care program to Microsoft,
which is an innovative company known for providing extensive employee
benefits," said Cindy Carrillo, Founder and CEO of Work Options Group.
"We are thrilled to provide a program that employees really value and
to be recognized by Microsoft for our commitment to excellence."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today said it would expand its global efforts to deliver
greater energy efficiency to businesses facing skyrocketing energy costs,
environmental concerns and corporate sustainability requirements. The company
introduced new services, technologies and financing to help enterprises bridge
the
gap between the mandate for Chief Information Officers (CIOs) to build
"greener" technology infrastructures that can meet growing business requirements
and
the desire of Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) to realize rapid financial
benefits from such investments.

    Today's announcement comes one year after IBM launched Project Big Green
andcommitted $1 billion to deliver technologies that help clients
dramaticallyincrease the level of energy efficiency in their data centers. Data
centershouse computer servers and equipment that are consuming increasingly
largeramounts of energy as demand for computing power grows worldwide. In the
past
year, IBM has engaged with more than 2,000 clients to deliver hardware, software
and services technologies that have helped them reduce data center energy
consumption and cut energy costs by as much as 40 percent.

    IBM Modular Data Centers -- Scaling for the long term while slashing
energycosts today

    The second phase of Project Big Green intends to drive greater
advancementsin energy efficiencies by making data centers more flexible in
matching
information technology (IT) needs to capital and operating costs. The data
center environment is going through dramatic change. According to the EPA,
energy costs for these environments are doubling every five years and the
American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air/Conditioning Engineers
expects
technology densities to increase by 20 times in this decade. With roughly 60
percent of the capital costs and 50 percent of the operational costs of running
a
data center being energy related, the ability to design, construct and activate
a
highly energy efficient data center has become a business imperative.

    To meet that imperative for both the CIO and CFO, IBM is today introducing
modular,
energy-efficient data center designs available anywhere in the world.
Designed to power businesses ranging from large global enterprises to small
organizations in remote areas, the new modular data centers can reduce energy
consumption by as much as 50 percent. They include:


--  Enterprise Modular Data Center (EMDC) - an enterprise class data
    center "shrink-wrapped" and standardized from 5,000 square feet up to
    20,000 square feet. This approach enables clients to bring new data centers
    online three-to-six months sooner than a custom designed version. By
    building in smaller, standardized modules, clients can scale the starting
    data center capacity by up to 12 times while matching their capital and
    operational costs to their IT needs over time. This approach allows the
    customers to defer up to 40 percent of the capital expense and 50 percent
    of the operational expense until the capacity is required. Each EMDC is
    designed to achieve the world's highest ratings for energy leadership, as
    determined by the Green Grid, an industry group focused on advancing energy
    efficiency for data centers and business compute ecosystems.

--  Portable Modular Data Center (PMDC) - provides a fully functional data
    center in a pod-like form with a complete physical infrastructure including
    power and cooling systems and remote monitoring. It also has all the
    elements of the secure operating environments found in traditional "raised-
    floor" data centers, including protection from fire, smoke, humidity,
    condensation and temperature changes. The PMDC can be shipped and deployed
    into any environment and can support multiple technology vendors and
    multiple systems in an industry standard rack environment.

--  High Density Zone (HDZ) - a modular system that provides incremental
    cooling and power capability in existing data centers that are tapped out
    of capacity. The HDZ system can be swapped into an existing data center
    without disrupting current operations and can provide up to 35 percent cost
    savings compared to retrofitting an existing data center.
    

    
The modular data centers introduced today are essentially miniature versions of
IBM's renowned data centers, mimicking the power and energy efficiency of
facilities that serve many of the world's largest enterprises. The capability to
increase computing capacity while simultaneously reducing power consumption is
an antidote to a pressing business need. CIOs must now plan data center support
of
global enterprises as energy costs rise to all-time highs. IBM's Project Big
Green
helps them design and deploy energy efficient modular data centers while
providingCFOs the savings which can dramatically reduce energy bills.

    "Since we announced IBM's Project Big Green a year ago, we've engaged with
thousands of businesses, governments and educational institutions around the
world to help them address critical energy challenges in their data centers,"
said Mike Daniels, senior vice-president and group executive, IBM Global
Technology Services. "In the second phase of Big Green, we're unveiling the
most advanced green technologies and services to help clients become much more
efficient in how they consume and pay for energy, not only in their data
centers, but across all of their operations."

    New Technologies - IBM Research Paves Way for Green Data Centers

    IBM scientists have developed a method to cool computer chips that have
circuits and components stacked on top of each other with tiny rivers of
water, an advance that promises to significantly reduce energy consumed by
data centers. Earlier this month, IBM Researchers, in collaboration with the
Fraunhofer Institute in Berlin, demonstrated a prototype that integrates the
cooling system into the three dimensional (3-D) chips by piping water
directly between each layer in the stack. These so-called 3-D chip stacks --
which take chips and memory devices that traditionally sit side-by-side on a
silicon wafer and stacks them together on top of one another -- presents one
of the most promising approaches to enhancing chip performance beyond its
predicted limits, while simultaneously reducing the energy consumed by data
centers.

    IBM storage systems researchers are also studying ways to measure power
utilization on the IT workload to help customers with data center
planning.Ultimately, the scientists expect to integrate these new technologies
into
storage management tools for real-time power consumption management.

    In addition, IBM service researchers are now applying Component Business
Modeling
(CBM) to the environmental space, particularly with regard to reducing
carbon footprint. CBM allows organizations to identify opportunities for
improvement and innovation by regrouping their activities into a manageable
number
of modular business components. This enables flexibility and provides for a
clarified focus on the core capabilities needed to run the business and drive
business
strategy. Organizations interested in carbon management use CBM to identify
areas of
the business with high carbon impact levels and opportunity for change. For
example, in a CBM map there is an "IT Systems and Operations" component with
highpotential to reduce carbon footprint through IBM's green data center
approach.
CBM maps are also pre-populated with performance metrics and industry
benchmarks that can be easily used to analyze business processes where waste can
be
reduced.

    New Products and Services for the Green Data Center

    IBM announced new software today for its industry leading storage
virtualization
system, the IBM SAN Volume Controller (SVC) 4.3. The new SVC 4.3 software can
significantly improve the flexibility and responsiveness of IT infrastructures
by
creating consolidated, virtual pools of information across the enterprise,
enabling IT departments to centrally manage resources and respond more quickly
to
client needs. Storage virtualization technology can also reduce requirements for
additionalphysical storage hardware systems, which can ultimately reduce overall
energy
usage in the data center.

    In addition, IBM is announcing three new energy efficient services to help
clients with data center storage and virtualization needs. They include:


--  IBM Server Optimization &amp; Integration Services for VMware server
    virtualization -- a comprehensive set of services that can help clients
    increase the flexibility of their server infrastructure, achieve
    utilization rates up to 60 percent, and significantly reduce the number of
    servers they manage. The service can help reduce energy costs by up to 30
    percent and reduce total cost of ownership by up to 50 percent.

--  IBM Storage Optimization and Integration Services for process
    excellence -- a service that addresses challenges in the enterprise
    including skill transfer, change management, lack of uniformity and the
    impact of resource churn. This service builds on the storage infrastructure
    power consumption and carbon footprint reporting capability which is part
    of the new IBM Novus Storage Enterprise Resource Planner (SERP) v4.3.1
    release.

--  IBM Softek z/OS Dataset Mobility Facility (zDMF) -- a service that
    enables clients to move data at the dataset level with minimal disruption
    to application availability.  This automated approach provides businesses
    greater flexibility, faster adoption of better-performing, larger capacity
    disk volumes, and newer, more energy-efficient storage systems.
    

    
Financing to Go Green

    IBM Global Financing announced today a customized, all inclusive financial
package
for energy efficient IT services, infrastructure and business transformation
projects. Such financing helps preserve client cash flow for the entire scope
of a client's green data center project, including hardware, software, services
and
maintenance with a single, comprehensive package. By financing green data center
projects, IBM Global Financing can administer all the clients' current and
future IT investments, even paying off current financing contracts with other
providers.

    The New Enterprise Data Center -- Green to the Core

    Earlier this year, IBM introduced a model for the new enterprise data center
-- an evolutionary, highly efficient, dynamic infrastructure that addresses
the business challenges global clients face today. The IBM vision is backed by
deep technical capabilities, unmatched skills and a clear roadmap with
assessments and solutions clients can act on today. Using an open approach,
with support from more than a dozen ecosystem partners, this new framework
allows clients to leverage emerging technologies to address growing business
challenges and helps them position their companies to be more competitive.

    Project Big Green is a critical part of IBM's new enterprise data center
strategy which focuses on best practices in virtualization, green IT, service
management, security and cloud computing.  The new enterprise data center
offers potentially dramatic improvements in IT performance and energy
efficiency, and helps enable rapid deployment of new IT services to support
business growth.

    Last month, IBM announced "Software for a Greener World," a broad set of
software
capabilities to help businesses achieve their green goals and optimize
infrastructure, workloads and people for energy efficiency. The capabilities
span the IBM software portfolio from Tivoli, WebSphere, Rational, Information
Management and Lotus. For example, IBM Software can enable clients to manage
energy consumption in the data center and beyond, deliver energy efficient
enterprise applications and SOA environments, optimize business processes for
energy efficiency, report on energy and carbon to document compliance,
efficiently manage information storage and processing to drive down energy
costs, and
reduce carbon emissions and the need for travel by increasing collaboration
across geographies.

    In support of IBM's Data Center Family capabilities and customer
requirements for
end-to-end solutions, IBM continues to expand their data center open
architecture through relationships with industry leading global power and
cooling technology providers including Anixter Inc., Eaton, Emerson Network
Power, GE Digital Energy, and APC by Schneider Electric.

    In addition to the energy efficient technology solutions announced today,
IBM is
focused on several areas related to energy and the environment, including
sustainable
supply chains, solar technology, carbon management services, advanced water
management, intelligent utility networks and intelligent transportation
systems. For more information, visit www.ibm.com/green.

&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer Initiate New Study in the Apixaban Phase 3 Clinical Trial Program

       First patient dosed in 12-month study examining the effects of the
 investigational drug apixaban in patients with blood clots in the leg veins or
                                      lungs
PRINCETON, N.J. &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) announced today
the start of a new Phase 3 clinical trial to assess the effect of apixaban in
patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potentially fatal disease process
that begins with blood clots in the leg veins or lungs. Apixaban, which is
currently being developed by the two companies, is an investigational oral,
highly selective factor Xa inhibitor, a new class of agents with therapeutic
potential to prevent and treat blood clots.

The AMPLIFY (Apixaban after the initial Management of Pulmonary embolism and
deep vein thrombosis with First-line therapy) trials are part of the EXPANSE
program - the global Phase 3 clinical development trial program for apixaban.
AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT are two major clinical trials involving approximately
7,300 patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in the vein, or
pulmonary embolism (PE), a potentially fatal condition caused by a blood clot
blocking a vessel in the lung.

"The initiation of this apixaban Phase 3 trial represents Bristol-Myers Squibb's
and Pfizer's commitment to furthering research in the treatment of VTE, a
serious disease that affects 1.3 million people annually in the US and Europe,"
said Jack Lawrence, Vice President, Research and Development, Bristol-Myers
Squibb. "Current oral drug treatment options for the treatment of patients with
VTE are primarily vitamin K antagonists (VKA), such as warfarin. Limitations of
VKAs include a slow onset of action, a narrow therapeutic window necessitating
regular coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment, and multiple food and drug
interactions."

New Apixaban Phase 3 Clinical Trials

The AMPLIFY-EXT (Apixaban after the initial Management of PuLmonary embolism and
deep vein thrombosis with First-line therapY- EXTended treatment) trial has
initiated enrollment and will include approximately 2,430 patients who will
receive, for an extended 12-month period, apixaban 2.5 mg dose or 5 mg twice
daily compared to patients taking placebo to determine the effects of apixaban
on recurrent VTE. Prior to entering the trial, patients will have completed 6 to
12 months of treatment for DVT or PE.

The AMPLIFY trial is expected to begin in the next few months, and will enroll
approximately 4,800 patients with acute DVT or PE and will investigate the
safety and efficacy of apixaban 10 mg twice daily for 1 week followed by 5 mg
twice daily for 6 months compared to enoxaparin plus warfarin, the two drugs
used as the current standard of care.

About Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)

Venous thromboembolism can take two forms: either as a deep vein thrombosis
(DVT), a blood clot in a vein, usually in the leg that partially or totally
blocks the flow of blood, or as a pulmonary embolism (PE), a blood clot blocking
a vessel in the lungs. PE can be associated with significant hemodynamic
deterioration or death.

VTE continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the western
world, with an incidence of one to two per 1000 people, and represents one in 10
hospital deaths. In addition, post-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary
hypertension occur in 10 percent of DVT and five percent of PE patients,
respectively.

The first year incidence of recurrent VTE is approximately 7.7 percent, and the
risk of recurrence continues after anticoagulant treatment ends at an average of
3% per year over the next ten years.

About the Apixaban Phase 3 Program: EXPANSE

The EXPANSE apixaban clinical trial program has seven ongoing Phase 3 clinical
studies involving approximately 45,000 patients worldwide. In addition to the
recently initiated VTE treatment program, the EXPANSE program also includes
trials studying potential use for prevention of venous thromboembolism in
patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and in hospitalized medically ill
patients at high risk of VTE, and trials studying prevention of stroke and other
thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The VTE
prevention program consists of:

    --  ADVANCE-1, 2, and 3 trials are investigating the safety and efficacy of
        apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily compared to enoxaparin in patients
        undergoing major orthopedic surgery. Results from the first trial are
        targeted for presentation at the American Society of Hematology in
        December 2008.

    --  The ADOPT study is investigating apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily for one
        month compared to standard of care (enoxaparin for at least 6 days
        followed by placebo) for the prevention of VTE in hospitalized patients
        who are medically ill and at risk of VTE.

Apixaban is also in Phase 3 trials studying the prevention of thrombotic events,
such as stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The AF program
consists of:

    --  The ARISTOTLE trial, which is investigating apixaban 5 mg twice daily
        compared to warfarin in approximately 15,000 patients with atrial
        fibrillation.

    --  The AVERROES trial, which is investigating apixaban 5 mg twice daily
        compared to aspirin in approximately 5,600 patients with atrial
        fibrillation who are ineligible for VKA treatment or haven't tolerated
        previous VKA treatment.

Apixaban has also recently completed enrollment in a Phase 2 trial in patients
with acute coronary syndrome (the APPRAISE trial). The results of this trial
will be presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in September
2008.

&lt;p&gt;Vibrant Media Honors Ask, Microsoft, New Line and Unilever at First Annual Awards Competition for Contextual Advertising

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Vibrant Media, the world leading video and contextual advertising
network, presented the Vibrant Awards for creative and strategic use
of in-text and contextual video advertising tonight in Manhattan.
Ask.com took the Gold for its skillful use of contextual advertising
incorporating a dynamic API feed. New Line Cinema won the Silver for
its cleverly enigmatic video campaign promoting the film "23".
Microsoft won the User Engagement Award for the effectiveness of its
LiveSearch campaign and Unilever won the Judges Choice Award for its
dueling "blonde vs. brunette" campaign to promote Sunsilk's Color
Boost. The European Vibrant Awards were held last week in London where
Yahoo!, Fiat and Chrysler won the night.

   According to Doug Stevenson, Co-founder and CEO of Vibrant Media,
"In the eight years since Vibrant was founded, in-text advertising has
come of age, and Vibrant has grown exponentially to meet the demand
with offices in eight cities in the U.S. and Europe, an audience of
120 million uniques, and a network of over 3,500 publishers. The
Vibrant Awards are intended to recognize the growing influence of
in-text advertising in the online advertising landscape."

   A distinguished panel of industry judges evaluated the nominated
campaigns for creativity, word selection and effectiveness in
communicating the brand message and meeting campaign objectives. The
judges were:

   -- David Cohen, EVP, US Director of Digital Communications,
Universal McCann Interactive

   -- Sarah Fay, CEO, Aegis, North America

   -- Mike Hurt, Director of Ad Planning, Microsoft &amp; Co-Chair, IAB
Digital Video Committee

   -- Steve Katelman, Director Strategic Partnerships, OMG

   -- Brian Morrissey, Digital Editor, Adweek

   -- Jack Myers, President, Myers Publishing, LLC

   Thirty-five other campaigns were evaluated by the judges including
Ford Sync, Theraflu, Kraft Oreo and Yellowpages.com.

   After reviewing the nominations, UMI's David Cohen noted, "There
were some very clever uses of the medium...I was impressed by the
quality of the submissions." Sarah Fay, CEO of Aegis North America,
commented that the entries highlighted the use of search as a way to
customize a video and serve up a message that's specific to the
environment.

   According to Sean Finnegan, Vibrant's CMO, "Contextual advertising
offers the best of all worlds - user control, relevancy, branding,
video, and pricing accountability. The campaigns honored tonight
reflect some of the smartest, most impactful and creative executions
we've seen, and it is our hope that the Vibrant Awards here and in the
UK will continue to inspire excellence in years to come."

   The recipients of the 2008 Vibrant Awards follow:

   Gold Award

   The campaign that won the Gold by epitomizing the skillful use of
in-text, fully leveraging the format strategically and creatively to
engage the consumer and deliver results, is Ask.com. By tapping
consumers' insatiable interest in celebrity, Ask.com intercepted users
by highlighting celebrity-related words -- like Angelina Jolie,
Indiana Jones, NFL, Jay Z, Jennifer Aniston, Mandy Moore, and more -
within related content, and provided a dynamic API feed with
additional search information. This campaign, which was a unanimous
hit among the judges, captured outstanding click through rates across
the board.

   Silver Award

   The campaign that took full advantage of the in-text medium by
combining the compelling use of words and video to win the 2008 Silver
Vibrant Award was New Line Cinema for the film "23." Using words such
as 'DNA' and 'Titanic' to provoke interest in the film, New Line
Cinema developed a custom unit that teased viewers with a series of
enigmas related to the number 23.

   User Engagement Award

   Finally, Vibrant's first User Engagement Award was presented to
the campaign that was most effective according to Vibrant's own
measurement tools. Microsoft wanted to gain market share and establish
Live.com as the premier online search engine. Through a custom in-text
unit, Microsoft was able to bring Live.com search results into the
content and engage users by offering relevant, real time information
related to the highlighted word. The Live.com initiative achieved
exceptional click-through and user interaction rates. The campaign
offered Vibrant's user base a powerful resource, placing convenient
search functionality within articles.

   Judges Choice Award

   This award recognizes a campaign that the judges felt deserved
special recognition for its clever approach. The winner of the 2008
Vibrant Judges' Choice Award is Unilever for Sunsilk's Color Boost.
Using words and phrases including "confident women," "color boost,"
"healthy shine," "shampoo," and "hair color," Unilever aimed to
increase awareness of Sunsilk's Color Boost. By highlighting the words
"blondes" and "brunettes," and creating a virtual duel between them,
Unilever delivered sassy video creative that perfectly illustrated the
notorious battle between blondes and brunettes.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc and Microsoft Corp ended talks as the Web pioneer agreed to let archrival Google Inc sell search ads on its site, the companies said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separate statements from Microsoft and Yahoo signaled a more permanent rift between the two after months of on-again, off-again talks. It also heightened pressure on Yahoo to outline an alternative strategy. Yahoo shares fell 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo said it had agreed to let Google put search ads on its site in what it called an $800 million annual revenue opportunity that would boost cash flow by $250 million to $450 million in the first 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's ads and Google's would be pitted against each other in an auction style process that could make a deal easier to pass regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo is being a reseller of Google whenever it makes sense and that is likely to be a lot of the time given how much more effective Google Web search ads have proven to be," Global Crown Capital analyst Martin Pyykkonen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to face a major antitrust review given the rising power of Google, and Sen. Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat and chairman of a U.S. Senate antitrust subcommittee, said he would investigate the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had sought a tie-up with Yahoo for more than a year and by early May had offered up to $47.5 billion, or $33 per share, to buy the Internet company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its latest offer included buying Yahoo's search business and paying $35 per share for a 16 percent stake in Yahoo, said two people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After talks fell through, Yahoo shares fell to $23.52 on Nasdaq. Following details of the Google deal, they rose to $24.00 in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had hoped a Yahoo deal would accelerate its ability to capitalize on Web advertising growth and compete with Google, which is increasingly fighting for the same Internet audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo said on Thursday that Microsoft had made it clear in a meeting on June 8 that it was no longer interested in buying the company outright, even at the price of $33 per share Microsoft had most recently proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may not appease Yahoo shareholders, including billionaire Carl Icahn, who have been pressuring Yahoo to reach a deal with Microsoft. Icahn has called for Chief Executive Jerry Yang to be ousted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it was not interested in "rebidding" for all of Yahoo, sending its shares up more than 4 percent as investors showed relief that the company would not be paying too high a price for a deal they considered risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Yahoo said that an alternative Microsoft proposal to buy only its search business did not fit into Yahoo's plan to grow search and display advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in a statement that its alternative offer was still open for discussion. It said that its most recent discussion with Yahoo for a partial deal would have valued Yahoo at more than $33 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE END?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said they did not expect that Yahoo and Microsoft would try another round of negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It certainly seems to be the end," said Derek Brown, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "In their most recent discussions, they were talking about totally separate visions of both a deal and the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is expected to soon be on the prowl for other acquisition targets since it has not given up its goal for online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft will keep trying," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran. "Yahoo is one of most popular sites on the Web and there is no one else with as much traffic. AOL may be one option and it may not be as expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn, who has waged a proxy battle to remove Yahoo's board at its August 1 annual meeting, had urged Yahoo to secure a higher price from Microsoft. Icahn has said a partnership with Google should only be a second choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares sank as low as $22.50 on news of the talks failing and expectations of the Google deal. It was their lowest level since January 31, the day before Microsoft announced its offer for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google shares finished up $7.75 at $552.95, and Microsoft closed up $1.12 at $28.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco; Writing by Michele Gershberg; editing by Dave Zimmerman, Jeffrey Benkoe, Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo shares sank on Thursday to their lowest since before Microsoft announced its takeover offer for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12 percent plunge in the stock followed Yahoo's announcement that the latest round of talks with Microsoft had ended with no deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock last traded at $23.07, down $3.08 on the session. The stock briefly fell to as low as $22.50. That is the lowest the stock has traded since January 31, the day before Microsoft made public its initial takeover offer at $31 per share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday it is getting out of the retail gas business in the United States as sky-high crude oil prices squeeze margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those branded service stations may be the most public aspect of Exxon's business, but they account for a small part of the company's profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the roughly 12,000 Exxon Mobil branded stations in the United States, Exxon, the world's largest publicly-traded oil company, owns about 2,220.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon plans to sell those service stations over several years. They include about 820 stations that it also operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will maintain the Exxon and Mobil brands, Exxon spokeswoman Prem Nair said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers will still be buying gasoline at stations that carry the Exxon and Mobil names, but they will not be owned by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service stations have struggled, even with $4-a-gallon plus gasoline prices because they have not been able to pass along to customers their additional costs from soaring crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to federal data, gasoline prices are up about 31 percent over the last year, and oil prices have nearly doubled over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are in a very, very challenging market.

"We feel the best way for us to grow and compete is through our distributor network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current environment, the company's profits from its retail unit are "somewhere close to a rounding error," said Mark Gilman, an analyst at the Benchmark Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Exxon was following competitors like Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc in moving away from ownership of service stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The retail gasoline business is a highly volatile and typically low return kind of business and thus the decision," Gilman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon made more than $40 billion in 2007, most of which came from its oil and gas production around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the decision came that it's more of a headache than its worth," said Oppenheimer  Co analyst Fadel Gheit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the company does not release profit margin figures for its retail arm, Gheit estimated the stations' margin was between 10 percent and 15 percent, about one-third its margin on crude oil production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question is who is going to buy them, and how much are they going to pay for them," Gheit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Matt Daily; Editing by Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, June 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
offered to pay $35 a share for a 16 percent equity stake in

have involved the sale of the Web company's search business,

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Erman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
on Thursday it is getting out of the retail gas business in the
United States as sky-high crude oil prices squeeze margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those branded service stations may be the most public

years. They include about 820 stations that it also operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company will maintain the Exxon and Mobil brands, Exxon
spokeswoman Prem Nair said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumers will still be buying gasoline at stations that
carry the Exxon and Mobil names, but they will not be owned by
the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Service stations have struggled, even with $4-a-gallon plus
gasoline prices because they have not been able to pass along
to customers their additional costs from soaring crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to federal data, gasoline prices are up about 31
percent over the last year, and oil prices have nearly doubled
over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in a very, very challenging market. Margins are

Mark Gilman, an analyst at the Benchmark Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Exxon was following competitors like Royal Dutch
Shell (RDSa.L) and BP Plc (BP.L) in moving away from ownership
of service stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The retail gasoline business is a highly volatile and
typically low return kind of business and thus the decision,"
Gilman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon made more than $40 billion in 2007, most of which
came from its oil and gas production around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think the decision came that it's more of a headache
than its worth," said Oppenheimer  Co analyst Fadel Gheit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the company does not release profit margin figures
for its retail arm, Gheit estimated the stations' margin was
between 10 percent and 15 percent, about one-third its margin
on crude oil production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The question is who is going to buy them, and how much are
they going to pay for them," Gheit said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York congressman who has been romantically linked by tabloid newspapers to several high-profile, beautiful women, is one step closer to creating a special work permit for foreign fashion models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner, a 43-year-old bachelor, has proposed legislation giving international beauties their own U.S. visa category, rather than have them compete with computer analysts and scientists for the non-immigrant H-1B visa for skilled professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From Fashion Week to our vibrant publishing industry to the many designers that call New York City home, fashion is a vital part of our economy that drives thousands of jobs," Weiner said in an email to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Post recently romantically linked Weiner to Huma Abedin, who was recently featured in Vogue magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner introduced his proposal in the House late last year which has not yet been scheduled for a vote, though it was recently referred to the Committee of the Whole, where less rigid rules allow bills to be passed quicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to create a separate category for fashion models, and would limit the number of visas to 1,000 for each fiscal year, according to a document that accompanies the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of international models who were issued H-1B visas has halved to 349 in the 2007 fiscal year, from nearly 800 a few years ago according to the document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 60 percent of U.S. fashion shoots involving international models are managed out of New York City, said Bruce Morrison, a former congressman who represents the U.S. fashion industry in the bill proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reason this bill is important is not so the model can come to the United States, it's so the production can be done in the United States," Morrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She's the engine but the train is all of these American workers. If the model can't come here, it goes on ... somewhere abroad," Morrison said, about fashion shoots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Michelle Nichols)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), a leading global Internet company,
today announced that discussions with Microsoft regarding a potential
transaction -- whether for an acquisition of all of Yahoo! or a
partial acquisition -- have concluded. The conclusion of discussions
follows numerous meetings and conversations with Microsoft regarding a
number of transaction alternatives, including a meeting between Yahoo!
and Microsoft on June 8th in which Chairman Roy Bostock and other
independent Board members from Yahoo! participated. At that meeting,
Microsoft representatives stated unequivocally that Microsoft is not
interested in pursuing an acquisition of all of Yahoo!, even at the
price range it had previously suggested.

   With respect to an acquisition of Yahoo!'s search business alone
that Microsoft had proposed, Yahoo!'s Board of Directors has
determined, after careful evaluation, that such a transaction would
not be consistent with the company's view of the converging search and
display marketplaces, would leave the company without an independent
search business that it views as critical to its strategic future and
would not be in the best interests of Yahoo! stockholders.

   Yahoo! remains focused on maximizing value for stockholders by
continuing to execute on its strategy of being the "starting point"
for the most consumers on the Internet and a "must buy" for
advertisers. The online advertising industry is projected to grow from
$40 billion in 2007 to approximately $75 billion in 2010 and the
company believes it has the right assets, strategic plan, Board of
Directors and management team to capitalize on this growth
opportunity.

   Forward Looking Statements

   This press release contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties concerning Yahoo!'s projected
financial performance as well as Yahoo!'s strategic and operational
plans. Actual results may differ materially from those described in
this release due to a number of risks and uncertainties. The potential
risks and uncertainties include, among others, the implementation and
results of Yahoo!'s ongoing strategic initiatives; Yahoo!'s ability to
compete with new or existing competitors; reduction in spending by, or
loss of, marketing services customers; the demand by customers for
Yahoo!'s premium services; acceptance by users of new products and
services; risks related to joint ventures and the integration of
acquisitions; risks related to Yahoo!'s international operations;
failure to manage growth and diversification; adverse results in
litigation, including intellectual property infringement claims;
Yahoo!'s ability to protect its intellectual property and the value of
its brands; dependence on key personnel; dependence on third parties
for technology, services, content and distribution; general economic
conditions and changes in economic conditions; and potential
continuing uncertainty arising in connection with the withdrawal of
Microsoft's unsolicited proposal to acquire Yahoo! and the announced
intention by a stockholder to seek control of our Board of Directors,
the possibility that Microsoft or another person may in the future
make another proposal, or take other actions which may create
uncertainty for our employees, publishers, advertisers and other
business partners, and the possibility of significant costs of
defense, indemnification and liability resulting from stockholder
litigation relating to the Microsoft proposal. More information about
potential factors that could affect Yahoo!'s business and financial
results is included under the captions "Risk Factors" and

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, no comment from Chevron, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS, June 12 (Reuters) - Nigeria's senior oil workers'
union said on Thursday that talks to avert a lockout at the
local unit of Chevron (CVX.N) were not going well and renewed
its strike threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron branch of the PENGASSAN union called off a
planned strike last week to push for the transfer of the
expatriate managing director from Nigeria after the national
union executive intervened and reopened talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Lumumba Okugbawa, PENGASSAN's deputy national secretary,
said the talks, which restarted on Tuesday with the aim of
reaching a deal within a week, were not progressing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have now written to the management to resolve the issues
by Wednesday, otherwise we would no longer be able to guarantee
industrial harmony at the company," Okugbawa told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron officials in Nigeria were not immediately available
for comment. A spokeswoman in California declined to comment in
an e-mailed response to inquiries on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The union accused the managing director of Chevron's local
unit of violating basic safety standards, having too many
expatriate staff and of a lack of respect for Nigerian workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our members are not comfortable with him, so they want him
to go," Okugbawa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Union leaders said PENGASSAN had written to President Umaru
Yar'Adua and other relevant stakeholders to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A strike at the U.S. energy giant would further slash oil
output in Africa's top producer, where a fifth of capacity has
been shut in since early 2006, when ethnic militants in the
Niger Delta began a violent campaign of sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is Nigeria's number three oil operator with an
estimated output of around 350,000 barrels per day (bpd).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nigerian unit of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) was forced to shut
in about 800,000 bpd oil output for eight days in April due to a
strike by the local branch of PENGASSAN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strike was suspended after the union's national body and
the government intervened.

summer Olympics.

    "CIBT is creating customized plans for companies sending 50 or more people
to
China this summer. We are assisting athletes and coaches, corporate travelers,
tour
operators, VIPs, and some very large groups to accommodate the unique needs of
each
of our clients. Since China's visa policy has gotten more restrictive leading
up to the Olympic games, CIBT personnel are working diligently to ensure that
all groups are getting the special attention they need. We are working closely
with the Chinese Embassy and its consulates across the United States to
ensure the smoothest possible process for all involved," said Jeff Fine,
President
of CIBT.  "The key to success, is to start early," he added.

    Mr. Diehl cautioned Olympics-bound travelers that "going directly to the
Chinese Embassy or consulates to obtain visas has proven frustrating for many
individuals and groups who have been turned away due to the lack of proper
support documentation often resulting in multiple return trips. Sending your
application by mail is even riskier. Until recently, a Chinese visa was valid
for
one year and permitted multiple entries. Now, people need official invitations,
flight and hotel confirmation, and in some cases bank statements and other
documents to apply for a visa."

    CIBT has developed special visa kits for international groups. The kits have
become especially valuable for companies trying to coordinate travel for global
employees and customers departing for the Olympics from various countries. CIBT
is the only visa expediter with worldwide offices.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
This summer, Maria Machado, a supply chain expert from Brazil,
will make an extended visit to Africa - unlike any trip she's taken
before. Maria and 15 of her colleagues at Pfizer, Inc. are part of a
now 5-year-old skills-based corporate volunteerism program, the Pfizer
Global Health Fellows.

   Machado works in Pfizer's Global Manufacturing Division, ensuring
medicines reach their final destination. She will travel to Mozambique
in Africa to support Population Services International (PSI), an
organization that provides healthcare in developing countries. Machado
will advise PSI's supply chain to deliver health products and services
in underserved communities. "Dealing with Brazilian trade has given me
first-hand experience in delivering medicines in under-resourced
settings. I can use my skills to directly impact the way PSI gets
medicines and services to areas in Mozambique that normally wouldn't
have access to quality healthcare."

   Today, Pfizer is celebrating five years of sending its employees
around the world to work on the front lines of healthcare, combating
devastating diseases and improving access to healthcare for
underserved communities. Pfizer is sending 16 new Fellows this year to
countries as far away as Mozambique, India and Panama. To date, Pfizer
has deployed 171 Fellows to 34 countries to work with non-governmental
organizations and governments to serve those most in need.

   Pfizer also announced a pilot expansion of the Global Health
Fellows program to work with underserved communities in Europe and the
United States to expand its commitment to improving access to
healthcare. Through existing work with small- to mid-sized healthcare
organizations in these regions, Pfizer identified a need for the
expertise and experience its employees could bring to improve
efficiency and impact. It is also clear that millions of people in
Europe and the U.S. experience significant access challenges, and
Pfizer employees are dedicated to addressing these problems by every
means possible.

   "We are happy to support the Global Health Fellows program, a
flagship of our overall philanthropy platform, Pfizer Investments in
Health," comments Robert Mallett, Pfizer's Senior Vice President of
Worldwide Public Affairs and Policy. "This program is a unique social
and business model that creates lasting impact. Global Health Fellows
add tremendous value to our business, just as they do for the
communities in which they work."

   A major business benefit of Global Health Fellows is the
development and growth opportunities for employees. Employees are
challenged to learn and practice new skills which they can apply in
their jobs and other philanthropy settings. Their support of Pfizer's
overall philanthropy platform is returned through opportunities to
expand their skill sets and bring innovative ideas back to Pfizer.

   Pfizer funds transportation, lodging and other expenses to send
its employees around the world to work side-by-side with health
organizations. During the Fellowship, Pfizer maintains its employees'
positions at the company, ensuring the Fellows can focus on the work
at hand.

   Core to its success is Pfizer's partnership with health NGOs
around the world. Pfizer and its partners match employees based on how
the employee's skills can impact specific health challenges. Employees
work directly with the partner, leveraging their skills in Information
Technology, Nursing, Facility Operations, Health Worker Training,
Public Health Communications, Marketing, Finance and more. The
knowledge and expertise that Fellows share leaves the NGO stronger and
more equipped to sustain long-term impact, even after the Fellow has
completed their assignment.

   "Our partnership with Pfizer has helped us improve family health
around the world by adding specialized expertise to our organization,"
said Al Siemens, CEO and Chairman of Family Health International.
"Since 2004, 19 Fellows have trained nurses, adapted HIV/AIDS
prevention strategies and managed data to help us operate efficiently.
They are invaluable in helping us advance our mission."

   Pfizer Global Health Fellows is the cornerstone of Pfizer's
philanthropic platform, Pfizer Investments in Health. This strategic
philanthropy platform aims to Treat patients, Teach prevention and
patient care, Build capacity in healthcare systems and Serve local
communities and governments to improve access to care.

&lt;p&gt;New Collaborative Model Benefits Patients and Promotes Transparency
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that it has entered into a $15-million
dollar collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The
partnership will include collaborations between Pfizer and the University in the
areas of scientific research, clinical development and clinical care and policy.

Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will pay Penn $15 million over a
three-year period, during which time scientists from Pfizer and Penn's School of
Medicine will work together on several projects of mutual interest including
basic and translational research addressing several therapeutic areas. Project
proposals will be solicited and reviewed by a committee with representation from
both parties. The initial emphasis of the collaboration will focus on the
neurosciences and oncology, but may expand to other areas.

"This collaboration provides an opportunity for Pfizer and the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine to build and implement a new model for
interactions between industry and academic medical centers," said Martin Mackay,
President, Pfizer Global Research and Development. "We are pleased to have such
a distinguished partner in this venture, which could provide a powerful example
for how we will work together to improve outcomes in research and clinical
development, and most importantly, in the lives of the patients we all serve."

Pfizer and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine will develop an
initiative to improve the management of cardiovascular risk and patient
adherence to treatments, among patients currently served by the University of
Pennsylvania's Health System. Results from the pilot programs will be shared
with the goal of initiating similar programs at other academic medical centers.

In addition, Pfizer and the University will work together to examine current
policy and practices around topics of mutual interest, including ongoing
education on new therapeutics for physicians.

"We are excited to work with Pfizer in a manner that spans the health care
continuum, from pre-clinical research through patient care, in a way that can
serve as a model for optimal interactions between industry and academia," said
Arthur H. Rubenstein, MBBCh, Executive Vice President of the University of
Pennsylvania for the Health System, and Dean, School of Medicine.

This partnership represents, in part, an extension of existing clinical study
collaborations between Penn and Pfizer. Since 1985, Pfizer has sponsored 130
clinical studies at Penn across 10 therapeutic areas, including oncology,
psychiatry and infectious disease.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Anadarko
Petroleum Corp (APC.N) to "buy" from "neutral" and initiated
coverage of Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) with a "buy," saying the
recent weakness in large cap exploration and production (EP)
companies' stocks is overdone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Brian Singer named EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N) as his
top pick and added the natural gas producer's stock to
"Americas Conviction Buy List," replacing Cabot Oil  Gas
(COG.N) which he continued to rate at "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Singer downgraded Encore Acquisition Co EAC.N to
"neutral" from "buy," to reflect the stock's 100 percent
performance since his previous upgrade in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our coverage view on EPs is attractive," the analyst
said, adding that he viewed EOG as a "bellwether" EP stock as
the company has a superior combination of production growth,
returns and free cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "EOG can continue to extend horizontal technology into both
new oil and North American/international natural gas plays. The
shares do not assume enough value for this or recent success in
the Bakken/Barnett Shale," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also added Anadarko and Devon to "Americas Buy
List."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Singer said he expects six key deepwater exploration well
results from Devon and Anadarko between now and year-end and
very little value is implied in either stock for success at
present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Encore shares were trading down more than 6 percent at
$69.67, while EOG stock was up $1.81 at $130.20 in late morning
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anadarko shares were up 36 cents at $78.05, while Devon
stock was down 90 cents at $115.55.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan raised its forecast for
internationally traded coal prices for 2009, citing
infrastructure constraints on supply and the potential for
higher demand from Brazil, Russia, India and China, and also
changed ratings on two coal companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan analyst John Bridges raised the 2009 price
estimate for traded coal to $300/tonne from $240/tonne and for
traded thermal coal to $150/tonne from $100/tonne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bridges cited lack of sufficient shipping capacity as one
of the prime reasons for coal supply constraint, adding that
installed coal industry infrastructure is likely to prove
insufficient for the growing demands of the over 2 billion
people of emerging countries like India and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also raised its price forecasts for
Appalachian, Illinois and West Bit coal in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan upgraded Consol Energy Inc (CNX.N) to "overweight"
from "neutral," citing the raised estimate for coal prices from
the company's Northern Appalachian market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the brokerage downgraded Arch Coal Inc (ACI.N) to
"neutral" from "overweight," saying the 52 percent rise in its
share price since Feb 5 has made the stock fairly valued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Arch Coal fell about 1 percent to $70.90, while
shares of Consol Energy were up 26 cents at $102.97 in morning
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today released research revealing that governments and the
communities they serve around the globe are being reshaped by six simultaneous
and inescapable forces, which present both opportunities and threats that will
require individualized strategies to effectively manage.  The study, titled
"Government
2020 and the Perpetual Collaboration Mandate," calls attention to the growing
globalimpact of rapid changes in demographics, globalization, environmental
concerns,
societal relationships, social stability and the expanding impact of technology.

    The influence of these six trends will vary in urgency for each country,
though
the report finds that a government's response to the positive and negative
effects of each will greatly influence the prosperity of its citizens. 
Findings also suggest that virtual organizations, in which geographically
dispersed constituents can collaborate seamlessly, will play a key role.

    "We are looking at a world in the midst of significant transition, where
governments have the opportunity to work together more effectively, and
engage their citizens and allies in the implementation of bigger goals for
society," said Gerry Mooney, General Manager, IBM Global Government. "Looking
ahead
to 2020, we found that the idea of virtual organizations will increasingly shift
from
being a concept to becoming the way successful governments function."

    Research results identified a recurring theme of 'perpetual collaboration'
as a core
capability governments will need to prosper and best serve citizens over the
next 12 years.  To achieve it, IBM recommends four key approaches for
government organizations:


Public and Private Collaboration: Form new alliances and models of
   interaction, such as global collaborative ventures, to keep pace with
   changes in global society.

Personalized Interaction and Services: Implement technologies that enable
   governments to provide convenience, increased efficiency, security and
   privacy in delivering services ranging from healthcare to social
   services.

Knowledge Creation and Sharing: Stimulate product and service innovation
   through interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary research, coupled with
   new models of knowledge sharing that can transcend multigenerations in
   the workplace.

Value to Constituencies: Engage constituents to raise awareness and
   buy into new approaches to governmental services, including services
   on-demand, that can provide greater value to citizens.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today released research revealing that governments and the
communities they serve around the globe are being reshaped by six simultaneous
and inescapable forces, which present both opportunities and threats that will
require individualized strategies to effectively manage.  The study, titled
"Government
2020 and the Perpetual Collaboration Mandate," calls attention to the growing
globalimpact of rapid changes in demographics, globalization, environmental
concerns,
societal relationships, social stability and the expanding impact of technology.

    The influence of these six trends will vary in urgency for each country,
though
the report finds that a government's response to the positive and negative
effects of each will greatly influence the prosperity of its citizens. 
Findings also suggest that virtual organizations, in which geographically
dispersed constituents can collaborate seamlessly, will play a key role.

    "We are looking at a world in the midst of significant transition, where
governments have the opportunity to work together more effectively, and
engage their citizens and allies in the implementation of bigger goals for
society," said Gerry Mooney, General Manager, IBM Global Government. "Looking
ahead
to 2020, we found that the idea of virtual organizations will increasingly shift
from
being a concept to becoming the way successful governments function."

    Research results identified a recurring theme of 'perpetual collaboration'
as a core
capability governments will need to prosper and best serve citizens over the
next 12 years.  To achieve it, IBM recommends four key approaches for
government organizations:


Public and Private Collaboration: Form new alliances and models of
   interaction, such as global collaborative ventures, to keep pace with
   changes in global society.

Personalized Interaction and Services: Implement technologies that enable
   governments to provide convenience, increased efficiency, security and
   privacy in delivering services ranging from healthcare to social
   services.

Knowledge Creation and Sharing: Stimulate product and service innovation
   through interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary research, coupled with
   new models of knowledge sharing that can transcend multigenerations in
   the workplace.

Value to Constituencies: Engage constituents to raise awareness and
   buy into new approaches to governmental services, including services
   on-demand, that can provide greater value to citizens.

&lt;p&gt;Javien Micropay Helps Merchants Satisfy Visa's Aggregation
            Guidelines for Online Micropayment Transactions
MCLEAN, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Javien Digital Payment Solutions, Inc. (www.javien.com) today
announced that Javien Micropay is the only patented micropayment
technology that can help merchants and retailers meet Visa's new
guidelines for online micropayment transactions of Visa credit, debit
or prepaid cards. Additionally Javien Micropay provides an auditable,
provable method of managing online micropayment aggregations that
conforms to Visa's new rules.

   As consumer demand for small ticket items (under $5) increases,
merchants incurring transaction fees associated with processing small
payments may find it to be cost-prohibitive without the advantage of
micropayment aggregation. Javien's Micropay makes it easy for
merchants to aggregate multiple purchases made by the same consumer so
they can minimize payment processing fees - in an auditable way that
complies with Visa's carefully set guidelines.

   Effective since April 1st, Internet merchants must obtain
authorization at the start of each aggregation session, and are
restricted to aggregating multiple transactions made by a single
consumer to no more than $15 and a maximum time period of three
calendar days. Merchants must be able to communicate the details of
the transactions to consumers.

   "We're glad Visa has chosen to place standards on micropayment
transactions to help guide the marketplace," said Leslie Poole, CEO of
Javien Digital Payment Solutions. "We've been offering merchants the
ability to track and aggregate micropayments for years with our
patented micropayment aggregation engine," noted Poole. "Our
technology helps merchants comply with the guidelines now, without
delay."

   Javien Micropay is available as part of Javien's e-commerce
platform or as an a la carte option. Merchants can leverage Javien's
patented adaptive micropayment aggregation technology to batch
transactions according to Visa's new rules.

   "We understand that merchants want to minimize transaction costs
in order to maximize their revenue," added Poole. "Our platform's
alignment with Visa's guidelines allows us to provide our customers
with peace of mind, knowing their payment system is fully compliant."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised the U.S. waste
management sector to "attractive" from "neutral," as it is
poised to benefit from lower volume declines, continued strong
pricing, and stock multiple expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result, the brokerage also added Allied Waste
Industries Inc AW.N to its Americas buy and conviction buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also upgraded the stock to "buy" from "neutral" and
raised its price target to $18 from $13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Shares of Allied Waste represent the most appealing
combination of financial and operating leverage to ongoing
municipal solid waste pricing growth and volume decline
deceleration," analyst David Feinberg wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs raised its 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates
on Allied Waste, which closed at $13.19 Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also raised its price target on the stock of
Waste Management Inc WMI.N to $45 from $38 and kept its "buy"
rating on the stock to reflect the positive sector trends.
However, it removed WMI from the Americas conviction buy list,
primarily based on valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that stabilizing waste volumes, coupled with
strong pricing, will ultimately lead to multiple expansion and
additional upside for shares of WMI," Feinberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised its 2008, 2009 and 2010 earnings
estimates on Waste Management, which closed at $36.95 Wednesday
on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  WALNUT CREEK, CA, Jun 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Uniting the way business works with the way people work, Emportal today
announced
it is the first SaaS-based Human Resource Management System (HRMS) vendor to
leverage the increasingly popular Microsoft 2007 user interface (UI) in its
core application, Emportal HCM. Named Microsoft Office Fluent, but more commonly
referred to as "The Ribbon," this user interface model is designed to make the
features of Emportal HR more discoverable and accessible with fewer mouse
clicks as compared to the menu-based UI that's inherent in most software
applications.

    Mark Robinson, Emportal's co-founder, president and CEO, shared, "One of the
biggest complaints about business-critical applications is that they require
users to work with unfamiliar user interfaces that slow down productivity and,
by default, discourage user adoption. When users aren't fully leveraging an
application's functionality, then the investment in that application is not
recognized."

    Houston, Texas-based ION, a leading technology-focused seismic solutions
company,
is one of Emportal's newest clients. ION replaced existing systems, such as ADP
Employease, with Emportal to manage their global workforce of 1,400 workers.
ION's HRIS Director, Deanna Newsome, said, "Selecting an HRMS with an
intuitive user interface was a tremendous factor in our decision-making
process. With Emportal HCM, our users have the familiarity of the Microsoft
desktopcoupled with an intuitive solution that enables them to toggle between
applications and complete tasks without skipping a beat."

    The Ribbon user interface is designed to help users quickly find the
commands
they need to complete a task. Commands are organized in logical groups, which
are
collected together under tabs. To reduce clutter, some tabs are visible only
when needed.

    Dave Wright, industry director for SaaS ISVs at Microsoft, concluded,
"Independent
software vendors such as Emportal can drive higher levels of customer
adoption when they utilize an application interface that their customers are
familiar with. Emportal's approach is cutting-edge and will certainly be a
competitive advantage for them in the HR market."

    Robinson agreed, "We're seeing significant demand for Emportal HCM,
especially
among organizations that are seeking to break free of the inherent
constraints of the traditional HRMS model. Our ribbon UI, combined with the
proven
scalability and flexibility of our SaaS solution, is allowing Emportal to
gain significant traction in the HR market."

    About Emportal

    Emportal was founded in 2005 to enable companies to choose and integrate the
best
HR vendors and services for their businesses, while at the same time having
them delivered through a single, flexible, coordinated, integrated, highly
scalable,
modular and managed enterprise platform. Comprehensively supporting and managing
the workforce of both today and tomorrow -- an ever-changing mix of
employees, vendors, and alternative labor sources (independent contractors,
temporary
workers, consultants, etc.) -- Emportal truly delivers a "have it your way"
blend of
next-generation technology and services.  More information can be accessed at

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's love affair with JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon may soon end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are growing concerned that a possible U.S. recession, coupled with the bank's sizable consumer credit business, could make Dimon -- who has been lionized for largely sidestepping the subprime lending crisis that laid low many competitors -- look much less impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's reputation for making savvy acquisitions is also under question, as doubts about the wisdom of the Bear Stearns Cos takeover mix with concern that JPMorgan might try to buy a large regional bank or thrift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's surprising that the sheen has stayed so untarnished," James Ellman, a portfolio manager at hedge fund Seacliff Capital in San Francisco, said commenting on Dimon's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who has led JPMorgan since the end of 2005, has been credited with the bank's success. Once passed over for the No. 1 job at Citigroup, the former protege of Sandy Weill has been hailed for his ability to contain costs and integrate the diverse banks which combined to comprise today's JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Michael Nix, a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates, said his firm, which manages more than $700 million across asset classes, has pared its holding over the last year to about 1 percent of the portfolio from about 3.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been a safe haven for many investors in financial stocks. Its shares are down about 12 percent on the year, placing it among the top performers of the KBW index, down around 27 percent over the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nix believes that when conditions improve, investors are likely to move away from broad, diversified financial companies that are seen as stable, such as JPMorgan, and return to other financial firms with more attractive valuations. He said Greenwood Capital is looking at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, as well as some of the exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is trading at 13 times estimated 2009 earnings, compared with 7.8 times for Morgan Stanley and 11 times for Goldman Sachs, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman did not return calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEATH OF 1,000 CUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellman highlighted JPMorgan's consumer credit exposure as a serious threat to profitability. He said, "Consumer finance is a major, major problem potentially for JPMorgan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is among the biggest U.S. credit card issuers and it also has growing auto loans and mortgage businesses. For the first quarter of the year, JPMorgan recorded $1.8 billion in income from credit cards and auto loan originations of $7.2 billion and mortgage loan originations of $47.1 billion, up 38 percent and 30 percent respectively on the same quarter the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at a May conference, Dimon revised downward estimates across its consumer businesses. Loss-rates on credit cards are expected to climb, while home equity losses, projected to be $500 million this quarter, could rise to $900 million by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we're seeing is fairly constant deterioration in both consumer and small business credit," said Dimon at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At JPMorgan, it's more, 'death of a 1,000 cuts'," Ellman said. "They're not taking any huge hits anywhere, but at just about every area that we've heard about being difficult in the banking sector, they're there and they're taking losses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANOTHER BEAR STEARNS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk of JPMorgan acquiring another struggling bank is also starting to rankle with some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, it was reported JPMorgan made a $7 billion bid for Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N), the largest U.S. savings and loan, and some have connected the firm with a potential purchase of Wachovia Corp WB.N, which has been battered by mortgage losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's hard to really believe," said Ellman, noting that as time goes by, it looks more and more as though the Bear Stearns merger "may be the deal from hell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, others see JPMorgan's purchase power as a reason for it to trade at a premium to similar stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Stein, president of FSI Group, an investment manager which focuses on financials, said, "There's built in some expectation that they can do some Bear-type transaction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Peabody, partner at research group Portales Partners, warned in a JPMorgan report last month that earnings potential from the Bear Stearns' takeover may not be in line with expectations. He pointed to the loss of prime brokerage customers and a challenging equity environment, and rated the bank "sell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Yahoo Inc turned down the latest offer from Microsoft Corp this week, it walked away from $9 billion in cash and $1 billion a year in additional operating profit, Microsoft said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an e-mail to employees, Microsoft platforms and services division president Kevin Johnson said it had offered $8 billion for a 16 percent stake in Yahoo and $1 billion to buy Yahoo's search business and assume its operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal also included a revenue-sharing partnership that would have delivered $1 billion a year in additional operating income to Yahoo due in part to a three-year guarantee of better rates for advertisements tied to its search results than Yahoo's current Panama advertising system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's most recent offer was an alternative to its previous full acquisition proposal. Instead, Yahoo entered an advertising agreement with Google Inc on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, a dominant force in desktop software but a laggard in online search advertising, is still open to discussing its alternative proposal despite Yahoo's partnership with Google, a source familiar with Microsoft's thinking said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo had no comment. Microsoft spokesman Jeff O'Mara declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source familiar with the matter said Microsoft had proposed a 10-year exclusive deal to handle Yahoo's search advertising and only guaranteed higher advertising rates for three of those years. Johnson's e-mail did not mention the duration of the deal, only saying it was "long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Yahoo's deal with Google, which will pit the two companies' ads against each other in an auction, is non-exclusive. It means other companies can join in the auction to bid to place ads next to Yahoo's search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately Yahoo has chosen a different course, and yesterday announced an agreement that would start to consolidate over 90% of the paid search advertising market in Google's hands," said Johnson in the e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will make the market far less competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal with Google would boost Yahoo's cash flow by $250 million to $450 million in the first 12 months, according to Yahoo. It would be less than half of Microsoft's forecast for $1 billion in additional operating income, the source familiar with Microsoft's thinking said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A BETTER DEAL?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its proposal would have delivered $1 billion of incremental operating income to Yahoo because it would reduce Yahoo's operating costs for running search and the company would receive large payments in the form of so-called traffic acquisition costs (TAC) from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo would also not have to make hefty research and development investments for search, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the surface, it looks like a better deal," Gartner analyst David Mitchell Smith said of Microsoft's search deal proposal for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith cautioned, however, that there may have been issues not revealed publicly that made the Google deal a better option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft abandoned its offer to buy all of Yahoo in May as negotiations dragged on, making it unlikely that a deal could complete regulatory review during the Bush administration, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the full acquisition could not get approval by year-end, the review process could have carried on until as late as October 2009, meaning that Microsoft would have to carry the capital risk of a $40-billion-plus acquisition for 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also became less interested in a full acquisition after Yahoo's search share continued to deteriorate more than Microsoft had forecast, the source said. A lucrative severance agreement put in place by Yahoo's management also made a full acquisition less appealing, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft structured its alternate proposal to focus solely on search to take into account Yahoo's concerns that combining the two companies' e-mail and instant messaging users would not gain regulatory approval, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft closed up 83 cents, or 2.94 percent, at $29.07 on the Nasdaq, while Yahoo closed down 5 cents, or 0.21 percent, at $23.47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michele Gershberg in New York, Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) launched a campaign on Friday to enlist supporters in its opposition to a new advertising collaboration deal between Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day after the companies announced an agreement allowing Google to sell search ads on Yahoo's Web site, Microsoft contacted advocacy groups that work to influence policy in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one source who was contacted by Microsoft, the software company said in an e-mail that the Google-Yahoo agreement would "limit choices for advertisers and publishers" and "destroy a competitive alternative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Microsoft takes the view that the deal is akin to a price-fixing agreement, with Google and Yahoo effectively setting a minimum price for advertisements on some key word searches, according to another source familiar with Microsoft's thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The effect of that is sitting down and agreeing, 'We won't go below (the minimum price)'," this source said. Microsoft also believes the arrangement will lead to the demise of Yahoo's own search advertising business, eliminating a competitor, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to comment on any contacts involving the Google-Yahoo deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Jack Evans on Friday reiterated Microsoft's overall objections to any Google-Yahoo deal, saying it would make the Internet advertising market less competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our position has been clear since April that any deal between these two companies will increase prices for advertisers and start to consolidate more than 90 percent of the search advertising market in Google's hands," Evans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROLE REVERSAL?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be something of a role reversal for Microsoft if the company also decides to press the U.S. Justice Department to file an antitrust lawsuit. Microsoft spent years fighting an antitrust lawsuit by the department alleging that it abused its Windows monopoly. It settled the case in 2002 and agreed to restrictions on its business practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Google-Yahoo collaboration does not need up-front approval from U.S. antitrust authorities since the two companies are not merging. However, the Justice Department could challenge the arrangement in court if it concluded that it would restrain competition between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies agreed to wait 3-1/2 months for regulatory approval and to offer a way to end it if Yahoo is taken over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several antitrust experts said the deal would probably not be opposed by U.S. antitrust authorities. But others disagreed, saying the Justice Department could be swayed by Microsoft's arguments, particularly if the deal generates concern among advertisers and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft are bitter rivals. Microsoft staunchly opposed Google's offer to buy advertising company DoubleClick for $3.1 billion last year. U.S. antitrust regulators approved the deal in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has likened its new deal with Yahoo to outsourcing agreements that are not uncommon among competitors in other industries. The company stressed that the deal is not exclusive and leaves Yahoo free to pursue its own advertising business and to partner with other companies in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google General Counsel Kent Walker on Friday disputed the idea that the companies would be setting prices in any way. Prices for the Internet search ads, he said, are determined through an ongoing competitive auction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No one's coming in and saying, 'By the way, we're going to set the prices for those ads,'" Walker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker said Yahoo would remain a "robust" company and would have ample incentive to invest in its own search advertising business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not committing to putting all its traffic though our platforms -- far from it," Walker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's love affair with JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon may soon end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are growing concerned that a possible U.S. recession, coupled with the bank's sizable consumer credit business, could make Dimon -- who has been lionized for largely sidestepping the subprime lending crisis that laid low many competitors -- look much less impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's reputation for making savvy acquisitions is also under question, as doubts about the wisdom of the Bear Stearns Cos takeover mix with concern that JPMorgan might try to buy a large regional bank or thrift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's surprising that the sheen has stayed so untarnished," James Ellman, a portfolio manager at hedge fund Seacliff Capital in San Francisco, said commenting on Dimon's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who has led JPMorgan since the end of 2005, has been credited with the bank's success. Once passed over for the No. 1 job at Citigroup, the former protege of Sandy Weill has been hailed for his ability to contain costs and integrate the diverse banks which combined to comprise today's JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Michael Nix, a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates, said his firm, which manages more than $700 million across asset classes, has pared its holding over the last year to about 1 percent of the portfolio from about 3.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been a safe haven for many investors in financial stocks. Its shares are down about 12 percent on the year, placing it among the top performers of the KBW index, down around 27 percent over the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nix believes that when conditions improve, investors are likely to move away from broad, diversified financial companies that are seen as stable, such as JPMorgan, and return to other financial firms with more attractive valuations. He said Greenwood Capital is looking at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, as well as some of the exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is trading at 13 times estimated 2009 earnings, compared with 7.8 times for Morgan Stanley and 11 times for Goldman Sachs, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman did not return calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEATH OF 1,000 CUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellman highlighted JPMorgan's consumer credit exposure as a serious threat to profitability. He said, "Consumer finance is a major, major problem potentially for JPMorgan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is among the biggest U.S. credit card issuers and it also has growing auto loans and mortgage businesses. For the first quarter of the year, JPMorgan recorded $1.8 billion in income from credit cards and auto loan originations of $7.2 billion and mortgage loan originations of $47.1 billion, up 38 percent and 30 percent respectively on the same quarter the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at a May conference, Dimon revised downward estimates across its consumer businesses. Loss-rates on credit cards are expected to climb, while home equity losses, projected to be $500 million this quarter, could rise to $900 million by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we're seeing is fairly constant deterioration in both consumer and small business credit," said Dimon at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At JPMorgan, it's more, 'death of a 1,000 cuts'," Ellman said. "They're not taking any huge hits anywhere, but at just about every area that we've heard about being difficult in the banking sector, they're there and they're taking losses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANOTHER BEAR STEARNS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk of JPMorgan acquiring another struggling bank is also starting to rankle with some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, it was reported JPMorgan made a $7 billion bid for Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N), the largest U.S. savings and loan, and some have connected the firm with a potential purchase of Wachovia Corp WB.N, which has been battered by mortgage losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's hard to really believe," said Ellman, noting that as time goes by, it looks more and more as though the Bear Stearns merger "may be the deal from hell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, others see JPMorgan's purchase power as a reason for it to trade at a premium to similar stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Stein, president of FSI Group, an investment manager which focuses on financials, said, "There's built in some expectation that they can do some Bear-type transaction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Peabody, partner at research group Portales Partners, warned in a JPMorgan report last month that earnings potential from the Bear Stearns' takeover may not be in line with expectations. He pointed to the loss of prime brokerage customers and a challenging equity environment, and rated the bank "sell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares in Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) fell more than 6 percent on Friday as investors doubted a new ad partnership with Google Inc (GOOG.O) would benefit the company after deal talks with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has shed more than 16 percent of its value since late trading on Thursday, when it confirmed that negotiations with Microsoft failed to produce a deal. Google rose 4 percent on Friday, while Microsoft gained 3.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo also unveiled a search advertising partnership that will let it run some Google paid search listings alongside its ads on web sites in the United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Yahoo called the deal an $800 million yearly revenue opportunity that would add up to $450 million in operating cash flow within its first year, investors were not convinced that it offered a better return than Microsoft's abandoned buyout offer that was last worth $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the announced Yahoo-Google deal is worth only $3 per share to Yahoo shareholders," Jeffrey Lindsay, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has been sued by shareholders and is engaged in a proxy battle with billionaire Carl Icahn over its handling of the negotiations. Analysts said they expected to hear more from disappointed shareholders in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think at a minimum that the current deal will result in further lawsuits, which Yahoo will ultimately have to settle, further impacting the economics of the deal," Lindsay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, Google appears to have gained greatly, mainly because the prospect of more serious competition from a combined Microsoft and Yahoo has been neutralized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross Sandler estimated the web search leader could also eventually earn up to $700 million in incremental annual cash flow from the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft walking from Yahoo should allow Google to continue to extend its lead in online advertising in the near-term, at the same time, fortify Yahoo's position as the clear No. 2 player," Sandler wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo fell $1.02 to $22.50. Google rose $20.01 to $572.96, while Microsoft advanced $1.01 to $29.251.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michele Gershberg; additional reporting by Bijoy Koyitty in Bangalore; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) said on Thursday that talks with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on a full or partial acquisition have ended, and announced a search advertising partnership with rival Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a timeline of key events in Microsoft's pursuit of Yahoo, stretching back more than two years, when the Web pioneer's financial results began weakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early 2006 - Yahoo begins to report a string of disappointing quarterly results that stretches over the next two years, reflecting competitive missteps by the company, market share gains by rival Google, changes in the online advertising landscape and weakening spending in some ad segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late 2006/early 2007 - Microsoft and Yahoo discuss various partnerships, including a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February - Yahoo, under the leadership of previous Chief Executive Terry Semel, tells Microsoft it is not the right time to discuss a takeover, as the Yahoo board sees great potential from new advertising technology and internal changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 12 - A strong minority of Yahoo shareholders challenges Yahoo's direction, as CEO Semel comes under fire. Nearly a third of votes cast at the company's annual shareholders' meeting oppose some of Yahoo's directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 18 - Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang takes over as chief executive as Semel steps aside. Semel remains Yahoo chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 31 - Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer makes a $44.6 billion, $31-per-share cash-and-stock takeover offer to Yahoo's board. Semel resigns as chairman and is replaced by Roy Bostock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 1 - Microsoft makes the offer public. Its shares fall 6.6 percent to $30.45; Yahoo shares rise 48 percent to $28.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 11 - Yahoo rejects the Microsoft offer as too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 13 - MySpace owner News Corp NWSa.N and Yahoo discuss a tie-up, according to a source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 18 - Yahoo gives financial forecasts for the next two years, in an effort to prove it is worth more than Microsoft bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 28 - One of seven face-to-face meetings takes place between the "senior-most" executives of Microsoft and Yahoo to discuss the bid. Yahoo asks how Microsoft would handle regulatory issues, including antitrust concerns, tied to a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 4 - People familiar with the matter say Microsoft is evaluating its bid for Yahoo because the Internet company may have lost value since Microsoft first made its offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 5 - Microsoft sets a three-week deadline for Yahoo to negotiate and reach a deal or face a proxy fight and a possible cut to the bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 7 - Yahoo again rejects Microsoft and says it is open to a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 9 - Yahoo says it will test Google search ads on its site, which could be more lucrative than selling its own search ads. Sources say Yahoo and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) are in parallel talks to join Time Warner's AOL and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 15 - At another meeting between  Yahoo and Microsoft executives and their financial advisers, Yahoo asks about Microsoft's integration plans and Yahoo raises a list of "key non-price deal terms" it believes are critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 26 - Microsoft's deadline to Yahoo passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 30 - Ballmer flies to California for talks with Yahoo CEO Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 3 - Yang meets Ballmer in Seattle. Microsoft raises its offer to $33 per share, or $47.5 billion. That is about $5 billion over the value of the previous offer at the time. Yahoo wants $37 per share, or about $5 billion more. Late in the day, Ballmer calls off the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 15 - Carl Icahn proposes a 10-member dissident board slate for election at Yahoo's annual shareholder meeting in July. Icahn says he now holds a 4.3 percent stake in Yahoo, including 9.9 million shares and 49 million call options. Yahoo Chairman Bostock replies to Icahn that "none of the alternatives we are considering would preclude us from entering into a transaction with Microsoft or any other party."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 18 - Microsoft says it has raised with Yahoo an "alternative" deal that would not involve the software maker buying all of the web company but says it could reconsider pursuing a full acquisition. A source says Microsoft proposed to buy Yahoo's search business and as part of the deal, Yahoo would put its Asian assets up for sale and Microsoft would buy a stake in what remains of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 22 - Yahoo nominates nine of its board directors for reelection, setting the stage for a showdown with Icahn. It postpones its annual shareholders' meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 6 - Icahn says Yahoo should offer to sell itself to Microsoft of $34.375 a share. The two sides exchange a series of letters in an acrimonious war of words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 12 - Yahoo announces search advertising deal with Google for up to 10 years, and says talks with Microsoft have ended. Sources say Microsoft offered to pay $35 a share for a 16 percent equity stake in Yahoo as part of an alternative deal that would have involved buying Yahoo's search business. Yahoo forecast an $800 million annual revenue opportunity from the Google deal, and a $250 million to $450 million boost to cash flow in the first 12 months. U.S. lawmakers are expected to scrutinize the deal over antitrust concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August 1 - Yahoo will hold its annual shareholders' meeting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources: Statements from Microsoft, Yahoo, Google and Icahn; Reuters stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Compiled by Eric Auchard, Peter Henderson and Tiffany Wu; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO, June 13 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp

company better rates for advertisements tied to its search
results than Yahoo's current Panama advertising system, the

Microsoft is still open to discussing its proposal despite
Yahoo's agreement with Google, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo had no immediate comment.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, June 13 (Reuters) - Shares in Coca-Cola Co
(KO.N) and Pepsi Bottling Group Inc PBG.N fell on Friday,
after a profit warning from the second-largest bottler of Coke
drinks stoked worries about weakness in the beverage sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greece's Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company SA HLB.AT
on Friday lowered its outlook for earnings, citing poor
weather, rising costs and strikes that hurt sales in the early
part of the year, and its shares dropped 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank analyst Marc Greenberg said the Coca-Cola HBC
warning was a "rare miss" for the strong Coke operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Coca-Cola were down 3.7 percent and stock in
Pepsi Bottling, the largest Pepsi bottler, was off 2.6 percent
in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Coca-Cola HBC warning creates risk for Coca-Cola and
(Pepsi Bottling Group)," said Morgan Stanley analyst William
Pecoriello in a client note on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pecoriello said the warning creates greater risk for Pepsi
Bottling, since he was counting on international business to
offset a slowdown in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Pecoriello said in a second note that both Coca-Cola
and Pepsi Bottling appeared to have been oversold on the
Coca-Cola HBC news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Just 2 weeks ago, Coke reiterated its outlook, having had
a read on its global April and May results," he said, adding
that the company likely was experiencing strength in Latin
America and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola HBC on Friday lowered its forecast for 2008
earnings per share to 1.37 euros to 1.40 euros a share, or
earnings growth of 5 percent to 8 percent, down from previous
guidance of 1.46 euros to 1.49 euros a share, or profit growth
of 12 percent to 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola HBC attributed the cut to poor May weather
conditions in Russia and Central Europe, economic weakness in
Italy, Romania and Ukraine, rising oil prices, and a strike in
Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his note, Pecoriello maintained his second-quarter
estimates for Coca-Cola and Pepsi Bottling. The analyst expects
Coca-Cola to post quarterly earnings per share of 97 cents and
Pepsi Bottling to report a per-share profit of 77 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pecoriello said both companies' valuations were
"undemanding" and said shares in each company could be weak
between now and their respective second-quarter reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc (CCE.N), the world's largest
bottler of Coca-Cola drinks, warned on May 28 that it expects a
mid- to high-single-digit percentage decline in second quarter
profit, excluding one-time items, due to the weak North
American economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Considering the warnings from the Greek and U.S. bottlers,
Pecoriello said there is a risk that Coca-Cola's second-quarter
global growth is running at 4 percent rather than the company's
forecasted 5 percent growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Coca-Cola were down $2.13 to $55.01 and Pepsi
Bottling shares were off 83 cents to $30.65.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares in Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) fell more than 6 percent on Friday as investors doubted a new ad partnership with Google Inc (GOOG.O) would benefit the company after deal talks with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) failed.&lt;/p&gt;

Google rose $20.01 to $572.96, while Microsoft advanced $1.01 to $29.251.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michele Gershberg; additional reporting by Bijoy Koyitty in Bangalore; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds retailer reaction)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Huw Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, June 13 (Reuters) - Visa Europe will continue to
levy charges on cross-border transactions using its payment
cards even though rival MasterCard (MA.N) has announced it is
suspending its equivalent fee to avoid European Union fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yesterday's announcement has no impact on Visa Europe's
interchange fees," a Visa Europe spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top retailers like Carrefour (CARR.PA), HM (HMb.ST), Marks
 Spencer (MKS.L) and IKEA said after MasterCard's move the
pressure was now on Visa to reform its transaction fees as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One euro in every nine spent by consumers in Europe changes
hands via one of Visa Europe's 350 million cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in ongoing talks with the European Commission about
how we set our interchange in future, and these continue. We
would like to reach agreement with the European Commission in
the near future," the spokesman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EU executive last December said MasterCard's
multilateral interchange fee on cross-border payment card
transactions using MasterCard and Maestro cards had violated EU
rules on fair competition for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It gave MasterCard six months -- until June 21 -- to change
its fee structure for international card transactions, or face
daily fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RETAILERS CHEER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MasterCard is continuing its appeal against the Commission's
decision at the European Court of First Instance, the EU's
second-highest court, but retailers were quick to cheer the
latest development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After years of trying to prove the raison d'etre on
interchange, MasterCard has had to admit defeat by now pulling
back its EU cross-border interchange fee," the European Retail
Round Table said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We all know that the true cost of a MasterCard payment
transaction is closer to 1 euro cent rather than as high as 3
cents which the company charges today and we intend to keep up
the pressure on MasterCard and Visa until the fees are withdrawn
at a national as well as cross-border level," the group said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EuroCommerce, another retail lobby which has dubbed the
intercharge fees as a tax on consumption, said MasterCard's move
will impact Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "EuroCommerce is confident that the Commission's current
investigation into Visa's interchange fees will result in a
similar and quick conclusion," EuroCommerce said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retailers said they are now waiting to see how several
national competition authorities will rule on national
interchange fees which affect the bulk of card usage in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It estimates interchange fees cost consumers 8 to 10 billion
euros ($12.3 billion to $15.3 billion) a year in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission opened an antitrust investigation into Visa
Europe's interchange fee in March, but the company has said the
0.7 percent charge was justified on cost grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's fee was exempt from EU competition law from 2002 to
December last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; French and German banks studying whether to launch rival
cards to unseat the cross-border dominance of MasterCard and
Visa will also be eyeing latest developments to see how they
affect potential business models.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc may bid for Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd, countering a $4.6 billion offer by Japan's Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd for the Indian generic drug maker, the Business Standard newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy's shares jumped more than 4 percent on the report while Daiichi Sankyo's shares dropped 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's largest drug maker, may bid for the about 65 percent of Ranbaxy held by institutions and public shareholders, the newspaper reported on Friday, citing unidentified sources familiar with the development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daiichi Sankyo struck a deal on Wednesday worth up to $4.6 billion to take control of Ranbaxy, with the two companies seeking to become a pharmaceuticals powerhouse that sells both branded drugs and generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's third-biggest drugmaker agreed to acquire 34.8 percent from Ranbaxy's founding Singh family and then make an open offer for up to an additional 20 percent in line with Indian regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said Pfizer held talks with the Ranbaxy founders for a possible acquisition a year earlier and may now offer to buy out the stake held by lenders and other investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is speculation," a Ranbaxy spokesman said. "We have a binding contract with Daiichi. It is a final contract."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, when asked in Tokyo what he would do if another bidder appeared at a higher price, Ranbaxy Chief Executive Malvinder Singh said, "This is a firm and binding agreement between the two sides."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daiichi Sankyo declined to comment on the report. A Pfizer spokesman said the company does not comment on market rumors and speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to calculations by Nomura Securities analyst Ryo Urushihara, if Daiichi Sankyo's bid failed, the Japanese drug maker could acquire up 44 percent of Ranbaxy's shares as it intends to buy new shares issued it by Ranbaxy, as well as gain shares from new-share warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline PLC had also weighed a deal with Ranbaxy, sources told Reuters on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Indian television channel reported that Glaxo's offer had been stalled by conditions linked to the process, while also saying Sanofi-Aventis SA had been a potential bidder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy has been battling Pfizer over patent rights for the U.S. company's blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug, Lipitor, in several countries and has been successful in certain cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy's shares rose 4.3 percent to 566.9 rupees, while Daiichi Sankyo's shares ended down 2.4 percent to 2,910 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nomura Securities acted as the exclusive financial adviser to Daiichi Sankyo, while Religare Capital Markets, which is controlled by the Singh family, advised Ranbaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bharghavi Nagaraju and Edwina Gibbs in Tokyo; Editing by Ranjit Gangadharan and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that analyst firm Gartner, Inc.* and market
research firm Evans Data Corp. have ranked IBM as the leader in the application
development software market.  These rankings come just as IBM is projecting
more than 12,000 people will attend its 2008 IBM Rational Software Development
Conferences in 13 countries around the globe.

    Gartner named IBM the worldwide market share leader in application
development based
on total software revenue in 2007 and Evans Data Corp. survey respondents who
were users of IBM Rational Application Developer ranked it the number one
Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) for user satisfaction. This is the
seventh consecutive year that Gartner has ranked IBM the leader and second
consecutive year that IBM Rational Application Developer was selected as the
Developer's Choice top IDE by the 1,200 developers worldwide participating in
the survey.

    According to the independent Gartner report, IBM is the leading market share
vendor in total software revenue, with 37.8 percent market share -- greater
market share than its three closest competitors combined. The worldwide
application development software market grew more than 10% percent in 2007 to
nearly $6.9 billion, according to Gartner.

    IBM was also noted for its overall leadership based on total software
revenue for
2007 across application development market sub-categories, including SCCM
Distributed,
Object Oriented Analysis &amp; Design and Java Platform AD Tool.  Telelogic,
recently acquired by IBM, had a 2007 marketshare of 40.6 percent in the
Requirements Elicitation and Management category based on total software
revenue.

    "With the rise of globally distributed software development teams, customers
are
looking for experienced vendors to help them collaborate in an open and
transparent manner," said Dr. Daniel Sabbah, general manager, IBM Rational
Software. "We believe the strong response from the Evans Data and Gartner
reports coincides with the feedback we've received from customers about IBM's
strategy around effective software delivery."

    IBM Kicks off the World's Most Attended Developer Conference Series

    This marketshare news coincides with IBM's announcement that over 12,000
participants are expected to attend the 15 IBM Rational Software Development
Conferences planned around the globe.  Following the event held last week in
Orlando, FL, IBM will take the show on the road to 17 cities including Sharm El
Sheikh, Egypt; San Paulo, Brazil; Bangalore, India; Shanghai, China; Rome and
Milan, Italy.

    For conference attendees using an iPhone, IBM is releasing a conference
scheduler
written in Enterprise Generation Language (EGL) to enable iPhone users to
dynamically experience the IBM Rational Software Development Conference
through an interface that they feel comfortable with.  Using Web 2.0 and
social engineering concepts, users can provide feedback on and chat about
sessions,
navigate the conference searching for tracks and events, and use inventive
technologythat suggests which talks the user should attend next based on
preferences.

    At the annual IBM Rational Software Development Conference in Orlando,
Florida, more than 3,500 attendees learned about new software and programs
that help customers transform how they are delivery software on a global scale. 
The
announcement of new products, services and business partner initiatives
aredesigned to transform how IBM Rational software can help clients drive
greater
value and performance from their globally distributed software investments.

    Clients unable to attend the conference locally can view the keynote
presentations on IBM TV.

    IBM helps developers remain competitive in today's fast-paced development
environment.  Innovative programs such as IBM developerWorks, the premier
technical resource for software developers, and IBM alphaWorks, IBM's emerging
technologies outlet, provide an online community for the developers of today
and tomorrow. Developers who are independent software vendors can take advantage
of sales and marketing tools, skill-building courses and technical support by
joining
the worldwide IBM PartnerWorld program.  IBM's Academic Initiative and IBM
Rational
Software Development Conference are examples of the ongoing learning and
community-buildingprograms needed by students, educators and developers
worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;OptionsNews on ONN.tv for June 13, 2008
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
OptionsNews, the daily news program on www.onn.tv, today reported
on the following companies:

   Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) plunged 10% yesterday to $23.52 after
reportedly being snubbed by Microsoft (MSFT). Yahoo had tried to get
Microsoft to renew their $33 take-over bid, but was rejected. In order
to try and stem the tide, Yahoo has turned to rival Google (GOOG) to
help them handle some of their advertising sales. How this will affect
activist shareholder Carl Icahn in his bid to unseat the board is
unknown at this time. These issues will be center stage at the Yahoo
shareholder meeting scheduled for August 1.

   Lehman Brothers Holdings (LEH) will officially post earnings
Monday before the open. They pre-announced that they expected to lose
$5.14 a share versus $2.21 the same period last year. Lehman stock
closed yesterday at $22.70.

   Total contract volume dropped yesterday from Wednesday's volume,
and the CBOE volatility index, also known as the VIX, pulled back from
Wednesday's close.

   Implied volatility has exploded in mid-tier banks such as Keycorp
(KEY) and SunTrust Banks (STI), as the credit crisis migrates from the
national to the regional banks. Closing at $6.90 yesterday, the STI
July 45 straddle has an implied volatility of 60, far ahead of the
63-day historical volatility of 48.09. Another example of rising
implied volatility in the regional banks options pricing is the RKH
(Merrill Lynch Regional Bank Holders Trust). The RKH 21-day historical
volatility is 28, but the July 105 straddle closed $11.10 with an
implied volatility of 42.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Thursday it is getting out of the retail gas business in the United States as sky-high crude oil prices squeeze margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those branded service stations may be the most public aspect of Exxon's business, but they account for a small part of the company's profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the roughly 12,000 Exxon Mobil branded stations in the United States, Exxon, the world's largest publicly-traded oil company, owns about 2,220.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon plans to sell those service stations over several years. They include about 820 stations that it also operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will maintain the Exxon and Mobil brands, Exxon spokeswoman Prem Nair said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers will still be buying gasoline at stations that carry the Exxon and Mobil names, but they will not be owned by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service stations have struggled, even with $4-a-gallon plus gasoline prices because they have not been able to pass along to customers their additional costs from soaring crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to federal data, gasoline prices are up about 31 percent over the last year, and oil prices have nearly doubled over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are in a very, very challenging market. Margins are reduced," said Nair. "We feel the best way for us to grow and compete is through our distributor network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current environment, the company's profits from its retail unit are "somewhere close to a rounding error," said Mark Gilman, an analyst at the Benchmark Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Exxon was following competitors like Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc in moving away from ownership of service stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The retail gasoline business is a highly volatile and typically low return kind of business and thus the decision," Gilman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon made more than $40 billion in 2007, most of which came from its oil and gas production around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the decision came that it's more of a headache than its worth," said Oppenheimer  Co analyst Fadel Gheit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the company does not release profit margin figures for its retail arm, Gheit estimated the stations' margin was between 10 percent and 15 percent, about one-third its margin on crude oil production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question is who is going to buy them, and how much are they going to pay for them," Gheit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Matt Daily; Editing by Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, June 13 (Reuters) - Visa Europe will continue to
levy charges on cross-border transactions using its payment
cards even though rival MasterCard (MA.N) has announced it is
suspending its equivalent fee to avoid European Union fines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Yesterday's announcement has no impact on Visa Europe's
interchange fees," a Visa Europe spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One euro in every nine spent by consumers in Europe changes
hands via one of Visa Europe's 350 million cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in ongoing talks with the European Commission about
how we set our interchange in future, and these continue. We
would like to reach agreement with the European Commission in
the near future," the spokesman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EU executive last December said MasterCard's
multilateral interchange fee on cross-border payment card
transactions using MasterCard and Maestro cards had violated EU
rules on fair competition for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It gave MasterCard six months -- until June 21 -- to change
its fee structure for international card transactions, or face
daily fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MasterCard is continuing its appeal against the Commission's
decision at the European Court of First Instance, the EU's
second-highest court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EuroCommerce, a retailer lobby, has campaigned for years to
get rid of what it dubs a tax on consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It estimates interchange fees cost consumers 8 to 10 billion
euros ($12.3 billion to $15.3 billion) a year in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission opened an antitrust investigation into Visa
Europe's interchange fee in March, but the company has said the
0.7 percent charge was justified on cost grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's fee was exempt from EU competition law from 2002 to
December last year.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with detail on search ads, recasts lead)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi and Anupreeta Das&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO, June 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft's plan to establish a
strong footing in online advertising suffered a big blow on Thursday as merger
talks with Yahoo finally, formally failed and Yahoo said it would let Google
sell search ads on its site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separate statements from Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Yahoo (YHOO.O) signaled a
real rift between the two after their agonizing on-again, off-again talks, and
Yahoo shares fell 10 percent as final hopes of a full or partial acquisition
faded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose more than 4 percent as investors showed relief that
the company would not be paying too high a price for a deal they considered
risky -- even though its biggest rivals on the Web aimed to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo said it had agreed to let Google (GOOG.O) put search ads --
advertisements placed next to search results -- on its site in what it called an
$800 million annual revenue opportunity that would boost cash flow by $250
million to $450 million in the first 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Google has made an enormous gain strategically. This move might well have
shut Microsoft out of the online space altogether," said Sanford Bernstein
analyst Jeffrey Lindsay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google and Yahoo, No. 1 and No. 2 in search, will pit ads against each other
in auctions for the ad that pays the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yahoo is being a reseller of Google whenever it makes sense, and that is
likely to be a lot of the time, given how much more effective Google Web search
ads have proven to be," Global Crown Capital analyst Martin Pyykkonen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The process is nonexclusive, meaning others could join in the bidding to
place ads, a factor that could make a deal easier to pass regulatory approval.
The companies agreed to wait 3-1/2 months for regulatory approval and to offer a
way to end it if Yahoo is taken over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the prospect of combining the top search ad vendors in one system
immediately raised fears. Sen. Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat and chairman of a
U.S. Senate antitrust subcommittee, said lawmakers would "closely examine" the
plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt likened the deal to ones in other
industries where rivals find ways to cooperate even as they compete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The decision of showing ads is a Yahoo decision, not a Google decision," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICROSOFT OFFER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo rejected Microsoft's latest proposal, which sources briefed on the
subject said included an offer to buy 16 percent of Yahoo for $35 per share,
plus to buy its search business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo simply said that an alternative Microsoft proposal to buy only its
search business did not fit into its plan to grow search and display
advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's offer for a minority stake was at a premium per share to its
early May offer to buy the entire company for $47.5 billion, or $33 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which said it was still open to an alternative deal, had hoped a
Yahoo deal would accelerate its ability to capitalize on Web advertising growth
and compete with Google, which is increasingly fighting for the same Internet
audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo said on Thursday that Microsoft had made it clear in a meeting on June
8 that it was no longer interested in buying the company outright, even at the
$33 per share price Microsoft had most recently proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That may not appease Yahoo shareholders -- including billionaire Carl Icahn
-- who have been pressuring Yahoo to reach a deal with Microsoft. Icahn has
called for Chief Executive Jerry Yang to be ousted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE END?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said they did not expect that Yahoo and Microsoft would try another
round of negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It certainly seems to be the end," said Derek Brown, an analyst at Cantor
Fitzgerald. "In their most recent discussions, they were talking about totally
separate visions of both a deal and the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is expected soon to be on the prowl for other acquisition targets
because it has not given up its goal for online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft will keep trying," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran. "Yahoo is
one of the most popular sites on the Web, and there is no one else with as much
traffic. AOL may be one option, and it may not be as expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn, who has waged a proxy battle to remove Yahoo's board at its Aug. 1
annual meeting, had urged Yahoo to secure a higher price from Microsoft. Icahn
has said a partnership with Google should only be a second choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares sank as low as $22.50 on news of the talks failing and
expectations of the Google deal. It was their lowest level since Jan. 31, the
day before Microsoft announced its offer for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares fell $2.63 to $23.52 on Nasdaq. Google shares finished up $7.75
at $552.95, and Microsoft closed up $1.12 at $28.24.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) sought on Friday to enlist support for its opposition to a new advertising collaboration deal between Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day after the companies announced an agreement allowing Google to sell search ads on Yahoo's Web site, Microsoft contacted advocacy groups that work to influence policy in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one source who was contacted by Microsoft, the software company said in an e-mail that the Google-Yahoo agreement would "limit choices for advertisers and publishers" and "destroy a competitive alternative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Microsoft takes the view that the deal is akin to a price-fixing agreement, with Google and Yahoo effectively setting a minimum price for advertisements on some key word searches, according to another source familiar with Microsoft's thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The effect of that is sitting down and agreeing, 'We won't go below (the minimum price)'," this source said. Microsoft also believes the arrangement will lead to the demise of Yahoo's own search advertising business, eliminating a competitor, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Jack Evans on Friday reiterated Microsoft's overall objections to any Google-Yahoo deal, saying it would make the Internet advertising market less competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our position has been clear since April that any deal between these two companies will increase prices for advertisers and start to consolidate more than 90 percent of the search advertising market in Google's hands," Evans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft later said in statement its lobbying approach "reflects our belief that we have a responsibility to engage with policymakers on issues that impact our products, customers, shareholders and the industry overall ..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROLE REVERSAL?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be something of a role reversal for Microsoft if the company also decides to press the U.S. Justice Department to file an antitrust lawsuit. Microsoft spent years fighting an antitrust lawsuit by the department alleging that it abused its Windows monopoly. It settled the case in 2002 and agreed to restrictions on its business practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Google-Yahoo collaboration does not need up-front approval from U.S. antitrust authorities since the two companies are not merging. However, the Justice Department could challenge the arrangement in court if it concluded that it would restrain competition between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies agreed to wait 3-1/2 months for regulatory approval and to offer a way to end it if Yahoo is taken over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several antitrust experts said the deal would probably not be opposed by U.S. antitrust authorities. But others disagreed, saying the Justice Department could be swayed by Microsoft's arguments, particularly if the deal generates concern among advertisers and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft are bitter rivals. Microsoft staunchly opposed Google's offer to buy advertising company DoubleClick for $3.1 billion last year. U.S. antitrust regulators approved the deal in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has likened its new deal with Yahoo to outsourcing agreements that are not uncommon among competitors in other industries.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) turned down the latest offer from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) this week, it walked away from $9 billion in cash and $1 billion a year in additional operating profit, Microsoft said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an e-mail to employees, Microsoft platforms and services division president Kevin Johnson said it had offered $8 billion for a 16 percent stake in Yahoo and $1 billion to buy Yahoo's search business and assume its operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal also included a revenue-sharing partnership that would have delivered $1 billion a year in additional operating income to Yahoo due in part to a three-year guarantee of better rates for advertisements tied to its search results than Yahoo's current Panama advertising system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's most recent offer was an alternative to its previous full acquisition proposal. Instead, Yahoo entered an advertising agreement with Google Inc (GOOG.O) on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, a dominant force in desktop software but a laggard in online search advertising, is still open to discussing its alternative proposal despite Yahoo's partnership with Google, a source familiar with Microsoft's thinking said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo had no comment. Microsoft spokesman Jeff O'Mara declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source familiar with the matter said Microsoft had proposed a 10-year exclusive deal to handle Yahoo's search advertising and only guaranteed higher advertising rates for three of those years. Johnson's e-mail did not mention the duration of the deal, only saying it was "long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Yahoo's deal with Google, which will pit the two companies' ads against each other in an auction, is non-exclusive. It means other companies can join in the auction to bid to place ads next to Yahoo's search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately Yahoo has chosen a different course, and yesterday announced an agreement that would start to consolidate over 90% of the paid search advertising market in Google's hands," said Johnson in the e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will make the market far less competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal with Google would boost Yahoo's cash flow by $250 million to $450 million in the first 12 months, according to Yahoo. It would be less than half of Microsoft's forecast for $1 billion in additional operating income, the source familiar with Microsoft's thinking said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A BETTER DEAL?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its proposal would have delivered $1 billion of incremental operating income to Yahoo because it would reduce Yahoo's operating costs for running search and the company would receive large payments in the form of so-called traffic acquisition costs (TAC) from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo would also not have to make hefty research and development investments for search, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the surface, it looks like a better deal," Gartner analyst David Mitchell Smith said of Microsoft's search deal proposal for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith cautioned, however, that there may have been issues not revealed publicly that made the Google deal a better option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft abandoned its offer to buy all of Yahoo in May as negotiations dragged on, making it unlikely that a deal could complete regulatory review during the Bush administration, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the full acquisition could not get approval by year-end, the review process could have carried on until as late as October 2009, meaning that Microsoft would have to carry the capital risk of a $40-billion-plus acquisition for 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also became less interested in a full acquisition after Yahoo's search share continued to deteriorate more than Microsoft had forecast, the source said. A lucrative severance agreement put in place by Yahoo's management also made a full acquisition less appealing, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft structured its alternate proposal to focus solely on search to take into account Yahoo's concerns that combining the two companies' e-mail and instant messaging users would not gain regulatory approval, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft closed up 83 cents, or 2.94 percent, at $29.07 on the Nasdaq, while Yahoo closed down 5 cents, or 0.21 percent, at $23.47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michele Gershberg in New York, Editing by Gerald E.

the deal in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google has likened its new deal with Yahoo to outsourcing 
agreements that are not uncommon among competitors in other 
industries. The company stressed that the deal is not exclusive 
and leaves Yahoo free to pursue its own advertising business 
and to partner with other companies in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google General Counsel Kent Walker on Friday disputed the 
idea that the companies would be setting prices in any way. 
Prices for the Internet search ads, he said, are determined 
through an ongoing competitive auction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No one's coming in and saying, 'By the way, we're going to 
set the prices for those ads,"' Walker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walker said Yahoo would remain a "robust" company and would 
have ample incentive to invest in its own search advertising 
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's not committing to putting all its traffic though our 
platforms -- far from it," Walker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's love affair with JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon may soon end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors are growing concerned that a possible U.S. recession, coupled with the bank's sizable consumer credit business, could make Dimon -- who has been lionized for largely sidestepping the subprime lending crisis that laid low many competitors -- look much less impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's reputation for making savvy acquisitions is also under question, as doubts about the wisdom of the Bear Stearns Cos takeover mix with concern that JPMorgan might try to buy a large regional bank or thrift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's surprising that the sheen has stayed so untarnished," James Ellman, a portfolio manager at hedge fund Seacliff Capital in San Francisco, said, commenting on Dimon's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who has led JPMorgan since the end of 2005, has been credited with the bank's success. Once passed over for the No. 1 job at Citigroup, the former protege of Sandy Weill has been hailed for his ability to contain costs and integrate the diverse banks which combined to comprise today's JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Michael Nix, a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates, said his firm, which manages more than $700 million across asset classes, has pared its holding over the last year to about 1 percent of the portfolio from about 3.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been a safe haven for many investors in financial stocks. Its shares are down about 12 percent on the year, placing it among the top performers of the KBW index, down around 27 percent over the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nix believes that when conditions improve, investors are likely to move away from broad, diversified financial companies that are seen as stable, such as JPMorgan, and return to other financial firms with more attractive valuations. He said Greenwood Capital is looking at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, as well as some of the exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is trading at 13 times estimated 2009 earnings, compared with 7.8 times for Morgan Stanley and 11 times for Goldman Sachs, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman did not return calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEATH OF 1,000 CUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellman highlighted JPMorgan's consumer credit exposure as a serious threat to profitability. He said, "Consumer finance is a major, major problem potentially for JPMorgan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is among the biggest U.S. credit card issuers and it also has growing auto loans and mortgage businesses. For the first quarter of the year, JPMorgan recorded $1.8 billion in income from credit cards and auto loan originations of $7.2 billion and mortgage loan originations of $47.1 billion, up 38 percent and 30 percent respectively on the same quarter the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at a May conference, Dimon revised downward estimates across its consumer businesses. Loss-rates on credit cards are expected to climb, while home equity losses, projected to be $500 million this quarter, could rise to $900 million by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we're seeing is fairly constant deterioration in both consumer and small business credit," Dimon said at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At JPMorgan, it's more, 'death of a 1,000 cuts,'" Ellman said. "They're not taking any huge hits anywhere, but at just about every area that we've heard about being difficult in the banking sector, they're there and they're taking losses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANOTHER BEAR STEARNS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk of JPMorgan acquiring another struggling bank is also starting to rankle with some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, it was reported JPMorgan made a $7 billion bid for Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N), the largest U.S. savings and loan, and some have connected the firm with a potential purchase of Wachovia Corp WB.N, which has been battered by mortgage losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's hard to really believe," Ellman said, noting that as time goes by, it looks more and more as though the Bear Stearns merger "may be the deal from hell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, others see JPMorgan's purchase power as a reason for it to trade at a premium to similar stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Stein, president of FSI Group, an investment manager which focuses on financials, said, "There's built in some expectation that they can do some Bear-type transaction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Peabody, partner at research group Portales Partners, warned in a JPMorgan report last month that earnings potential from the Bear Stearns' takeover may not be in line with expectations. He pointed to the loss of prime brokerage customers and a challenging equity environment, and rated the bank "sell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities on Monday filed a lawsuit against a former executive who managed more than $200 million in wealthy clients' assets, accusing him of sharing sensitive information with other firms and trying to steer clients to rival firm Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, an attorney representing JP Morgan said the complaint was being amended on Monday night to remove all references to Morgan Stanley (MS.N). The lawyer said it was an error to name any firms in the suit because the firms were not known, but the lawsuit was not about Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan Securities, a unit of JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), is seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to preserve the status of a pending arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In papers filed in U.S. District Court in New York, JP Morgan said Argentine Hernan Arbizu, who worked in its private banking department, was responsible for handling "high net worth individuals" and their related businesses in Argentina and Chile for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amended complaint will accuse him of attempting to induce JP Morgan clients to take their business away from JP Morgan, the attorney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbizu, who lived in Connecticut while employed with JP Morgan, fled to Argentina just before being fired last month, court papers said. He allegedly took stolen documents with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Defendant engaged in such wrongdoing prior to and after the time he was terminated from JPMorgan," the attorney said the amended complaint would read, removing a reference to Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said it discovered evidence last month that Arbizu had made unauthorized and illegal wire transfers between the account of a JP Morgan client and accounts at other firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit also claims that Arbizu stole confidential and proprietary information and assets belonging to JP Morgan and its clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it has not yet ascertained the full extent of damage caused by Arbizu's actions but added that it believes "a thorough investigation will reveal criminal conduct beyond the contractual, common-law and statutory violations detailed in this affidavit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit claims that the defendant has confessed his wrongdoing and stated that he feared that returning to the United States would result in his arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It argues that without the injunction and restraining order, JP Morgan and its clients will suffer further irreparable harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan has asked the court to stop the defendant from using, disclosing, transmitting or destroying any documents belonging to it or its clients. It seeks the surrender and return of all JP Morgan materials in Arbizu's possession and asks that he be stopped from attempting to induce any of its clients to do business with other firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also asked the court's help in questioning the defendant under oath and is seeking attorneys' fees and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, JP Morgan said it was filing a claim against Arbizu with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is close
to finalising a plan to restructure a $7 billion structured
investment vehicle (SIV) formerly run by Cheyne Capital, the
Financial Times newspaper reported in its Tuesday edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The paper said the deal could be signed as early as Tuesday
and be the first of a number of deals that would see some $18
billion worth of SIV assets restructured over the coming
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the Financial Times, which did not cite its
source for the report, Deloitte  Touche, receivers for the SIV
formerly known as Cheyne Finance, was close to signing off on
the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIVs, held by banks, hedge funds or other institutions,
issue a mixture of short-term debt and capital and buy
longer-term assets, which may pay more interest than the amount
they pay on their notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The vehicles hit trouble in August when liquidity in the
credit markets dried up as investors faced exposure to the U.S.
subprime market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That prevented SIVs from raising funds and also caused the
value of their assets -- mainly bank debt and asset-backed
securities -- to drop.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Many option traders wanted to put their 
hands around the call options in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) 
on Monday, reflecting optimism about the prospects for 
favorable earnings from the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman will report second-quarter results on Tuesday 
before the bell. Wall Street analyst expect earnings ranging 
from $3.03 to 3.99 per share. The consensus estimate is $3.42, 
according to Reuters estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the New York Stock Exchange, shares in Goldman closed up 
2.13 percent, or $3.80, to close at $182.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the options market, many investors bought calls, hoping 
to catch a share rally or cover short positions. Some also 
bought puts, possibly to shield their portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the optimism may be due to the fact that Goldman 
has easily topped analyst estimates over the past few quarters, 
said independent options trader Frederic Ruffy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Reuters Estimates, Goldman has beaten analyst 
targets by an average of 73 cents per share over the past four 
quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recently, pressures on the brokerage industry have risen 
because of the economy, slowing investment banking activity and 
perhaps most importantly, more evidence of faulty risk 
management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Throughout it all, Goldman Sachs has been the diamond in 
the rough," said William Lefkowitz, options strategist at 
brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investors are anticipating that Goldman's guidance and 
quarterly profits will not disappoint them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott Fullman, director of derivative investment strategies 
at broker-dealer WJB Capital Group, shared the view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You are seeing speculation that Goldman is going to report 
better-than-expected results based upon the number of calls 
being traded," he said. "We are also seeing put buying as a 
possible hedge for long stock positions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total option volume was running three times the usual 
level, with about 127,000 Goldman calls and 84,000 puts traded, 
according to option analytics firm Trade Alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the action was centered in the front-month calls 
which go off the board this Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the most popular contracts were the June $175, $180 
and $185 call strikes, allowing investors to buy Goldman shares 
from $175 to $185 a piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The volume in the call strikes far exceeded their 
respective open interest, indicating traders opened new 
positions at these soon-to-expire strikes, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The majority of these front-month calls were bought, 
suggesting investors believe the investment bank will have a 
very good quarter instead of a very bad one," said Jon 
Najarian, a founder of Web information site optionmonster.com."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This a very expensive stock to speculate in, and it looks 
like Goldman could make another attempt at $200 this year." 
Najarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The options are also pricing in a sizable move in Goldman 
shares on the back of its quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman options are implying a plus or minus 5 percent 
move, or a swing of $9, in the aftermath of its earnings, said 
Christopher Hauck, director of the equity strategy group at 
Deutsche Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some models predict a bigger move. Using his data, Credit 
Suisse equity derivatives strategist Sveinn Palsson found the 
option market is forecasting a move up or down of 6 percent, or 
$11 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Doris Frankel; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM), today announced a new service, the IT Carbon Strategy Study,
to
help clients starting on their green transformation identify the most rapid
areas of reduction in IT carbon emission across the infrastructure.

    Part of IBM's Project Big Green initiative, the service enables clients to
develop the guiding principles for becoming a greener enterprise and
createrecommendations for the actions they can take to achieve those goals. The
service assesses the entire IT enterprise, not just the data center.

    "Significant reduction in carbon footprint can be achieved in
often-overlooked areas such as desktop systems, networking components, server
rooms
and printers that can contribute more than 50 percent of the total energy
consumption for IT," said Jeanine Cotter, vice president for IBM's IT
Strategy and Architecture services.

    The assessment includes both the data center and the distributed environment
including offices, retail stores, and warehouses.

    While early momentum has been in the greening of data centers, studies are
revealing that there is at least as much emission reduction potential in the
distributed environment. As few companies have existing infrastructure that has
been
built with energy efficiency as part of the design criteria, the IT Carbon
Strategy
Study provides clients specific recommendations on project priorities with
the biggest potential gains.  Projects could comprise the network, printers,
distributed servers (server closets outside the data center), facilities
upgrades
like heating, venting, and air conditioning (HVAC) and universal power
supplies (UPS), desktop computers and monitors.

    A typical three-to-four week study includes a kick-off workshop to agree
onoverall objectives and targets, data gathering and data analysis
leveraginga carbon impact analysis tool to help assess cost benefit analysis.
After
completing an action oriented workshop, clients are presented with the
results in a report including the specific findings and recommendations.

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Downgrades 3 Classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Comm'l Mtge Securities Corp., Series 2005-CIBC12

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades and assigns a Distressed Recovery rating
to the following classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp., series 2005-CIBC12:

   --$5.4 million class M to 'B' from 'B+';

   --$8.1 million class N to 'B-' from 'B';

   --$5.4 million class P to 'CCC/DR1' from 'B-'.

   In addition, Fitch affirms the following classes:

   --$162.2 million class A-2 at 'AAA';

   --$163.6 million class A-3A1 at 'AAA';

   --$122.9 million class A-3A2 at 'AAA';

   --$200 million class A-3B at 'AAA';

   --$649.3 million class A-4 at 'AAA';

   --$137.4 million class A-SB at 'AAA';

   --$216.7 million class A-M at 'AAA';

   --$162.5 million class A-J at 'AAA';

   --Interest only class X-1 at 'AAA';

   --Interest only class X-2 at 'AAA';

   --$43.3 million class B at 'AA';

   --$19 million class C at 'AA-';

   --$32.5 million class D at 'A';

   --$27.1 million class E at 'A-';

   --$24.4 million class F at 'BBB+';

   --$24.4 million class G at 'BBB';

   --$29.8 million class H at 'BBB-';

   --$8.1 million class J at 'BB+';

   --$8.1 million class K at 'BB';

   --$8.1 million class L at 'BB-';

   --$50 million class UHP at 'BB'.

   The $27.1 million class NR is not rated by Fitch. Class A-1 has
paid in full.

   The downgrades of classes M through P are due to projected losses
on the three specially serviced loans (1.5%).

   The affirmations are the result of sufficient credit enhancement
and stable performance of the non-specially serviced loans. As of the
May 2008 distribution date, the transaction has paid down 3.7% to $2.1
billion from $2.2 billion at issuance. Four loans, 2.9% of the pool,
have defeased.

   The largest specially serviced loan (0.7%) is secured by a 34,938
square foot (sf) retail property in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands that is
90 days delinquent. The property suffered from a deteriorating retail
environment stemming from a reduction in vacation travel. The most
recent appraisal value indicates losses upon disposition.

   The second largest specially serviced loan is collateralized by an
89,080 sf suburban office building in New London, CT (0.4%) that
transferred in February 2007. The loan is 90 days delinquent.
Occupancy as of April 2008 was 67% and the special servicer is working
to stabilize the property.

   The third specially serviced loan (0.4%) is collateralized by a
140,482 sf office property located in Buffalo, NY, that transferred in
September 2007 due to monetary default. Occupancy as of February 2008
was 75%. Losses are expected on all three assets.

   Three loans, the Universal Hotel Portfolio (4.9%), 4250 North
Fairfax Drive (2.2%), and 450 Roxbury Drive (1.2%) maintain investment
grade shadow-ratings. Watertower Place at Celebration has paid in
full.

   The Universal Hotel Portfolio consists of three hotels in Orlando,
Fl, with a total of 2,400 keys. September 2007 combined occupancy was
82.5% compared to issuance at 81.9%. Average daily rate and revenue
per available room for the same period were $225 and $185 compared to
issuance at $208 and $171, respectively.

   The $50 million A-note is pooled and held in the trust. The $50
million B-note, non-pooled but in the trust, collateralizes class UHP.

   The second loan, 4250 North Fairfax Drive, is an office property
located in Arlington, VA, that reported year-end (YE) 2007 occupancy
of 100%, up from issuance occupancy of 98.6% and an increase in net
operating income of 30% since issuance. The third loan, 450 Roxbury
Drive, is a medical office property in Los Angeles, CA. Occupancy as
of YE 2007 was 100%, an increase from the issuance occupancy of 88.4%.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
Published ratings, criteria and methodologies are available from this
site, at all times. Fitch's code of conduct, confidentiality,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) laid off investment bankers last week as it reacts to slowing markets and a slump in merger activity, according to people familiar with the situation and Wall Street recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cuts, described as in the hundreds, were concentrated among support staff and junior level bankers. One insider told Reuters that 25 percent of employees at the vice-president level were let go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April the world's largest securities firm initiated a round of market-related cuts, hitting such areas as leveraged lending and mortgage securities, though none have been announced publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment specifically to the investment-banking job cuts, but repeated an earlier statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given market conditions, we have been looking at a number of areas of the firm where we believe we have too many people. We have transferred some to other areas and to other regions, but unfortunately, some people have been asked to leave the firm," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had 31,874 employees worldwide at the end of February, up from 30,500 at the end of November 2007. Goldman's head count reflected the bank's acquisition of Litton Loan Servicing, a company that provides back-office support for home mortgage lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company has so far suffered the least damage in the global credit crunch and it remains the leading adviser to mergers and IPOs worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEALS DOWN 25 PERCENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the cuts show the firm cannot completely avoid the pinch of an environment where megabuyouts have disappeared and global year-to-date announced MA deals and deal volumes are down more than 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters data, $1.77 trillion of acquisitions have been announced worldwide this year, compared with $2.39 trillion for the first six months of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of deals fell to 16,120 year to date in 2008 vs. 21,803 in the first half of last year, according to Thompson Reuters, a drop of 26 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With seized-up credit markets slowing everything from deal finance to underwriting, Goldman is expected to report a 33 percent drop in second-quarter earnings Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some recruiters noted that Goldman has steered clear of cutting managing directors, higher ranking executives responsible for sourcing deals and generating fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're holding up better than their competitors, but they are still hurt. If you had anything to do with any credit-related vehicles or products, you're going to be hit," said Jeanne Branthover, head of the global financial services practice at Boyden Global Executive Search. "The question is, is this it for Goldman or will they hit other levels (of management) as well?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters earlier this year reported that Goldman slashed about 1,500 employees, targeting the bottom performers in annual reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet while the rest of Wall Street is slashing jobs -- more than 60,000 since the credit crunch took hold -- Goldman has insisted it will increase global head count this year at a low single-digit rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job cuts in mature markets like the United States, executives have said, will be more then offset by aggressive hiring in fast growing regions such as Asia and businesses such as distressed-debt investing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustavo Dolfino, president of recruiting firm WhiteRock Group, said the extent of Goldman's cuts are not all that material though they still send an important signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What matters is not the number of cuts: It's the trend. Goldman's catching up with the rest of the industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Brian Moss)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, June 16 (Reuters) - The Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority said on Monday it fined JP Morgan
Securities (JPM.N) $185,000 for failing to report municipal
bond transactions and because it "improperly reported
transactions that it should not have."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In its monthly disciplinary report, FINRA said the firm did
not report transactions to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board's Real-time Transaction Reporting System, which records
the buying and selling of bonds and posts them on its Web
site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, FINRA found JP Morgan did not file sales
reports for over-the-counter equity securities on time, while
also being lax in creating a paper trail for short sales and
other transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FINRA also fined St. Germain Investment Company, of
Springfield, Massachusetts, $75,000 for failing to report some
of its municipal transactions to the MSRB and for not creating
and following supervisory procedures to ensure it was working
within federal law, the non-governmental regulator said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both firms paid the penalties without admitting or denying
FINRA's findings.

&lt;p&gt;Based on Artilium's Mobile Presence Innovation
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Artilium, a leading European developer of Microsoft-based
carrier-grade software for mobile network operators, unveils new
mashup applications developed via the Microsoft Connected Services
Sandbox, a development environment that facilitates the rapid creation
and deployment of new services which combine Web 2.0 type services
with traditional telecommunications offerings.

   Artilium will showcase three applications created in the Sandbox
at NXTcomm08 in Las Vegas, June 17-19, 2008 at the Microsoft booth
#SL5916/SL5923. Featuring Artilium's patented Mobile Presence
functionality the applications are examples of the thousands of
services that can be offered by mobile operators as paid services or
part of subscriber or business customer packages. The Artilium
NXTcomm08 demonstrations will feature:

   --  A child monitoring service that allows parents to check the
        location of their children and their status (ie., on phone, in
        a lesson, etc.); and make a one-click phone call from the
        computer desktop to their child or a designated contact within
        a particular location (i.e., school, home).

   --  Real-time call control from the desktop so that when you
        receive a call on your mobile, landline or IP phone, a pop-up
        displays on your computer screen that features contact details
        including a photo designated in Microsoft Office Outlook
        contacts, and provides the user with options to 'control' the
        call such as sending it to voicemail, forwarding the call to
        an assistant, another number, or other options.

   --  A desktop-integrated location-based weather service that
        delivers dynamic 12-hour weather forecasts specific to the
        subscriber's current location.

   "Microsoft shares Artilium's vision for the development of new
services by combining the best of the Web world with the best of the
telecom world. We see third-party application development powering a
new wave of innovation, which in turn provides operators with a
plethora of new revenue-generating services," stated Steve Zimba,
Managing Director of the Global Telecom Business at Microsoft Corp.
"We're excited to be showcasing Artilium's applications created in the
Microsoft Connected Services Sandbox."

   Artilium CEO Robert Marcus added, "Artilium has extended the
Microsoft desktop presence experience, making it fully mobile,
network-based and device agnostic to deliver continuous real-time
location and state data that open an infinite variety of possibilities
for mobile mashups that combine the 'three C's: content (including
advertising), commerce, and community (social networks). We're excited
to work with Microsoft to enable network operator delivery of a new
generation of services that securely exploit the convergence of Web
and telecommunications networks."

   The applications showcased in the Microsoft booth are built using
Artilium's ARTA Mobile Services Platform, an open and modular Next
Generation Service Delivery Platform and Intelligent Network built on
Service Oriented Architecture principles and designed to enable the
rapid creation of new mobile applications. ARTA provides open and
secure mobile network access to third-party developers creating
intelligent mash-ups that combine network capabilities of presence,
mobility, location and telephony with Web services including
advertising, social networking and search. Artilium's patented
Tri-cell Intelligent Location System is the only location technology
that provides automatic continuous location data for unmodified mobile
phones without the need for GPS or other specialist equipment.

   Built entirely on Microsoft's .NET Framework, ARTA runs on the
Windows Server line of operating system using Microsoft SQL Server
database technology and Microsoft Visual Studio as a rapid service
creation environment for third-party developers.

   The Microsoft Connected Services Sandbox is a program that unites
independent software vendors (ISVs), developers, systems integrators
(SIs), network equipment providers and telecommunications service
providers in developing and testing new communications services, and
ultimately bringing these new services together. Through the Sandbox,
participants can take their core network assets and combine them with
technologies and applications from the Web 2.0 world. Through this
initiative, Microsoft aims to build a solid partner ecosystem for the
Telco 2.0 era, spurring the creation and commercialization of a range
of innovative new services.

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS, June 16 (Reuters) - The Agbami offshore oilfield in
Nigeria operated by Chevron (CVX.N) is on track to produce its
first oil in June, the U.S. energy giant said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The massive field located 70 miles (113 km) offshore, is
expected to reach peak output of 250,000 barrels per day within
a year of start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For Agbami, work is progressing, and with good weather
conditions, we will be within the expected range for first oil,"
a company spokeswoman said in an e-mail to Reuters. She did not
give a specific start-up date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top Chevron officials had said in February that Agbami was
expected to come online in June, without specifying a date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The field is crucial to Nigeria's efforts to ramp up output
and offset the loss of production from militant attacks and
sabotage of oil facilities in the Niger Delta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About a fifth of Nigeria's oil output has been shut in since
early 2006 after ethnic militants launched a violent campaign
against the oil industry to press for greater control of the
region's natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agbami and Total's (TOTF.PA) Akpo are the only major offshore
oilfields expected to come online this year, adding 500,000 bpd
to the output of Africa's top producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Umaru Yar'Adua said last week Nigeria, the world's
eighth-biggest crude exporter, aimed to double its oil
production to 4 billion bpd by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But most analysts and industry experts doubt that will be
possible as Nigeria cannot produce anywhere close to its current
3 billion bpd supply capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Average output in 2007 declined by 100,000 bpd compared with
the previous year to 2.14 million bpd due to a rise in militant
attacks, according to the International Energy Agency.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded video-game
retailer GameStop Corp (GME.N) to "neutral" from "sell," saying
the stock now more appropriately reflects impending fall in
software sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage does not see further downside from current

&lt;p&gt;  DUBLIN, IRELAND and ARMONK, NY, Jun 16 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
 Today IBM (NYSE: IBM) and the Industrial Development Agency of Ireland (IDA
Ireland) announced the establishment of an IBM Centre of Excellence for Water
Management.

    Located in Dublin, the new facility will focus primarily on innovative
research and
services for monitoring, managing and forecasting environmental challenges such
as
the movement of pollutants in fresh water, marine and oceanic environments.

    "Ireland's track record in developing research and development projects,
combined
with its ongoing innovative approach to new business creation, makes it an ideal
location for the Centre's research-based services," said Dr. Sharon Nunes,
vice president, IBM Big Green Innovations.

    One of the Centre's first projects is a collaboration with the Marine
Institute,
Ireland on its national research SmartBay project, which is under
development at Galway Bay.

    SmartBay is a research, test and demonstration infrastructure for monitoring
and managing aquatic environmental data such as tidal flow, wave heights,
temperature, and phytoplankton via an integrated network of sensors,
robotics and computational technology distributed throughout the Bay.

    IBM will develop an advanced sensor network, use real-time monitoring
technologies,
data analytics and next generation content delivery to provide scientists,
commercial fishing &amp; aquaculture, monitoring agencies and the public with access
to environmental information in a similar way that we forecast and report the
weather.

    "The Marine Institute's aim is to create a mind shift in the way we view our
marine sector in terms of economic opportunities through the application of
knowledge. Our collaboration with IBM is a good example of increasingly
sophisticated technology being applied to marine stewardship and management
activities -- the research and development of which offers a significant
new opportunity for Irish industry," said Dr. Peter Heffernan, CEO Marine
Institute
Ireland.

    "The novel environmental technologies that will emerge from the
collaborations around the SmartBay platform will create new business for
Irish technology companies as well as enhancing the viability of the seafood,
shipping and water monitoring sectors."

    The Dublin Centre will also foster collaboration across Irish small and
medium enterprises (SMEs), Government agencies and key academic collaborators
including Dublin City University, University College of Dublin, and the
Tyndall Institute at University College, Cork to improve water quality and water
system performance.

    Speaking at today's announcement Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan T.D
said, "Choosing Ireland as the preferred location for this global research
centre
is a significant strategic win for IBM Ireland and IDA Ireland. It enhances
Ireland's reputation globally as a research and development location for
emerging
'Green Technology' investments and is in line with the IDA's strategy of
winning high-value knowledge-based research and development investments from
leading technology companies. It also positions Ireland at the centre of IBM's
emerging business strategy.  This investment by IBM is extremely important for
Ireland, ensuring further diversification of IBM'S Dublin Technology Campus
Operations."

    IBM Water Management Milestones

    IBM is expanding its water management capabilities around the world. Earlier
this year IBM established a Centre of Excellence for Water Management in
Amsterdam where the primary focus is on flood management and levee systems.
In 2007, IBM announced with The Beacon Institute, New York a
technology-based monitoring and forecasting network for the Hudson River and
estuary.

    In addition to advanced water management capabilities, IBM is focused on
several areas related to energy and the environment, including energy efficient

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) has joined forces with semiconductor process company Tokyo Ohka Kogyo (TOK) (4186.T) to develop more efficient solar power technologies to cut the cost of the clean energy source, the companies said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move is the latest by large technology companies to enter the burgeoning field of photovoltaic solar products, which turn sunlight into electricity without releasing the pollutants that are emitted from coal, oil and nuclear power generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp will contribute its expertise in manufacturing cells, while TOK will bring its technology used in the semiconductor industry and for coating LCD panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership is seeking to create techniques that double the efficiency of thin film solar modules, making them capable of converting more of the sun's rays into electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM Research's Supratik Guha, who leads its solar photovoltaic activities, said the companies do not plan to enter the solar module production business, but hope to license their technology to producers in the next two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've already been in discussions with photovoltaic manufacturers," Guha told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are problems to be resolved," he said, "but this is the time we're starting to talk to them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership will focus on developing new methods for printing copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CIGS) cells that can turn more than 15 percent of sunlight into power -- a significant improvement on the 6 percent to 12 percent efficiency that current solar CIGS makers have achieved in their fabrication plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guha declined to specify the companies' projected sales from the technology that will come from their link-up, but described the potential market as "huge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, an estimated 90 percent of photovoltaic solar equipment uses silicon to turn sunlight into electricity. That technology is more efficient than CIGS, often converting more than 20 percent of sunlight into power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those cells are much thicker than thin-film applications, limiting how they can be deployed, and they rely on silicon, which has skyrocketed in price in recent years as the solar industry gobbled up limited supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM looked into various solar technologies before settling on CIGS, Guha said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Traditional silicon is a very mature field already, the scope for dramatic improvement is probably not there," he said. "We felt that this is where we could make a bigger impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the U.S. Energy Department's National Renewable Energy Laboratory announced in April they had set a new efficiency record of 19.9 percent for CIGS cells, nearing the record for multicrystalline silicon cells of 20.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, no company has yet to near that CIGS record on the factory floor, where cells must be quickly mass produced in a cost effective manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guha said the goal of the partnership was to create a process for making the cells cheaply enough that they reach "grid parity," the level in which solar power is competitive with traditional forms of electricity generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that if we can get to a module cost of less than $1 per watt, and be able to keep a handle on the system costs, then one should be able to get to grid parity ... photovoltaics still need roughly a 2 (times efficiency) improvement," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We strongly feel that we have a shot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily; Editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life/ware simplifies life for the fictional Elias family and
educates visitors about the potential and possibilities for their own
digital homes.
ANAHEIM, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Life/ware(TM) is excited to announce its participation in the new
Innoventions Dream Home at the Disneyland Resort, a technology
showcase built in partnership with Disney, Microsoft, HP and
homebuilder Taylor Morrison.

   Life/ware brings the home to life to provide the fictional Elias
family with entertainment anywhere in the Home; to recognize each
member of the Elias family as he or she enters a room and tailors it
to reflect personal preferences; and to help the house run more
efficiently with the rhythm of the Elias family's everyday life.
Life/ware showcases a variety of existing products and emerging
technologies within Dream Home, enabling guests to interact with each
piece and imagine how technology might enhance digital living
experiences in their own homes.

   "The Innoventions Dream Home will introduce Disneyland guests to
an incredibly intuitive technology from Life/ware that can enhance
their lives today, while providing them a glimpse of what they may
find in their homes in the future," says Bret Fitzgerald, Life/ware's
vice president of marketing. "Life/ware is best understood when
experienced and Dream Home is the perfect showcase for millions of
Disneyland guests each year to experience our products first-hand and
show how Life/ware can change their lives."

   Life/ware is a unique digital control solution that runs on the
Windows Media Center platform. Much more than the sum of its hardware
and software parts, Life/ware represents a lifestyle where technology
works with a user to accommodate his or her every need. Life/ware
represents a breakthrough in terms of how people interact with
technology to enhance everyday life and conveniences. From
personalized in-room settings to lighting, music and home theater
solutions, Life/ware allows a user to build a digital home one step at
a time, all while providing a simple and intuitive way to manage and
integrate everything.

   In the Dream Home, Disneyland guests interact with members of the
Elias family as they use the home's technology to prepare for a big
celebration. Life/ware responds to individual members of the Elias
family as they enter and exit the rooms of the Home. In the Great Room
for example, using RFID (radio frequency identification) technology,
Life/ware automatically triggers pictures on the walls, cues up music
and adjusts the lighting and temperature to meet the preferences of
the particular family member who enters the room.

   With powerful new technologies from a wide variety of partners,
Dream Home designers turned to Life/ware, the only platform capable of
seamlessly integrating so many systems and devices into one unified
experience.

   Life/ware controls a performance-grade DMX lighting system in the
home, complete with Lutron dimmer switches shades. RFID tags worn by
the family trigger custom Life/scenes in each room - adjusting the
music selection, volume, lighting - even the photos on the
Life/ware-controlled digital picture frames. A MediaMatrix NION
distributed audio system, Panasonic security cameras, even the pergola
fountain are all controlled by Life/ware. Life/point touch panels and
Life/media media servers ensure that the Life/ware experience is
available to the Elias family and Disneyland guests all throughout the
home.

   In the Party Tent out back, Life/ware powers the karaoke
experience, complete with stage lighting, virtual backgrounds and
automated souvenir snapshots. More than anything else, the home shows
how powerful technologies can be brought together, and implemented
with grace through the simple addition of Life/ware to a home.

   "Dream Home lets consumers experience just how Life/ware makes a
home fun, interactive and entertaining," said Fitzgerald. "Life/ware
brings the 'today' to Dream Home because our product is available now
and can be implemented immediately to change the way people live at
home."

&lt;p&gt;June 16 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded

macro economic front and its strategic direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage lowered its 2009 earnings forecast for the
company to $2.30 a share from $2.42 to reflect challenges in
the operating environment, mainly in the real-estate and
aviation aftermarket.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Yahoo Inc turned down the latest offer from Microsoft Corp this week, it walked away from $9 billion in cash and $1 billion a year in additional operating profit, Microsoft said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an e-mail to employees, Microsoft platforms and services division president Kevin Johnson said it had offered $8 billion for a 16 percent stake in Yahoo and $1 billion to buy Yahoo's search business and assume its operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal also included a revenue-sharing partnership that would have delivered $1 billion a year in additional operating income to Yahoo due in part to a three-year guarantee of better rates for advertisements tied to its search results than Yahoo's current Panama advertising system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's most recent offer was an alternative to its previous full acquisition proposal. Instead, Yahoo entered an advertising agreement with Google Inc on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, a dominant force in desktop software but a laggard in online search advertising, is still open to discussing its alternative proposal despite Yahoo's partnership with Google, a source familiar with Microsoft's thinking said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo had no comment. Microsoft spokesman Jeff O'Mara declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another source familiar with the matter said Microsoft had proposed a 10-year exclusive deal to handle Yahoo's search advertising and only guaranteed higher advertising rates for three of those years. Johnson's e-mail did not mention the duration of the deal, only saying it was "long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Yahoo's deal with Google, which will pit the two companies' ads against each other in an auction, is non-exclusive. It means other companies can join in the auction to bid to place ads next to Yahoo's search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately Yahoo has chosen a different course, and yesterday announced an agreement that would start to consolidate over 90% of the paid search advertising market in Google's hands," said Johnson in the e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will make the market far less competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal with Google would boost Yahoo's cash flow by $250 million to $450 million in the first 12 months, according to Yahoo. It would be less than half of Microsoft's forecast for $1 billion in additional operating income, the source familiar with Microsoft's thinking said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A BETTER DEAL?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its proposal would have delivered $1 billion of incremental operating income to Yahoo because it would reduce Yahoo's operating costs for running search and the company would receive large payments in the form of so-called traffic acquisition costs (TAC) from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo would also not have to make hefty research and development investments for search, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the surface, it looks like a better deal," Gartner analyst David Mitchell Smith said of Microsoft's search deal proposal for Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith cautioned, however, that there may have been issues not revealed publicly that made the Google deal a better option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft abandoned its offer to buy all of Yahoo in May as negotiations dragged on, making it unlikely that a deal could complete regulatory review during the Bush administration, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the full acquisition could not get approval by year-end, the review process could have carried on until as late as October 2009, meaning that Microsoft would have to carry the capital risk of a $40-billion-plus acquisition for 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also became less interested in a full acquisition after Yahoo's search share continued to deteriorate more than Microsoft had forecast, the source said. A lucrative severance agreement put in place by Yahoo's management also made a full acquisition less appealing, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft structured its alternate proposal to focus solely on search to take into account Yahoo's concerns that combining the two companies' e-mail and instant messaging users would not gain regulatory approval, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft closed up 83 cents, or 2.94 percent, at $29.07 on the Nasdaq, while Yahoo closed down 5 cents, or 0.21 percent, at $23.47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michele Gershberg in New York, Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - U.S. banks may need to raise $65 billion of additional capital to cope with mounting losses from a global credit crisis that will not peak until 2009, Goldman Sachs  Co (GS.N) analysts said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new capital would be on top of $120 billion already raised by the industry, analysts led by Richard Ramsden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Banks will not turn until a peak in credit costs is in sight," the analysts wrote. "Moreover, weaker banks are unlikely to benefit from consolidation as bank deals always slow when credit is deteriorating and larger banks are hamstrung by their own problem assets as well as accounting requirements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it lowered its price targets for 14 banking companies and cut its 2008 earnings-per-share forecasts for 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the banks for which Goldman cut both are BBT Corp (BBT.N), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N), SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N), U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also lowered its price targets for Wachovia Corp WB.N and Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N), and its earnings outlook for Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trading, the 24-member KBW Bank Index .BKX was down 3.2 percent, while the 50-member KBW Regional Bank Index .KRX dropped 2.6 percent. These contributed to declines in broader market indexes as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zions Bancorp (ZION.O), a Salt Lake City-based bank, fell as much as 12.8 percent after projecting higher nonperforming assets and saying weakness in residential construction and land values in the U.S. Southwest should persist into 2009. Goldman also cut Zions' price target and earnings forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenders have raised capital to help combat a surge in problem loans. Among those to raise the most were Citigroup Inc (C.N), Wachovia, Washington Mutual and National City Corp NCC.N, which this year each raised at least $7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problem loans were once concentrated in subprime mortgages. They have, however, been spreading to other types of lending, including prime mortgages, home equity loans, commercial real estate and construction loans, auto loans and credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANKS SET ASIDE $86 BILLION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman analysts estimated that U.S. banks and thrifts have set aside $86 billion for loan losses in the three quarters since the credit crisis began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said the weak housing market drove the deterioration and that home prices will likely keep falling all year. It expects credit losses to peak in the first quarter of 2009, when the rate of charge-offs may be 46 percent higher than a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worries about credit losses have driven down banks' share prices. This has caused paper losses for many investors who infused capital into the industry, including many private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of this capital has come from offerings of common stock or convertible preferred shares. Goldman said further attempts to raise capital may prove even more costly for shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Capital raising becomes harder," the analysts wrote. "Only four out of 42 deals we track are in-the-money so far. This will make the next round of deals harder and more expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Monday, the KBW bank and regional bank indexes were down a respective 23.7 percent and 21 percent this year. The Standard  Poor's 500 index .SPX was down 7.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon, Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Tuesday quarterly earnings fell 11 percent as market turmoil hit trading and slowed investment banking, yet the firm again exceeded expectations by avoiding major losses on assets slammed by the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than a year, banks have been grappling with the challenges of a new world where profit engines such as mortgages, buyout finance and commercial real estate seized up. Goldman anticipated the changes earlier its rivals and was more aggressive in reducing exposure to hard-hit assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Goldman earnings fell for a second straight quarter, but not as much as its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have an uncanny ability to stay out of trouble," said Thomas Russo, portfolio manager at Gardner Russo  Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter ended May 30, net income at the largest U.S. investment bank fell to $2.09 billion, or $4.58 a share, from $2.33 billion, or $4.93, a year earlier. The results beat the average analyst forecast of $3.42 by a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net revenue fell 7 percent to $9.42 billion in a period that included the March panic that drove Bear Stearns into the ground and handed Lehman Brothers LEH.N a $2.8 billion loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth in equity underwriting, mergers and prime brokerage let Goldman beat forecasts, despite $775 million in write-downs and hedging losses. Goldman generated a surprisingly high 20 percent return on equity even as Merrill Lynch MER.N and Lehman executives forecast years of muted profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They benefited from the disruption at the other investment banks," said Rose Grant, who helps manage $2 billion for Boston's Eastern Investment Advisors. "In tough times, people tend to gravitate toward the stronger financial firms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares, which had rallied 12 percent during the past week, were little changed in early afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH SLEDDING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since credit and mortgage markets broke down last year, the world's banks and brokers have been forced to write down assets by more than $400 billion. The bursting of the credit bubble so far has led to 60,000 job losses and the ouster of senior executives at six of the world's largest banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of easy credit also has slowed the pace of leveraged buyouts, mergers and public stock offerings. For stronger firms like Goldman, the environment led to new business helping companies raise capital and restructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the recent market environment, Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said markets remained treacherous. He estimated the credit crisis had probably moved past the halfway mark, yielding an environment that right now is "less stressed" than previous months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly, the first weeks of March were the bottom, at least up to now," Viniar told reporters in a briefing. "Now there is less concern about systemic liquidity risk. People are focused on individual investments and credit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar also observed that Goldman has reduced its exposure to hard-hit assets, such as leveraged loans, at the same time it is scouring the market snapping up bad loans and other distressed assets at discounts. Goldman in the quarter reduced its balance sheet by 8 percent to just under $1.1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our performance through the last several quarters leaves us well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise," he told analysts in a later conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rivals are busy pulling in their horns, Goldman has increased risk-taking. Value at risk, a measure for what it could lose in one day, rose 17 percent to $184 million from the first quarter, fueled by interest-rate derivatives and commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Goldman proved it is not immune from the problems caused by a market breakdown now in its second year. The firm absorbed $775 million of losses from credit products, including $500 million of losses on ineffective hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter revenue from fixed-income trading, normally Goldman's largest business, fell 29 percent to $2.38 billion. Revenue from trading interest rates, currencies and mortgages helped offset a steep drop in credit products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which reports its quarterly results on Wednesday, saw its shares fall 4 percent in afternoon trading amid worries the No. 2 U.S. investment bank will suffer bigger losses than Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GROWTH AREAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Goldman businesses fared better. Equity trading revenue was little changed, but was the quarter's biggest contributor at $2.49 billion. Robust client buying and selling offset a weak quarter in the firm's internal hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking revenue fell 2 percent to $1.69 billion, reflecting the sharp downturn in bond and loan underwriting, but stock issuance fees were the highest in eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merger and acquisition fees rose 13 percent, as Goldman remained the top advisor worldwide so far this year, yet the backlog of pending investment banking fees fell during the quarter amid a slowdown of announced deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asset management revenue rose 10 percent to $1.16 billion as funds under management swelled by $22 billion to $895 billion, including $6 billion of new client money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from securities services, which includes prime brokerage services for hedge funds, soared 29 percent to a record $985 million, in part as disruptions at rival banks such as Bear Stearns attracted new accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Principal investments revenue fell 7 percent to $725 million of revenue, including a $214 million gain on its Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's compensation and other expenses also fell more than expected, as the firm reduced headcount by 1 percent to 31,495. It paid a lower income tax rate as more profit came from outside the United States, savings that accounted for about a third of the margin by which Goldman beat its estimates this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank reaffirmed it expects to increase employees this year by low single-digit percentage rates at a time Wall Street is slashing jobs. Goldman is aggressively expanding in Asia and other fast-growing regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares were down 21 cents at $181.88 in afternoon trading. The stock has fallen about 15 percent this year, outperforming a 20 percent drop in the Amex Securities Broker Dealer index .XBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Dan Wilchins; Editing by Andre Grenon, Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has slashed its exposure to hard-hit leveraged loans and mortgages, letting it jump on distressed opportunities now emerging in the market, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have been focused on strengthening our capital and liquidity levels while simultaneously right-sizing troubled asset classes, such as leveraged loans," he told reporters in a briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has cut funded and unfunded leveraged-buyout loan exposure to $14 billion from a peak of $52 billion last August, when investors suddenly balked at the easy terms and low rates brokers were offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recently announced sale of Alltel by investors including Goldman Sachs' private equity arm to Verizon Wireless reduced that exposure further to $11 billion, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise Goldman shed residential mortgage securities, which sparked the broader credit crisis last summer, to about $15 billion on Goldman's balance sheet from $19 billion at the end of February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's holdings of "prime" mortgages dropped the most, to $8.5 billion at the end of May from $12.2 billion in February. Exposure to Alt-A loans, which require less documentation from borrowers, and "subprime" mortgages were little changed at about $5 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile commercial mortgages, another troubled area as the U.S. economy weakens, were reduced to $17 billion from $19.4 billion during the quarter. Viniar said virtually everything sold for more than their marked-down values on Goldman's books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUYING SPREE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Viniar stressed that Goldman is also actively adding assets, using its balance sheet to pick up bargains in markets when many investors remain stuck to the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman deployed capital from distressed investment funds as well as from its own balance sheet to pick up sour bank loans, mortgages and other securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the residential market, particularly, we make active markets. So while there was a net reduction of about $4 billion, multiples of that were bought and sold during the quarter," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar's comment about increased trading activity, combined with Lehman's recent disclosure that it sold $147 billion of assets during the second quarter, offers some signs that frozen debt markets are starting to thaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It feels like from a credit market point of view, we're a ways through what happened. I think there's a lot (of the crisis) behind us. There is less to come than there was," said Viniar, who declined to guess how long the crisis would last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly, the first weeks of March were the bottom, at least up to now. Right now there is less concern about systemic illiquidity risk. People are focused on individual investments and credits," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a better tone, in that way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market movement also helped Goldman reduce the scale of its level 3 assets -- a designation for real estate, investments and other rarely-traded assets that don't have a reliable market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said Goldman's level 3 assets fell to $78 billion, or 7 percent of total assets at the end of May, from $96 billion at the end of February. About half the decrease represents asset sales, with the remainder upgraded to level 2, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEH.N shares dropped 7.6 percent on Tuesday, as earnings from rival Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) showed how difficult the future could be for Lehman, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman said on Tuesday that its second fiscal quarter earnings fell 11 percent. On Monday, Lehman said it lost $2.8 billion in the fiscal quarter ended May 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Goldman's stronger areas were commodities and currencies trading, which make up a smaller portion of Lehman's business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A few markets where Lehman is stronger just aren't doing as well," said Bill Fitzpatrick, an analyst covering financial stocks at Optique Capital Management, which does not own Lehman shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman shares fell $2.06 to close at $25.14 on Tuesday, and have fallen about 60 percent this year. The stock trades at less than 0.8 percent of its book value, implying that investors see more write-downs ahead for the bank, even after the $3.7 billion of write-downs it recorded on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial stocks broadly fell on Tuesday, with Goldman dropping 1.46 percent and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) down 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley will report earnings on Wednesday. On days when brokerage stocks have fallen in recent months, Lehman has tended to decline the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Lehman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dan Wilchins, editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs had more trading risk in the second quarter, but earned less trading revenue, in a reflection of how difficult it is for even the best regarded investment banks to generate earnings growth now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's value-at-risk, a measure of trading risk known as "VaR," rose 38 percent in the second quarter from the same quarter last year. That meant the bank had maximum potential losses of $184 million on 95 percent of the trading days in the quarter, up from $133 million a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, trading revenue fell 16 percent from a year ago. It was Goldman's second straight quarter of higher VaR and lower trading revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That raised the eyebrows of some analysts and risk management experts, who wondered if Goldman is getting fully compensated for the risks it takes by trading on behalf of clients or for its own account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's dangerous for Goldman Sachs, because eventually, they're going to get it wrong. They're not omnipotent," said Christopher Whalen, managing director at Institutional Risk Analytics, a risk management advisory firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a conference call that VaR rose because the investment bank reduced its positions, but its existing positions became riskier as markets fluctuated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the rise in VaR compared with the trading results, Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag said on Tuesday: "I don't think one should read anything into it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And investors generally seem less concerned about risk at Goldman than at other banks. Goldman trades at about 1.8 times its book value, or the accounting value of its assets minus liabilities, while Lehman Brothers trades below book value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, the largest U.S. investment bank, is the only major broker that has not recorded a single quarterly loss during this credit crunch, a feat investors ascribe to its superior trading and risk management abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And VaR is a crude measure of risk, in part because it assumes returns follow a bell curve, which for many instruments is an invalid assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VaR accounts for Goldman's risk from both client trades and positions the investment bank takes with its own funds. Higher VaR does not necessarily mean Goldman is taking more trading risk with its own funds. If client trading is responsible for much of Goldman's value at risk, the investment bank may be using its relative strength to win market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But caveats aside, having a higher VaR and lower trading returns does send up a warning flag, investors said. Even if Goldman does not post a big loss from trading, it could have more trouble generating earnings growth from the area, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not a good thing. At the end of the day, while Goldman Sachs has performed well through tough periods, there's no guarantee that will continue," said James Ellman, president at hedge fund Seacliff Capital, which does not own Goldman shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Richard Mably in London)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Zions Bancorp (ZION.O), which operates banks throughout the western United States, fell more than 9 percent on Tuesday after Goldman Sachs cut its price target on the stock to $39 from $47.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman also cut its outlook for Zions' earnings per share to $3.05 from $4.00 for 2008 and to $4.10 from $4.75 for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandler O'Neill also lowered its 12-month price target to $40 from $47 and rates the shares "hold," indicating an expectation that the shares will underperform peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock was down $3.58 to $33.58 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an investor presentation filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Zions said it sees slow loan growth in California, Arizona and Nevada. In addition, weakness in residential construction activity and land values in the U.S. Southwest are seen persisting into 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But loan growth in other areas, including Texas, was said to be "relatively strong," according to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has seen its provisions for loan losses rise over the past two quarters, and indicated that these costs could continue to take a toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the investment side, Zions indicated $1.5 billion of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) it had held as "available for sale" were now being held to maturity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is a different accounting method for investments held this way, Chief Financial Officer Doyle Arnold said in a statement that he saw "no immediate impact on earnings, (accounting) or regulatory capital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unrealized pre-tax losses from these investments, with a fair value of $1.227 billion as of April 30, were recorded in the first quarter, and the bank expects the difference to be earned back over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a visit with Zion management, Sandler O'Neill said it does not expect the bank to need to do a large, dilutive capital raise, and sees its exposure to the credit crisis as largely limited to residential-related areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However Utah, where Zions is based, is now feeling more of the effects of the real estate downturn, Sandler O'Neill analyst R. Scott Siefers said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by John Wallace, Gunna Dickson, Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail on risk, tax savings)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
said on Tuesday quarterly earnings fell 11 percent as market
turmoil hit trading and slowed investment banking, yet the firm
again exceeded expectations by avoiding major losses on assets
slammed by the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For more than a year, banks have been grappling with the
challenges of a new world where profit engines such as mortgages,
buyout finance and commercial real estate seized up. Goldman
anticipated the changes earlier its rivals and was more aggressive
in reducing exposure to hard-hit assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result, Goldman earnings fell for a second straight
quarter, but not as much as its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have an uncanny ability to stay out of trouble," said
Thomas Russo, portfolio manager at Gardner Russo  Gardner in
Lancaster, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the second quarter ended May 30, net income at the largest
U.S. investment bank fell to $2.09 billion, or $4.58 a share, from
$2.33 billion, or $4.93, a year earlier. The results beat the
average analyst forecast of $3.42 by a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net revenue fell 7 percent to $9.42 billion in a period that
included the March panic that drove Bear Stearns into the ground
and handed Lehman Brothers LEH.N a $2.8 billion loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Growth in equity underwriting, mergers and prime brokerage let
Goldman beat forecasts, despite $775 million in write-downs and
hedging losses. Goldman generated a surprisingly high 20 percent
return on equity even as Merrill Lynch MER.N and Lehman
executives forecast years of muted profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They benefited from the disruption at the other investment
banks," said Rose Grant, who helps manage $2 billion for Boston's
Eastern Investment Advisors. "In tough times, people tend to
gravitate toward the stronger financial firms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares, which had rallied 12 percent during the past
week, were little changed in early afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOUGH SLEDDING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since credit and mortgage markets broke down last year, the
world's banks and brokers have been forced to write down assets by
more than $400 billion. The bursting of the credit bubble so far
has led to 60,000 job losses and the ouster of senior executives
at six of the world's largest banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lack of easy credit also has slowed the pace of leveraged
buyouts, mergers and public stock offerings. For stronger firms
like Goldman, the environment led to new business helping
companies raise capital and restructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reflecting on the recent market environment, Goldman Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said markets remained treacherous.
He estimated the credit crisis had probably moved past the halfway
mark, yielding an environment that right now is "less stressed"
than previous months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly, the first weeks of March were the bottom, at least
up to now," Viniar told reporters in a briefing. "Now there is
less concern about systemic liquidity risk. People are focused on
individual investments and credit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar also observed that Goldman has reduced its exposure to
hard-hit assets, such as leveraged loans, at the same time it is
scouring the market snapping up bad loans and other distressed
assets at discounts. Goldman in the quarter reduced its balance
sheet by 8 percent to just under $1.1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our performance through the last several quarters leaves us
well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities as they
arise," he told analysts in a later conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While rivals are busy pulling in their horns, Goldman has
increased risk-taking. Value at risk, a measure for what it could
lose in one day, rose 17 percent to $184 million from the first
quarter, fueled by interest-rate derivatives and commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Goldman proved it is not immune from the problems
caused by a market breakdown now in its second year. The firm
absorbed $775 million of losses from credit products, including
$500 million of losses on ineffective hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second-quarter revenue from fixed-income trading, normally
Goldman's largest business, fell 29 percent to $2.38 billion.
Revenue from trading interest rates, currencies and mortgages
helped offset a steep drop in credit products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which reports its quarterly results on
Wednesday, saw its shares fall 4 percent in afternoon trading amid
worries the No. 2 U.S. investment bank will suffer bigger losses
than Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GROWTH AREAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other Goldman businesses fared better. Equity trading revenue
was little changed, but was the quarter's biggest contributor at
$2.49 billion. Robust client buying and selling offset a weak
quarter in the firm's internal hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banking revenue fell 2 percent to $1.69 billion,
reflecting the sharp downturn in bond and loan underwriting, but
stock issuance fees were the highest in eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merger and acquisition fees rose 13 percent, as Goldman
remained the top advisor worldwide so far this year, yet the
backlog of pending investment banking fees fell during the quarter
amid a slowdown of announced deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asset management revenue rose 10 percent to $1.16 billion as
funds under management swelled by $22 billion to $895 billion,
including $6 billion of new client money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue from securities services, which includes prime
brokerage services for hedge funds, soared 29 percent to a record
$985 million, in part as disruptions at rival banks such as Bear
Stearns attracted new accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Principal investments revenue fell 7 percent to $725 million
of revenue, including a $214 million gain on its Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's compensation and other expenses also fell more than
expected, as the firm reduced headcount by 1 percent to 31,495. It
paid a lower income tax rate as more profit came from outside the
United States, savings that accounted for about a third of the
margin by which Goldman beat its estimates this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank reaffirmed it expects to increase employees this year
by low single-digit percentage rates at a time Wall Street is
slashing jobs. Goldman is aggressively expanding in Asia and other
fast-growing regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares were down 21 cents at $181.88 in
afternoon trading. The stock has fallen about 15 percent this
year, outperforming a 20 percent drop in the Amex Securities
Broker Dealer index .XBD.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - U.S. banks may need to raise $65 billion of additional capital to cope with mounting losses from a global credit crisis that will not peak until 2009, Goldman Sachs  Co analysts said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new capital would be on top of $120 billion already raised by the industry, analysts led by Richard Ramsden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Banks will not turn until a peak in credit costs is in sight," the analysts wrote. "Moreover, weaker banks are unlikely to benefit from consolidation as bank deals always slow when credit is deteriorating and larger banks are hamstrung by their own problem assets as well as accounting requirements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it lowered its price targets for 14 banking companies and cut its 2008 earnings-per-share forecasts for 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the banks for which Goldman cut both are BBT Corp (BBT.N), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N), SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N), U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also lowered its price targets for Wachovia Corp WB.N and Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N), and its earnings outlook for Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares of many banks fell on Tuesday. In early afternoon trading, the 24-member KBW Bank Index .BKX was down 2.4 percent, while the 50-member KBW Regional Bank Index .KRX dropped 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zions Bancorp (ZION.O), a Salt Lake City-based bank, fell as much as 12.8 percent after projecting higher non-performing assets and saying weakness in residential construction and land values in the U.S. southwest should persist into 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also cut Zions' price target and earnings forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenders have raised capital to help combat a surge in problem loans. Among those to raise the most were Citigroup Inc (C.N), Wachovia, Washington Mutual and National City Corp NCC.N, which this year each raised at least $7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problem loans were once concentrated in subprime mortgages. They have, however, been spreading to other types of lending, including prime mortgages, home equity loans, commercial real estate and construction loans, auto loans and credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANKS SET ASIDE $86 BILLION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman analysts estimated that U.S. banks and thrifts have set aside $86 billion for loan losses in the three quarters since the credit crisis began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said the weak housing market drove the deterioration and that home prices will likely keep falling all year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worries about credit losses and driven down banks' stock prices, causing paper losses for many investors who infused capital into the industry, including many private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of this capital has come from offerings of common stock or convertible preferred shares. Goldman said further attempts to raise capital may prove even more costly for shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Capital raising becomes harder," the analysts wrote. "Only four out of 42 deals we track are in-the-money so far. This will make the next round of deals harder and more expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Monday, the KBW bank and regional bank indexes were down a respective 23.7 percent and 21 percent this year. The Standard  Poor's 500 index .SPX was down 7.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman says banks may need to raise another $65 bln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Volatile oil prices keep investors nervous
 (Updates to early afternoon)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Deborah Jian Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday
as Goldman Sachs warned that banks may need to raise an
additional $65 billion, stoking worries about further fallout
from the mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said the global credit crisis will not peak until
2009 and lowered its price targets for 14 banking companies. It
also cut 2008 earnings-per-share forecasts for 11 banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Bank of America (BAC.N), whose target price was
cut by Goldman, tumbled 2.5 percent and were the biggest drag
on the SP 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The warning on the outlook for banks offset the market's
upbeat reaction to Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) release of
its own quarterly earnings, which exceeded Wall Street
expectations even though they were down 11 percent from a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is unlikely to go higher without participation
from financial stocks. You have funding and write-down issues
with the financials," said Subodh Kumar, chief investment
strategist at Subodh Kumar  Associates in Toronto, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 75.96
points, or 0.62 percent, to 12,193.12. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX slipped 5.13 points, or 0.38 percent, to
1,355.01. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 8.53 points,
or 0.34 percent, to 2,466.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP financial index .GSPF fell nearly 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Bank of America (BAC.N), the No. 2 U.S. bank,
were down 68 cents at $29.63. after Goldman cut the bank's
profit forecast. For details, see [ID:nN17335525]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also lowered its price targets on Wachovia Corp
WB.N and Washington Mutual (WM.N). Wachovia shares slid 3.9
percent, and WaMu shares skidded 5.0 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volatile oil prices added to the negative tone on Wall
street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Oil is an enormous headwind," said Peter Kenny, managing
director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey. "You see the conversation going from oil to the
agriculture/commodity space and that's dominated by corn, with
the floods in the Midwest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude .CLc1 see-sawed, rising above $134 a barrel
before falling back to $133.34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of travel services and credit card company American
Express (AXP.N) weighed on the Dow, dropping more than 3
percent to $43.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Nasdaq, shares of Adobe Systems (ADBE.O) dropped almost
3 percent to $41.64, a day after the design software maker
offered a revenue outlook that disappointed investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the economic front, a government report showed a
higher-than-expected reading in overall producer prices in May,
but the data also showed that the core Producer Price Index,
which excludes volatile food and energy prices, moderated as
economists had forecast. [ID:nN17336776].

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc investors are showing more interest in an alternate board slate proposed by billionaire Carl Icahn that was first formed to deliver the company to Microsoft Corp in a now-defunct buyout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft out of the picture, it is not clear whether Icahn will reshape his proxy fight. But several investors say they would be willing to back some or all of his nine board nominees at a shareholder meeting on August 1, at the very least to show disappointment over the failed talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, investors are citing a hybrid option that would put several of Icahn's candidates on the board to act as watchdogs, while preserving many of Yahoo's existing stewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Nelson, a partner at Mithras Capital, which owns about 1.7 million Yahoo shares, said he would back Icahn's entire slate unless the current board took a dramatic about-face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe a truly independent board is what's needed at Yahoo and not one that has these obviously deep and emotional connections to the company," Nelson told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo could show good faith by having Jerry Yang resign as CEO and get a new person in there. In that scenario, a modified slate would make more sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second shareholder, who asked to remain anonymous, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He should go ahead," the investor said. "It's an indicator of the widespread dissatisfaction of shareholders with Yahoo's management and the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If nothing else, (it's) to keep them honest and nobody's really sure if Microsoft is completely out of the picture," the investor added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Yahoo's biggest shareholders, including Legg Mason and Capital Research Management, have yet to make their views known on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissident investor Eric Jackson called on Monday on these stakeholders to back a hybrid board with five existing directors and four of Icahn's nominees, since it will now have to steer Yahoo toward organic growth rather than a buyout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want Icahn to win outright, but I am putting forward this 'Third Option' because I fear several large shareholders will worry about the operational abilities of Icahn and his team," Jackson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICAHN STILL WEIGHS OPTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks over Microsoft's $47.5 billion, $33-per-share offer to buy Yahoo fell apart in May. On Thursday, the companies said they failed to reach a smaller deal for Microsoft to take a stake in Yahoo and buy its search business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares have tumbled nearly 12 percent since then to about $23 on Tuesday, with investors who had bet on a Microsoft deal further paring their stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Yahoo forged a search advertising deal with arch rival Google Inc that it estimates will add as much as $450 million in operating cash flow within the first year and will leave it free to pursue other partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo contends it was still open to an outright acquisition by Microsoft, but the partial deal would strip its ability to grow its other online advertising businesses, including display ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn told Reuters on Sunday he was still studying the Google deal, which he said "might have some merit" and looks like a better choice than a partial deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn holds about 59 million shares, or more than 4 percent on Yahoo. He could still change tack and reach a compromise with Yahoo's board to take a handful of seats instead of trying to replace all of its directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors acknowledged a lot could change ahead of the Yahoo shareholder meeting, particularly if new details surface about the potential of the Google deal. But some said their immediate gut reaction is still in Icahn's favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Price, senior portfolio manager at RCM Capital Management LLC, said that, if Icahn tries to work with Yahoo directly, he may succeed in getting one director on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has moved on and Yahoo has moved on, so I'm not sure what an alternative slate would do," said Price, whose firm sold 1.91 million of the Yahoo shares it owned in the first quarter and which owned 18,245 Yahoo shares as of the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe having a director from Icahn, if they view him as looking to benefit the shareholders and bring a sense of urgency to the efforts of Yahoo, I think that would be probably acceptable to Yahoo," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo officials and Icahn had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Muralikumar Anantharaman in Boston, Dane Hamilton in New York and Anupreeta Das in San Francisco)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev abolished visa controls on Tuesday for ex-Soviet citizens in Latvia and Estonia who have not taken up citizenship of the two Baltic States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin decree follows increasing tensions between Moscow and the ex-Soviet republics over the treatment of the Russian-speaking minorities in both countries, many of whom have refused citizenship or been unable to pass new language tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow has repeatedly dismissed EU criticism of its own human rights record by raising the treatment of Russian speakers in the Baltic States, which it says face discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Medvedev accused foreign governments of clamping down on Russian-language media and warned the Kremlin would retaliate, though he did not name any countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the decree, former Soviet citizens residing in Latvia or Estonia can enter and exit Russia without visas on condition they possess either a Latvian non-citizen passport or an Estonian foreign-resident passport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both types of document have been issued to large numbers of Russian-speaking residents in the two Baltic states who do not have citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has a policy of trying to lure back many ethnic Russians who continue to live across the former Soviet Union to help counter its own declining population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Conor Sweeney; Editing by Janet Lawrence)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on Tuesday it earned less from commodities in its latest quarter than the first quarter and described market views of its success in the sector as "way overblown."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The No. 1 U.S. investment bank did not break down profits it made from commodities in the second quarter to May 30. But in financial results released on Tuesday, it indicated that the risk from commodity operations had doubled from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's average daily value-at-risk (VaR) for commodity prices reached $48 million in the second quarter to May 30, up from $38 million in the first quarter and $24 million in the quarter to May 25 last year, the results showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VaR figure sums up the potential loss in value that Goldman's trading positions in commodities may face due to adverse market movements over a one-day time horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's commodity operations, the largest among investment banks, are widely watched by the industry. Goldman was the first to forecast the price of $100 a barrel for crude oil when such levels were far away, and was in the news again recently with a $200-a-barrel forecast for oil over the next 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman's Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said in a conference call that market talk of the firm's commodity trading results in the second quarter was "way overblown".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said results from commodities were weaker in the second quarter than the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar also attributed the rise in the bank's commodities VaR to "greater market volatility and activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman as a group reported an 11 percent drop in second-quarter earnings due to turmoil in financial markets. But the firm again exceeded market expectations by avoiding major losses on assets slammed by the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Barani Krishnan; Editing by Brian Moss)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has completed a long-awaited rescue of a $7 billion structured investment vehicle, the receivers said on Tuesday, paving the way to clear up more troubled mortgage assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal to restructure the SIV, formerly run by British hedge fund Cheyne Capital, comes as Wall Street's biggest investment bank beat expectations by avoiding major losses on assets, though quarterly earnings dropped by 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are delighted ... we are in a position to sign a restructuring agreement in respect of the Cheyne Finance portfolio today," said Neville Kahn, of accountancy firm Deloitte and Touche LLP DLTE.UL, who act as receivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the restructuring, Deloitte will price the assets in the market, selling a minority part of the portfolio to the group of creditors who want to cash out, the parties involved said in an official statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will allow Deloitte to sell the rest of the assets to the remaining creditors -- who have already agreed to reinvest that money in a newly established vehicle set up by Goldman Sachs -- which will hold the rest of the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of the securities is expected to be completed on or about July 17, Deloitte said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other SIVs, including Golden Key, Whistlejacket and Rhinebridge, are expected to follow Cheyne's model, being restructured by Goldman, said Stephen Peppiatt, at Bingham McCutchen, a legal advisor to a Cheyne senior creditor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We thought that Cheyne would be restructured some time ago, it has taken longer, but now there is a template that others will follow," Peppiat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cheyne Capital SIV collapsed last year as the credit crunch hurt the value of its investments in asset-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOB CUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs laid off hundreds of investment bankers last week, people familiar with the situation and recruiters told Reuters on Monday, with one insider saying 25 percent of employees at the vice-president level were let go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts were seen as a reaction to slowing markets and a slump in merger activity in the wake of the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet finalization of the restructuring deal, which was first announced in December, provides a glimmer of hope for the revival of the market in troubled mortgage assets that are at the core of the global credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good news is that we are capable of valuing these assets and that we can move on from this phase to the next one," said Jeroen van den Broek, a credit strategist at ING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIVs ran into trouble last August when liquidity in the credit markets dried up, preventing them from raising funds and also causing the value of their assets -- mainly bank debt and asset-backed securities -- to drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIVs, held by banks, hedge funds or other institutions, issue a mixture of short-term debt and capital to buy longer-term assets, which pay more interest than the amount they pay on their notes.

&lt;p&gt;  STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN, Jun 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Umea University announced today that the most powerful
Windows-based computer in Europe is being installed at the supercomputer
center known as HPC2N. Scientists at HPC2N will use the powerful system --
running on a beta version of Windows HPC Server 2008(R) -- for basic as well as
applied research.

    The computer -- nicknamed "Akka" -- combines IBM Power(R) microprocesors and
Cell
Broadband Engines(R) with new energy-efficient Xeon(R) quad-core processors from
Intel. Akka will be capable of sustained performance of 46 trillion
calculations per second (46 teraflops) and a peak output of 54 teraflops. It
would rank among the 50 fastest supercomputers in the world according to the
current list of the TOP500 Supercomputer Sites (www.top500.org). It is about
3,000 times more powerful than a laptop computer.

    The High Performance Computing Center North (HPC2N) is a consortium of
Universities and research institutes in northern Sweden, housed at Umea
University. It is a member of SNIC, the Swedish Research Council's metacentre
for
high performance computing. Akka will serve as a powerful resource for the
Swedish
academic research community with a range of application areas including
space science, material science, bioinformatics, theoretical physics and
chemistry, engineering sciences, as well as basic research in parallel
algorithms, library software and middleware for grid infrastructure.

    The system runs two operating systems -- Windows and Linux -- in what is
known as a dual-boot design.

    "This new system brings supercomputing to new users and new application
areas," said
Professor Bo Kagstroem at Umea University and director of HPC2N. "This is
the first supercomputer in Sweden with both Linux and Windows operating
systems. It will be very exciting to see how new results can be achieved by
combining and utilizing these different hardware and operating systems."

    "This installation is a good example of how IBM and Microsoft can work
together to enable a wider number of research opportunities with a broader
choice
of operating systems that includes Windows HPC Server 2008 with its
best-in-class performance and high productivity capabilities," said Kyril
Faenov, general manager of the HPC division at Microsoft.

    Energy-conscious supercomputing

    The Umea system requires less electricity to run and cool than other
supercomputer designs that connect clusters of "PC-style" processors. The
system's energy efficient design is a hallmark of a new generation of IBM
hardware designed to couple improved performance with maximum energy efficiency.
It utilizes a compact configuration based on IBM's BladeCenter technology with
powerful low-voltage processors. This allows Akka to perform about 266
million calculations per second per watt (266 megaflops/watt) based on
sustained performance, according to methodology used by the "Green500" list of
the
world's most energy efficient supercomputers
(http://www.green500.org/docs/runrules/runrules.pdf). It would rank as the
most energy-efficient Windows cluster on the current Green500 list
(http://www.green500.org/home.php).

    "IBM is developing all new supercomputer packages to bring
energy-efficientdesigns to new industries," said Dave Jursik, VP of
supercomputer sales
forIBM. "Working with Intel and Microsoft we can create powerful cluster
solutions
that address the growing needs of researchers such as the scientists in
Sweden."

    "The choice of low-power processors and the highly energy-efficient design
of
our new machine room show our commitment to become a green data center," says
Professor Bo Kagstroem.

    "In an increasingly energy conscious environment, where performance must
bedelivered at reduced energy levels Intel's Xeon(R) quad-core processors
deliver the
high performance mandated by supercomputing together with world-class
energy-efficiency," said Christian Morales, EMEA Vice President and General
Manager
of Intel Corporation.

    The new Supercomputer was delivered and implemented by IBM's Business
Partner
Gridcore with expertise in the delivery of high performance computing solutions.

    Technical details

    The system is based on 672 IBM HS21XM Blades which include Intel's
low-voltage
Xeon(R) quad-core, 2.5 GHz, 50-watt processor, with a total of 5,376
processor cores as well as IBM Cell BE-blades and Power6-blades. The system
also includes IBM DS4800 Storage and uses high-speed interconnect InfiniBand and
Ethernet interconnects. Akka posted a Linpack Benchmark performance rating of
46.04
sustained teraflops with 85.6% efficiency using Windows HPC Server 2008.

&lt;p&gt;  BOULDER, CO, Jun 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) officially opened its "greenest" data center in North
America today at its Boulder, Colo., site. The 115,000-square-foot, energy
efficient facility includes 70,000 square feet of raised floor space and is part
of a $350 million investment by the corporation in Boulder to help meet
customer demand worldwide for green data centers, while helping IBM and its
clients reduce energy costs.

    The new data center features numerous leading-edge technologies and
services,
including high density computing systems utilizing virtualization technology,
along with
energy efficient power and cooling technologies. These, in conjunction with the
center's energy efficient design and construction, will allow IBM to reduce
its overall carbon footprint compared to standard data centers.

    Today's opening comes one year after IBM launched Project Big Green,
committing
$1 billion per year to deliver technologies that help customers increase the
level
of energy efficiency in their data centers. Since then, IBM has engaged with
more than 2,000 clients as part of the project, delivering a variety of
hardware,
software and services technologies to help businesses reduce data center
energy consumption and cut energy costs by more than 40 percent by certain
measures.

    With the 70,000-square-foot addition, IBM Boulder expands its hardened
raised
floor operations from approximately 225,000 square feet to nearly 300,000 square
feet.  It is IBM's largest data center location worldwide.

    "This new green data center reflects IBM's leadership in finding
innovativeand environmentally responsible ways to meet our clients' needs, as
well
asour own," said Larry Longseth, IBM Colorado senior state executive and IBM
Boulder senior location executive.  "Boulder is one of the corporation's premier
data
center locations, and it is strategically positioned to help IBM meet its
commitment to maintain its data centers at the highest level of energy
efficiency."

    To build the new data center, IBM retrofitted an existing office building on
the
Boulder campus.  It reused 98 percent of the original building's shell, recycled
65
percent of the materials from the original building, and 25 percent of newly
purchased material came from recycled products.

    The facility will be partially powered by alternative energy sources,
including
more than one million kilowatt hours per year of wind-powered electricity
purchased by
IBM.  This will result in a planned reduction of approximately two million
pounds of carbon dioxide produced per year.

    Given Boulder's geographic location and existing infrastructure reliability,
the site is
an optimal location to leverage energy efficiency. When exterior temperature and
humidity levels are favorable, the new data center's technology switches to
free-cooling mode -- utilizing a water economizer to dramatically reduce energy
consumption.

    Variable-speed pumps and motors were also installed in the air
conditioningsystems to balance the cooling capacities to the actual load.  This
furtherreduces energy usage and costs, and water taps were installed throughout
the
facility, providing flexibility for water-cooled IT equipment -- like the IBM
Power 6 technology -- as well as today's air-cooled profiles.  The center
also uses low-sulfur fuels to reduce emissions from backup generators.

    The facility's mechanical system design is 40 percent more efficient than
one
without heat exchangers for free-cooling, equating to a reduction of
approximately 6,550 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.  Its capacity
is expandable to meet future technology requirements.

    With the strong focus on design and energy efficiency, Boulder qualified for
training incentives from the state of Colorado, investment initiatives from the
city
of Boulder, and rebates from local provider Xcel Energy.

    The expanded data center became fully operational and began boarding clients
in
May 2008.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Zions Bancorp (ZION.O), which operates banks throughout the western United States, fell sharply on Tuesday after Goldman Sachs cut its price target on the stock to $39 from $47.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandler O'Neill lowered its 12-month price target to $40 from $47 and rates the shares "hold," indicating an expectation that the shares will underperform peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock fell $4.46 to $32.70 in late-morning trade on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandler O'Neill said that based on a visit with Zion management, it does not expect the bank to need to do a large, dilutive capital raise, and sees its exposure to the credit crisis as largely limited to residential-related areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Utah, where Zions is based, is now feeling more of the effects of the real estate downturn, Sandler O'Neill analyst R.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Equatorial Guinea will penalize U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) for failing to stop gas flaring in the country, a senior state official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country had also expressed its concern to British gas producer BG Group (BG.L) about "extremely unfair profit" it was making in the small West African gas and oil producer, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon will be penalized because it could not stop flaring," Gabriael Nguema Lima, the vice minister of the Mines, Industry and Energy of Equatorial Guinea said at a conference in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon will be penalized. We will announce it soon. It will be in the press in a month," he told Reuters after his speech to the conference. He did not say what the penalty would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gas flaring produces greenhouse gases, which are blamed for global warming. Equatorial Guinea is ranked tenth in gas flaring in the world, according to the World Bank-backed Global Gas Flaring Reduction (GGFR) initiative and it plans to stop the flaring completely eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lima also said: "The ministry is unhappy about (BG's) windfall profit." Asked if the ministry would take any action, he said, "Nothing. That is just a message."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some oil producing countries have criticized foreign oil firms for not sharing windfall profits from record high prices with producer governments. Some firms have been forced to accept revised profit sharing contracts or give up valuable assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ikuko Kao; editing by James Jukwey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings of Exxon Mobil
Corporation (ExxonMobil):

   --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AAA';

   --Senior Unsecured Debt at 'AAA';

   --Commercial Paper at 'F1+';

   --Short-Term IDR at 'F1+';

   The Rating Outlook is Stable.

   The ratings reflect the unsurpassed depth, breadth, and quality of
ExxonMobil's asset portfolio and strong competitive position in all
parts of the integrated oil chain; its best-in-class operational
performance; disciplined returns-based investment focus; very strong
cash flow generation capability; and historically conservative use of
the balance sheet.

   On the upstream side, the company has a large proven reserve base
of approximately 22.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) and
production of approximately 4.1 million boe per day. ExxonMobil's
latest three-year FD costs were a solid $10.89/boe, while three-year
reserve replacement on an all-in basis was 78% including sales and 95%
excluding sales, as calculated by Fitch. Downstream, ExxonMobil is the
largest refiner in the world, with approximately 6.3 million barrels
per day of refining capacity in 38 refineries located across 21
countries. The marketing arm of the segment sells gasoline and other
fuels at numerous stations worldwide. The company is also a worldwide
leader in the chemicals business, and a significant portion of its
petrochemicals and lubes capacity is integrated with existing refinery
facilities.

   Overall, the upstream component of ExxonMobil provides the bulk of
the company's earnings and cash flow.

   In financial terms, the company's conservative financial strategy
is evident when examining ExxonMobil's balance sheet. As of March 31,
2008, the company had $40.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents,
which exceeded its balance sheet debt of approximately $10 billion by
over four times. ExxonMobil's strong cash flows and very low leverage
translates into among the most robust credit metrics in the industry
and across the corporate sector. For 2007, E debt/proven reserves
(excluding equity reserves and allocating 28% of debt to other
operations) was just $0.52/boe, according to Fitch calculations. As of
March 31, 2008, EBITDA/interest coverage was 76.4 times (x), while
debt/EBITDA was just 0.1x. Free cash flow was $35.2 billion and total
assets were $258.2 billion.

   ExxonMobil is the world's largest publicly traded integrated oil
and gas company with additional interests in petrochemicals and power
generation. The company is active in more than 200 countries and
territories and had a worldwide regular employee count of 80,800 as of
Dec. 31, 2007.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
Published ratings, criteria and methodologies are available from this
site, at all times. Fitch's code of conduct, confidentiality,
conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance and other
relevant policies and procedures are also available from the 'Code of
Conduct' section of this site. The ratings above have been initiated
by Fitch as a service to investors. The issuer did not participate in
the rating process other than through the medium of its public
disclosure.

pointed to a higher market open on Tuesday on news reports that
the Federal Reserve is not likely to lift interest rates soon
and on reassuring earnings results from Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A higher-than-expected reading of overall producer prices
failed to dent the market's gains, with traders focusing
instead on data showing that core inflation, which excludes
volatile food and energy prices, moderated as economists had
forecast. For details, see [ID:nN17336776].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares rose 2.3 percent to $186.32 after the bank
said profit declined but reported earnings per share that
handily topped analysts' estimates. [ID:nWNAS8493]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman has always been one that hasn't been as close to
the (subprime mortgage) trouble as some of the others. But the
story is good and it adds fuel to the argument that the
financial arena is getting back to the business of making
money," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells
Capital Management in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc2 were up 11.5 points, above fair
value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking
into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration
on the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc2 rose 90 points,
and Nasdaq 100 NDc2 futures were up 14 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Futures started the morning in higher territory after both
The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times said market
expectations for a Fed rate hike have been overly aggressive.
The Journal said policy-makers are almost certain to leave
rates unchanged at its meeting next week. [ID:nL17129983]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interest rate hikes are seen as a negative for stocks since
they crimp consumer spending and corporate borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding to relief on Wall Street, oil prices retreated after
touching a fresh high on Monday. The front-month crude contract
CLc1 was down $1.40 at $133.21.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - The cost of protecting
Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) debt with credit default swaps fell on
Tuesday after the investment bank reported
stronger-than-expected earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five-year credit default swaps on Goldman traded around 100

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Tuesday said quarterly earnings fell 11 percent as balky debt markets slowed investment banking activity and eroded trading profit, yet the results were encouraging during the worst environment seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. investment bank reported net income of $2.09, or $4.58 a share, for the fiscal second quarter ended May 31, down from $2.33 billion, or $4.93 a share, a year earlier. Analysts' average forecast was $3.42 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THOMAS RUSSO, PARTNER AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT GARDNER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RUSSO  GARDNER, IN LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have an uncanny ability to stay out of trouble. One of the lessons that has come forth during all this is you can't know whether a bank has trouble ahead. One defense against trouble is corporate culture, and Goldman has shown they have retained a highly unusual degree of discipline in their culture."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN  CO, GREENWICH,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONNECTICUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They continue to do the right thing. They continue to meet expectations and hats off to them. They're doing a brilliant job. They've been the best and continue to shine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JIM PAULSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT WELLS CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MANAGEMENT IN MINNEAPOLIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman has always been one that hasn't been as close to the trouble as some of the others. But the story is good and it adds fuel to the argument that the financial arena is getting back to the business of making money."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has nearly completed a long-awaited rescue of a $7 billion (3.6 billion pound) structured investment vehicle, parties involved said, just as it adjusts to the credit crunch by laying off hundreds of bankers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal to restructure the SIV, formerly run by British hedge fund Cheyne Capital, comes as Wall Street's biggest investment bank is expected to report a 33 percent drop in second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, hurt by a fall in activity in key markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are delighted ... we are in a position to sign a restructuring agreement in respect of the Cheyne Finance portfolio today," said Neville Kahn, a receiver at Deloitte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other SIVs, including Golden Key, Whistlejacket and Rhinebridge, are expected to follow Cheyne's model, being restructured by Goldman, said Stephen Peppiatt, at Bingham McCutchen, a legal advisor to a Cheyne senior creditor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We thought that Cheyne would be restructured some time ago, it has taken longer, but now there is a template that others will follow," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the restructuring, accountancy firm and Cheyne receivers Deloitte will price the assets in the market, Peppiatt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would sell a minority part of the portfolio through an auction, corresponding to the group of creditors who want cash, he said, which would put a price on the assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would allow Deloitte to sell the rest of the assets to the rest of the creditors -- who have already agreed to reinvest that money in a newly established vehicle set up by Goldman Sachs -- which will hold the rest of the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structured investment vehicle or SIV formerly run by hedge fund Cheyne Capital collapsed last year as the credit crunch hurt the value of its investments in asset-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOB CUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs laid off hundreds of investment bankers last week, people familiar with the situation and recruiters told Reuters on Monday, with one insider saying 25 percent of employees at the vice-president level were let go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts were seen as a reaction to slowing markets and a slump in merger activity in the wake of the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet finalisation of the restructuring deal, which was first announced in December, provides a glimmer of hope for the revival of the market in troubled mortgage assets that are at the core of the global credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good news is that we are capable of valuing these assets and that we can move on from this phase to the next one," said Jeroen van den Broek, a credit strategist at ING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the deal, the new vehicle will issue some securities that the senior creditors will buy, giving Goldman Sachs the money to repay the assets that the vehicle bought from the receivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIVs ran into trouble last August when liquidity in the credit markets dried up, preventing them from raising funds and also causing the value of their assets -- mainly bank debt and asset-backed securities -- to drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIVs, held by banks, hedge funds or other institutions, issue a mixture of short-term debt and capital to buy longer-term assets, which pay more interest than the amount they pay on their notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it planned to open a search technology center (STC) in Europe as part of its plan to accelerate investments in Live Search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The location of the STC has not yet been determined, the company said, with several cities being considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The STC will be opened in Microsoft's 2009 fiscal year, starting July 1 this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has sought to increase its presence in online search in a bid to gain ground on market leader Google Inc and Yahoo Inc to create an online advertising powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That effort to gain market share in Web search led to its unsuccessful offer to buy Yahoo for $47.5 billion earlier this year. Yahoo said on Thursday that talks with Microsoft over a smaller deal for its Web search business failed to produce a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft launched a "cashback" search service that pays users a rebate for buying products they found using the company's Windows Live search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily; editing by Rory Channing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - European shares rallied further

Goldman Sachs (GS.N) delivered earnings ahead of forecasts,
which offered some reassurance about the outlook for financials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; U.S. data that showed producer price inflation -- excluding
food and energy costs -- was in line with expectations and
housing starts that fell shy of forecasts, did little to temper
the rally in the European market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 1229 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of top

   "Given the difficult market conditions, we are particularly
pleased to be able to report strong results for the second quarter,"
said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We
continue to benefit from our strong client franchise, a broad and
diverse set of businesses and the deep commitment and experience of
our people. We are realistic about the market challenges we face, but
times of market dislocation also produce opportunities, and we will
continue to take advantage of the most attractive of these as they

Investment Banking
------------------
*T

   Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.69 billion, 2% lower
than the second quarter of 2007 and 44% higher than the first quarter
of 2008.

   Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $800 million, 13% higher
than the second quarter of 2007, reflecting strong client activity.
Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $885 million,
13% lower than the second quarter of 2007, reflecting significantly
lower net revenues in debt underwriting, partially offset by
significantly higher net revenues in equity underwriting. The decline
in debt underwriting was principally due to a decrease in leveraged
finance activity, as market conditions remained challenging. The
increase in equity underwriting reflected strong client activity. The
firm's investment banking transaction backlog decreased during the
quarter. (3)

*T
Trading and Principal Investments
---------------------------------
*T

   Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were
$5.59 billion, 16% lower than the second quarter of 2007 and 9% higher
than the first quarter of 2008.

   Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) were
$2.38 billion, 29% lower than the second quarter of 2007, reflecting
significantly lower results in credit products. Credit products
included a loss of approximately $775 million (including a loss of
approximately $500 million from hedges) related to
non-investment-grade credit origination activities, and lower results
from investments compared with the second quarter of 2007. The
decrease in credit products was partially offset by higher net
revenues in mortgages, which improved from a difficult second quarter
of 2007, as well as higher net revenues in interest rate products,
commodities and currencies. During the quarter, FICC operated in an
environment characterized by solid client activity, generally tighter
corporate credit spreads and volatile markets.

   Net revenues in Equities were $2.49 billion, essentially unchanged
from the second quarter of 2007, as significantly higher net revenues
in the client franchise businesses were offset by significantly lower
net revenues in principal strategies. Commission volumes were strong
and were higher compared with the second quarter of 2007. During the
quarter, Equities operated in an environment generally characterized
by strong client activity and higher equity prices, as well as
continued high levels of volatility.

   Principal Investments recorded net revenues of $725 million for
the second quarter of 2008. These results primarily reflected gains
from corporate principal investments, as well as a $214 million gain
related to the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC).

Asset Management and Securities Services
----------------------------------------
*T

   Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were
$2.15 billion, 18% higher than the second quarter of 2007 and 5%
higher than the first quarter of 2008.

   Asset Management net revenues were $1.16 billion, 10% higher than
the second quarter of 2007, reflecting higher management and other
fees. During the quarter, assets under management increased
$22 billion to $895 billion, due to $16 billion of market appreciation
and $6 billion of net inflows. The increase in assets under management
primarily reflected market appreciation in equity assets and net
inflows in money market and fixed income assets, partially offset by
net outflows in equity assets.

   Securities Services net revenues were $985 million, 30% higher
than the second quarter of 2007, as the firm's prime brokerage
business continued to generate strong results, primarily reflecting
significantly higher customer balances.

Compensation and Benefits
-------------------------
*T

   Compensation and benefits expenses were $4.52 billion, 7% lower
than the second quarter of 2007, commensurate with lower net revenues.
The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 48.0% for
the first half of 2008, consistent with the first half of 2007.
Employment levels decreased 1% during the quarter.

Non-Compensation Expenses
-------------------------
*T

   Non-compensation expenses were $2.07 billion, 11% higher than the
second quarter of 2007 and 6% lower than the first quarter of 2008.
Approximately one-half of the increase compared with the second
quarter of 2007 was attributable to higher brokerage, clearing,
exchange and distribution fees, which principally reflected higher
activity levels in Equities and FICC. The remainder of the increase
compared with the second quarter of 2007 generally reflected the
impact of geographic expansion and growth in employment levels.

Provision for Taxes

   The effective income tax rate for the first half of 2008 was
27.7%, down from 29.5% for the first quarter of 2008 and 34.1% for
fiscal year 2007. The decreases in the effective tax rate were
primarily due to changes in geographic earnings mix.

                                Capital

   As of May 30, 2008, total capital was $226.87 billion, consisting
of $44.82 billion in total shareholders' equity (common shareholders'
equity of $41.72 billion and preferred stock of $3.10 billion) and
$182.05 billion in unsecured long-term borrowings. Book value per
common share was $97.49 and tangible book value per common share was
$85.16 (1), an increase of 5% and 6%, respectively, during the
quarter. Book value and tangible book value per common share are based
on common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted
to employees with no future service requirements, of 427.9 million at
period end.

   The firm repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock at an
average cost per share of $173.85, for a total cost of $203 million
during the quarter. The remaining share authorization under the firm's
existing share repurchase program is 62.4 million shares.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
----------------------------------------------------
*T

   This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within
the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not historical
facts but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future
events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and
outside of the firm's control. It is possible that the firm's actual
results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from
the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these
forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and
important factors that could affect the firm's future results and
financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the
firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2007 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of
the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2007.

   Statements about the firm's investment banking transaction backlog
also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are
subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be
modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net
revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions
may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected.
Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of
a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the
case of underwriting transactions, a decline in general economic
conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities
markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer
of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions,
a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate
financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the
transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For
a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect
the firm's investment banking transactions, see "Risk Factors" in
Part I, Item 1A of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended November 30, 2007 and "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II,
Item 7 of the firm's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended November 30, 2007.

(1) Tangible common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders'
    equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible
    assets, excluding power contracts. Identifiable intangible assets
    associated with power contracts are not deducted from total
    shareholders' equity because, unlike other intangible assets,
    less than 50% of these assets are supported by common
    shareholders' equity. Management believes that return on average
    tangible common shareholders' equity (ROTE) is meaningful because
    it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether
    they were acquired or developed internally. ROTE is computed by
    dividing net earnings (or annualized net earnings for annualized
    ROTE) applicable to common shareholders by average monthly
    tangible common shareholders' equity. Tangible book value per
    common share is computed by dividing tangible common
    shareholders' equity by the number of common shares outstanding,
    including restricted stock units granted to employees with no
    future service requirements.

(3)  The firm's investment banking transaction backlog represents an
     estimate of the firm's future net revenues from investment
     banking transactions where management believes that future
     revenue realization is more likely than not.

(4)  Excludes 4,948, 4,818 and 4,841 employees as of May 30, 2008,
     February 29, 2008 and May 25, 2007, respectively, of
     consolidated entities held for investment purposes. Compensation

(5)  Consolidated entities held for investment purposes are entities
     that are held strictly for capital appreciation, have a defined
     exit strategy and are engaged in activities that are not closely
     related to the firm's principal businesses. For example, these
     investments include consolidated entities that hold real estate
     assets, such as hotels, but exclude investments in entities that
     primarily hold financial assets. Management believes that it is
     meaningful to review non-compensation expenses excluding
     expenses related to these consolidated entities in order to
     evaluate trends in non-compensation expenses related to the
     firm's principal business activities.

     positions due to adverse market movements over a one-day time
     horizon with a 95% confidence level. The modeling of the risk
     characteristics of the firm's trading positions involves a
     number of assumptions and approximations. While management
     believes that these assumptions and approximations are
     reasonable, there is no standard methodology for estimating VaR,
     and different assumptions and/or approximations could produce
     materially different VaR estimates. For a further discussion of
     the calculation of VaR, see Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and
     Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in the firm's Annual
     Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2007.

&lt;p&gt;  SALT LAKE CITY, UT, Jun 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Nicholas &amp; Company is building a model data center that delivers
significantly more computing power per watt.  The Salt Lake City-based, 500
employee,  food distributor has increased its computing capabilities while
holding energy costs level by virtualizing applications, and consolidating
its servers and storage on IBM systems.

    With help from IBM (NYSE: IBM) and IBM Premier Business Partner Vision
Solutions, Nicholas &amp; Company has also added new capabilities and improved the
availability of its information technology infrastructure, and helped protect
vital company assets by installing a world-class backup and recovery system.

    Nicholas &amp; Company, which delivers food and other products to customers
ranging
from the smallest restaurants to the largest national fast-food chains
throughout
the western United States, operates a 24X7, 215,000 square foot facility and
moves up to 600,000 cases of food every week.

    The company chose the IBM BladeCenter(R) H platform as an integral part
of its business, consolidating 12 separate servers on to the platform. IBM
BladeCenter H is an integrated solution designed for consolidation,
virtualization and
top performance. To realize further efficiencies, Nicholas &amp; Company is running
virtualization technology from VMware on IBM HS21 blade servers in the
BladeCenter H.

    "As an independently owned, mid-sized company, Nicholas &amp; Company is focused
on meeting the needs of our clients while operating efficiently. We have
been very happy with the built-in redundancy and energy-efficiency of the
IBM BladeCenter H and expect continued success," said Russell Erickson, Nicholas
&amp;
Company system administrator.

    The company's new data center also uses an IBM System i(TM) 525 that
provides
storage for the BladeCenter system and runs the corporate Web site, intranet,
extranet, the company's email system, and a new voice over Internet
protocol (VoIP) telephone system. The i525 was introduced by IBM one year ago
to help small and medium businesses simplify IT environments. In 2008, IBM
introduced the first of a new generation of IBM Power(TM) Systems that will
provide IBM System i and System p(TM) clients a single, unified line of servers
with simplified pricing, increased application choice and reduced energy and
administration costs.

    IBM's work with Nicholas &amp; Company is an example of how IBM is helping
clients
develop a new enterprise data center, which offers dramatic improvements in IT
efficiency and provides for rapid deployment of new IT services to support
future business growth. IBM is helping clients move to new enterprise data
centers
byfocusing on best practice around virtualization, green IT, service management
and
cloud computing.

    Nicholas &amp; Company is planning for the future by choosing a blade platform
that
can meet its needs for both x86 and i (formerly i5/OS) applications. For clients
with
similar needs, IBM offers an i Edition Express for BladeCenter S, an
attractive option for clients to simplify the integration of their i and x86
applications in one BladeCenter.

    Nicholas &amp; Company also improved its business resiliency, key to maintaining
its reputation for excellent customer service, by migrating its tape-based
systems to iTERA(TM) HA, an innovative business recovery solution developed by
Irvine, California-based Vision Solutions.

    "We used to back up our data overnight on Saturdays.  It took six hours.
That
process has been eliminated," said Erickson.  "Using iTERA HA, we are up
24/7."

    Nicholas &amp; Co. has moved from an estimated recovery time measured in days to
a
continuously available environment with IBM Power Systems, BladeCenter, and
iTERA
HA for logical replication.

    "Critical systems, such as Web access for customers, warehouse management
systems,
and a mobile sales force, demand around-the-clock access. Any delays in the
availability of the core applications can jeopardize the business of
companies like Nicholas &amp; Company causing customers to turn to competitors,"
said Vision Solutions' CTO and Executive Vice President, Alan Arnold. "Our
innovative, affordable and easy-to-use HA brand, Vision's iTERA HA(TM) was built
around the trusted IBM Power Systems Platform and keeps business-critical
information like Nicholas &amp; Company's data continuously protected and
available."

    Yet another benefit is that new application development is now easier
sinceit can be performed in an isolated test environment on a backup server
rather
than on the production server. "Looking ahead, iTERA HA will also help when we
expand: we'll move one of our servers to separate location and use it for
disaster recovery," Erickson explained.

experience. Click here for an interactive brochure on our offerings
specifically designed for the mid market.

&lt;p&gt;Freescale Joins Microsoft's Windows Embedded Partner Program, Accelerating Promotion of Freescale's i.MX Product Development Kit for Windows Embedded CE Based Devices

      Microsoft Becomes Global Platinum Sponsor of the Freescale
                           Technology Forum
ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Developers and designers of devices built on the Windows Embedded
platform can leverage the combined resources of Freescale
Semiconductor and Microsoft(R) to bring smart, connected,
service-oriented devices to market faster.

   Freescale has joined the Windows Embedded Partner Program to
promote i.MX with Windows Embedded Platforms. Additionally,
Microsoft's Windows Embedded Business has become a Global Platinum
sponsor of the Freescale Technology Forum. Freescale brings six
generations of application processor expertise to Windows Embedded CE
based handheld devices, opening the door to entirely new classes of
portable consumer, industrial and general embedded markets.

   Concurrently, Freescale announced wide availability of its i.MX31
Product Development Kit (PDK) based on the Windows Embedded CE 5.0 and
Windows Embedded CE 6.0 operating systems. The integrated modular
design of the i.MX31 PDK enables a more efficient development process
- a critical benefit in the handheld device market. The PDK simplifies
consumer device development with three separate, reusable modules that
work together for streamlined software creation.

   Several Freescale alliance partners offer their technologies based
on i.MX and Windows Embedded CE. The comprehensive ecosystem
supporting i.MX and Windows Embedded CE includes baseline tools,
system integrators, middleware partners and board vendors.

   Portable devices continue to become more connected in the field,
at work and at home. At the same time, OEMs must incorporate a greater
number of complex applications into embedded devices. Devices must
work better together, in league with other devices and technologies.
Meanwhile, device life cycles are shrinking, which means developers
are being asked to do more in less time.

   "Collaborating with Freescale through our Windows Embedded Partner
Program brings together an abundance of resources to the current and
emerging device segments," said Kim Chau, senior partner marketing
manager of the Windows Embedded Business at Microsoft Corp. "The
combination of Windows Embedded CE and the i.MX family of processors
provides OEMs with integrated, low-power, cost-effective solutions
that allow for quicker and easier development of high-quality
devices."

   "Freescale has a strong track record of partnering with Microsoft
on projects since our early collaboration on Windows Embedded CE and
the Dragonball processor family," said Aaron Shagrin, director of the
Multimedia Alliances Network at Freescale. "We are pleased to
officially join the Windows Embedded Partner Program and have
Microsoft as a Global Platinum sponsor of the Freescale Technology
Forum events. At this week's event in Orlando, Freescale will showcase
our i.MX application processors, which take advantage of optimized
Board Support Packages for both Windows Embedded CE 5.0 and Windows
Embedded 6.0 operating systems."

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission, a thorn in Microsoft's (MSFT.O) side for its antitrust campaigns against the software giant, is falling short in its own internal attempt to promote more competition in the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union executive has so far not followed its own policy that it purchase office software and operating systems with open standards as well Microsoft products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the moment we are working in a Microsoft environment," said Christos Ellinides, director of corporate IT solutions and services, who recommends software for the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes noted the Commission's pledge to buy open-standard software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This policy, adopted last year, needs to be implemented with vigor," Neelie Kroes told an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy requires all future procurement should promote software using "open, well-documented standards" that interoperates freely with other software, essentially in desktop and laptop machines. By using open-standard software, the Commission would signal it is practicing what it preaches in terms of injecting more competition into computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellinides said in an interview arranged by a spokeswoman for Commissioner Siim Kallas, who oversees procurement, that studies showed the costs of moving to open source outweighed the benefits. He said it may be time for a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a decision that we will explore the possibility of initiating this study on an institutional basis," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the Commission can already read and send data in open formats, but a lawyer for open-standards groups disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MUICROSOFT REQUIRED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission should be more thorough in following their own policies. I have clients who have complained that the Commission mandates using (Microsoft) Excel spreadsheets in some funding projects," said Carlo Piana, based in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Munich has dumped Microsoft for open-standards desktops and says the transition is going well so far, avoiding being locked in to Microsoft or anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellinides said he plans to talk with Munich representatives this week. Munich Mayor Christian Ude appeared with Kroes when she made her call for open standards. "There is no doubt that open standards strengthen competition," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes and her predecessor, Mario Monti, led the fight to enforce EU antitrust rules against Microsoft, with fines of 1.68 billion euros ($2.58 billion) levied so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key to Microsoft's power is that Office products like Word will not read documents produced in other programs unless special software is added or formatting information is stripped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will change that next year. The Commission says other promises have not been kept and it will wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission last year contracted to pay Microsoft about 4.5 million euros annually until 2011 to provide its 30,000 desktop users with software, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellinides said he would need to talk to the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the Court of Auditors and the Court of Justice before considering any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We like to make sure that economies of scale are taken into account, as opposed to everyone doing their own thing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Quentin Bryar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Elan top percentage gainer, rises on Alzheimer drug trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * All eyes on Goldman results, U.S. inflation data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sitaraman Shankar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - European shares rose in early
trade on Tuesday, lifted by gains in banks and commodity stocks
as investors geared up for results from Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 0831 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top
European shares was up 0.7 percent at 1,270.35 points, little
affected by UK inflation figures that came in higher than
expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miners gained on higher metal prices and a newspaper report
that China's state-owned Chinalco aluminium giant was keen to
buy a range of global resource assets and may consider raising
its stake in global miner Rio Tinto (RIO.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rio rose 2 percent and BHP Billiton (BLT.L) gained 2.5
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Irish drugmaker Elan Corp ELN.I rose 6.4 percent to top
European gainers after it said that an intermediate trial of a
drug for Alzheimer's disease supported an earlier decision to
start final Phase III trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whitbread (WTB.L) rose 3.8 percent after Britain's biggest
hotel and restaurants operator said that like-for-like sales
across its businesses rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks were broadly higher, led by HBOS HBOS.L, which
jumped 5 percent, while Commerzbank (CBKG.DE), Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS.L) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) all rose between
1.7 and 2.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil stocks were also higher, as oil hovered around the $134
a barrel mark. BP (BP.L) gained 1.2 percent and Royal Dutch
Shell rose 1.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But analysts said that they expected equities to fall away
as the year progressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're going to be seeing a dampener, with a nine-month lag
(to the United States)," said Justin Urquhart Stewart,
investment director at Seven Investment Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There will be little upward pressure on equities in the dog
days of summer, and I would expect us to end the year lower than
where we are now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FTSEurofirst 300 has fallen 16 percent so far this year,
taken lower by big writedowns at top banks stemming from a
meltdown in the market for risky U.S. mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE, Germany's DAX
.GDAXI and France's CAC .FCHI rose 0.8 to 0.9 percent. So
far this year, the FTSE has fallen 9.5 percent, faring better
than the DAX and the CAC due to its heavy commodity weighting at
time when oil and metals are surging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But prices continue to be a worry, with data on Tuesday
showing that British consumer price inflation rose more than
expected to a series high of 3.3 percent in May, reinforcing
market expectations of higher UK rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REPORTS ON FED PROVIDE BOOST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stocks were, however, supported by media reports that the
U.S. Federal Reserve was unlikely to raise interest rates in the
next few months unless the inflation outlook worsens, while
speculation that it could hike rates several times this year is
probably overdone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All 15 primary dealers in a Reuters poll earlier this month
said they expected the Fed to leave rates on hold at its June
meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fact that there were three articles in the space of 24
hours shows that it really wants to rein in rate hike
expectations... That's one factor that's buoying stocks as it
eases one pressure that's crimping vulnerable economies," said
Nicola Chadwick, international economist at Commonwealth Bank of
Australia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later in the session, investor focus will shift to results
from Goldman Sachs, U.S. inflation data and Germany's ZEW
sentiment indicator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'd expect Goldman to show a clean pair of heels to the
market -- they've deftly side-stepped the credit crisis and
benefited from the commodities surge," said Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source familiar with the matter said that Goldman was
about to bail out a $7 billion structured investment vehicle run
by Cheyne Capital, boosting hopes that markets for trouble
mortgage assets are easing.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Thursday it planned to open a search technology center (STC) in Europe as part of its plan to accelerate investments in Live Search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The location of the STC has not yet been determined, the company said, with several cities being considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The STC will be opened in Microsoft's 2009 fiscal year, starting July 1 this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has sought to increase its presence in online search in a bid to gain ground on market leader Google Inc and Yahoo Inc to create an online advertising powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That effort to gain market share in Web search led to its unsuccessful offer to buy Yahoo for $47.5 billion earlier this year. Yahoo said on Thursday that talks with Microsoft over a smaller deal for its Web search business failed to produce a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft launched a "cashback" search service that pays users a rebate for buying products they found using the company's Windows Live search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily; editing by Rory Channing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds more details about deal, further comment from
ministry spokesman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Randy Fabi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, June 18 (Reuters) - Nigeria's oil ministry
intervened at the eleventh hour on Wednesday to avert a
potentially crippling strike at U.S. energy giant Chevron
(CVX.N), saying it had persuaded the firm to reduce its
expatriate workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks with senior oil workers' union PENGASSAN, which had
accused Chevron of having too many foreign staff, had broken
down, and an imminent lock-out could have slashed Nigeria's oil
output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron has agreed to remove 70 expatriates in order to
avert the strike," oil ministry spokesman Fidelis Osammor
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron has too many expatriate workers, which does not
help the federal government's local content policy," he said,
adding that he did not know which employees would be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron officials were not immediately available to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fears of another supply disruption in Africa's top oil
producer -- already hobbled by unrest in the Niger Delta and
funding shortfalls at its state oil firm -- helped push U.S.
crude prices CLc1 to more than $136 a barrel on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's output from Nigeria is around 350,000 barrels per
day (bpd), of which its equity share is around 129,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, a strike by an oil workers union at Exxon Mobil's
(XOM.N) unit in Nigeria shut down nearly all that company's
800,000 bpd production in the West African country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria already is producing well below its potential. A
violent campaign of sabotage by militants in the southern Niger
Delta, the heartland of the country's oil industry, has slashed
capacity by around a fifth since early 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron branch of PENGASSAN had been demanding transfer
of the expatriate managing director from Nigeria, accusing him
of violating safety standards, having too many expatriate
staff, and of a lack of respect for Nigerian workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has more than 2,000 workers in Nigeria, of
which 90 percent are Nigerian, according to its Web site.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes dateline from NEW YORK; adds details from paragraph
4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, June 18 (Reuters) - A court battle between
Mexican broadcaster Televisa and its partner Univision
Communications has been postponed until Oct 14, according to a
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies have been sparring in court since 2005,
when Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) filed a lawsuit demanding
royalty payments it said Univision Communications had withheld
as part of a programming deal that expires in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In late April, the two companies had requested a delay in
the trial until July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts believe the postponements could mean the companies
are making an effort to settle outside the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three-year-old legal fight began when Jerrold
Perenchio, former CEO of Univision, made one of his lieutenants
his successor, crushing Televisa's hopes of putting one of its
own at the helm of the U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then, Televisa lost a bid for Univision against a group of
investors led by media tycoon Haim Saban and the Mexican
broadcaster sold its 11 percent stake in Univision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa wants more money from Univision for airing its
shows in the United States, where there is a large, underserved
Latino market that the Mexican media giant wants to tap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa declined comment on Wednesday. Univision was not
immediately available.

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds regional data in paragraph 13) By Hugh Bronstein BOGOTA, June 18 (Reuters) - Colombian cocaine production edged down last year despite an increase in crops used to make the drug, showing that law enforcement efforts have reduced the efficiency of the business, the United Nations said on Wednesday. U.N. investigators said the output in the world biggest cocaine-producing country was 600 tonnes in 2007, down 2 percent from the year before. Planting of coca bushes used to make cocaine meanwhile rose to 99,000 hectares in 2007, up 27 percent from 2006. Farmers are quickly replanting in more remote areas after the government sprays herbicides on their coca fields, part of a multibillion-dollar U.S.-backed program. A record 538,700 acres (218,000 hectares) of coca were eradicated last year. What's happening is that the efficiency of production is going down, said Aldo Lale-Demoz, representative in Colombia for the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. After each eradication, farmers immediately replant somewhere else, he said. That takes time. They go further inside forests. They go further afield from their homes. They will not tend those plots as well as they did before, so the productivity of those secondary lots is much lower. Productivity increased in 2003 through 2005, according to U.N. figures, as traffickers responded to the spraying by looking for ways to produce more cocaine per hectare of coca. If efficiency moved down last year it was only after several years of it moving up, said John Walsh, an analyst with the Washington Office on Latin America. Unfortunately, net production of cocaine in Colombia remains stable and high. Colombian police say they are cracking down on access to chemicals used to make cocaine in secret jungle laboratories, another factor reducing production efficiency. Crime is down in this Andean country under President Alvaro Uribe, a White House ally who was re-elected by a landslide in 2006 and remains popular in part for spurring economic growth. The U.N. report nonetheless calls the sharp increase in coca cultivation a serious and worrisome reversal of previous declines in areas covered by the illegal crops. The United Nations had reported a drop from 166,000 hectares of Colombian coca cultivation in 2000 to about half that amount in 2006. Cocaine output in the Andean region, including Peru and Bolivia, rose 1 percent last year to 994 tonnes. Bolivian production alone shot 11 percent higher to 104 tonnes while coca cultivation regionwide rose 16 percent to 181,600 hectares, the U.N. report said.   (Editing by Todd Eastham)

&lt;p&gt;NRF Welcomes Bipartisan Support of Legislation Requiring Visa and MasterCard to Negotiate Over Hidden Interchange Fee

WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The National Retail Federation today welcomed the addition of
Senator Christopher "Kit" Bond, R-Mo., as a co-sponsor of the Credit
Card Fair Fee Act of 2008, saying the move shows lawmakers in both
parties are increasingly concerned by hidden fees that cost the
average family $427 a year.

   "The addition of Senator Bond to this bill underscores the
bipartisan support for fixing this problem," NRF Senior Vice President
and General Counsel Mallory Duncan said. "Protecting retailers and
their customers from the greed of credit card companies is an issue
that crosses party lines. Congress is hearing more and more often from
their constituents that it's time to do something about a fee that
gives a windfall profit to the credit card industry at a time when the
average American is struggling to pay for groceries and to fill the
tank. The public thinks it's time to do something about these fees,
and members of Congress are responding."

   Bond on Tuesday became the lead co-sponsor of S. 3086, which was
introduced two weeks ago by Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin,
D-Ill. The legislation is a companion measure to H.R. 5546, also named
the Credit Card Fair Fee Act of 2008, introduced by House Judiciary
Committee Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich., and Representative
Christopher Cannon, R-Utah, in March. The Conyers/Cannon bill has a
total of 37 other co-sponsors, including 21 Democrats and 16
Republicans.

   Both the House and Senate measures would require credit card
systems possessing "substantial market power" to negotiate with
merchants to reach a voluntary agreement on credit card terms and
conditions. If an agreement could not be reached, both sides would be
required to submit their final offers to binding arbitration by a
panel of antitrust experts appointed by the Department of Justice and
Federal Trade Commission.

   "The lineup of sponsorship on this legislation - a powerful House
committee chairman and a member of the Senate leadership as sponsors,
and respected, veteran Republican lawmakers as lead co-sponsors -
shows that this is a measure that has substantial weight behind it,"
Duncan said. "As Chairman Conyers said before, it doesn't look good
for the credit card companies."

   At issue is credit card "interchange," a non-negotiable fee
averaging close to 2 percent that Visa and MasterCard banks charge
merchants every time a credit card or signature debit card is used to
pay for a transaction. Visa and MasterCard effectively force merchants
to pass the fees on to consumers by requiring them to be included in
the advertised price of items and making cash discounts difficult. But
interchange is largely unknown to most consumers because Visa and
MasterCard keep merchants from disclosing it on receipts and don't
disclose the fee on monthly statements.

   According to NRF estimates, the average U.S. family will pay $427
in hidden credit card interchange fees in 2008, up from $378 in 2007.
The amount has nearly tripled from the $159 paid in 2001, the year NRF
began tracking interchange. Total interchange collections are
projected at $48 billion this year, up from $42 billion last year and
$16.6 billion in 2001.

   The National Retail Federation is the world's largest retail trade
association, with membership that comprises all retail formats and
channels of distribution including department, specialty, discount,
catalog, Internet, independent stores, chain restaurants, drug stores
and grocery stores as well as the industry's key trading partners of
retail goods and services. NRF represents an industry with more than
1.6 million U.S. retail companies, more than 25 million employees -
about one in five American workers - and 2007 sales of $4.5 trillion.
As the industry umbrella group, NRF also represents over 100 state,
national and international retail associations. www.nrf.com

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Wednesday that Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd (RANB.BO) can begin selling a U.S. generic form of its Lipitor cholesterol fighter by late 2011 under a settlement deal, some five months later than Wall Street expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts have long expected Lipitor's U.S. marketing exclusivity to lapse no later than June 2011, and for cheaper generic forms of the world's best-selling drug to then immediately flood U.S. drugstores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But under Pfizer's settlement with India's Ranbaxy, which has long challenged Lipitor's patents in the courts, U.S. patients will not have access to Ranbaxy's copycat product until November 30, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares rose slightly, giving up earlier gains. Ranbaxy closed up 2.9 percent at a three-year high of 598.20 rupees in Mumbai on speculation the company would reach a Lipitor settlement with Pfizer. Japan's Daiichi Sankyo Co (4568.T) last week said it would pay up to $4.6 billion for control of Ranbaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delay in Lipitor generics would buy a little extra time for Pfizer, whose earnings are expected to plunge once a copycat form of its $12 billion-a-year flagship product arrives and starts hammering away at Lipitor sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSUMER BACKLASH?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if the delay could spark a backlash among patients and insurers who favor cheaper generics, David Reid, Pfizer's acting general counsel, said: "We're pleased with this settlement and we actually think it is pro-patient, pro-competitive and pro-intellectual property."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was best to bring certainty for both organizations," Ranbaxy Chief Executive Malvinder Singh said in an interview at Ranbaxy's London office. "The biggest part for us is in the United States where we will launch with certainty and without any risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Krensavage, principal of Krensavage Asset Management LLC, said investors had been expecting Lipitor's marketing exclusivity to lapse as soon as March 2010, but no later than June 2011, depending on expiration times of two important Lipitor patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer is a more attractive company today because this deal would delay Lipitor generics from five to 20 months, and spare Pfizer $3 billon to $11.7 billion in lost Lipitor sales over that period," Krensavage said, predicting the settlement would ease uncertainty among Pfizer investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, whose shares are at a 10-year low due to anemic revenue from its other medicines and worries about Lipitor's looming patent expiration, also described the deal as a potential balm to its long-suffering shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy, as the first drugmaker to seek approval of generic Lipitor, would be entitled under federal law to 180 days of marketing exclusivity before other generics could be introduced, Reid said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prices of branded medicines typically fall 20 percent or more once the first generic hits the market, and can tumble 80 percent or more after other generics are launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, while ending Pfizer's long-standing attempts to block Ranbaxy's product in the United States, would leave Pfizer free to eventually launch its own authorized generic form of Lipitor, Reid said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid said the agreement would benefit consumers because some less-well-known Lipitor patents extend as far out as 2017, and could have blocked generics until then. Analysts, however, have discounted that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEAL RESOLVES OTHER ISSUES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement also will entitle Ranbaxy to begin selling generic versions of Caduet -- a Pfizer drug that combines Lipitor with the company's Norvasc blood pressure treatment -- in the United States by November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Pfizer will not pay Ranbaxy any monies under the deal, Reid said Ranbaxy would profit because its U.S. generic now has a guaranteed path and because Pfizer will drop efforts to stop ongoing sales of its Lipitor generics in Malaysia, Brunei, Peru and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrangement would also allow Ranbaxy to sell generic Lipitor in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Italy and Australia near the time of respective patent expirations in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patent battles between the companies over Lipitor would continue, however, in Finland, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Romania, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal also would end ongoing U.S. patent disputes between the companies relating to Pfizer's Accupril blood pressure drug, and a dispute in Ecuador involving Pfizer's Viagra anti-impotence pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Pfizer will submit the deal to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Reid said it does not require the agency's approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FTC in February filed suit against Cephalon Inc CEPH.O, alleging the U.S. biotechnology company broke the law by paying generic drug makers to keep copycat versions of its Provigil sleep disorder medicine off the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency has been battling similar agreements among drugmakers for years, arguing they violate antitrust law and keep drug prices high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid said Pfizer's agreement with Ranbaxy should not raise such concerns at the FTC because it involves no payments and complies with all applicable laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, India's Business Standard newspaper said Pfizer may bid for Ranbaxy, countering Daiichi's offer. Pfizer has declined to comment on the speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Michael Kahn and Mike Elliott in London; Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds closing Pfizer shares) By Ransdell Pierson NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Wednesday that Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd (RANB.BO) can begin selling a U.S. generic form of its Lipitor cholesterol fighter by late 2011 under a settlement deal, some five months later than Wall Street expectations. Industry analysts have long expected Lipitor's U.S. marketing exclusivity to lapse no later than June 2011, and for cheaper generic forms of the world's best-selling drug to then immediately flood U.S. drugstores. But under Pfizer's settlement with India's Ranbaxy, which has long challenged Lipitor's patents in the courts, U.S. patients will not have access to Ranbaxy's copycat product until Nov. 30, 2011. Pfizer's shares rose slightly, giving up earlier gains. Ranbaxy closed up 2.9 percent at a three-year high of 598.20 rupees in Mumbai on speculation the company would reach a Lipitor settlement with Pfizer. Japan's Daiichi Sankyo Co (4568.T) last week said it would pay up to $4.6 billion for control of Ranbaxy. The delay in Lipitor generics would buy a little extra time for Pfizer, whose earnings are expected to plunge once a copycat form of its $12 billion-a-year flagship product arrives and starts hammering away at Lipitor sales. CONSUMER BACKLASH? Asked if the delay could spark a backlash among patients and insurers who favor cheaper generics, David Reid, Pfizer's acting general counsel, said: We're pleased with this settlement and we actually think it is pro-patient, pro-competitive and pro-intellectual property. It was best to bring certainty for both organizations, Ranbaxy Chief Executive Malvinder Singh said in an interview at Ranbaxy's London office. The biggest part for us is in the United States where we will launch with certainty and without any risk. Mike Krensavage, principal of Krensavage Asset Management LLC, said investors had been expecting Lipitor's marketing exclusivity to lapse as soon as March 2010, but no later than June 2011, depending on expiration times of two important Lipitor patents. Pfizer is a more attractive company today because this deal would delay Lipitor generics from five to 20 months, and spare Pfizer $3 billon to $11.7 billion in lost Lipitor sales over that period, Krensavage said, predicting the settlement would ease uncertainty among Pfizer investors. Pfizer, whose shares are at a 10-year low due to anemic revenue from its other medicines and worries about Lipitor's looming patent expiration, also described the deal as a potential balm to its long-suffering shareholders. Ranbaxy, as the first drugmaker to seek approval of generic Lipitor, would be entitled under federal law to 180 days of marketing exclusivity before other generics could be introduced, Reid said in an interview. U.S. prices of branded medicines typically fall 20 percent or more once the first generic hits the market, and can tumble 80 percent or more after other generics are launched. The deal, while ending Pfizer's long-standing attempts to block Ranbaxy's product in the United States, would leave Pfizer free to eventually launch its own authorized generic form of Lipitor, Reid said. Reid said the agreement would benefit consumers because some less-well-known Lipitor patents extend as far out as 2017, and could have blocked generics until then. Analysts, however, have discounted that possibility. DEAL RESOLVES OTHER ISSUES The settlement also will entitle Ranbaxy to begin selling generic versions of Caduet -- a Pfizer drug that combines Lipitor with the company's Norvasc blood pressure treatment -- in the United States by November 2011. Although Pfizer will not pay Ranbaxy any monies under the deal, Reid said Ranbaxy would profit because its U.S. generic now has a guaranteed path and because Pfizer will drop efforts to stop ongoing sales of its Lipitor generics in Malaysia, Brunei, Peru and Vietnam. The arrangement would also allow Ranbaxy to sell generic Lipitor in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Italy and Australia near the time of respective patent expirations in those countries. Patent battles between the companies over Lipitor would continue, however, in Finland, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Romania, Pfizer said. The deal also would end ongoing U.S. patent disputes between the companies relating to Pfizer's Accupril blood pressure drug, and a dispute in Ecuador involving Pfizer's Viagra anti-impotence pill. Although Pfizer will submit the deal to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Reid said it does not require the agency's approval. The FTC in February filed suit against Cephalon Inc CEPH.O, alleging the U.S. biotechnology company broke the law by paying generic drug makers to keep copycat versions of its Provigil sleep disorder medicine off the market. The agency has been battling similar agreements among drugmakers for years, arguing they violate antitrust law and keep drug prices high. Reid said Pfizer's agreement with Ranbaxy should not raise such concerns at the FTC because it involves no payments and complies with all applicable laws.

&lt;p&gt;RIGA (Reuters) - Estonia and Latvia accused Russia on Wednesday of being hypocritical in giving ex-Soviet citizens who live in the two Baltic states visa-free travel while talking about integration problems at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow has long complained Latvia and Estonia discriminated against their 400,000 Russian-speakers by depriving them of citizenship after the fall of the Soviet Union. It has urged them to speed up a naturalization and integration process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet said giving non-citizens visa-free travel to Russia would remove any incentive for them to take up local citizenship. Since the Soviet Union fell, these residents have held no nationality at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision unfortunately confirms Russia's hypocrisy," Paet was quoted by Baltic news agency BNS as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the old rules, both Estonian citizens and non-citizens carrying "alien" travel documents needed a visa to go to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant that someone trying to decide whether to go through the naturalization process -- which involves tests -- might decide to do it anyway as it made no difference to requirements on entering Russia. But this is no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By this decision Russia actually slows down the granting of citizenship because it eliminates significant motivation for applying for Estonian citizenship," Paet said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Ministry of Latvia said Russia's move would hinder integration and hit negotiations between the European Union and Russia on easing visa requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, it will not ensure opportunities for non-citizens to enjoy the benefits provided by the status of an EU citizen," it added in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Patrick Lannin; Editing by Caroline Drees)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS, Jun 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Today IBM (NYSE: IBM) and utility based services provider iTricity
announced that iTricity will open a brand new Cloud Computing Hosting
Center for Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg. Based on IBM "Blue
Cloud" technology, iTricity will use the center to host computing
services for its customers. The two companies will work closely to build
this landmark center.

    Cloud computing is an emerging model in which users gain access to their
applications from anywhere through Internet-connected devices. A
simplified user interface makes the infrastructure supporting the
applications transparent to users.

    IBM Blue Cloud, a series of cloud computing services, allows corporate
data centers to operate more like the Internet by enabling computing
across a distributed, globally accessible fabric of resources, rather
than on local machines. IBM Blue Cloud technologies enable computing
resources to be dynamically provisioned and shared to achieve significant
economies of scale. This strong service management platform results in
near-zero incremental management costs when more information technology
(IT) resources are added to the cloud.

    With the new center, the iTricity computing service will be made available
under monthly credit card billing for either fixed or variable,
usage-based fees. The hosting service is planned to span iTricity's five
data centers located in the Amsterdam region.

    "We are excited about the opening of this newest highly advanced Cloud
Computing Center for Continental Europe. Customer demands for flexible
computing resources are rapidly increasing. Therefore, we need to take
into consideration more aspects such as security, continuity and
compliance. Fast delivery is no longer the single most important
selection criteria. Hosting services should also be reliable, fully
resilient across multiple centers and compliant to business rules and
regulations," said iTricity's Chief Executive Officer and Founder Mr.
Robert Rosier. "The IBM Blue Cloud technology helps us to provision fast
and fully compliant IT resources across our multi-datacenter environment."

    "Customers will access shared IT resources on iTricity's cloud computing
center much faster and easier than previously available," added Mr. Robert
Rosier. "iTricity expects to achieve both operational efficiency and power
savings as a result of improved resource utilization." He added, "iTricity
will add powerful functions to current cloud computing capabilities, such
as Secure Cloud Management, Infrastructure Profiling and Self Service
Provisioning and Payment Portal."

    Since 2005, iTricity has provided hosting services to customers in The
Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany across a variety of
industries including sports, government, finance, automobile and health.

    iTricity's clients are eager to subscribe to the new cloud computing
service. "The new service will ensure we pay only for the resources we
use. Yet we are able to have the flexibility to move quickly when we need
more resources," said Mr. Jos Swart, Managing Director of Sportlink.
Sportlink is an application service provider (ASP), servicing large sports
federations. Sportlink has been using the iTricity Services for almost two
years and is excited by the newest developments in the iTricity platform.

    The IBM Cloud Computing Centre at Dublin, Ireland and IBM High Performance
Solutions Lab in Silicon Valley, California, will work in close
collaboration with iTricity in building this center.

    "IBM welcomes iTricity as they join the global community of cloud
computing," said Dr. Willy Chiu, Vice President of IBM High Performance
Solutions Lab. "Enterprise computing centers are expanding across the
U.S., Europe, and Asia, using IBM Blue Cloud technologies."

    The center will be powered by IBM System x and System p servers, and IBM
Tivoli Provisioning Manager Software. The five data centers will be linked
with a virtual storage area network (SAN) and the newest Multiprotocol
Label Switching (MPLS) technologies. The cloud computing center in
Amsterdam will be a tightly secured infrastructure, managed by iTricity's
sister company, GlidePath. The center will comply with the ISO27001 - Code
of Information Security. Additional security functions required by banks
or governmental agencies are available at iTricity, including auditing by
one of their certification partners.

    IBM Cloud Computing Milestones

    IBM has been expanding its cloud computing capabilities around the world.
Over the past year, IBM has announced cloud computing clients such as Wuxi
City of China; Sogeti, the local professional services division of
Capgemini; and Vietnamese government institutions and universities. IBM
built Europe's first cloud computing center in Dublin, Ireland in March,
2008. In October, 2007 IBM announced a joint academic program with Google
to help university students gain the skills to program cloud applications.
In November 2007, IBM launched Blue Cloud technologies that are key to
IBM's New Enterprise Data Center (NEDC) initiative, as well as for all of
the IBM Cloud Computing centers worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Wednesday that Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd (RANB.BO) can begin selling a U.S. generic form of its Lipitor cholesterol fighter by late 2011 under a settlement deal, some five months later than Wall Street expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts have long expected Lipitor's U.S. marketing exclusivity to lapse no later than June 2011, and for cheaper generic forms of the world's best-selling drug to then immediately flood U.S. drugstores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But under Pfizer's settlement with India's Ranbaxy, which has long challenged Lipitor's patents in the courts, U.S. patients will not have access to Ranbaxy's copycat product until November 30, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares rose 3.8 percent to $18.40 in premarket trading. Ranbaxy closed up 2.9 percent at a three-year high of 598.20 rupees in Mumbai on speculation the company would reach a Lipitor settlement with Pfizer. Japan's Daiichi Sankyo Co (4568.T) last week said it would pay up to $4.6 billion for control of Ranbaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delay in Lipitor generics would buy a little extra time for Pfizer, whose earnings are expected to plunge once a copycat form of its $12 billion-a-year flagship product arrives and starts hammering away at Lipitor sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSUMER BACKLASH?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if the delay could spark a backlash among patients and insurers who favor cheaper generics, David Reid, Pfizer's acting general counsel, said: "We're pleased with this settlement and we actually think it is pro-patient, pro-competitive and pro-intellectual property."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was best to bring certainty for both organizations," Ranbaxy Chief Executive Malvinder Singh said in an interview at Ranbaxy's London office. "The biggest part for us is in the United States where we will launch with certainty and without any risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Krensavage, principal of Krensavage Asset Management LLC, said investors had been expecting Lipitor's marketing exclusivity to lapse as soon as March 2010, but no later than June 2011, depending on expiration times of two important Lipitor patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer is a more attractive company today because this deal would delay Lipitor generics from five to 20 months, and spare Pfizer $3 billon to $11.7 billion in lost Lipitor sales over that period," Krensavage said, predicting the settlement would ease uncertainty among Pfizer investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, whose shares are at a 10-year low due to anemic revenue from its other medicines and worries about Lipitor's looming patent expiration, also described the deal as a potential balm to its long-suffering shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy, as the first drugmaker to seek approval of generic Lipitor, would be entitled under federal law to 180 days of marketing exclusivity before other generics could be introduced, Reid said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prices of branded medicines typically fall 20 percent or more once the first generic hits the market, and can tumble 80 percent or more after other generics are launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, while ending Pfizer's long-standing attempts to block Ranbaxy's product in the United States, would leave Pfizer free to eventually launch its own authorized generic form of Lipitor, Reid said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid said the agreement would benefit consumers because some less-well-known Lipitor patents extend as far out as 2017, and could have blocked generics until then. Analysts, however, have discounted that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEAL RESOLVES OTHER ISSUES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement will also entitle Ranbaxy to begin selling generic versions of Caduet -- a Pfizer drug that combines Lipitor with the company's Norvasc blood pressure treatment -- in the United States by November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Pfizer will not pay Ranbaxy any monies under the deal, Reid said Ranbaxy would profit because its U.S. generic now has a guaranteed path and because Pfizer will drop efforts to stop ongoing sales of its Lipitor generics in Malaysia, Brunei, Peru and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrangement would also allow Ranbaxy to sell generic Lipitor in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Italy and Australia near the time of respective patent expirations in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patent battles between the companies over Lipitor would continue, however, in Finland, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Romania, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would also end ongoing U.S. patent disputes between the companies relating to Pfizer's Accupril blood pressure drug, and a dispute in Ecuador involving Pfizer's Viagra anti-impotence pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Pfizer will submit the deal to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Reid said it does not require the agency's approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FTC in February filed suit against Cephalon Inc CEPH.O, alleging the U.S. biotechnology company broke the law by paying generic drug makers to keep copycat versions of its Provigil sleep disorder medicine off the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency has been battling similar agreements among drugmakers for years, arguing they violate antitrust law and keep drug prices high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid said Pfizer's agreement with Ranbaxy should not raise such concerns at the FTC because it involves no payments and complies with all applicable laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, India's Business Standard newspaper said Pfizer may bid for Ranbaxy, countering Daiichi's offer. Pfizer has declined to comment on the speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Michael Kahn and Mike Elliott in London; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 18 (Reuters) - Lachlan Edwards, co-head of
European restructuring at Goldman Sachs (GS.N), is moving to the
bank's Sydney's office to lead the restructuring unit in
Australia, a source familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Edwards, a native Australian, will start his new job in
September, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Edwards was poached two years ago from Rothschild, where he
was head of UK restructuring, to head the European restructuring
unit at Goldman Sachs, ahead of an expected wave of corporate
debt defaults and restructurings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was joined last year by Andrew Wilkinson, who moved from
law firm Cadwalader, and who will now head the European team,
the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman Sachs restructuring unit on Tuesday agreed with
accountants Deloitte  Touche the $7 billion rescue of a
Structured Investment Vehicle formerly run by UK hedge fund
Cheyne Finance after six months of tense negotiations.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs maintained its "cautious"
view on the paper and forest products sector for the near term,
saying rising inflation and a drop in demand for paper was
putting pressure on second-quarter earnings of the companies in
the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, analyst Richard Skidmore said patient investors
willing to look through the current earnings and demand
environment could find some value in the stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would look to be more aggressive on the stocks as we
begin to see inflation abate and demand improve," Skidmore said
in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage upgraded International Paper Co (IP.N) to
"buy" from "neutral" on valuation and lowered Domtar Corp
(UFS.N) to "neutral" from "buy." It raised BlueLinx Holdings
Inc (BXC.N) to "neutral" from "sell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman recommended investors switch out of Domtar and into
Boise Inc BZ.N, which it started coverage with a "buy"
rating, based on valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage maintained "sell" ratings on Louisiana
Pacific Corp (LPX.N) and Norbord Inc (NBD.TO), as it is not
anticipating a recovery in U.S. housing markets until late
2009.

&lt;p&gt;  PORTLAND, OR, Jun 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Tripwire, Inc. today announced operational configuration assessment policies for
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and Microsoft Exchange that allow
Microsoft administrators to ensure the known and trusted state of these critical
infrastructurecomponents, helping ensure optimal performance. With its support
of core
business applications, Tripwire Enterprise is the first and only solution to
comprehensively assure complete configuration control across the Microsoft
technology stack, from Windows Server to Active Directory and SQL Server to
Exchange and IIS.

    For many businesses, Microsoft Exchange is the mission-critical tool that
allows employees to communicate and be productive. Any IT organization focused
on
servicing the business implicitly understands the importance of ensuring 100
percent availability, integrity and security of its email application.
Similarly, with Microsoft IIS serving 55 percent of all active Fortune 1000 Web
sites(1), it is critical for companies to ensure its predictability.  A
single error in system configuration can generate unexpected downtime and fire
fighting, thus it is imperative to control configurations of these
mission-critical applications.

    Tripwire Enterprise for Microsoft IIS and Exchange allows IT operations to
ensure that these two critical business applications are configured to
maximize operational performance. Many organizations spend large sums of
money hiring consultants to help optimize application configurations to
getthe greatest performance and highest availability. Tripwire Enterprise now
provides operational policies for IIS and Exchange servers with tests for
settings recommended by industry experts and validated in demanding client
environments.

    Tripwire Enterprise proactively captures detailed configuration
informationfrom across Microsoft Exchange and IIS servers and automatically
compares the data
against Tripwire's operational policies. Tripwire Enterprise then automates
the validation of the configurations and certifies that these business-critical
applications comply with internal governance, external regulatory requirements,
and industry best practices.  Best practice operational policies for IIS and
Exchange optimize the IT service stack for maximum performance and
reliability.  For example, Tripwire ensures that CPU monitoring settings are
enabled correctly to prevent a single application pool from monopolizing IIS
server resources and decreasing performance. Tripwire then maintains that
setting
with continuous change auditing. In fact, Tripwire's operational policy for IIS
helps businesses achieve faster page loads, reduce hardware costs and operating
expenses,and provide a consistent and reliable online experience.

    "Tripwire stands alone in its breadth and depth of coverage, allowing IT
managers to holistically and automatically monitor the entire spectrum of IT
infrastructure for changes," said Dan Schoenbaum, SVP Marketing and Corporate
Development, Tripwire. "With best practice policies tailored for
organizations that rely on IIS and Exchange, Tripwire is extending its
pioneering market leadership to bring customers more insight about the
configuration of their infrastructure, increasing system availability,
predictability
and IT effectiveness."

    About Tripwire, Inc.

    Tripwire helps over 6,000 enterprises worldwide reduce security risk, attain
compliance and increase operational efficiency throughout their virtual and
physical environments. Using Tripwire's industry-leading configuration
assessment and
change auditing solutions, organizations successfully achieve and maintain IT
configuration control. Tripwire is headquartered in Portland, Ore. with

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, June 18 (Reuters) - Chinese companies could sue
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) under a new antitrust law which will
come into effect on Aug. 1, the Shanghai Securities News said on
Wednesday, citing unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The newspaper said China's State Intellectual Property
Office was organising companies to bring lawsuits to challenge
Microsoft's pricing and the dominance of its products on the
Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft Windows retails at 1,000-2,000 yuan ($145-$290)
and its Office software suite at 4,000-5,000 yuan, which
together is more than the cost of a computer," one source told
the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is not right for an international company to use its
monopoly position to sell software at outrageous prices while
criticising the Chinese people's awareness of copyright law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An antitrust lawyer told Reuters that although the new law
will come into effect in six weeks, the final version has not
yet been published. But oversight of domestic competition was
likely to remain with officials from the State Administration of
Industry and Commerce (SAIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Under the law, the companies can complain against companies
abusing a dominant position, but SAIC is not obliged to act,"
said the lawyer, who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft's case has been such a saga in the European
Union, and I think if SAIC are willing to investigate at all,
they will have to spend a lot of resources and time on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It would be a political decision. At a certain time, they
may want to pick one company and make an investigation. It
always looks good on the front pages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nobody at Microsoft in China was immediately available to
comment.

down over 3% yesterday to just off its 52-week low, and down over 38%
from its 52-week high.

   Oil eased again overnight in Asia to $133.58 a barrel, despite the
fact that most analysts are expecting a negative report from the U.S.
government saying there has been a drop in crude oil inventories. This
news has apparently been countered by reports from Saudi officials
that their government is considering increasing oil output by 200,000
barrels a day, or about 2%. This follows an increase of 300,000
barrels a day last month.

   The three major indexes all fell yesterday amid the negative news
surrounding banks and new data showing that the price of oil is
starting to have a real and deep affect on the economy. The Producers
Price Index, also known as the PPI, jumped an astounding 1.4%, the
highest rise since November, while the core PPI, which strips volatile
food and energy prices, only rose 0.2%. The Dow fell over 108 points
yesterday, while the fell over 9 points and the Nasdaq composite fell
17 points.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts raised their fiscal 2008 earnings estimates for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) on Wednesday, a day after the investment bank posted second-quarter results that exceeded expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The company's challenge at this point is to re-stimulate trading while holding on to its investment gains. The second quarter results do not appear to be sustainable," Ladenburg Thalmann analyst Richard Bove wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs said second-quarter revenue from fixed-income trading, normally its largest business, fell 29 percent to $2.38 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bove, who rates the stock "sell," raised his fiscal 2008 earnings estimate for the company to $15.45 from $13.96 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oppenheimer  Co analyst Meredith Whitney, who has a "perform" rating on the stock, raised her 2008 earnings view to $15.75 a share from $14.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although Goldman continues to outperform its peers, as reflected with its higher multiple, we remain cautious on the brokers group as the capital markets activity remain anemic and believe Goldman is fairly priced at these levels," Whitney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia raised its 2008 earnings estimates to $18.21 from $17.80 a share, while Lehman raised it to $16.81 from $15.04 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs reported an 11 percent fall in quarterly earnings as market turmoil hit trading and slowed investment banking, yet the firm again exceeded expectations by avoiding major losses on assets slammed by the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bangalore; Editing by Deepak Kannan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM Cognos Business Intelligence Software Helps Creativity Inc. Win TechTarget 2008 Midmarket IT Leadership Award

      -- Creative arts manufacturer recognized for successful IT
  implementations, including IBM Cognos 8 Business Intelligence, that
   helped drive efficiencies and support key business initiatives --
BURLINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Cognos, an IBM company and the world leader in business
intelligence and performance management, announced today that
Creativity Inc. VP of IT, Jim Mulholland, has won a TechTarget(R)
Midmarket IT Leadership Award for successfully executing a variety of
IT initiatives, including the implementation of an enterprise-wide
performance management system, that led to significant productivity
gains.

   Creativity Inc. is a leading designer, marketer, and distributor
of basic crafting, beading, organization, paper crafting, and
scrapbooking products. Announced at the annual CIO Decisions
Conference(TM) in Carlsbad, CA, Creativity VP Mulholland was
recognized by CIO Decisions Conference and SearchCIO-Midmarket.com(TM)
editors for his work in implementing IT solutions such as IBM Cognos 8
BI that resulted in increased efficiencies in reporting and analysis,
as well as stronger profitability through improved forecasting.
Mulholland was one of ten industry IT executives to receive an award.

   "We are proud that these winners exemplify innovation and
IT/business alignment in the midmarket," said Anne McCrory, Editorial
Director, TechTarget CIO Decisions Media Group. "The judging was a
rigorous process, and these IT executives should be proud that they
stood out. Clearly, they are leaders."

   IBM Cognos 8 BI Improves Creativity's Bottom Line

   In 2005, Creativity executives recognized that the reporting and
analysis capabilities of their existing Solarsoft ERP system were
limited and required significant IT involvement, which negatively
impacted the company's bottom line. To overcome these barriers, the
company sought out a BI solution that could be easily implemented
within the company's existing IT infrastructure, could tap into
multiple data sources, and would require minimal IT maintenance.

   Creativity implemented IBM Cognos 8 BI, arming managers with a
single, clear view of their data, which could then be easily measured
against company objectives. For example, a key metric that Creativity
needed to manage was its customer fill rate, with most customers
requiring 95 to 100% fill. Previously, there was some summary-level
insight into this area; with IBM Cognos BI, the company's supply chain
team is now provided with daily and weekly details so they can manage
their fill rates on the fly, enabling them to manage inventory levels
and reduce carrying costs.

   To help employees gain full advantage of their IBM Cognos BI
software, Creativity established a Business Intelligence competency
center (BICC) called the Analytical Center of Excellence (ACE).
Considered part of the eight-person IT team, the BICC is tasked with
maintaining the company's BI solution, and is also responsible for the
company's reporting, analysis and future BI requirements.

   Using IBM Cognos software, Creativity has experienced significant
returns to date, including a decrease of 50% in time required to close
the books, as well as a decrease of 25% in customer chargebacks. IBM
Cognos BI's automated features have also helped free up two headcounts
to work on other projects.

   "By using IBM Cognos 8 BI, we are beyond the point most companies
hope to reach with data accuracy. Employees can now speak confidently
about our data, and easily match up reports and metrics, knowing that
they are speaking the same language," said Jim Mulholland,
Vice-President of Information Technology at Creativity. "The ROI
gained from our IBM Cognos business intelligence solution stems from
improving customer satisfaction and keeping our largest customers
happy. Our CIO Decisions Award win is a perfect testament to our
successful track record, and we are honored by the industry
recognition."

   IBM Cognos 8 Business Intelligence provides decision makers at all
levels of the enterprise with groundbreaking capabilities to better
manage performance by delivering a consistent, accurate view of all
business information. As part of its global Information on Demand
business strategy, IBM Cognos BI helps clients like Creativity find
new ways to use performance information to accelerate their business
growth by responding quickly to changing demands, and enabling the
rapid delivery of new business services. IBM's approach enables
businesses to use Cognos 8 performance management software to
innovate, better compete and capitalize on emerging opportunities.

   "Creativity's efforts to implement a culture of BI have provided
the company with the foundation they needed to make better, more
informed business decisions. In addition to improved customer service,
Creativity has evolved into one of the few arts and craft suppliers
that can effectively service large retailers, generating impressive
returns both for these chains and their customers," said Paul Hoy,
Global Manufacturing Industry Director, Cognos.

   Cognos is a recognized leader in delivering performance management
solutions for the consumer goods industry. In fact, 19 of the top 20
consumer goods companies in the world use IBM Cognos solutions. For

&lt;p&gt;  HEERLEN, NETHERLANDS, Jun 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 

German researcher Andreas Walther has won the first prize in the DSM
Science &amp; Technology Awards (South) 2008. An international judging
committee, chaired by Dr Manfred Eggersdorfer, R Director at DSM
Nutritional Products, selected Andreas Walther, who will obtain his
doctorate from the University of Bayreuth (Germany), for his PhD research
in the field of polymeric materials.

    Andreas Walther has succeeded in developing new classes of polymeric
materials with unusual properties based on so-called Janus particles.
These particles, named after the two-faced Roman god, are characterized
by surfaces with distinctive properties, which enable specific and
different interactions with other materials. They form an ideal toolbox
for nanotechnology applications and materials science, paving the way for
the construction of novel types of advanced biochemical sensors,
drug-delivery vehicles, multi-component storage and release devices, or
highly surface-active particles. Looking to the future, a multitude of
current problems in biomedicine, materials science and other disciplines
can efficiently be tackled by the materials enabled by Andreas Walther's
research.

    Andreas Walther was presented with an award trophy and a certificate by
Mr Stephan Tanda, member of DSM's Managing Board on Tuesday, June 17. As
the winner of the first prize he will also receive a cash prize of EUR
7,500.

    The winner of the second prize, Irene Maier of the University of Vienna
(Austria), will receive a cash prize of EUR 5,000 for her PhD research on
the development of analytic methods for allergens in food matrices. The
winner of the third prize, Christoph Dumelin of the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology Zurich (Switzerland), will receive a cash prize
of EUR 2,500 for his PhD research on the development of protein binders
from DNA coded libraries. The other nine finalists will each receive a
cash prize of EUR 1,250.

    The DSM Science &amp; Technology Awards form part of the DSM Innovation
Awards Program sponsored by the DSM Innovation Center. They are granted
for outstanding PhD research by doctoral students from Switzerland, which
is the home base of DSM Nutritional Products, and the neighboring regions
of Austria, Northeastern France and Southern Germany.

    The awards presentation event was held at Park Hotel Vitznau in Vitznau
(Switzerland). Speaking on the occasion, Mr Tanda said: 'The excellent
quality of the PhD research carried out by the contestants clearly
demonstrates the power and the potential of the younger generation. These
young scientists will pave the way for innovations that will contribute
to a healthier and more sustainable world.'


 
 Report of the judging
committee

    In its report about the winner of the first prize, the judging committee
said it was impressed by the outstanding quality and high impact of the
research carried out by Andreas Walther: 'He has not only synthesized the
basic building blocks but also assembled these into various 1-, 2-, and
3-dimensional structures, which he then characterized physically and
functionally. In this way he has made a major breakthrough in a highly
competitive field, based on an innovative new concept.' According to the
judging committee, the outcome of the research may prove useful in a
variety of applications, e.g. in the medical area or in the development
of new photovoltaic devices.

    The judging committee commended the high quality of the work of all the
other finalists.

    The winners of the first, second and third prizes

    Andreas Walther conducted his research at the Institute for Molecular
Chemistry II, University of Bayreuth (Germany), under the supervision of
Professor Axel Mueller.

    Irene Maier conducted her research at the Department of Biochemistry,

Two parallel awards schemes

    DSM launched the Science &amp; Technology Awards twenty-three years ago.
Until 2006, the awards were open to doctoral students from the
Netherlands, Belgium and the German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen (DSM
Science &amp; Technology Awards - North). In view of the high reputation and
popularity the awards had gained in academic circles, in 2007 DSM
introduced a parallel contest for PhD researchers from universities in
Switzerland, Austria, Northeastern France and Southern Germany (DSM
Science &amp; Technology Awards - South).

    Encouraging pioneering research

    DSM performs a great deal of its R work in close collaboration with
universities. Through its Science &amp; Technology Awards DSM wants to
encourage young research scientists to undertake creative, pioneering
research. This is important because this kind of research often provides
the basis for the development of new, knowledge-intensive industrial
processes and innovative products.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Wednesday that Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd (RANB.BO) may begin selling a U.S. generic form of its Lipitor cholesterol fighter by late 2011 under a settlement deal, at least five months later than Wall Street expectations. Industry analysts have long expected Pfizer's U.S. marketing exclusivity for Lipitor to lapse no later than June 2011 and for cheaper generic forms of the world's best-selling drug to then immediately flood U.S. drugstores. But under Pfizer's settlement with India's Ranbaxy, which has long challenged Lipitor's patents in the courts, U.S. patients will not have access to Ranbaxy's copycat product until Nov. 30, 2011. The delay would buy a little extra time for Pfizer, whose earnings are expected to plunge once a generic form of its $12 billion-a-year flagship product arrives and starts hammering away at Lipitor sales. Asked if the delay could spark a backlash among patients and insurers who favor cheaper generics, David Reid, Pfizer's acting general counsel, said: We're pleased with this settlement and we actually think it is pro-patient, pro-competitive and pro-intellectual property.

&lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy to Receive License in U.S. on November 30, 2011;

               Pfizer to Host Conference Call Today at 9 a.m. EDT
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today that it has entered into an agreement with generics
manufacturer Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. of India and certain of its affiliates to
settle substantially all their patent litigation worldwide involving Lipitor,
the world's most-prescribed cholesterol-lowering medicine. Under the terms of
the agreement, Ranbaxy will have a license to sell generic versions of Lipitor
and Caduet in the United States effective November 30, 2011. Caduet is a
medicine that combines the active ingredients of Lipitor and Norvasc and treats
both high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

The settlement provides shareholders of Pfizer and Ranbaxy, as well as patients,
with substantial certainty regarding the potential date - November 30, 2011 -
for entry of a generic version of Lipitor in the United States. In addition, the
agreement provides a license for Ranbaxy to sell generic versions of Lipitor on
varying dates in seven additional countries: Canada, Belgium, Netherlands,
Germany, Sweden, Italy and Australia. Pfizer and Ranbaxy have also resolved
their disputes regarding Lipitor in Malaysia, Brunei, Peru and Vietnam.

The lawsuits between Pfizer and Ranbaxy regarding Lipitor and Caduet will be
dismissed in the specified countries, and Ranbaxy will no longer contest the
validity of Pfizer's patents in the specified countries, including the United
States, according to the agreement. The settlement also resolves all patent
litigation with Ranbaxy relating to Accupril in the United States and Viagra in
Ecuador.

"This agreement is a win-win-win because it is pro-patient, pro-competition and
pro-intellectual property," said Ian Read, president of Worldwide Pharmaceutical
Operations for Pfizer. "The agreement provides patients with access to a generic
product much earlier than if Ranbaxy were unsuccessful in obtaining approval for
its product and overcoming the relevant patents. It provides substantial
certainty regarding the timing of the entry of a generic version of Lipitor.
Finally, the agreement clearly reaffirms the value and importance of
intellectual property and this country's well-balanced system of creating
incentives to develop innovative medicines while at the same time establishing a
strong generic drug business."

"Without patents and rigorous defense of intellectual property rights,
innovators would face significant challenges that could inhibit the discovery of
new medicines," Mr. Read added.

The settlement provides Ranbaxy with licenses to all the patents it needs to
make the generic product and enables Ranbaxy to manufacture and launch a generic
version of Lipitor prior to the expiration of the crystalline and amorphous
patents.

The Lipitor patents involved in this agreement are the basic compound patent,
which expires in the United States in 2010; the enantiomer patent, which expires
in the United States in 2011; as well as various process and crystalline form
patents, which expire in 2016 and 2017; and the combination patent for Caduet,
which expires in 2018.

The settlement complies with all applicable laws, and does not contain any of
the practices - such as "reverse payments" - that have been identified as of
concern recently by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

Pfizer has been defending Lipitor patent challenges by Ranbaxy throughout the
world since 2003. The agreement pertains solely to Ranbaxy and its affiliates
and does not cover legal challenges to the Lipitor patents involving other
generic manufacturers. However, Ranbaxy was the first generic challenger to the
listed Lipitor patents and, as such, holds the rights to 180 days of marketing
exclusivity in the United States.

The patent infringement litigation between Pfizer and Ranbaxy relating to
Lipitor will continue in five other European countries -- Finland, Spain,
Portugal, Denmark and Romania. Court cases involving the enantiomer patents are
pending in Spain and Portugal, while an infringement action on the commercial
process patent is pending in Finland. Patent cases involving the enantiomer
patent are pending in Denmark and Romania.

Pfizer invites investors and the general public to listen to a webcast of a
conference call with Pfizer's legal team at 9:00 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, June 18,
2008. The purpose of the call is to provide an overview of the settlement.

Those who wish to participate can either call 1-866-331-6338 in the United
States or 1-347-284-6938 outside the United States. The passcode is "Pfizer."

&lt;p&gt;Mustang Engineering Boosts Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Performance with F5's Application Ready Network

     Global Firm with 4,000-User SharePoint Site Benefits from 60
  Percent Performance Increase, Maximizing Application Investment and
                    Improving Employee Productivity
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV), the global leader in Application
Delivery Networking, today announced that Mustang Engineering has
optimized the performance of its recent Microsoft Office SharePoint
Server 2007 deployment using the F5 Application Ready Network (ARN).
Pre-deployment test results showed a 60 percent improvement in the
performance of Mustang's SharePoint Server 2007 environment when
supported by F5(R) solutions.

   "We made a significant investment in SharePoint Server 2007," said
Keith Wingate, Senior Network Architect at Mustang. "If employees
experience sluggishness with an enterprise application like
SharePoint, they won't use it. F5's Application Ready Network ensures
that we get top performance from SharePoint so that our employees can
leverage this new collaborative environment to better serve our
clients. This translates directly into a positive return on our
SharePoint investment."

   Mustang, an independent services provider to the oil, gas,
chemical, and manufacturing industries, deployed SharePoint Server
2007 to over 4,000 employees at the company's Houston, Texas
headquarters and its 12 other domestic and international offices. With
help from Accudata Systems, a Houston-based IT consulting and
integration firm with more than 26 years of experience, Mustang used
F5's ARN, deploying the F5 BIG-IP(R) Local Traffic Manager(TM)
(LTM(TM)) with WebAccelerator(TM) solution to boost SharePoint Server
2007 performance and ensure a positive user experience. WebAccelerator
is a web application delivery product that helps organizations
overcome performance issues involving browsers, web application
platforms, and WAN latency.

   F5's ARN is a holistic, application-specific network architecture
and infrastructure designed for enterprise applications such as
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007. It provides a complete set of
resources that simplify the design, deployment, and management of
mission-critical applications across the network with F5 products,
including step-by-step deployment procedures and pre-defined,
validated web acceleration policies. By removing bottlenecks outside
the application's control that put deployments at risk -- such as WAN
latency -- F5's ARN improves user experience, strengthens security,
unifies access control and enforcement, and ensures the superior
scalability of 2007 Microsoft Office system applications.

   Accudata Systems assisted Mustang with the selection and testing
of its BIG-IP LTM with WebAccelerator deployment. "We're seeing a
sharp increase in the demand for services around SharePoint Server
2007. SharePoint is typically a very high profile and
business-critical solution, so performance is key," said Chris Laney,
Accudata Systems Account Manager. "Our ability to walk in the door
with the F5 Application Ready Network allows us to deliver huge
benefits to our clients because now we can help them address
deployment concerns up front."

   "Mustang's use of the F5 ARN for SharePoint Server 2007 is an
exciting, real-world example of the benefits that we've documented in
our own test results, as well as the test results of third parties,"
says Jim Ritchings, Vice President of Business Development at F5.
"Using the F5 ARN helps Mustang deliver the innovation and quality
they're known for by ensuring that employees can take full advantage
of the collaboration capabilities SharePoint offers."

   Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:

   LWSN May See MSFT Competition

   Lawson Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: LWSN) is a leading provider of
enterprise resource planning (ERP) software solutions and professional
services to mid-market enterprises in the health care, retail, public
and professional service industries. The company reported revenues of
$212.9 million in Q3:FY08, missing our estimate of $218 million while
non-GAAP EPS of $0.08 came in line with our expectations. We maintain
our Hold rating on the shares.

   Lawson operates in a highly competitive market dominated by large
players such as Oracle Corporation (Nasdaq: ORCL) and SAP (NYSE: SAP)
in health care; and JDA Software Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: JDAS) SAP and
others in retail. Given the consolidation in the industry, we worry
that as Lawson's major competitors are increasing in size they are
becoming more formidable. Moreover, Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) has
entered the low end of the ERP market, and may move up-market by
targeting Lawson's core segments.

   Lawson's shares currently trade at 23.1 times our FY2008 EPS
estimate. We have adjusted our revenue and EPS estimates for Q4 and
FY2008. Consequently, we have also lowered our target price to $10.00
from $11.00, which is 29.4 times our FY2008 EPS estimate and 20.0
times our FY2009 EPS estimate.

&lt;p&gt;The deal to restructure the SIV, formerly run by British hedge fund Cheyne Capital, comes as Wall Street's biggest investment bank beat expectations by avoiding major losses on assets, though quarterly earnings dropped by 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are delighted ... we are in a position to sign a restructuring agreement in respect of the Cheyne Finance portfolio today," said Neville Kahn, of accountancy firm Deloitte and Touche LLP, who act as receivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the restructuring, Deloitte will price the assets in the market, selling a minority part of the portfolio to the group of creditors who want to cash out, the parties involved said in an official statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will allow Deloitte to sell the rest of the assets to the remaining creditors -- who have already agreed to reinvest that money in a newly established vehicle set up by Goldman Sachs -- which will hold the rest of the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of the securities is expected to be completed on or about July 17, Deloitte said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other SIVs, including Golden Key, Whistlejacket and Rhinebridge, are expected to follow Cheyne's model, being restructured by Goldman, said Stephen Peppiatt, at Bingham McCutchen, a legal advisor to a Cheyne senior creditor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We thought that Cheyne would be restructured some time ago, it has taken longer, but now there is a template that others will follow," Peppiat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cheyne Capital SIV collapsed last year as the credit crunch hurt the value of its investments in asset-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOB CUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs laid off hundreds of investment bankers last week, people familiar with the situation and recruiters told Reuters on Monday, with one insider saying 25 percent of employees at the vice-president level were let go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts were seen as a reaction to slowing markets and a slump in merger activity in the wake of the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet finalisation of the restructuring deal, which was first announced in December, provides a glimmer of hope for the revival of the market in troubled mortgage assets that are at the core of the global credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good news is that we are capable of valuing these assets and that we can move on from this phase to the next one," said Jeroen van den Broek, a credit strategist at ING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIVs ran into trouble last August when liquidity in the credit markets dried up, preventing them from raising funds and also causing the value of their assets -- mainly bank debt and asset-backed securities -- to drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIVs, held by banks, hedge funds or other institutions, issue a mixture of short-term debt and capital to buy longer-term assets, which pay more interest than the amount they pay on their notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM's (NYSE: IBM) history-making hybrid supercomputer, built for the
National Nuclear Security Administration's (NNSA) Los Alamos National
Lab, burned its way into the TOP500 Supercomputer record book today as
the most powerful system in the world -- by a wide margin. Its sustained
performance of 1.02 petaflops (1.02 quadrillion calculations per second)
puts the system in a class of its own -- more than three times faster
than the nearest non-IBM system.

    The official results were reported today during the International
Supercomputing Conference in Dresden, Germany, where the bi-annual listing
of the World's TOP500 Supercomputer Sites was released.
http://www.top500.org/

    Built by IBM for the NNSA and housed at its Los Alamos National
Laboratory, the petaflop-smashing system gets its world-leading power
from 12,240 IBM PowerXCell 8i Cell Broadband Engine(TM) processors --
derived from chips that power today's most popular videogame consoles.
6,562 AMD Opteron Dual-Core processors perform basic compute functions,
freeing the IBM(R) PowerXCell 8i chips for the math-intensive
calculations that are their specialty.

    This "hybrid" architecture, which optimizes the strength of multiple types
of processors, is an IBM hallmark. The design is analogous to that of a
hybrid car with similar benefits. For example, if the NNSA supercomputer
were built with standard x86 chips alone, the system would have been
significantly larger and would have required much more power.

    While the NNSA supercomputer will be used for ensuring the reliability and
safety of the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, it also sets the pace
for future research in a variety of scientific and commercial fields
including biotech, alternative energy, climate change and physics. IBM
expects its hybrid design to lead the way to a commercial supercomputer
platform that will support new scientific research and engineering
workloads unthinkable just a decade ago.

    IBM Sets the Pace for TOP500

    IBM continued its pace-setting leadership of the TOP500 with a trifecta
showing in the top three spots and a total of 210 systems on the list --
the most of any supercomputer vendor. IBM also had the most aggregate
performance on the list with 5.6 petaflops (48% of total); and the most
systems in the top 10, top 50, and top 100.

    The No.2 fastest computer in the world is an IBM(R) Blue Gene/L system at
NNSA's Lawrence Livermore National Lab in California, which clocked in at
478 teraflops (478 trillion calculations per second). Team Blue Gene also
held the No.3 spot with a 450 teraflop performance from the Blue Gene/P
system housed at the Department of Energy's Argonne National Lab in
Chicago.

    IBM also had the most power efficient systems: IBM QS22 PowerXCell 8i
processor-based supercomputers at IBM Germany and Fraunhofer; and the NNSA
system; and the fastest machine in Europe -- the Blue Gene/P at Juelich
Research Centre in Germany.

    The "TOP500 Supercomputer Sites" is compiled and published by
supercomputing experts Jack Dongarra from the University of Tennessee;
Erich Strohmaier and Horst Simon of the Department of Energy's
NERSC/Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; and Hans Meuer of the
University of Mannheim (Germany). The entire list can be viewed at

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - U.S. banks may need to raise $65 
billion of additional capital to cope with mounting losses from 
a global credit crisis that will not peak until 2009, Goldman 
Sachs  Co (GS.N) analysts said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The new capital would be on top of $120 billion already 
raised by the industry, analysts led by Richard Ramsden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Banks will not turn until a peak in credit costs is in 
sight," the analysts wrote. "Moreover, weaker banks are 
unlikely to benefit from consolidation as bank deals always 
slow when credit is deteriorating and larger banks are 
hamstrung by their own problem assets as well as accounting 
requirements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it lowered its price targets for 14 banking 
companies and cut its 2008 earnings-per-share forecasts for 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the banks for which Goldman cut both are BBT Corp 
(BBT.N), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N), SunTrust 
Banks Inc (STI.N), U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Wells Fargo  Co 
(WFC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also lowered its price targets for Wachovia Corp 
WB.N and Washington Mutual Inc (WM.N), and its earnings 
outlook for Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In afternoon trading, the 24-member KBW Bank Index .BKX 
was down 3.2 percent, while the 50-member KBW Regional Bank 
Index .KRX dropped 2.6 percent. These contributed to declines 
in broader market indexes as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zions Bancorp (ZION.O), a Salt Lake City-based bank, fell 
as much as 12.8 percent after projecting higher nonperforming 
assets and saying weakness in residential construction and land 
values in the U.S. Southwest should persist into 2009. Goldman 
also cut Zions' price target and earnings forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lenders have raised capital to help combat a surge in 
problem loans. Among those to raise the most were Citigroup Inc 
(C.N), Wachovia, Washington Mutual and National City Corp 
NCC.N, which this year each raised at least $7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Problem loans were once concentrated in subprime mortgages. 
They have, however, been spreading to other types of lending, 
including prime mortgages, home equity loans, commercial real 
estate and construction loans, auto loans and credit cards.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANKS SET ASIDE $86 BILLION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman analysts estimated that U.S. banks and thrifts 
have set aside $86 billion for loan losses in the three 
quarters since the credit crisis began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They said the weak housing market drove the deterioration 
and that home prices will likely keep falling all year. It 
expects credit losses to peak in the first quarter of 2009, 
when the rate of charge-offs may be 46 percent higher than a 
year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worries about credit losses have driven down banks' share 
prices. This has caused paper losses for many investors who 
infused capital into the industry, including many private 
equity firms and sovereign wealth funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much of this capital has come from offerings of common 
stock or convertible preferred shares. Goldman said further 
attempts to raise capital may prove even more costly for 
shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Capital raising becomes harder," the analysts wrote. "Only 
four out of 42 deals we track are in-the-money so far. This 
will make the next round of deals harder and more expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through Monday, the KBW bank and regional bank indexes were 
down a respective 23.7 percent and 21 percent this year. The 
Standard  Poor's 500 index .SPX was down 7.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Andre Grenon, Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ANAHEIM, California (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney has 
unleashed more of that Pixar synergy it keeps boasting of by 
unveiling Toy Story Mania!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Dubbed a 4-D ride and requiring the wearing of 3-D glasses, 
it was introduced Tuesday by CEO Bob Iger and John Lasseter, 
creator of the "Toy Story" franchise, at Disney's California 
Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger and Lasseter seem determined to push Pixar's 
computer-animated film characters in ways large and small at 
its theme parks on both coasts. To wit, Toy Story Mania! 
represents the first time an attraction was created for two 
parks simultaneously. The ride opened May 31 at Walt Disney 
World in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toy Story Mania! creates the illusion that riders have 
shrunk to toy-size so they might scoot through Andy's Room 
firing virtual projectiles at 3-D targets while collecting 
points for accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lasseter outscored Iger by more than 2-to-1 during the 
festivities. Then the ride opened for the public, and the line 
of riders stretched from one end of the park to the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andy's Room figures prominently in "Toy Story" and "Toy 
Story 2," both of which were directed by Lasseter. He is 
executive producing "Toy Story 3," due in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm really, really competitive, and I want the high 
score," Lasseter told guests at the unveiling ceremony, which 
included video of astronauts conducting experiments with a Buzz 
Lightyear toy at the International Space Station. "That is 
awesome -- to see a character you created floating in space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lasseter has figured prominently at Disney since the 2006 
purchase of Pixar. He's not only chief creative officer of 
Pixar Animation Studios but also principal creative adviser at 
Walt Disney Imagineering, where theme park attractions are 
created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acting as carnival barker outside the ride is a giant, 
high-tech Mr. Potato Head that engages in conversation with 
parkgoers. Engineers took more time animating Mr. Potato Head 
than any other audio-animatronics figure ever produced at 
Imagineering. As in the "Toy Story" films, he's voiced by Don 
Rickles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toy Story Mania! joins a host of Pixar-inspired attractions 
at the Disney theme parks based on such films as "Finding 
Nemo," "Monsters, Inc." and "A Bug's Life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The attractions, though, are a warm-up for the main event: 
a $1.1 billion Cars Land under construction that will span 12 
acres at California Adventure. The five-year project, scheduled 
for completion in 2012, could culminate with a change in the 
park's name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are going to make this park even more amazing," 
Lasseter said. "I promise you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said on 
Tuesday quarterly earnings fell 11 percent as market turmoil 
hit trading and slowed investment banking, yet the firm again 
exceeded expectations by avoiding major losses on assets 
slammed by the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; For more than a year, banks have been grappling with the 
challenges of a new world where profit engines such as 
mortgages, buyout finance and commercial real estate seized up. 
Goldman anticipated the changes earlier its rivals and was more 
aggressive in reducing exposure to hard-hit assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result, Goldman earnings fell for a second straight 
quarter, but not as much as its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have an uncanny ability to stay out of trouble," said 
Thomas Russo, portfolio manager at Gardner Russo  Gardner in 
Lancaster, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the second quarter ended May 30, net income at the 
largest U.S. investment bank fell to $2.09 billion, or $4.58 a 
share, from $2.33 billion, or $4.93, a year earlier. The 
results beat the average analyst forecast of $3.42 by a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net revenue fell 7 percent to $9.42 billion in a period 
that included the March panic that drove Bear Stearns into the 
ground and handed Lehman Brothers LEH.N a $2.8 billion loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Growth in equity underwriting, mergers and prime brokerage 
let Goldman beat forecasts, despite $775 million in write-downs 
and hedging losses. Goldman generated a surprisingly high 20 
percent return on equity even as Merrill Lynch MER.N and 
Lehman executives forecast years of muted profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They benefited from the disruption at the other investment 
banks," said Rose Grant, who helps manage $2 billion for 
Boston's Eastern Investment Advisors. "In tough times, people 
tend to gravitate toward the stronger financial firms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares, which had rallied 12 percent during the 
past week, were little changed in early afternoon trading.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOUGH SLEDDING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since credit and mortgage markets broke down last year, the 
world's banks and brokers have been forced to write down assets 
by more than $400 billion. The bursting of the credit bubble so 
far has led to 60,000 job losses and the ouster of senior 
executives at six of the world's largest banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lack of easy credit also has slowed the pace of 
leveraged buyouts, mergers and public stock offerings. For 
stronger firms like Goldman, the environment led to new 
business helping companies raise capital and restructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reflecting on the recent market environment, Goldman Chief 
Financial Officer David Viniar said markets remained 
treacherous. He estimated the credit crisis had probably moved 
past the halfway mark, yielding an environment that right now 
is "less stressed" than previous months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly, the first weeks of March were the bottom, at 
least up to now," Viniar told reporters in a briefing. "Now 
there is less concern about systemic liquidity risk. People are 
focused on individual investments and credit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viniar also observed that Goldman has reduced its exposure 
to hard-hit assets, such as leveraged loans, at the same time 
it is scouring the market snapping up bad loans and other 
distressed assets at discounts. Goldman in the quarter reduced 
its balance sheet by 8 percent to just under $1.1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our performance through the last several quarters leaves 
us well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities as 
they arise," he told analysts in a later conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While rivals are busy pulling in their horns, Goldman has 
increased risk-taking. Value at risk, a measure for what it 
could lose in one day, rose 17 percent to $184 million from the 
first quarter, fueled by interest-rate derivatives and 
commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Goldman proved it is not immune from the problems 
caused by a market breakdown now in its second year. The firm 
absorbed $775 million of losses from credit products, including 
$500 million of losses on ineffective hedges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second-quarter revenue from fixed-income trading, normally 
Goldman's largest business, fell 29 percent to $2.38 billion. 
Revenue from trading interest rates, currencies and mortgages 
helped offset a steep drop in credit products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which reports its quarterly results 
on Wednesday, saw its shares fall 4 percent in afternoon 
trading amid worries the No. 2 U.S. investment bank will suffer 
bigger losses than Goldman.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GROWTH AREAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other Goldman businesses fared better. Equity trading 
revenue was little changed, but was the quarter's biggest 
contributor at $2.49 billion. Robust client buying and selling 
offset a weak quarter in the firm's internal hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banking revenue fell 2 percent to $1.69 billion, 
reflecting the sharp downturn in bond and loan underwriting, 
but stock issuance fees were the highest in eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merger and acquisition fees rose 13 percent, as Goldman 
remained the top advisor worldwide so far this year, yet the 
backlog of pending investment banking fees fell during the 
quarter amid a slowdown of announced deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asset management revenue rose 10 percent to $1.16 billion 
as funds under management swelled by $22 billion to $895 
billion, including $6 billion of new client money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue from securities services, which includes prime 
brokerage services for hedge funds, soared 29 percent to a 
record $985 million, in part as disruptions at rival banks such 
as Bear Stearns attracted new accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Principal investments revenue fell 7 percent to $725 
million of revenue, including a $214 million gain on its 
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's compensation and other expenses also fell more 
than expected, as the firm reduced headcount by 1 percent to 
31,495. It paid a lower income tax rate as more profit came 
from outside the United States, savings that accounted for 
about a third of the margin by which Goldman beat its estimates 
this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank reaffirmed it expects to increase employees this 
year by low single-digit percentage rates at a time Wall Street 
is slashing jobs. Goldman is aggressively expanding in Asia and 
other fast-growing regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares were down 21 cents at $181.88 in 
afternoon trading. The stock has fallen about 15 percent this 
year, outperforming a 20 percent drop in the Amex Securities 
Broker Dealer index .XBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Dan Wilchins; Editing by Andre

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An investor with a minority stake in 
Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) on Thursday urged Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to 
take its most recent offer for a partial investment directly to 
Yahoo shareholders and prove its merits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mark Nelson, a partner in Mithras Capital, which owns 1.7 
million Yahoo shares, said such a move by Microsoft would help 
shareholders gauge whether the proposal was truly superior to 
an advertising partnership Yahoo forged with archrival Google 
Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have not been able to have our opinion heard," Nelson 
told Reuters. "If (Microsoft) does indeed have a superior 
transaction they should flesh it out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft abandoned a $47.5 billion offer to buy all of 
Yahoo last month, but more recently discussed a transaction to 
take a 16 percent stake in Yahoo and buy its search business 
for $9 billion as it seeks a stronger foothold in online 
advertising. Talks broke down last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said its alternate deal was still open for 
discussion, though Yahoo maintains that selling its search 
business would be tantamount to giving up on future growth in 
the wider online advertising market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is our strong belief that there is an ideal solution to 
Microsoft's current impasse with Yahoo: Microsoft must take its 
'alternate transaction' ... directly to Yahoo shareholders via 
the upcoming proxy vote," Nelson wrote in a letter he said was 
e-mailed and faxed to Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo faces a proxy battle against billionaire investor 
Carl Icahn ahead of its annual shareholders meeting on August 
1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn proposed a full slate of nine directors to replace 
Yahoo's current board, though he initially launched his proxy 
battle to act as a catalyst for a Microsoft takeover deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn has yet to say if he will change his strategy now 
that Microsoft appears to be out of the picture. He told 
Reuters early this week he was studying the Yahoo partnership 
with Google that aims to improve its financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eric Jackson, another activist investor in Yahoo, this week 
proposed that shareholders vote for up to four Icahn board 
nominees rather than replace all the directors to preserve some 
stability at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nelson said he had not spoken with other Yahoo investors 
about his proposals, which include backing Icahn's full slate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're a substantial Yahoo shareholder who has strong 
opinions," Nelson said in an interview. "We believe we voice 
opinions that maybe other Yahoo shareholders have not thought 
about and may consider in the coming month."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo says the Google deal could add as much as $450 
million in operating cash flow within the first 12 months and 
leaves it open to working with other partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has said its proposal would deliver an additional 
$1 billion a year in operating profit for Yahoo and value its 
stake in the company at $35 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declined to comment. Yahoo officials were not 
immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares closed down 18 cents to $22.73 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle;

&lt;p&gt; Camp Rock , 8-10 p.m., Disney Channel)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Barry Garron&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - It's a felony to print 
money, but Disney, for all practical purposes, has found a way 
around that law. By adhering closely to its "High School 
Musical" formula and stretching the results over even more of 
its divisions, Disney has devised a way to generate coin more 
efficiently than the U.S. Mint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether "Camp Rock" actually outperforms "High School 
Musical" remains to be seen. But if it doesn't, it won't be for 
lack of corporate strategizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With "Camp Rock," Disney plucks another fresh face off its 
deep bench of young talent. Demi Lovato, a cast member on the 
Disney interstitial program "As the Bell Rings," plays Mitchie 
Torres, an aspiring singer and timid songwriter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All that stands between Mitchie and a fabulously successful 
career is attendance at fabulously expensive Camp Rock, which 
her parents can't afford. Then Mitchie's mom, a caterer, gets 
hired to do the cooking, which allows Mitchie to attend at a 
discount (cue the family hug).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the camp, we find a mean, rich, snooty blonde (Meaghan 
Jette Martin steps in for Ashley Tisdale), a smattering of 
minimorality lessons and a song-filled happy ending. Joe Jonas 
of the Jonas Brothers is at camp, too, serving as an instructor 
and a "really like" interest for Mitchie. The whole enterprise 
is so precisely formulated, you expect to see a final credit 
for quality control inspector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Matthew Diamond gets a solid enough performance 
and lots of toothy smiles from Lovato, who should remain a 
bankable Disney property for as long as she stays clothed on 
the Internet. Maybe even after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It takes nothing away from this genuinely talented group of 
kids to express even greater admiration for the promotion and 
marketing. Following Friday's premiere (with an audio simulcast 
on Radio Disney and a video simulcast on mobile devices), "Camp 
Rock" will be broadcast on ABC on Saturday, on ABC Family on 
Sunday and on Disney.com on Monday. From there, the ripple 
effect will carry merchandise and more replays to shores near 
and far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ConAgra Foods Announces New Licensing and Capabilities Agreement with the Procter &amp; Gamble Company

      Agreement Focuses On Proprietary Capabilities in Ingredient
                      Technologies and Packaging
OMAHA, Neb.--(Business Wire)--
ConAgra Foods, Inc. (NYSE:CAG) announced today a new licensing and
capabilities agreement with The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG)
that provides ConAgra Foods access to unique nutrition-enhancing food
ingredients and packaging capabilities related to sustainability,
ergonomics and design, as well as access to the vast amounts of
research associated with those technologies. Financial terms of the
agreement were not disclosed.

   Under the terms of the agreement, ConAgra Foods will be P's
exclusive licensee for a variety of P food ingredient and processing
technologies, including nutrition-enhancing ingredients like Calcium
Citrate Malate, trademarked Calsura. In addition, ConAgra Foods will
receive access to various packaging capabilities and technologies
owned by P These food and packaging technologies will have
application within a broad spectrum of current ConAgra Foods branded
products. Additionally, ConAgra Foods will have the option to purchase
all rights to certain technologies covered by the license.

   "P has a wealth of food technologies that we can use to deliver
new and improved products that drive health and wellness and create
unique competitive advantages for our business," said Al Bolles,
executive vice president, Research, Quality &amp; Innovation for ConAgra
Foods. "In addition, ConAgra Foods gains access to P's packaging
capabilities which will allow us to reduce costs and improve our
sustainability efforts. We'll also receive P's full institutional
knowledge and research for the licensed technologies and will leverage
that expertise in a variety of different ways."

   "P is a company of brands, and as a result we have technologies
and core expertise in many categories and capabilities," said Jeff
Weedman, vice president, External Business Development, P "I'm
really pleased that P's food technologies and packaging expertise
will help power ConAgra Foods' brands, many of which are enjoyed by my
own family. P looks forward to furthering its relationship with
ConAgra Foods."

   One of the nutrition-enhancing food ingredients included in the
agreement is Calsura, the trademarked name for Calcium Citrate Malate
(CCM), a form of calcium that can be used to fortify a variety of
foods and beverages. CCM is one of the most thoroughly studied
supplemental forms of calcium, having been tested in numerous clinical
trials involving children, teenagers, young adults, post-menopausal
women and senior adults. These studies have shown that the calcium in
Calsura is highly absorbable and builds stronger bones in both
children and adults.

   As part of the agreement, ConAgra Foods will be P's exclusive
licensee for Calsura in a number of food categories and will be given
access to all of P's research and clinical trials for this product.
In addition, ConAgra Foods will be given a license to utilize the
Calsura trademark in ConAgra Foods-owned branded products containing
CCM.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds investor interview, details, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michele Gershberg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - An investor with a minority
stake in Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) on Thursday urged Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) to take its most recent offer for a partial investment

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - At least three oil companies have expressed interest in taking over Exxon Mobil Corp's long-languishing leases at its Point Thomson oil field in Alaska, if the state succeeds in taking them away from the world's largest oil company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alaska is fighting a legal battle to yank the properties from Exxon and its partners for allegedly violating the terms of the leases by not developing the field's estimated hundreds of millions of barrels of oil and 8 trillion to 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three companies have told state officials they would like to buy and develop the leases, after the state formally takes back the properties, said Marty Rutherford, deputy commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are three major companies that have been very interested.

"The bottom line is the state law doesn't allow people to warehouse our leases with no activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She declined to name the companies but said they have promised to develop more rapidly than Exxon has. "They're very clear that they would be much better partners in that unit, that ex-unit, as they put it," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alaska legislators have speculated that Shell Oil was among the companies interested in the leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and its partners -- BP Plc, Chevron Corp and ConocoPhillips -- have not drilled on the Point Thomson leases since 1982, but maintain that they have met their commitments and have turned to the Alaska court system to fight for their leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has also said it is determined to embark on an aggressive development program this winter, including construction of an ice road, an airstrip and the drilling of multiple wells and the imminent hiring of Alaska-based contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig Haymes, Alaska production manager for Exxon Mobil, said the company's winter plans were part of a $1.3 billion development plan to which the partners have committed that will produce at least 10,000 barrels a day of liquids by 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a lot of incentive to produce hydrocarbons.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with fresh quotation in paragraph 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Yereth Rosen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska, June 19 (Reuters) - At least three oil
companies have expressed interest in taking over Exxon Mobil
Corp's (XOM.N) long-languishing leases at its Point Thomson oil
field in Alaska, if the state succeeds in taking them away from
the world's largest oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alaska is fighting a legal battle to yank the properties
from Exxon and its partners for allegedly violating the terms
of the leases by not developing the field's estimated hundreds
of millions of barrels of oil and 8 trillion to 9 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three companies have told state officials they would like

clear that they would be much better partners in that unit,
that ex-unit, as they put it," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alaska legislators have speculated that Shell Oil (RDSa.L)
was among the companies interested in the leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and its partners -- BP Plc (BP.L), Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) -- have not drilled on the
Point Thomson leases since 1982, but maintain that they have
met their commitments and have turned to the Alaska court
system to fight for their leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has also said it is determined to embark on an
aggressive development program this winter, including
construction of an ice road, an airstrip and the drilling of
multiple wells and the imminent hiring of Alaska-based
contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Craig Haymes, Alaska production manager for Exxon Mobil,
said the company's winter plans were part of a $1.3 billion
development plan to which the partners have committed that will
produce at least 10,000 barrels a day of liquids by 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have a lot of incentive to produce hydrocarbons. All
around the world, wherever I've worked, that is what is in our

block, likely under special terms detailing development and

years, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State Rep. Les Gara, an Anchorage Democrat, said Exxon and

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with talks rescheduled for next week, paragraph 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Randy Fabi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, June 19 (Reuters) - Nigeria's senior oil workers'
union PENGASSAN said on Thursday it will resume talks with
Chevron Corp (CVX.N) after the government intervened late on
Wednesday to avert an imminent strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Since the government has created a platform to continue
talks, we are still hoping the strike won't happen," PENGASSAN
Secretary General Bayo Olowoshile told Reuters, but added there
was still "lots of fear and suspicion" among Chevron workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A second union official said three-party talks were
rescheduled for early next week from Friday to ensure all
stakeholders could be in Abuja for the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's output from Nigeria is around 350,000 barrels per
day (bpd), of which its equity share is around 129,000 bpd, and
a strike could sharply cut the country's output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, a strike by an oil workers union at Exxon Mobil
Corp's (XOM.N) unit in Nigeria shut down nearly all the
company's 800,000 bpd production in the West African country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks between the union and Chevron management broke down on
Wednesday but the oil ministry intervened at the eleventh hour
to avoid strike action, saying it had persuaded the U.S. energy
giant to reduce its expatriate work force in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PENGASSAN has been demanding the removal of the company's
expatriate director, saying he has too many foreign staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Olowoshile said there were still issues to be resolved,
including union demands over safety concerns. But he was
optimistic that industrial action was not imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked if there would be a strike, he said: "I don't see it
in the immediate future."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - PIMCO's Bill Gross, who manages the world's largest bond fund, said on Thursday that he still holds some of the largest banks' corporate debt, including Citigroup Inc, despite the problems hitting the banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gross said in an interview that he continues to hold the "high-quality" debt of banking companies because they represent good long-term value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gross, chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, or PIMCO, told Reuters that, in addition to Citibank, he remains a holder of the debt of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Deutsche Bank, and Spain's Banco Santander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gross -- who manages the $130 billion PIMCO Total Return Fund -- joins other big bond managers, including Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Boston-based Loomis Sayles, in buying and holding on to the corporate credits of major investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Fuss, who helps oversee more than $100 billion in fixed-income securities, had been purchasing the debt and convertible preferred securities of Lehman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many banks have raised capital and cut their dividends as the housing and credit market crises deepen further than many investors expected. Since last year, exposure by financial institutions globally to subprime mortgage debt and structured finance products has resulted in more than $400 billion of write-downs and losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deleveraging process will continue to be painful, Gross said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The financial system is deleveraging, which noticeably affects financials, but ultimately reflects negatively on our entire economy since it is finance- and consumption-oriented," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia KBW Bank Index of 24 large banks dropped to its lowest since October 2002 on Wednesday, weighed down by sharp losses among regional banks, many of which are being forced to cut their dividends and raise capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Export-driven sectors are "holding up the rest of the market," Gross said. But he quickly added that export-driven economies are vulnerable if developing economies continue to tighten policies by way of higher interest rates and currency revaluations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil, of course, is not helping matters," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jennifer Ablan in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Collaboration to Include Early Establishment of 22nm Photomask
                                Process
TOKYO--(Business Wire)--
Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. (Toppan Printing; Head office:
Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo; President &amp; CEO: Naoki Adachi) today announced that
it has entered into a new development agreement with IBM that covers
the last phase of 32nm photomask process development, and all phases
of 22nm photomask process development. This joint development will
take place at IBM's Burlington photomask facility in Essex Junction,
VT., starting in June 2008.

   Photomasks are used to transfer semiconductor chip circuits onto a
silicon wafer, and this photolithography process is a critical first
step in semiconductor production. Semiconductors have become
increasingly sophisticated due to growing demand for
telecommunications devices and highly complex and multifunctional
digital consumer electronic products. Therefore, it is vital that
semiconductor and photomask manufacturers work closely together to
develop the advanced lithography technologies that will be needed to
produce future-generation semiconductor chips. In order to keep pace
with this changing technological environment, Toppan Printing and IBM
started joint development of photomasks for 45nm semiconductors in
2005, and expanded the scope of their activities to include 32nm
development in 2007.

   Toppan Printing has developed a 32nm photomask process at its
facility in Asaka, Japan. As part of the activities under the new
development agreement, Toppan Printing will work with IBM to integrate
the Toppan Printing process into the 32nm photomask process that
Toppan Printing and IBM will jointly develop, thus potentially
optimizing the performance of the jointly developed process.

   As for the 22nm semiconductor generation, the industry is
considering implementation of many new technologies such as EUV
lithography and nano-imprint, but many technical issues remain
outstanding. So IBM has determined to pursue with Toppan Printing the
joint development of a 22nm photomask process by technical innovation
of ArF immersion lithography, the current mainstream technology for
the manufacture of 32nm photomasks.

   IBM is known as an innovative semiconductor manufacturer always
leading the industry in semiconductor process technology, material
development and implementation. The photomask joint development
efforts of Toppan Printing and IBM have aided the wafer process
development conducted by IBM and certain of its wafer process
development collaborators in East Fishkill, NY. Specifically, Toppan
Printing and IBM have manufactured and provided 45nm and 32nm
photomasks in support of 45nm and 32nm wafer process development
activities, and expect as well to manufacture and provide 22nm
photomasks in support of 22nm wafer process development activities.

   "This newest process development agreement with Toppan Printing
builds upon the success that our two companies have enjoyed while
working together over the past several years. This newest agreement
will help ensure we can continue to deliver innovative chip
applications for IBM systems and our OEM semiconductor clients," said
Michael Cadigan, General Manager, IBM Semiconductor Solutions. "This
collaborative effort builds upon our joint progress at 45nm and 32nm
and sets us on a path to deliver the photomasks needed for
next-generation chip manufacturing production. IBM is very proud of
its relationship with Toppan Printing."

   "It is a great pleasure for us to enter into a new joint
development agreement with IBM, the world's most advanced
semiconductor processing company, to the coming generation of 22nm,"
said Naoki Adachi, president of Toppan Printing. "During the past
three years of joint work, we have been nurturing a strong
collaboration as well as a highly sophisticated technical development
capability. We believe this joint initiative will place IBM and Toppan
Printing at the forefront of advanced photomask technology
development, and thus will enable us to contribute to the
technological innovation in the world's semiconductor industry. Toppan
Printing is the only photomask manufacturer in the world with the
capability of providing high-quality photomask products in a timely
manner in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other Asian countries. This
joint development in cooperation with IBM will help Toppan Printing
become the world's premier photomask manufacturer at 22nm as well."

&lt;p&gt;AMEC Paragon Contributes to Successful Installation of Chevron's Takula Gas Processing Platform

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
AMEC, the international engineering and project management
company, announced today that subsidiary AMEC Paragon made significant
contributions to the successful installation of the Takula Gas
Processing Platform (TGPP), which recently has been completed in Block
0 offshore Angola.

   Located in approximately 186 feet (57 meters) of water, TGPP is
the newest platform to be installed by Chevron subsidiary Cabinda Gulf
Oil Company Limited (CABGOC) for the Cabinda Association.

   The project is a highlight of CABGOC's long-term Area A Gas
Management (AAGM) Program to reduce the routine flaring of produced
gas - both onshore and offshore. As engineering contractor to CABGOC,
AMEC Paragon provided front-end engineering design services for the
AAGM Program, followed by detailed engineering and procurement
assistance to Samsung Heavy Industries for the TGPP, which was built
at the Samsung Geoje shipyard, South Korea.

   "TGPP represents a major accomplishment for the Area A project as
it will provide additional compression and gas sweetening in Block 0,"
said Chevron Project Manager Bob King. "AMEC Paragon's comprehensive
detailed design work streamlined the material procurement and
fabrication phases of the project and contributed to safe and
successful platform installation. We look forward to commissioning and
start-up during the third quarter of 2008."

   Terrance Ivers, President of AMEC Paragon, added: "Our work helped
ensure the efficiency of the offshore installation effort, including
integration with the existing infrastructure. We also have worked in
close collaboration with Chevron to support its Incident and
Injury-Free (IFF) program over the past six years, leading to the TGPP
project's success and have supported other CABGOC flare reduction
projects in Area A since 2003."

   Bridge-linked to an existing platform, TGPP is a single-train
facility designed as a 5,000-metric ton, single-lift modular deck with
facilities to process approximately 100 million standard cubic feet
per day (scf/d) of sour gas for injection and delivery to the new
onshore Cabinda Gas Plant.

&lt;p&gt;Tightly Integrated Software from Wasp Barcode Technologies
 Simplifies the Creation of Barcodes for Use in Microsoft Word, Excel
                              and Access
PLANO, Texas--(Business Wire)--
With new software from Wasp Barcode Technologies, businesses can
improve efficiency and automate time-consuming processes by quickly
and easily adding barcodes to Microsoft(R) Word documents, Microsoft
Excel(R) spreadsheets and databases driven by Microsoft Access. Wasp
BarcodeMaker is an approved Microsoft Office Marketplace application
that seamlessly integrates with Microsoft Office including Office
2007, allowing users to create barcodes with the touch of a single
button.

   Wasp BarcodeMaker fully integrates into the toolbar (or ribbon) of
Microsoft Office applications. Users simply select text or numbers
within these programs and click the BarcodeMaker button. A barcode is
then created using one of a 13 barcode symbologies provided. Once a
barcode is created, it can be used in a wide range of applications,
including:

   --  Creation of shadow books or product scan pages used in retail
        or warehouse environments. These books include barcodes for
        multiple products, which might be too bulky, small or
        inconvenient to tag with individual barcode labels. Rather
        than lifting and scanning these items at a cash register, the
        shadow book can be more easily scanned.

   --  Addition of barcodes to invoices, which can be saved as .pdf
        files for e-mailing or printing.

   --  Addition of barcodes to mail-merge documents, enabling better
        tracking of special offers, customer responses and more.

   --  Addition of barcodes to simple product packages designed in
        Word

   "Businesses are looking for ways to improve efficiency and
productivity," said Tom O'Shea, general manager for Wasp. "Something
as simple as a barcode can be a huge time-saver, but many business
owners fear they would be too complex or difficult to implement.

   "With BarcodeMaker, we are making it extremely easy and affordable
to use barcoding software," O'Shea added. "The software has been
integrated right into the applications small businesses are already
familiar with. They can simply click to create a barcode. No special
expertise is needed."

   When barcodes need to be edited, users simply double-click on the
barcode or change the underlying data in Word, Excel or Access. The
barcodes will be instantly updated. Barcode symbology, size, color,
location and density each can be changed with a single command.

   An advanced version, BarcodeMaker Pro provides additional 2D
symbologies. It also provides integration into Microsoft Access and
CrystalReports.

   Wasp BarcodeMaker is available immediately at a list price of $99.
A 10-user license pack is also available for $249. BarcodeMaker Pro is
available for $199, or $349 for a 10-user license pack. The software
can be purchased from direct marketing retailers such as CDW,
TigerDirect, PC Connection and Insight, leading retail stores such as
Fry's, and office super stores such as Staples. It is also available
through computer resellers including WaspLink(TM) value-added
resellers (VARs).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - XM Satellite and Sirius Satellite 
Radio shares tumbled on Thursday after Goldman Sachs slashed 
its price target on the two companies, who hope their proposed 
merger will soon pass its last regulatory hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; XM shares fell $1.84, or about 17.7 percent, to $8.54, and 
Sirius stock fell 33 cents, or about 13.5 percent, to $2.11 in 
active morning Nasdaq trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs cut its six-month targets on Sirius to $1.75 
from $2.25, and reduced its price target on XM TO $6.50 from 
$11.50. Goldman kept its "sell" rating on XM and "conviction 
sell" rating on Sirius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new outlook comes in the wake of news that U.S. Federal 
Communications Commission chief Kevin Martin supports the 
companies' merger plan, leading some to think that the deal's 
completion may come within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While the FCC draft circulation signaling the merger's 
likely ultimate conditioned approval generated a short-term 
lift to the stocks, we think any 'imminent merger' related 
strength has passed," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, Goldman said that the companies declining cash 
flow is "insufficient to justify valuations even giving credit 
for merger synergies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With core demand for satellite radio falling amongst the 
younger demographics, versus rapid increases for MP3 players 
and other new technologies ... we see long-term risk to the 
outlook," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Franklin Paul, editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, Jun 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and A.P. Moeller-Maersk owned Dansk Supermarked today
announced two significant five-year extensions to existing services
contracts. Dansk Supermarked is Denmark's largest chain of food and
general merchandise stores with approximately 40,000 employees and more
than 1,100 stores across Denmark and several other European countries.

    The first agreement, signed in March 2008, covers support, maintenance and
project enhancement services for SAP based applications. This agreement
extends an existing contract signed in 2005 and has also been tailored to
secure the legacy applications as part of Dansk Supermarked's ERP roadmap
until 2013.

    The second agreement, signed in April 2008, is a five-year strategic
outsourcing contract. The scope for this contract is SAP infrastructure
hosting and services, including UNIX capacity and operations, storage,
help desk and SAP operations services. This contract extends a 2004
agreement covering IT infrastructure across all hardware platforms.

    The new agreements allow Dansk Supermarked to focus resources on continued
international expansion together with the organizational implementation of
the large scale ERP program as IBM will be responsible for the
establishment and management of new systems and infrastructure and the
maintenance and support for applications. The significant growth of Dansk
Supermarked in recent years further consolidates the strong relationship
with IBM as full service provider as entering new markets requires
flexible and adaptable systems to enable a swift start for employees in
new business areas.

    "Dansk Supermarked and IBM have had a good and constructive collaboration
for several years. It is therefore natural to extend this collaboration to
include development and operation of our SAP solution which is important
in supporting Dansk Supermarked's continued growth," says Alan Jensen,
CIO at Dansk Supermarked.

    "Retail is one of the most competitive industries in the world, and
timely, accurate information is vital to productivity and cost control,"
says Sven Kolstrup, Country Executive, Global Technology Services, IBM
Denmark. "IBM offers an unmatched breadth and depth of services that
drive business results for clients like Dansk Supermarked, allowing them
to focus on their customers."

    The new agreements will support Dansk Supermarked operations across
Denmark, the UK, Sweden, Poland and Germany.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N, subject of takeover speculation after a series of missteps, has hired investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to advise on strategy and aid its search for a new chief executive, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper, citing unidentified people familiar with the situation, said there has been speculation about a potential deal involving Wachovia since word leaked out that the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank had retained Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia, which has posted $5.3 billion of market related write-downs since last summer, named director Lanty Smith as an interim replacement for CEO Kennedy Thompson. The bank has slipped to sixth place among U.S. banks from fifth, while its share price plunged 68 percent over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the Journal reported Smith has told top executives at the bank that Wachovia intends to remain independent, citing the unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at Wachovia could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - A summit of conservative bishops challenging the worldwide Anglican Communion over homosexuality and biblical authority has got off to a shaky start after its leader could not enter Jordan for a planning session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigerian Archbishop Peter Akinola, whose campaign has raised the specter of schism in the 77-million strong Communion, was not allowed into Jordan from Israel on Wednesday to attend a pre-summit meeting of about 130 conservatives in Amman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders assembled in Amman left on Thursday for Jerusalem, where their Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON) summit will open on Sunday, GAFCON spokesman Rev. Arne Fjeldstad said by telephone from the Jordanian border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GAFCON, which says it represents about 35 million Anglicans mostly in Africa, Asia and Latin America, will be held less than a month before the 10-yearly Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops from around the world opens on July 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fjeldstad said Akinola was not denied entry into Jordan but gave up after several hours' delay at the border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was kept in bureaucratic limbo," he said. "They claimed that, as a diplomatic passport holder, he had to give advance warning that he was coming. He decided to go back to Jerusalem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planned for four days, the Amman meeting "wound up early" when GAFCON leaders learned "that previously granted permission for the Jordan consultation was deemed insufficient", Fjeldstad said in a statement late on Wednesday announcing the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISPUTE OVER BIBLICAL AUTHORITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 280 bishops are expected to be among more than 1,000 Anglican leaders due at the Jerusalem GAFCON on June 22-29. They plan to visit biblical sites including Bethlehem, birthplace of Jesus, and prepare a strategy for future action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are not planning a formal schism but many will not be among the 800 bishops due at the Lambeth Conference, which usually agrees doctrinal guidelines for member churches. Among the boycotters are bishops from Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Communion's crisis reflects a split between traditionalist churches in the so-called Global South -- where more than half of all Anglicans now live -- and liberal ones mostly in Britain, Canada and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2003 consecration of Anglicanism's first openly gay bishop, Gene Robinson of the U.S. Episcopal Church, deepened a rift, the root of which lie in a dispute over strict or liberal interpretations of the Bible and authority in the Communion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The authority of Scripture is a defining mark of Anglican identity," Ugandan Archbishop Henry Orombi says on the GAFCON website www.gafcon.org. "In the current Anglican crisis, we are at risk of losing our biblical foundation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says the faith spread by British missionaries will be redefined by those who were converted. "The younger churches of Anglican Christianity will shape what it means to be Anglican. The long season of British hegemony is over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative Anglicans say the Bible bans homosexuality while liberals argue that all people are equal under God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Communion's differences over homosexuality are not limited to the Robinson issue. The Church of England is investigating a service to bless the civil union of two gay clergymen held in London against Church rules on May 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Elizabeth Piper)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Camp Rock , 8-10 p.m., Disney Channel)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Barry Garron&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - It's a felony to print 
money, but Disney, for all practical purposes, has found a way 
around that law. By adhering closely to its "High School 
Musical" formula and stretching the results over even more of 
its divisions, Disney has devised a way to generate coin more 
efficiently than the U.S. Mint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether "Camp Rock" actually outperforms "High School 
Musical" remains to be seen. But if it doesn't, it won't be for 
lack of corporate strategizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With "Camp Rock," Disney plucks another fresh face off its 
deep bench of young talent. Demi Lovato, a cast member on the 
Disney interstitial program "As the Bell Rings," plays Mitchie 
Torres, an aspiring singer and timid songwriter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All that stands between Mitchie and a fabulously successful 
career is attendance at fabulously expensive Camp Rock, which 
her parents can't afford. Then Mitchie's mom, a caterer, gets 
hired to do the cooking, which allows Mitchie to attend at a 
discount (cue the family hug).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the camp, we find a mean, rich, snooty blonde (Meaghan 
Jette Martin steps in for Ashley Tisdale), a smattering of 
minimorality lessons and a song-filled happy ending. Joe Jonas 
of the Jonas Brothers is at camp, too, serving as an instructor 
and a "really like" interest for Mitchie. The whole enterprise 
is so precisely formulated, you expect to see a final credit 
for quality control inspector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Matthew Diamond gets a solid enough performance 
and lots of toothy smiles from Lovato, who should remain a 
bankable Disney property for as long as she stays clothed on 
the Internet. Maybe even after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It takes nothing away from this genuinely talented group of 
kids to express even greater admiration for the promotion and 
marketing. Following Friday's premiere (with an audio simulcast 
on Radio Disney and a video simulcast on mobile devices), "Camp 
Rock" will be broadcast on ABC on Saturday, on ABC Family on 
Sunday and on Disney.com on Monday. From there, the ripple 
effect will carry merchandise and more replays to shores near 
and far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Marilyn Huff said in a Thursday ruling that Microsoft owes Alcatel-Lucent a total of $512 million, which includes interest on the original award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a jury ruled for Alcatel-Lucent in April, Microsoft sought to have the ruling overturned. Last year, Microsoft was successful in having thrown out a separate $1.5 billion damages ruling over audio technology patents claimed by Alcatel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had always believed we had a strong case and are pleased that the judge agreed that the jury's thoughtful verdict was well reasoned and supported by the evidence," Alcatel-Lucent spokeswoman Mary Ward said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesman said the company said it plans to appeal the decision and is confident that the damages award will not be sustained on appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software maker joined Dell and Gateway to fight the suit over technology used in Microsoft software licensed by those computer manufacturers. Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent are locked in several patent disputes, including a suit over video-decoding technology in Microsoft's Xbox game console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the two patents it was found to have infringed upon related to technology that allows users to enter dates into calendars and another used in tablet computers to recognize patterns in handwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CANNES, France (Reuters) - A senior Microsoft executive on Friday criticized a new advertising deal between web search giants Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc., saying it would reduce competition in ad search and be bad for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin Johnson, President of the Platforms and Services Division at Microsoft, was speaking at the "Cannes Debate" moderated by Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of British advertising group WPP, alongside executives of Yahoo and AOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Yahoo agreed to let Google put search ads -- advertisements placed next to search results -- after announcing separately that on-again, off-again merger talks with Microsoft Corp had failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of the deal between the two ad search leaders has notably raised concern among advertisers it could drive up ad rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reacting to Hilary Schneider, Executive Vice-President of Yahoo's Global Partner Solutions division, who had described the deal as a "win-win", Johnson said: "If win is consolidating around 90 percent of the paid search with Google, you can say, ok, Google would do that as a win."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think that from an industry perspective that supports having choices and having a number of strong players in the advertising business," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on Microsoft's plans, he said: "So we are going to continue to invest. We are going to focus on our strategy and build a world class advertising platform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; editing by Tony Austin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Celebrity homemaker Martha Stewart has been denied entry to Britain because of her 2004 U.S. conviction for lying about a stock sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc, the company founded by Stewart, said the 66-year-old businesswoman had been planning to travel to Britain for business meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She has engagements with English companies and business leaders and hopes this can be resolved so that she will be able to visit soon," Charles Koppelman, chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Britain's Home Office, which runs the UK Border Agency, said it does not comment on individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to oppose the entry to the UK of individuals where we believe their presence in the United Kingdom is not conducive to the public good or where they have been found guilty of serious criminal offenses abroad," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stewart was found guilty of conspiracy, making false statements and obstruction of agency proceedings -- all stemming from her sale of stock in biotech company ImClone Systems Inc. on December 27, 2001. She was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of house arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michelle Nichols, editing by Philip Barbara)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - XM Satellite and Sirius Satellite 
Radio shares tumbled on Thursday after Goldman Sachs slashed 
its price target on the two companies, who hope their proposed 
merger will soon pass its last regulatory hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; XM shares fell $1.84, or about 17.7 percent, to $8.54, and 
Sirius stock fell 33 cents, or about 13.5 percent, to $2.11 in 
active morning Nasdaq trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs cut its six-month targets on Sirius to $1.75 
from $2.25, and reduced its price target on XM TO $6.50 from 
$11.50. Goldman kept its "sell" rating on XM and "conviction 
sell" rating on Sirius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new outlook comes in the wake of news that U.S. Federal 
Communications Commission chief Kevin Martin supports the 
companies' merger plan, leading some to think that the deal's 
completion may come within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While the FCC draft circulation signaling the merger's 
likely ultimate conditioned approval generated a short-term 
lift to the stocks, we think any 'imminent merger' related 
strength has passed," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, Goldman said that the companies declining cash 
flow is "insufficient to justify valuations even giving credit 
for merger synergies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With core demand for satellite radio falling amongst the 
younger demographics, versus rapid increases for MP3 players 
and other new technologies ... we see long-term risk to the 
outlook," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Franklin Paul, editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transaction Processing Proves Lucrative for MasterCard and Visa, says Turner Investment Partners Commentary

BERWYN, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Much like toll-bridge operators, MasterCard and Visa face little
competition and operate in a business -- the processing of credit-card
transactions -- with high barriers to entry. So they are relatively
free to raise fees and earn superior profits. That's the conclusion of
the latest Sector Focus commentary by four financial-services sector
analysts at Turner Investment Partners.

   Turner, an investment firm based in Berwyn, Pennsylvania,
publishes Sector Focus commentaries monthly as part of the continuing
efforts of its five analyst teams to monitor the market sectors for
its growth-stock portfolios.

   The commentary, entitled MasterCard and Visa: profitable toll
takers, was written by Pablo Echavarria, security analyst; David
Honold, security analyst/portfolio manager; Mark Turner, president and
senior portfolio manager/security analyst; and Rick Wetmore, security
analyst/portfolio manager. In the piece they observe that the profit
margins of both companies exceed 30% and estimate that "both
MasterCard and Visa can increase their earnings per share by at least
20% annually over the next two years."

   The analysts note that developing countries like Brazil and China
may hold the most promise for MasterCard and Visa's future growth. The
highest growth rates in credit-card use are in Latin America, the
Middle East, Asia, and Europe, in descending order. Latin America's
growth rate is 27%, compared with 13% in the U.S.

   They identify increased lawsuits from merchants, federal
legislation around credit-card fees, and online payment competitors
such as PayPal as business risks to the companies, but believe those
risks are unlikely to significantly impair MasterCard and Visa's
above-average earnings growth. "We think global traffic on MasterCard
and Visa's toll bridges should grow for years to come," they conclude.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs's (GS.N) bail-out of a $7 billion Structured Investment Vehicle shows investors are pushing hard for banks to clean up troubled assets -- and could speed up billions worth of new writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed restructuring of Cheyne Finance, together with accountancy firm Deloitte DLTE.UL, could cut a Gordian knot and free up a backlog of unsold toxic assets in a sellers-only market that has neither buyers, nor prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the deal, announced this week, may also be the starting point of a new round of bank writedowns, bringing new losses and overshadowing any resulting transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors are definitely pushing banks to kitchen-sink their bad assets," Jim Irvine, head of Structured Products at Henderson Global Investors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They want them to come out clean -- there's great concern that certain banks, including German banks, still haven't done that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets are still grappling with a huge overhang of devalued assets after the crisis, and Europe alone has a backlog of about $116 billion of unsold leverage loans that banks are feeling under pressure to offload, according to estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are billions of dollars worth of assets in SIVs -- off-balance sheet vehicles banks have set up to boost their financial firing power -- that need revaluing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In subprime mortgage-related assets, global banks have already disclosed losses of $165 billion or 80 percent of the forecast total, leaving the remainder still to be announced, according to Fitch ratings agency research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are wary of sudden losses such as those from UBS (UBSN.VX), the Swiss bank that wrote down assets in three consecutive rounds totaling $37 billion, making it Europe's biggest victim of the credit squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEEP DISCOUNTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sign just how much more money is still at risk, the Cheyne restructuring -- which aims to free assets in the SIV by pricing and selling some of the portfolio through an auction -- is expected to lead to steep discounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund's value -- $7 billion at receivership -- is expected to stand around $4 billion now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One restructuring banker, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said he expected a discount of five to 10 basis points in the auction, so that the portfolio could be sold for about 55 to 60 pence in the pound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The auction is likely to derive extremely low bids, given the volume of paper and the fact that few are expected to be sold," credit strategist Suki Mann at SocGen said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the much-awaited plan Deloitte will auction some 10 percent of the portfolio, to value the assets, a number that sources familiar with the situation said corresponds to the minority of creditors who want to cash out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will then set an off-balance-sheet investment vehicle that will issue securities to former SIV senior creditors, who will hold the rest of the assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Considering almost half of the SIV portfolio's underlying assets were linked to U.S. residential mortgages (...), the senior noteholders may crystallize significant losses," a recent research note by Calyon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cheyne deal is innovative because it offers senior creditors different options -- either cashing in or holding on to the assets -- despite the fact that they all are equally entitled to remaining value in the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARK-TO-MYTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sign the credit crisis is far from over, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers LEH.N last week announced plans to raise $6 billion, following its first quarterly loss as a public company. Goldman Sachs earlier this week disclosed losses of $775 million in credit products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banks' losses are partially based on their mark-to-model practices, which confuses the market because the valuations are not based on actual trades, but on models, with each bank using its own specific methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You price something but you don't know if anybody in the market is going to meet you at that price," a person familiar with the methods said, under the condition of anonymity. "You need real trades to be transparent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet slowly, transparency and liquidity are returning to even the most arcane corners of the market, allowing banks to reduce those assets that are exclusively valued by models, said Tom Jenkins, a credit analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Cheyne restructuring is a sign that regulators, auditors, rating agencies and powerful investors such as sovereign wealth funds are pushing banks to finally address the issue and price assets at a realistic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not in banks' interest to try to camouflage their assets," Jenkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Douwe Miedema)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 20 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Pepsi
Bottling Group Inc PBG.N to "neutral" from "underweight,"
saying the stock is trading at a discount compared with its
soft drink peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Valuation has come down to a level where we think there is
little downside relative to the group," analyst John Faucher
wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the analyst lowered his 2008 earnings estimate on
the company, citing lower volume expectations and continued
commodity pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Faucher said he expects higher oil prices and a challenging
cold drink environment to weigh on the company's margin.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An investor with a minority stake in Yahoo Inc on Thursday urged Microsoft Corp to take its most recent offer for a partial investment directly to Yahoo shareholders and prove its merits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Nelson, a partner in Mithras Capital, which owns 1.7 million Yahoo shares, said such a move by Microsoft would help shareholders gauge whether the proposal was truly superior to an advertising partnership Yahoo forged with archrival Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not been able to have our opinion heard," Nelson told Reuters. "If (Microsoft) does indeed have a superior transaction they should flesh it out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft abandoned a $47.5 billion offer to buy all of Yahoo last month, but more recently discussed a transaction to take a 16 percent stake in Yahoo and buy its search business for $9 billion as it seeks a stronger foothold in online advertising. Talks broke down last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its alternate deal was still open for discussion, though Yahoo maintains that selling its search business would be tantamount to giving up on future growth in the wider online advertising market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is our strong belief that there is an ideal solution to Microsoft's current impasse with Yahoo: Microsoft must take its 'alternate transaction' ... directly to Yahoo shareholders via the upcoming proxy vote," Nelson wrote in a letter he said was e-mailed and faxed to Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo faces a proxy battle against billionaire investor Carl Icahn ahead of its annual shareholders meeting on August 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn proposed a full slate of nine directors to replace Yahoo's current board, though he initially launched his proxy battle to act as a catalyst for a Microsoft takeover deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn has yet to say if he will change his strategy now that Microsoft appears to be out of the picture. He told Reuters early this week he was studying the Yahoo partnership with Google that aims to improve its financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Jackson, another activist investor in Yahoo, this week proposed that shareholders vote for up to four Icahn board nominees rather than replace all the directors to preserve some stability at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelson said he had not spoken with other Yahoo investors about his proposals, which include backing Icahn's full slate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're a substantial Yahoo shareholder who has strong opinions," Nelson said in an interview. "We believe we voice opinions that maybe other Yahoo shareholders have not thought about and may consider in the coming month."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo says the Google deal could add as much as $450 million in operating cash flow within the first 12 months and leaves it open to working with other partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said its proposal would deliver an additional $1 billion a year in operating profit for Yahoo and value its stake in the company at $35 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to comment. Yahoo officials were not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares closed down 18 cents to $22.73 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle; Editing by Brian Moss, Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) CEO said the company will not seek to make a spate of other Internet acquisitions in the wake of its failed bid for Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), the Financial Times reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation has emerged that Microsoft could try to buy Facebook, in which it already owns a small stake, the AOL division of Time Warner (TWX.N) and a slew of smaller concerns, the newspaper reported in its online edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People don't understand what they're talking about," Chief Executive Steve Balmer said in an interview with the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the end of the day, this is about the ad platform. This is not about just any one of the applications," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft abandoned a $47.5 billion offer to buy Yahoo last month, but had more recently discussed a deal to take a 16 percent in Yahoo and buy its search business for $9 billion as part of its effort to establish a stronger foothold in online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is waging a campaign to convince investors that its product range and brand make it more valuable than media peers and more like a consumer goods company -- but so far that has proved a hard sell on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On calls with analysts and at investor conferences since November, Chief Executive Bob Iger and Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs have argued that the second-largest U.S. entertainment company should be viewed as a stable global brand rather than a cyclical, hit-driven media business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we should be considered differently from our peers ... hopefully that translates into value as well," Iger said on Tuesday at the opening of the Toy Story Mania ride at Disney's California Adventure theme park in Anaheim, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney executives have been touting "the Disney Difference" -- the company's growing stable of characters, its ability to apply them to all its businesses and its growing global reach -- as elements that set the company apart from media rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts, including David Bank of RBC Capital Markets, say as long as Disney derives so much of its revenue from movies, TV and theme parks -- 93 percent in 2007 -- it will be valued as a media brand, especially in a down economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no way to get around the reality that Disney is a hit-driven business," Bank said, though he accepted that "a leverable brand does tend to get a premium" valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a multiple of 13.4 times estimated 2009 earnings, Disney shares trade above big names like Viacom Inc VIAb.N, at 10.6, and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), at 12.2. But its price-earnings ratio lags consumer companies with similar brand power, including Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) at 15.7 times 2009 earnings, Nike Inc (NKE.N) at 17.1, and Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N) at 16.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's share price, having climbed out of a trough around $23 shortly after Iger took over, has languished in the mid-$30 range for more than a year despite three years of double-digit earnings growth and $16 billion in share buybacks. Yet analysts who follow Disney have a median price target of $40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT'S THE ECONOMY...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the reason its (P/E ratio) is somewhat depressed is not because Disney is not a 'best of breed' brand -- it is concerns over the macroeconomy," Bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the same treatment as a global consumer brand like Nike, Disney needs a larger overseas presence, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst John Shanley said. Nike earns about 62 percent of its revenue abroad versus 20 percent for Disney, insulating Nike against sales and fashion cycles, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As Nike grows internationally, that seasonality becomes less of a factor," said Shanley, a senior athletic and footwear industry analyst. "There is much more cyclicality in footwear than you are going to find in the Walt Disney business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger and Staggs have argued that no other U.S. media brand can sell products around the world like Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really have the most valuable brand in global family entertainment and in much of the space that we occupy, (we are) the only real brand that matters," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executives say they have cushioned businesses against economic swings: by introducing moderately priced vacation packages and hotel rooms at its parks, testing online ad sales and distribution to hedge against weak TV ratings, and cutting movie output to focus on Disney-branded family fare that can sell across all its units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowell, Weedon  Co partner Douglas Christopher agreed that Disney's global brand equity is "great" but cautioned "you can't just take a brand like that and go into every market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney would have a hard time equating itself with consumer staples like Coca-Cola or Procter  Gamble because of its past initial difficulties in international markets, as well as the nature and pricing of its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you are talking about purchases of $5 or less -- staples -- you can make that argument better, which is why you see Procter  Gamble trading at the high end of the range of (P/E) multiples," Christopher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should instead reward Disney for its stable free cash flow and for fixing operational problems from the 1990s, as well as acknowledge its U.S. real estate assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have been delivering and the stock is the same price," Christopher said. "This is a company that is being valued as a sleepy old industrial company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in Disney's annual dividend, whose return is less than half that of Coke and PG, could also make "a lot of friends" in the investment community, Christopher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuna Amobi, senior media and entertainment analyst for Standard  Poors Equity Research, said that while "there is something to be said for Disney's ability to spawn new franchises and monetize them," it does not fit a consumer products mold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that would be short-changing the other assets they bring to the table," Amobi said, adding that with those assets comes volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ESPN and the parks are the main engines that are driving the main results of Disney," he said. "ESPN has been as steady as they come ... the biggest question mark is how the parks are going to hold up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Camp Rock , 8-10 p.m., Disney Channel)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Barry Garron&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - It's a felony to print 
money, but Disney, for all practical purposes, has found a way 
around that law. By adhering closely to its "High School 
Musical" formula and stretching the results over even more of 
its divisions, Disney has devised a way to generate coin more 
efficiently than the U.S. Mint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether "Camp Rock" actually outperforms "High School 
Musical" remains to be seen. But if it doesn't, it won't be for 
lack of corporate strategizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With "Camp Rock," Disney plucks another fresh face off its 
deep bench of young talent. Demi Lovato, a cast member on the 
Disney interstitial program "As the Bell Rings," plays Mitchie 
Torres, an aspiring singer and timid songwriter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All that stands between Mitchie and a fabulously successful 
career is attendance at fabulously expensive Camp Rock, which 
her parents can't afford. Then Mitchie's mom, a caterer, gets 
hired to do the cooking, which allows Mitchie to attend at a 
discount (cue the family hug).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the camp, we find a mean, rich, snooty blonde (Meaghan 
Jette Martin steps in for Ashley Tisdale), a smattering of 
minimorality lessons and a song-filled happy ending. Joe Jonas 
of the Jonas Brothers is at camp, too, serving as an instructor 
and a "really like" interest for Mitchie. The whole enterprise 
is so precisely formulated, you expect to see a final credit 
for quality control inspector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Matthew Diamond gets a solid enough performance 
and lots of toothy smiles from Lovato, who should remain a 
bankable Disney property for as long as she stays clothed on 
the Internet. Maybe even after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It takes nothing away from this genuinely talented group of 
kids to express even greater admiration for the promotion and 
marketing. Following Friday's premiere (with an audio simulcast 
on Radio Disney and a video simulcast on mobile devices), "Camp 
Rock" will be broadcast on ABC on Saturday, on ABC Family on 
Sunday and on Disney.com on Monday. From there, the ripple 
effect will carry merchandise and more replays to shores near 
and far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs  Co strategists urged 
stock investors on Monday to "underweight" U.S. financial and 
consumer shares, admitting it was wrong when it upgraded both 
sectors just seven weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The downgrades sparked selling in the two sectors as 
investors feared that weakening consumer demand and 
deterioration in the credit markets will weigh on 
profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We boosted our consumer discretionary and financials 
weights in May on the belief the sectors would benefit from 
bank recapitalizations and fiscal stimulus," Goldman 
strategists led by David Kostin wrote. "Our thesis was clearly 
wrong in hindsight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman had previously urged investors to overweight 
consumer stocks and maintain a neutral weight in financials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In afternoon trading, the Standard  Poor's Financials 
Index .GSPF was down 1.8 percent while the SP Consumer 
Discretionary Index .GSPD was down 1.1 percent. The SP 500 
.SPX, in contrast, was up 0.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the decliners was Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N, whose 
shares were down 3.4 percent after a Banc of America Securities 
analyst projected a wider loss for the securities firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others that fell included Citigroup Inc (C.N), down 2.6 
percent, Home Depot Inc (HD.N), down 4 percent, and General 
Motors Corp (GM.N), down 4.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Banks are what's weighing on the market," said Steve 
Goldman, a market strategist at Weeden  Co, citing the Goldman 
Sachs report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial stocks had fallen 18 percent since the May 5 
upgrade, compared with a 5 percent drop in the SP 500, Goldman 
said, as investors grew increasingly worried that more lenders 
would cut their dividends and conduct dilutive capital-raisings 
as losses mounted from mortgages and other debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumer discretionary stocks, which include such 
industries as cars, clothing and leisure, fell 7 percent in the 
same period, the Goldman strategists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many analysts have been concerned that the tax rebates the 
government began handing out earlier this year might not 
provide much stimulus for the U.S. economy as debt-burdened 
consumers use them to pay bills or buy increasingly expensive 
necessities such as food and gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, the strategists asked, "What sustains consumer 
spending after the tax rebate checks have been spent?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman urged clients to allocate 13 percent of their 
holdings in SP 500 stocks to financials and 7 percent to 
consumer discretionary stocks, compared with respective index 
weightings of 15.1 percent and 8.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The credit situation facing the consumer is still 
deteriorating, house prices are falling sharply, and 
unemployment is rising," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategists urged investors to overweight the energy, 
materials and information technology sectors, saying they will 
likely outperform in an environment of rising inflation and 
weakening consumer demand. It rates those sectors "overweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee, Dinesh Nair in Bangalore

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Billboard) - Culture Club frontman Boy George has been forced to cancel his North American summer tour after U.S. authorities refused to issue him a visa, citing looming legal issues overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George's 24-date North American trek was scheduled to begin July 11 at the House of Blues in Las Vegas, and wrap August 23 at the House of Blues in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the moment, Boy George cannot come to the United States of America because he has been refused permission to enter by the USA Administration," read a statement from the artist's management. "This is not in respect of anything he has done in the past but because he is facing a trial in November in London for something that happened in April last year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George was arrested last year after a 28-year-old male escort from Norway accused the singer/DJ of false imprisonment and assault. George later denied the allegations and was released on bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"George's lawyers in London have absolutely forbidden us to speak about the facts of that case and all I can say is that George is astounded at the decision and is having lawyers here in the States look at it in the hope that someone will change their mind," the statement continued. "George really would love to come to America and repay his American fans loyalty and that is why we are asking the US Authorities to reconsider their decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, George supported the release of his "Essential Mix" collection with a brief DJ-tour of the U.S. George has also toured and performed DJ sets in Australia, Asia, Europe and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Billboard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs  Co strategists urged stock investors on Monday to "underweight" U.S. financial and consumer shares, admitting it was wrong when it upgraded both sectors just seven weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downgrades sparked selling in the two sectors as investors feared that weakening consumer demand and deterioration in the credit markets will weigh on profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We boosted our consumer discretionary and financials weights in May on the belief the sectors would benefit from bank recapitalizations and fiscal stimulus," Goldman strategists led by David Kostin wrote. "Our thesis was clearly wrong in hindsight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had previously urged investors to overweight consumer stocks and maintain a neutral weight in financials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trading, the Standard  Poor's Financials Index .GSPF was down 1.8 percent while the SP Consumer Discretionary Index .GSPD was down 1.1 percent. The SP 500 .SPX, in contrast, was up 0.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the decliners was Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N, whose shares were down 3.4 percent after a Banc of America Securities analyst projected a wider loss for the securities firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others that fell included Citigroup Inc (C.N), down 2.6 percent, Home Depot Inc (HD.N), down 4 percent, and General Motors Corp (GM.N), down 4.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Banks are what's weighing on the market," said Steve Goldman, a market strategist at Weeden  Co, citing the Goldman Sachs report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial stocks had fallen 18 percent since the May 5 upgrade, compared with a 5 percent drop in the SP 500, Goldman said, as investors grew increasingly worried that more lenders would cut their dividends and conduct dilutive capital-raisings as losses mounted from mortgages and other debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer discretionary stocks, which include such industries as cars, clothing and leisure, fell 7 percent in the same period, the Goldman strategists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts have been concerned that the tax rebates the government began handing out earlier this year might not provide much stimulus for the U.S. economy as debt-burdened consumers use them to pay bills or buy increasingly expensive necessities such as food and gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides, the strategists asked, "What sustains consumer spending after the tax rebate checks have been spent?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman urged clients to allocate 13 percent of their holdings in SP 500 stocks to financials and 7 percent to consumer discretionary stocks, compared with respective index weightings of 15.1 percent and 8.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The credit situation facing the consumer is still deteriorating, house prices are falling sharply, and unemployment is rising," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategists urged investors to overweight the energy, materials and information technology sectors, saying they will likely outperform in an environment of rising inflation and weakening consumer demand. It rates those sectors "overweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee, Dinesh Nair in Bangalore and Ellis Mnyandu in New York; Editing by Deepak Kannan, Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - U.S. junk bond defaults may
rise more quickly than earlier thought as economic prospects
worsen and bank losses extend the credit crunch, Goldman Sachs
said in a report on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Contrary to a widespread view, covenant-lite loans, or
those with reduced protections for lenders, may also accelerate
the next wave of defaults, Goldman said. More than $89 billion
of covenant-lite loans were issued over the past two years,
according to Reuters Loan Pricing Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Credit is tight, shocks to profits are getting harder to
absorb, and the risks to our 4.5-to-6 percent high-yield
default forecast for 2008 are shifting to the upside," Goldman
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Economic fallout from the credit crunch will get worse
before it gets better as mortgage losses at banks mount,
Goldman said. Regional banks in particular will find it more
difficult than large banks to make up capital losses, "and this
will provide the credit crunch with a second wind," Goldman
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank said it has also changed its long-held
view that covenant-lite loans would delay defaults. Previously,
Goldman believed that with fewer covenants, or loan terms, for
companies to violate, there would be fewer events to trigger
defaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After looking at default data from the early 1990s,
however, Goldman found that covenant violations were not the
key catalysts for defaults. "The overwhelming majority of
defaults occur for the most conventional of reasons: inability
to make interest payments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Covenants, on the other hand, give banks the negotiating
power to change a company's strategy and preserve its credit
quality, Goldman found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That happened with several homebuilders that violated loan
covenants when they ran into trouble last year, Goldman said.
Forced to renegotiate loan agreements, many builders liquidated
land and home inventory to improve their balance sheets,
postponing and reducing the odds of default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A free-wheeling financing environment allowed many
companies to arrange loans without such protective covenants in
recent years, however. Nearly $67 billion of covenant-lite
loans were issued last year, on top of almost $23 billion in
2006, according to Reuters Loan Pricing Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it may also have taken too much comfort from
the fact that few companies have debt maturing over the near
term. Even if companies do not have bonds or loans to roll
over, they may still face tighter terms from nervous
suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frontier Airlines FRNTQ.PK, for example, recently filed
for bankruptcy protection after saying its credit card
processor, First Data, wanted to hold back credit card payments
until Frontier met a reserve requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inflation concerns are also raising credit risks because
the Federal Reserve will have to keep interest rates tighter
than conditions warrant, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A widely expected pick-up in the default rate is already
well on schedule, Goldman noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Standard  Poor's, the U.S. junk bond default
rate has risen to 1.89 percent from a 25-year low of 0.97
percent at the end of 2007 and should hit 4.7 percent within a
year. There is also a 20 percent chance that it could go as
high as 8.5 percent, SP said in a report last week.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch places the following classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Series
2007-FL1 on Rating Watch Negative:

   --$11.9 million class RS-1 at 'AA-';

   --$12.8 million class RS-2 at 'A+';

   --$15.6 million class RS-3 at 'A';

   --$11.1 million class RS-4 at 'A-';

   --$15.4 million class RS-5 at 'BBB+';

   --$13.2 million class RS-6 at 'BBB';

   --$7.6 million class RS-7 at 'BBB-'.

   The Negative Watch placements are due to the receipt of the
Resorts International Servicer reported year-end (YE) 2007 with net
cash flow that is significantly less than issuance. Fitch will review
the financial information in detail as well as market performance. As
a result of this analysis, downgrades of several notches are possible.
The trust portion of the Resorts International loan consists of a
$120.2 million senior trust component and $98.7 million in subordinate
rake (RS) classes. The loan is secured by three casino/ hotel
properties located in Atlantic City, NJ and Tunica, MS. The total debt
on the properties, including the trust portion, totals $506.3 million
and includes $233.6 million in subordinate debt outside the trust.

&lt;p&gt;Rally Software Announces Agile Lifecycle Management for Microsoft Visual Studio Team System

      Joint Webinar Demonstrates Improved Development Visibility,
             Collaboration and Productivity in Agile Teams
BOULDER, Colo.--(Business Wire)--
Rally Software Development Corp.(R) today announced support for
Microsoft Visual Studio Team System to drive improved development
visibility, collaboration and productivity in Agile teams. Rally will
demonstrate this functionality during a webinar on Wednesday, June 25,
2008 at 1:00 p.m. EDT.

   As teams adopt Agile practices, the faster pace of iterative
development requires enhanced project visibility and team
collaboration. To meet this need, Rally and Microsoft Corp. have each
developed sets of tools for project planning and development that
support the increased velocity of Agile teams. By leveraging
connectors between Rally's Agile project management solution and
Visual Studio Team System 2005 and 2008, all team members gain
real-time visibility across source code assets and build results
through a connection into Rally's collaborative Agile planning
dashboards.

   "This connection between Rally's lightweight Agile lifecycle
management solution and Visual Studio Team System brings new value to

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, June 23 (Reuters) - Russian oil firm Gazprom Neft
(SIBN.MM) said on Monday it has suspended work at its two
projects with U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N) in the Arctic
Yamal-Nenets region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Gazprom Neft and Chevron have decided to suspend work in
(Yamal). It hasn't been as promising as previously thought,"
Gapzrom Neft's spokeswoman Natalya Vyalkina said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two years ago Gazprom Neft and Chevron formed the Northern
Taiga NefteGaz joint venture, set up by the companies to jointly
produce hydrocarbons in the West Siberian region. Gazprom Neft
owns 75 percent of the venture and Chevron holds the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week Gazprom Neft president Alexander Dyukov said the
firm would be willing to work on another deposit with Chevron
besides those in the joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the spokeswoman on Monday said an additional deposit
would most likely be part of the original joint venture
agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The joint venture has not been liquidated, we'll think
about which other areas we can develop," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of gas export monopoly Gazprom
(GAZP.MM), produced around 43 million tonnes of oil last year,
flat on 2006, has been fighting declining production since its
former owner, billionaire Roman Abramovich, sold the firm, then
called Sibneft, to the gas giant in 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Katya Golubkova, writing by Amie

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Nick Tattersall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAGOS, June 23 (Reuters) - Nigeria's senior oil workers'
union began strike action at U.S. energy giant Chevron (CVX.N)
on Monday but said it had not yet shut down any production,
pending further talks with the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A limited form of protest has started but we have not yet
gone deep. We have not shut down the oilfields, but
administrative functions are affected," Lumumba Okugbawa, deputy
secretary general of the PENGASSAN union, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said union representatives will travel to the Nigerian
capital Abuja for talks with the federal government about the
labour dispute, after negotiations with Chevron management
reached deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron confirmed that PENGASSAN members had declared a work
stoppage but said it was "continuing to engage all the
stakeholders" through dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is still too early to comment on any potential impact of
the declared work stoppage on our operations," Chevron
spokeswoman Margaret Cooper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's output from Nigeria is around 350,000 barrels per
day (bpd), of which its equity share is around 129,000 bpd. A
strike at the firm could further cut Nigeria's production,
already driven down by militant attacks on oil facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil Minister Odein Ajumogobia said on Sunday the world's
eighth largest oil exporter was producing around 1.8 million
barrels per day (bpd) before the most recent attacks, less than
two thirds of its 3 million bpd installed output capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The central bank said on Monday that oil output in the first
three months of the year had totalled just under 187 million
barrels, or around 2.05 million barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fears of supply disruption in Nigeria, the world's eighth
biggest oil exporter, have contributed to a rise in global crude
prices to record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, a strike by an oil workers' union at Exxon Mobil's
(XOM.N) unit in Nigeria shut down nearly all of the company's
800,000 bpd production in the West African country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron branch of PENGASSAN has been demanding the
transfer of the expatriate managing director from Nigeria,
accusing him of violating safety standards, having too many
foreign staff and a lack of respect for Nigerian workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks between the union and Chevron management broke down
last Wednesday but the oil ministry intervened at the eleventh
hour to avoid strike action, saying it had persuaded the U.S.
firm to reduce its expatriate workforce in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PENGASSAN later said there were still issues to be resolved,
including union demands over safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has more than 2,000 employees in Nigeria, of whom 90
percent are Nigerian, according to its Web site.

&lt;p&gt;June 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded BlackRock Inc

&lt;p&gt;June 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added United States Steel

 US Steel replaces Nucor Corp (NUE.N) on Goldman's conviction

$210. The brokerage said it expects rising steel prices to be
sustainable as growth in world demand should exceed supply for
several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said U.S. Steel's plan to increase the price
of oil country tubular goods more than 25 percent should boost
revenue by about $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also raised its 2008 earnings estimates on U.S.
Steel to $17.30 from $16.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Steel's shares were up 3 percent at $188.04 in early

&lt;p&gt;--  "New paradigm" of drug development, combining efforts of the National
        Institutes of Health and The Scripps Research Institute with leading
        translational biotech and pharmaceutical companies EyeCyte and Pfizer

    --  Collaboration seeks to develop new cell-based treatments for neovascular
        and degenerative retinal disease
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


EyeCyte, Inc., an early stage stem/progenitor cell-based ophthalmology research
and development company based in La Jolla, California, today announced that it
has secured its Series A funding through an agreement with Pfizer. The financing
will fund the company into 2010 and will be primarily used to drive product
development of the company's initial clinical target, diabetic retinopathy.

Under the terms of the deal, Pfizer has invested $3 million in Series A
Preferred shares of EyeCyte. Pfizer will be the sole pharmaceutical partner and
will have an Advisory and Board role, helping to facilitate technology
applications that will have meaningful pharmaceutical and patient impact. Pfizer
will also have right of first refusal for a buy-out of EyeCyte or its
technologies.

"EyeCyte is delighted to have attracted Pfizer as an investment partner", said
Mohammad A. El-Kalay, Ph.D., president and Chief Executive Officer, EyeCyte. "We
are very pleased with the terms of our collaboration and believe that Pfizer
shares our goal of building a premier ophthalmology research and development
organization with an emphasis on stem/progenitor cell based therapies."

Building on research into the causes of, and potential treatments for, retinal
disease by Professor Martin Friedlander, M.D., Ph.D. and his laboratory at The
Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, EyeCyte will use the properties of blood
and bone marrow-derived progenitor cells of patients to pursue the development
of treatments for acquired and inherited retinal diseases including diabetic
retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, retinal vascular occlusive disease,
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa.

Currently, available treatments benefit sub-populations of patients with these
diseases, but there remains a great unmet medical need. Published and
unpublished preclinical data from the Friedlander laboratory demonstrates that
specific populations of cells may be therapeutically useful for the treatment of
retinal vascular and degenerative diseases. These progenitor cells target sites
of retinal ischemia and neovascularization where they stabilize the vasculature
in animal models.

"We are excited about the potential that this collaboration offers to the
millions of patients suffering from vascular or degenerative eye diseases, such
as macular degeneration," said Corey Goodman, Ph.D., president, Pfizer
Biotherapeutics and Bioinnovation Center. "Not only does this collaboration with
EyeCyte complement our internal research efforts, it is a great example of the
investment Pfizer is making in academic and biotech partnerships to accelerate
research in emerging areas of science where there is still great medical need.
With the financial support and complementary ophthalmology expertise from
Pfizer, Dr. Friedlander and his team at EyeCyte will now be able to further
advance this highly promising research in an environment that allows them to
keep their autonomy, culture and entrepreneurial spirit. This approach truly is
a win-win proposition for Pfizer, for EyeCyte and for human health, and we are
excited to be at the forefront of incubating highly promising research, like
this, through our partnership model."

The preclinical research at Friedlander's laboratory that led to these novel -
and potentially, therapeutically useful - discoveries has been funded through
grants from the National Eye Institute (NEI) of the National Institutes of
Health (NIH). In June 2007, his lab was awarded a five-year grant from the NEI
to support the development of the use of adult stem cells as a therapy for
treating the most common types of vision loss. The particular funding mechanism
used to support this work, an "R24," is an NEI/NIH program specifically designed
to facilitate collaborative research for the therapy of visual disorders.

"Something interesting and potentially very important is happening here - we may
be seeing discoveries of investigator-initiated research, funded by NIH, pushed
to the clinic more rapidly by the investigators through creative collaborations
among non-profits, biotech, and big pharma," said Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D.,
director of the National Eye Institute. "Our goal in the next several years is
to develop this new approach to treating retinal diseases to the point it can be
tested in the clinic," said Dr. Friedlander. "While the NIH grant goes a long
way towards enabling us to translate the pre-clinical work into clinical
application, the recent investment by Pfizer in EyeCyte provides us the means,
in part, to meet the extraordinary expenses associated with developing a
clinical product that we can take to the FDA for evaluation and, ultimately, to
patients."

"Working with EyeCyte and Pfizer," says Friedlander, "I have every confidence
that we will bring this potential therapy to the point of being tested in the
clinic. This is an extraordinary opportunity to take highly novel laboratory
concepts, test them experimentally, and translate them into therapies for the
treatment of blinding eye diseases. The combination of NIH-funded pre-clinical
research, the tremendous environment at a non-profit like The Scripps Research
Institute and the strengths of translational biotech and pharmaceutical
organizations like EyeCyte and Pfizer are the new paradigm that will enable us
to more rapidly translate science from the bench to therapeutics for the
bedside."

&lt;p&gt;Pitney Bowes MapInfo Unveils Location Intelligence Component for IBM(R) Cognos 8 Business Intelligence Software

    Viewing Data in Map Format Enables Organizations to Better Spot
  Trends and Discover New Opportunities, Resulting in Better Business
                               Decisions
TROY, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Pitney Bowes MapInfo, the leading global provider of location
intelligence solutions, today introduced the Location Intelligence
Component (LIC) for IBM(R) Cognos 8 business intelligence software.
Customers in all industries, including retailer Camping World and
public entity MassHousing, the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency,
can now incorporate location analysis into their IBM Cognos 8 BI
applications to more efficiently monitor and analyze their enterprise
data.

   "The LIC provides an easy to use graphical interface that enables
users to leverage the geographic dimension within their data to
enhance traditional business intelligence analysis," said Jon Winslow,
director of business development at Pitney Bowes MapInfo. "Users are
now able to more easily identify geographic patterns and trends in
their operations and share these insights across their enterprise.
Armed with this visual information, organizations are better
positioned to address problem areas and more quickly and confidently
take advantage of emerging opportunities."

   Camping World in Bowling Green, Kentucky

   With 80 retail stores nationwide, Camping World uses the LIC
together with IBM Cognos 8 BI to determine new retail sites, and to
develop merchandising and marketing campaigns across its recreational
vehicle products and services catalog, retail and Web site businesses.
Prior to adding location intelligence, the process of visually
providing relevant data from all its businesses to the company's
executive management team was a challenge. By combining location
intelligence and business intelligence, these analyses are even more
effective and tasks that used to take days, can be completed in hours.
Product sales data can be quickly mapped to identify which areas of
the country are generating revenue and what are the most popular
products by region. As a result, Camping World is able to develop
promotions targeted to specific regions of the country, and execute
more targeted marketing plans about which products to showcase at
regional RV shows.

   MassHousing, Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency

   MassHousing, the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency, works with
a plethora of building and financial partners to provide affordable
housing to the Commonwealth's residents. Since the organization shares
information with many partners, it needed a way to easily and
effectively map and share geographic data across the state. By
integrating the LIC into its existing Cognos dashboard, MassHousing
can now present data in a geographic context. The LIC is packaged in a
format for users across the organization to easily query data and
create accurate maps in a matter of minutes. For example, MassHousing
can examine how many communities are within a 10-minute walk to public
transportation and create demographic layers over that map to better
understand what locations are being under-utilized.

   "Pitney Bowes MapInfo location intelligence offering provides our
BI customers with an opportunity to geo-spatially analyze their
corporate data as well as offer decision makers powerful visual
insight into that data from a geographic perspective. This extends the
value of their business information for greater productivity and
operational effectiveness," said Don Campbell, CTO, Cognos, an IBM
Company. "Across industries, customers are now able to add location
specific analysis to business intelligence capabilities to quickly and
effectively solve business challenges like creating balanced sales
territories, finding gaps in geographic coverage to create routing and
workforce efficiencies and putting stores closer to customers through
site location analysis."

    End-Users to Benefit from Up to 112 Cores and 448 GB of Shared
          Memory in a Single Virtual Symmetric Multiprocessor
CUPERTINO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
ScaleMP, the leader in virtualization solutions for high-end
computing, today announced that vSMP Foundation(TM) Standalone, its
patent-pending virtualization software, is now available for the IBM
BladeCenter(R) HS21 XM blade server. In conjunction with IBM
BladeCenter H, ScaleMP enables the aggregation of up to 14
dual-processor blades within an integrated chassis to create a single
virtual symmetric multiprocessor (SMP). Customers are now able to
aggregate up to 112 Intel(R) Xeon(R) processing cores and up to 448 GB
of shared memory, benefiting from one of the densest high-end x86
systems available on the market today.

   "I am pleased to announce the support of vSMP Foundation
Standalone for the IBM BladeCenter system, proving once more our
solution's flexibility and further enhancing its value to High
Performance Computing (HPC) customers," said Shai Fultheim, founder
and CEO of ScaleMP. "vSMP Foundation Standalone enables the creation
of a cost-effective, high-performance system that is ideally suited
for scalable environments across many industry segments such as
financial services, manufacturing, life sciences and energy. Our
solution reduces the operational cost and complexity normally

multiple cluster nodes into a single system

   The IBM BladeCenter H offers up to 14 blades in a compact 9U
chassis, and comes with an integrated InfiniBand switch, and up to
four hot swappable, redundant, load-balancing power supplies. Power,
cooling and networking devices are aggregated in the rear of the
chassis, optimizing space and power. Customer's investment is
protected since each blade module is fully upgradeable in the future
to newer CPUs, as they become available. Customers can start small and
scale over time as their needs grow. The IBM BladeCenter HS21 XM
delivers two high-performance Dual-Core or Quad-Core Intel Xeon
processors coupled with up to 32 GB maximum memory per blade. It
supports multiple I/O expansion capabilities, as well as local drives.

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS, June 23 (Reuters) - Nigeria's senior oil workers'
union said on Monday it hoped to resume talks this week over a
labour dispute with Chevron (CVX.N) but that it would ask state
oil firm NNPC to intervene if it failed to reach a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The PENGASSAN union has been demanding the removal of the
company's expatriate director, saying he has too many foreign
staff, and has threatened a walk-out if its demands are not met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are hoping that the talks will continue this week. There
is no specific date as yet," PENGASSAN Secretary General Bayo
Olowoshile told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we are unable to resolve, we will be meeting with the
group managing director of NNPC by Friday to find a resolution,"
he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's output from Nigeria is around 350,000 barrels per
day (bpd), of which its equity share is around 129,000 bpd. A
strike at the firm could further cut Nigeria's output, already
driven down by militant attacks on oil facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, a strike by an oil workers union at Exxon Mobil's
(XOM.N) unit in Nigeria shut down nearly all the company's
800,000 bpd production in the West African country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks between the union and Chevron management broke down
last Wednesday but the oil ministry intervened at the eleventh
hour to avoid strike action, saying it had persuaded the U.S.
energy giant to reduce its expatriate workforce in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PENGASSAN has said there are still issues to be resolved,
including union demands over safety concerns.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is waging a campaign to convince investors that its product range and brand make it more valuable than media peers and more like a consumer goods company -- but so far that has proved a hard sell on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On calls with analysts and at investor conferences since November, Chief Executive Bob Iger and Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs have argued that the second-largest U.S. entertainment company should be viewed as a stable global brand rather than a cyclical, hit-driven media business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we should be considered differently from our peers ... hopefully that translates into value as well," Iger said on Tuesday at the opening of the Toy Story Mania ride at Disney's California Adventure theme park in Anaheim, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney executives have been touting "the Disney Difference" -- the company's growing stable of characters, its ability to apply them to all its businesses and its growing global reach -- as elements that set the company apart from media rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts, including David Bank of RBC Capital Markets, say as long as Disney derives so much of its revenue from movies, TV and theme parks -- 93 percent in 2007 -- it will be valued as a media brand, especially in a down economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no way to get around the reality that Disney is a hit-driven business," Bank said, though he accepted that "a leverable brand does tend to get a premium" valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a multiple of 13.4 times estimated 2009 earnings, Disney shares trade above big names like Viacom Inc, at 10.6, and Time Warner Inc, at 12.2. But its price-earnings ratio lags consumer companies with similar brand power, including Coca-Cola Co at 15.7 times 2009 earnings, Nike Inc at 17.1, and Procter  Gamble Co at 16.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's share price, having climbed out of a trough around $23 shortly after Iger took over, has languished in the mid-$30 range for more than a year despite three years of double-digit earnings growth and $16 billion in share buybacks. Yet analysts who follow Disney have a median price target of $40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IT'S THE ECONOMY...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the reason its (P/E ratio) is somewhat depressed is not because Disney is not a 'best of breed' brand -- it is concerns over the macroeconomy," Bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the same treatment as a global consumer brand like Nike, Disney needs a larger overseas presence, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst John Shanley said. Nike earns about 62 percent of its revenue abroad versus 20 percent for Disney, insulating Nike against sales and fashion cycles, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As Nike grows internationally, that seasonality becomes less of a factor," said Shanley, a senior athletic and footwear industry analyst. "There is much more cyclicality in footwear than you are going to find in the Walt Disney business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger and Staggs have argued that no other U.S. media brand can sell products around the world like Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really have the most valuable brand in global family entertainment and in much of the space that we occupy, (we are) the only real brand that matters," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executives say they have cushioned businesses against economic swings: by introducing moderately priced vacation packages and hotel rooms at its parks, testing online ad sales and distribution to hedge against weak TV ratings, and cutting movie output to focus on Disney-branded family fare that can sell across all its units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowell, Weedon  Co partner Douglas Christopher agreed that Disney's global brand equity is "great" but cautioned "you can't just take a brand like that and go into every market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney would have a hard time equating itself with consumer staples like Coca-Cola or Procter  Gamble because of its past initial difficulties in international markets, as well as the nature and pricing of its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you are talking about purchases of $5 or less -- staples -- you can make that argument better, which is why you see Procter  Gamble trading at the high end of the range of (P/E) multiples," Christopher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should instead reward Disney for its stable free cash flow and for fixing operational problems from the 1990s, as well as acknowledge its U.S. real estate assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have been delivering and the stock is the same price," Christopher said. "This is a company that is being valued as a sleepy old industrial company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in Disney's annual dividend, whose return is less than half that of Coke and PG, could also make "a lot of friends" in the investment community, Christopher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuna Amobi, senior media and entertainment analyst for Standard  Poors Equity Research, said that while "there is something to be said for Disney's ability to spawn new franchises and monetize them," it does not fit a consumer products mold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that would be short-changing the other assets they bring to the table," Amobi said, adding that with those assets comes volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ESPN and the parks are the main engines that are driving the main results of Disney," he said. "ESPN has been as steady as they come ... the biggest question mark is how the parks are going to hold up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's Changsha Zoomlion Industry Science and Technology Development said on Wednesday it had won a joint bid with Goldman Sachs and two other investors to buy Italy's Compagnia Italiana Forme Acciaio SpA, or Cifa, for 271 million euros ($421.9 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavy machinery maker Zoomlion 000157.SZ will pay 163 million euros for a 60 percent stake in the Italian construction machinery maker, while Goldman (GS.N), Mandarin Capital Partners and Chinese private-equity firm Hony Capital would hold the remaining 40 percent, the company said in a statement to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Chinese machinery makers are building up their presence overseas in hopes of eventually competing with global leaders such as Caterpillar (CAT.N).

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Bill Gates' retirement from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) later this week marks the end of an era for the software giant, thrusting CEO Steve Ballmer into the spotlight during one of the most challenging periods in the company's history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The departure of Gates, who will remain the company's non- executive chairman, coincides with an escalating rivalry with Google Inc (GOOG.O) and other competitors who are using the Internet to chip away at Microsoft's software dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Gates taking a step back, the weight of Microsoft's future falls squarely on Ballmer's shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has to think about some radical changes within the organization to not just fix the online business, but start innovating in some of the other ones," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the threat of new online rivals, Ballmer, who replaced Gates as the company's chief executive in 2000, made one of the boldest moves in Microsoft's history, with a $47.5 billion bid to buy Web pioneer Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The failure to clinch a deal has highlighted the company's shortcomings in its Web business and the urgency with which it needs to act or risk slipping farther behind Google in the growing and lucrative world of online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say Microsoft, which has grown from 30 employees in 1980, the year Ballmer joined the company, to almost 90,000 now, is not agile enough to keep up with rivals and its massive bureaucracy has stifled innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft just hasn't come up with anything all that innovative," said Andrew Loechl, director at Eagle Harbor Asset Management.

It is a position being advocated by the man tapped to replace Gates as Microsoft's chief software architect, Ray Ozzie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Microsoft, Gates will work full-time at his charitable foundation, the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, but he will spend one day a week at the company, taking part in special projects in areas such as Web search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Helm, director of research at independent research firm Directions on Microsoft, said Gates' departure will not mean a major change in direction for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bill and Steve broadly agree on company strategy as a whole, especially in the view point of an investor.

Gates still holds nearly a 9 percent stake in the company, while Ballmer owns roughly 4.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has downplayed the exit of Gates, emphasizing that Ballmer has been the main decision maker for nearly a decade, with Gates taking on a more technical role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Ballmer's reign as CEO, the company has managed to protect its dominant market share in Windows and Office. It has also built an $11 billion server business and entered the video game industry with the Xbox console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer has grown Microsoft's revenue to an estimated $67 billion this year from $25 billion in fiscal 2001. Net profit will nearly triple to an estimated $21 billion, according to analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the positive. The negative has been the company's stock price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, Microsoft's stock has fallen 52 percent. It has underperformed the Nasdaq, down 42 percent over the period, and SP 500, down 11 percent.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co is waging a campaign 
to convince investors that its product range and brand make it 
more valuable than media peers and more like a consumer goods 
company -- but so far that has proved a hard sell on Wall 
Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On calls with analysts and at investor conferences since 
November, Chief Executive Bob Iger and Chief Financial Officer 
Tom Staggs have argued that the second-largest U.S. 
entertainment company should be viewed as a stable global brand 
rather than a cyclical, hit-driven media business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think we should be considered differently from our peers 
... hopefully that translates into value as well," Iger said on 
Tuesday at the opening of the Toy Story Mania ride at Disney's 
California Adventure theme park in Anaheim, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney executives have been touting "the Disney Difference" 
-- the company's growing stable of characters, its ability to 
apply them to all its businesses and its growing global reach 
-- as elements that set the company apart from media rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some analysts, including David Bank of RBC Capital 
Markets, say as long as Disney derives so much of its revenue 
from movies, TV and theme parks -- 93 percent in 2007 -- it 
will be valued as a media brand, especially in a down economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is no way to get around the reality that Disney is a 
hit-driven business," Bank said, though he accepted that "a 
leverable brand does tend to get a premium" valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a multiple of 13.4 times estimated 2009 earnings, Disney 
shares trade above big names like Viacom Inc, at 10.6, and Time 
Warner Inc, at 12.2. But its price-earnings ratio lags consumer 
companies with similar brand power, including Coca-Cola Co at 
15.7 times 2009 earnings, Nike Inc at 17.1, and Procter  
Gamble Co at 16.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's share price, having climbed out of a trough around 
$23 shortly after Iger took over, has languished in the mid-$30 
range for more than a year despite three years of double-digit 
earnings growth and $16 billion in share buybacks. Yet analysts 
who follow Disney have a median price target of $40.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IT'S THE ECONOMY...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think the reason its (P/E ratio) is somewhat depressed 
is not because Disney is not a 'best of breed' brand -- it is 
concerns over the macroeconomy," Bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To get the same treatment as a global consumer brand like 
Nike, Disney needs a larger overseas presence, Susquehanna 
Financial Group analyst John Shanley said. Nike earns about 62 
percent of its revenue abroad versus 20 percent for Disney, 
insulating Nike against sales and fashion cycles, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As Nike grows internationally, that seasonality becomes 
less of a factor," said Shanley, a senior athletic and footwear 
industry analyst. "There is much more cyclicality in footwear 
than you are going to find in the Walt Disney business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger and Staggs have argued that no other U.S. media brand 
can sell products around the world like Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We really have the most valuable brand in global family 
entertainment and in much of the space that we occupy, (we are) 
the only real brand that matters," Iger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The executives say they have cushioned businesses against 
economic swings: by introducing moderately priced vacation 
packages and hotel rooms at its parks, testing online ad sales 
and distribution to hedge against weak TV ratings, and cutting 
movie output to focus on Disney-branded family fare that can 
sell across all its units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crowell, Weedon  Co partner Douglas Christopher agreed 
that Disney's global brand equity is "great" but cautioned "you 
can't just take a brand like that and go into every market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney would have a hard time equating itself with consumer 
staples like Coca-Cola or Procter  Gamble because of its past 
initial difficulties in international markets, as well as the 
nature and pricing of its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you are talking about purchases of $5 or less -- 
staples -- you can make that argument better, which is why you 
see Procter  Gamble trading at the high end of the range of 
(P/E) multiples," Christopher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors should instead reward Disney for its stable free 
cash flow and for fixing operational problems from the 1990s, 
as well as acknowledge its U.S. real estate assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have been delivering and the stock is the same 
price," Christopher said. "This is a company that is being 
valued as a sleepy old industrial company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An increase in Disney's annual dividend, whose return is 
less than half that of Coke and PG, could also make "a lot of 
friends" in the investment community, Christopher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tuna Amobi, senior media and entertainment analyst for 
Standard  Poors Equity Research, said that while "there is 
something to be said for Disney's ability to spawn new 
franchises and monetize them," it does not fit a consumer 
products mold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think that would be short-changing the other assets they 
bring to the table," Amobi said, adding that with those assets 
comes volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "ESPN and the parks are the main engines that are driving 
the main results of Disney," he said. "ESPN has been as steady 
as they come ... the biggest question mark is how the parks are 
going to hold up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) was criticized on Tuesday for being slow to resolve problems in the technical documentation it was required to provide to rival software makers as part of its 2001 antitrust settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems were a major part of discussions at a hearing held to review Microsoft's compliance with the pact that settled findings the company had abused its dominance in personal computer operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was required to issue licenses for companies who want to write programs for the Windows computer operating system, and also provide technical information about Windows to help make the programs work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department and states, who were also party to the antitrust suit, complained that Microsoft had acted too slowly in resolving technical information problems, known as "technical document issues" or TDIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that the TDIs are not declining," said Jay Himes, chief of the New York attorney general's antitrust bureau. Himes estimated that each Microsoft employee working on the problems cleared one per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it was convinced the issue would be resolved. "There are TDIs but I thought everyone agreed that there would be TDIs" for as long as the oversight was in place, Microsoft attorney Rick Rule told the interim compliance hearing before District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 1,276 outstanding TDIs in the 20,000 page document, said Microsoft spokesman David Bowermaster. "We're doing our best to close them as fast as we identify them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A full compliance hearing has been set for September 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, said on Tuesday it has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) for advice on its loan portfolio, after the housing slump caused mortgage-related losses to soar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is performing analytics on our loan portfolio to evaluate various alternatives," said Christy Phillips-Brown, a Wachovia spokeswoman. She declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiring came after reports last week that Wachovia also retained Goldman to help it find a new chief executive. Wachovia ousted Ken Thompson from that position three weeks ago following a series of financial, legal and regulatory problems, less than a month after replacing him as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia said it ended March with $480.5 billion of net loans, up 14 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonperforming assets, however, more than quadrupled over that time to $8.37 billion, largely because of mounting defaults on adjustable-rate mortgages that let borrowers pay less than the interest due. Such low payments can cause amounts owed on so-called "option ARMs" to rise even as home prices fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This implies to us that the bank will mark down a sizable package of loans so that they can be more easily sold," wrote Richard Bove, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann  Co. "This could be a meaningful charge to second-quarter earnings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Option ARMs, which Wachovia calls "Pick-a-Pay" mortgages, were a specialty of Golden West Financial Corp, a California lender that Wachovia bought for $24.2 billion in October 2006 just as the five-year housing boom was peaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Problems with the $121.2 billion option ARM portfolio, as well as with other loans, led Wachovia in April to raise $8.05 billion of capital and cut its dividend 41 percent. They also resulted in a $708 million loss from January to March, the bank's first quarterly loss since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia shares had through Monday fallen more than 55 percent this year, prompting frequent speculation the bank could be a takeover target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia shares rose 94 cents to $17.86 on the New York Stock Exchange shortly before the close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Bangalore; editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

offer to buy a 16 percent stake in the company as well as
Yahoo's search business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The information we have is thin, but what one source is
saying (is) that Microsoft is talking a price lower than the
$33 they were offering (per share) when the talks disintegrated
in May," the TechCrunch report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reports of a rekindling of talks gave hope to Yahoo
investors incensed over what was perceived as the botched
handling of Microsoft's initial overtures in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The options in Yahoo are very susceptible to any sort of
speculation on a strategic partnership that might put the 
company on a more resolute path," said Rebecca Engmann Darst,
equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers Group. She cited
heavy buying in Yahoo July calls valued at $22.50 and $25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo has said it remained open to more talks with
Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, CNET Networks Inc's technology news website
News.com reported on its blog that Microsoft was willing to
sweeten its earlier offer for a partial purchase of Yahoo's
search business, citing one unidentified major investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares fell 17 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $27.80
on Nasdaq after the reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gillis said Yahoo does not have the luxury of time to stay
independent as U.S. economic weakness appears to be sapping the
pace of growth in the display advertising business -- ads that
are prized by corporate marketers and serve as Yahoo's revenue
mainstay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Canaccord Adams analyst warned that even if Yahoo does
not disappoint Wall Street with its second-quarter report due
out later in July, then the economic drag on advertising would
likely show up by its third-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A miss would be brutal to the stock," he added.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades and assigns a Distressed Recovery rating
to the following classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp., (JPMCC) series 2005-CIBC13:

   --$10.2 million class N downgraded to 'B-' from 'B';

   --$6.8 million class P downgraded to 'CCC/DR1' from 'B-'.

   In addition, Fitch affirms the following classes:

   --$45.5 million class A-1 at 'AAA';

   --$317.8 million class A-1A at 'AAA';

   --$130.2 million class A-2 at 'AAA';

   --$250 million class A-2FL at 'AAA';

   --$206.4 million class A-3A1 at 'AAA';

   --$25 million class A-3A2 at 'AAA';

   --$751.7 million class A-4 at 'AAA';

   --$135.1 million class A-SB at 'AAA';

   --$272.1 million class A-M at 'AAA';

   --$187 million class A-J at 'AAA';

   --Interest-only class X-1 at 'AAA';

   --Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA';

   --$54.4 million class B at 'AA';

   --$23.8 million class C at 'AA-';

   --$44.2 million class D at 'A';

   --$34 million class E at 'A-';

   --$37.4 million class F at 'BBB+';

   --$30.6 million class G at 'BBB';

   --$34 million class H at 'BBB-';

   --$10.2 million class J at 'BB+';

   --$17 million class K at 'BB';

   --$10.2 million class L at 'BB-'.

   --$6.8 million class M at 'B+'.

   Fitch does not rate the $37.4 million class NR.

   The downgrades of classes N and P are due to projected losses on
the seven specially serviced loans (3.0%). Two loans (1.4%) have
become specially serviced since the last Fitch rating action. Expected
losses would be fully absorbed by the non-rated class NR, however, are
expected to impact the credit enhancement to classes N and P.

   The rating affirmations reflect sufficient credit enhancement
levels and stable performance of the non-specially serviced loans
since the last Fitch rating action in March 2008. As of the June 2008
distribution date, the transaction has paid down by 1.6% to $2.68
billion from $2.72 at issuance.

   In total, 18 loans are considered Fitch loans of concern (10.6%)
due to declining performance, including the seven specially serviced
loans. The largest specially serviced loan (1.2%) is secured by a
589-unit multifamily property located in Randallstown, Maryland. The
loan is current, but it was transferred to special servicing in March
2008 because the borrower obtained an unauthorized mezzanine loan. The
special servicer and borrower are negotiating a workout, including a
potential payoff.

   The second (0.7%), third (0.3%), and fourth-largest (0.2%)
specially serviced loans / assets are all secured by student-oriented
multifamily properties located in Tallahassee, Florida. All of the
loans have the same sponsor. The collateral consists of eight
different properties with a total of 1,106 units. Loans on two of the
properties are 90 days late and in foreclosure. The other five
properties, formerly collateralizing one loan, are REO. Losses are
expected on the specially serviced assets.

   The DRA - CRT Office Portfolio (6.8%) is the largest loan in the
transaction. It is secured by sixteen office buildings with a total of
1.48MM square feet (sf). The buildings are located within four
different office parks in four different states. The loan has
exhibited diminished performance since issuance. The loan's debt
service coverage ratio (DSCR) and occupancy at issuance were 1.49
times (x) and 95.6%. As of Year End (YE) 2007, the servicer-reported
DSCR had fallen to 0.98x and occupancy was 84.7%. The decline in DSCR
and occupancy are both due to turnover of tenants. The loan matures on
October 1, 2010 and there are no extension options.

   The transaction has minimal near-term maturity risk as none of the
loans mature in 2008 or 2009 - 14.7% of the pool matures in 2010.

   Fitch's Distressed Recovery (DR) ratings are designed to estimate
recoveries on a forward-looking basis while taking into account the
time value of money.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Releases Four Powerful ''Buy'' Stocks: CocaCola FEMSA, Monsanto Company, Schnitzer Steel Industries and Owens-Illinois

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Four free stock picks are being made available today on Zacks.com.
The industry's leading independent research firm highlights one Zacks
#1 Rank Strong Buy or a Zacks #2 Rank Buy stock for each of the four
main styles of investing: Aggressive Growth, Growth &amp; Income,
Momentum, and Value.

   The four highlighted picks are: CocaCola FEMSA (NYSE: KOF),
Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON), Schnitzer Steel Industries (Nasdaq:
SCHN) and Owens-Illinois, Inc. (NYSE: OI).

   Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Four
daily picks are offered free at http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

   Zacks #1 Rank Stocks have nearly tripled the S 500 since 1988,
producing an average annual return of +30%. Performance has been
notable even during volatile and down times. For example, during the
last bear market, 2000-2002, the market tumbled -37.6% - but Zacks #1
Rank stocks gained +43.8%.

   Here is a summary of today's selected stocks that are now highly
rated by Zacks:

   Aggressive Growth - CocaCola FEMSA (NYSE: KOF)

   CocaCola FEMSA shares have recently pulled back as the overall
market has struggled, but this stock's performance in 2008 can still
be considered impressive. Trading at these levels, shares of FEMSA
look attractively priced, carrying a forward P/E multiple of 14.5X.
With the company's primary exposure coming from such booming South
American countries as Brazil, FEMSA is operating in the right place at
the right time.

   Growth &amp; Income - Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON)

   Monsanto is set to announce results for the fiscal third quarter
on June 25, prior to market open. Wall Street estimates have been
moving up ahead of the report. Four out of 12 covering analysts lifted
third-quarter earnings forecasts from last month's $1.33 per share to
$1.35. The most accurate projection is higher at $1.36. The company
recently hiked its quarterly dividend from 17.5 cents per share to 24
cents per share. The new dividend is payable on July 25, 2008, to
shareowners of record on July 3, 2008.

   Momentum - Schnitzer Steel Industries (Nasdaq: SCHN)

   Schnitzer Steel Industries has been a top-tier performer in 2008,
as the company's share price has more than doubled in price on the
heels of strong international demand and sustained pricing power.
Analyst estimates have continued to rise in accordance with the share
price, enabling this stock to maintain attractive valuations.

   Value - Owens-Illinois, Inc. (NYSE: OI)

   Owens-Illinois is seeing big global profits in glass containers as

   How to Regularly Access Picks from the Zacks Rank Discovery for
Free: http://at.zacks.com/?id=88

   Underlying the four free stock picks is a simple truth that first
appeared in a Financial Analysts Journal article published in 1979.
Leonard Zacks, a Ph.D. in Mathematics from M.I.T. found that "earnings
estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock
prices." Zacks #1 Rank is awarded to a stock when analysts sharply
upgrade their estimates of what the company will earn.

four daily picks free to those who register at

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (C.N) will likely post a second-quarter loss and suffer a possible $8 billion of fresh write-downs, while credit concerns will also weigh on JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) quarterly results, according to Merrill Lynch  Co analyst Guy Moszkowski.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analyst said recent comments from Citigroup management as well as falling home prices and rising subprime mortgage defaults suggest that "another round (of write-downs) is forthcoming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden said on a Deutsche Bank conference call that the bank could take substantial write-downs in the second quarter, raising concern that second-quarter earnings would be weaker than expected. Moszkowski also said write-downs will weigh on JPMorgan, and that the bank's shotgun acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos will likely result in increased markdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst also lowered his 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates for JPMorgan, and forecast a 2008 loss for Citigroup, saying he expects additional writedowns at both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial institutions globally have written down more than $400 billion in assets amid the credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moszkowski expects Citigroup to post a second-quarter loss of 50 cents a share, after earlier expecting profit of 39 cents a share. He also projected a full-year loss of 42 cents a share, after earlier expecting profit of 44 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst expects Citigroup in the second quarter to incur $5.1 billion of writedowns on collateralized debt obligations and subprime exposure; to boost reserves related to monoline insurers by $2.4 billion, and to write-down exposure to "Alt-A" mortgages by $423 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup has suffered more than $46 billion of write-downs and credit losses in the last three quarters. Though Moszkowski said the bank has substantial long-term value in its consumer and capital markets businesses, he said its "legacy of lax oversight .... will require years of remedial management."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMORGAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst said consumer credit is becoming increasingly stressed, and that this poses a risk to JPMorgan, one of the largest U.S. consumer lenders, with heavy exposures to such areas as credit card and home equity lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a consumer recession, JPMorgan is hard-pressed to avoid the pain entirely," Moszkowski added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst said there was also a "high risk" that JPMorgan could make a very large regional-bank acquisition. He expects such a deal to be seen as "opportunistically positive," as JPMorgan's management was likely do only a well-priced deal and execute it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moszkowski lowered his second-quarter profit per share estimate for JPMorgan to 61 cents from 86 cents. He cut his 2008 outlook to $2.79 a share from $3.30, and for 2009 to $3.88 a share from $4.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 17 analysts covering Citigroup, Moszkowski ranks second in accuracy of earnings estimates over the last four fiscal quarters and the last two fiscal years, according to Thomson Reuters data. He ranks tenth among 17 analysts covering JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moszkowski cut his price target on Citigroup stock to $20 from $23 and on JPMorgan stock to $42 from $46. He rates both stocks "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of both Citigroup and JPMorgan were up more than 2 percent at $18.95 and $37.62, respectively, in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, stock movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Entegris Inc
(ENTG.O) to "neutral," saying it sees better "relative value"
in the other names in semiconductor production equipment space,
sending its shares down as much as 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs analyst James Covello said the company's
significant underperformance has been driven by its margin
execution issues over the last 18 to 24 months. He previously
had a "buy" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also identified companies like Lam Research Corp
(LRCX.O), Advanced Energy Industries Ltd (AEIS.O) and Verigy
Ltd VRGY.O as his top picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Covello said Entegris' stock is down 34 percent since last
year, compared with a 13 percent fall in the SP 500 index
.SPX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He, however, said the company's unit-driven model should
offset the effects of the current capital expenditure driven
downturn and allow it to benefit from an expected rebound in
shipments in the latter half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Covello maintained his six-month price target of $8 on the
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were trading down 51 cents at $7.13,
after hitting a intraday low of $6.56 on Nasdaq earlier in the
day.

&lt;p&gt;Relations between France and China have soured in the run up to the Beijing Games after thousands of pro-Tibet protesters disrupted the torch Paris relay in April, trying to snatch the flame from a wheelchair-bound Chinese athlete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese nationalists subsequently called for a boycott of French goods and picketed outlets of French supermarket chain Carrefour in a number of Chinese cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French Foreign Ministry late last month said Beijing's official tourism body had urged tour operators to stop selling holiday packages to France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French ambassador to China Herve Ladsous said visa applications lodged in Beijing in recent weeks were down two-thirds on the same period last year, and that French officials had held discussions with their Chinese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were given the assurance that there had never been an order for tourism agencies to boycott France," Ladsous said in a transcript of a press briefing posted on the French embassy's website on Wednesday (www.ambafrance-cn.org).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have taken note of this assurance but note that the problem still remains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ladsous said that some of the fall was due to an official order discouraging officials from traveling overseas in the wake of the devastating earthquake in Sichuan last month, and a slow-down in outbound travel ahead of the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But there is more than that as France has been more directly touched and it is clear that the fall of two-thirds relates to Beijing, whereas in Shanghai, where the authorities did not give any instruction, the visas continued to be delivered at the same speed as before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruption of the Olympic torch relay in Paris sparked street protests and boycott calls targeting French companies in cities across China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French President Sarkozy fanned the discontent by refusing to say whether he would attend the opening ceremony on August 8, suggesting he would boycott the event unless China started talks with Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China blames the Dalai Lama for masterminding unrest in ethnic Tibetan areas in the country's far west in March with an eye to spoiling the August's Olympic Games. The Dalai Lama, who says he wants autonomy but not independence for Tibet, rejected the accusations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Nick Macfie and David Fox)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Chevron comment, edits)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Randy Fabi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, June 24 (Reuters) - Talks between Nigeria's oil
workers' union and Chevron (CVX.N) will resume on Thursday in an
effort to avert an all-out strike that could further slash
output from the OPEC producer, a top union official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Union workers continued a partial strike on Tuesday,
stopping administrative staff from getting to their offices in
Lagos for the second straight day, but oilfield operations were
not affected, said PENGASSAN Secretary General Bayo Olowoshile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This action is aimed at putting more pressure on management
ahead of talks," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three-party talks between the union, Chevron and the
government are planned for Thursday and Friday in the Nigerian
capital Abuja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company is continuing to engage all the stakeholders to
resolve all the issues through dialogue," said Chevron
spokeswoman Margaret Cooper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron branch of PENGASSAN has been demanding the
transfer of the expatriate managing director from Nigeria,
accusing him of violating safety standards, having too many
foreign staff and a lack of respect for Nigerian workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's output from Nigeria is around 350,000 barrels per
day, of which its equity share is around 129,000 bpd. A strike
at the firm could further cut Nigeria's production, already
driven down by militant attacks on oil facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fears of a fresh supply disruption in the world's
eighth-largest oil exporter helped push U.S. crude prices CLc1
near $139 a barrel earlier on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, a strike by an oil workers' union at Exxon Mobil's
(XOM.N) unit in Nigeria shut down nearly all of the company's
800,000 bpd output in the West African country.

&lt;p&gt;USTelematics Announces Integration of Microsoft MSN Gas Price Finder Into Voyager Mobile IPTV

   Live MSN Autos Feature to Guide Voyager-Equipped Cars to Lowest
Local Gas Prices With One Click
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
USTelematics, Inc. (OTCBB:UTLM), at the forefront of the
connected-car revolution, today announces that the Company's Voyager
in-car Mobile Internet Protocol TV will be integrated with Microsoft's
(NASDAQ:MSFT) MSN Autos Gas Price Finder, enabling drivers of cars
equipped with Voyager to find the best, closest fuel prices in real
time.

   Adding a GPS upgrade module to Voyager, at an additional cost to
consumers, will automatically activate the Gas Price Finder feature.
Voyager users will be able to click an on-screen button to
automatically feed their location to Microsoft's MSN Autos online gas
price facility. The gas pricing list will display in a popup window on
Voyager's screen, even during live TV play, and then the window will
automatically minimize itself after a few minutes.

   "Gas prices are a topic of high concern for people right now,"
said Howard Leventhal, Chief Executive Officer of USTelematics. "We
saw an opportunity to help folks deal with this serious economic issue
in a technology-enhanced way and decided to implement this feature in
Voyager." For a demonstration of how this system displays real time
gas prices in almost any U.S. zip code, see
http://autos.msn.com/everyday/gasstations.aspx?zip=Netx

   Aside from the additional cost of adding Voyager's GPS Module to a
Voyager installation, there will be no extra cost for using this Gas
Price Finder feature beyond the ongoing monthly cost of connecting
Voyager to EVDO broadband services.

   "In one respect this may be thought of as further economic
justification for subscribing to the wireless broadband services
required to connect your kids to live TV programs in the back seat,"
said Mr. Leventhal. "As we prepare Voyager to hand-off to others for
manufacturing and distribution, we continue to enhance its value and
functionality."

&lt;p&gt;  EATONTOWN, NJ, Jun 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Quintum Technologies, an innovator in VoIP technologies and a subsidiary
of Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: NWK), announced today that
IDC, an Italian integrator and Microsoft Certified Partner, has selected
Quintum's Tenor BX switch to support its Microsoft OCS environment with
VoIP connectivity.

    IDC had previously installed another vendor's certified gateway to
implement VoIP. However, IDC encountered a variety of problems with that
gateway -- including failures connecting to the toll-free numbers of
discount long distance providers. Quintum's superior ability to handle the
pre-connection messaging of these providers eliminated this problem.

    Quintum Tenor switches provide a complete, robust gateway solution for
Microsoft OCS environments that includes 'Any to Any' switching, built-in
SIP proxy services, support for analog devices, and remote-office
survivability.

    "Quintum Tenor switches are clearly superior to any other gateway that we
have used," said Valerio Capodacqua, Technical Director, IDC. "Only the
Tenor was able to meet all of our technical requirements -- thereby
enabling us to reap all the potential business benefits that convergence
offers. The Tenor switch also delivered higher voice quality, as measured
both objectively by Microsoft's monitoring tools and subjectively by IDC's
end-users."

    Capodacqua added that Quintum also provided IDC with strong technical
support.

    As a result of its positive experience, IDC is now implementing Tenor
switches at several customer sites throughout Italy.

    "Quintum's ability to accommodate nearly any type of existing network and
telecom infrastructure makes it a compelling choice for resellers and
integrators, as well as their customers," said Chuck Rutledge, Quintum's
VP of marketing. "We are very pleased to work closely with IDC to address
their customers' particular unique requirements."

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 24 (Reuters) - J.P.Morgan Securities upgraded Complete
Production Services CPX.N to "overweight" from "neutral," on
resource play exposure and potential earnings upside, and
raised its earnings estimates for the hydrocarbon reserves
developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said resource plays, which contribute to
nearly 80 percent of the company's revenue, would continue to
be the main driver of incremental U.S. drilling activity going
forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said it also expects additional earnings upside
potential at the company from increased growth capital
expenditure, acquisitions, and stronger pricing levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It raised its earnings estimates for the company to $2.45 a
share from $2.41 for 2008, and to $3.30 a share from $2.96 for
2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average expect the company to earn $2.41 a
share before items for 2008, and $2.93 a share before items for
2009, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, however, said 2008 and 2009 consensus
earnings estimates appeared too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P.Morgan also expects the company's growth strategy,
scaled back early in the first quarter, to re-accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With the U.S. land market now tightening, we believe CPX
will soon return to its aggressive growth strategy,
particularly in emerging shale plays like the Haynesville,
Bakken, and Marcellus," analyst Kevin Pollard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Complete Production shares closed at $34.80 Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange.  (Reporting by Deepti Govind in

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 24 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities began coverage
of global space-based image and information provider GeoEye Inc
GEOY.O with an "overweight" rating, noting the stock is
significantly undervalued and 2009 revenue would likely surge
as it launches its GeoEye-1 satellite in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage expects the shares to outperform after GeoEye
launches its next-generation high-resolution satellite on Aug
22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The successful launch of the satellite should lead to a 170
percent rise in the company's earnings before interest, taxes
depreciation and amortization on revenue growth of 50 percent
in 2009, said analyst Paul Coster in a research note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, GAAP earnings-per-share could decline due to
increase in depreciation expense, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GeoEye-1, which the brokerage assigns a success launch rate
of 95 percent or higher, is expected to offer leading
resolution compared to other satellites in the industry and the
company's long-term revenue should grow over 12 percent, the
analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the satellite-based earth imagery industry, the
brokerage said it is in the early stage and should grow at over
10 percent compound annual growth rate through 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of GeoEye closed at $18.04 Monday on the Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;First of Its Kind Network Built on Facebook Platform Creates a
One-Stop Resource for Small Business Owners
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today unveiled the Visa Business Network
(www.visabusinessnetwork.com), the first-ever application dedicated to
connecting small businesses on Facebook. The Visa Business Network has
been created with small businesses, for small businesses, and is a
unique environment built on Facebook Platform for the small business
arena. To celebrate this initiative, Visa will award a total of $2
million in Facebook advertising credit to help small business owners
reach new customers and drive new growth.

   The Visa Business Network combines Facebook Platform, and its
ability to deliver innovative applications on Facebook, with the
global leader in small business payment services, Visa. This inventive
new site can help small business owners easily tap into a global
network of peers and advisers from among the more than 80,000 small
businesses already on Facebook. It will also provide small business
owners with valuable business tools and help them efficiently identify
and target thousands of prospective customers. This one-stop resource
will empower small business owners to expand their customer base,
manage their business better and exchange ideas with other businesses
and trusted advisers.

   "Visa has been working closely with small businesses for many
years, and we know that they are anything but small. Small businesses
have big ideas, big expectations and big ambitions. We established the
Visa Business Network to help them thrive and grow," said Antonio
Lucio, Chief Marketing Officer, Visa Inc. "Working with Facebook, Visa
is breaking new ground by harnessing social networking to connect
business owners. We are putting the power of the network in the users'
hands, and it will be fascinating to see how the community evolves."

   Visa focuses on enabling small businesses to pursue their passions
by providing payment products that help them succeed. The Visa
Business Network builds on that by providing small businesses with
networking capabilities that will help to grow their business, get
support to manage it more effectively. In creating the Visa Business
Network, Visa and Facebook focused on these three needs:

   --  Connect with others -- Networking is an essential part of a
        small business' success; it helps owners grow and manage their
        business. The Visa Business Network is a simple way to find
        and network with other business owners for new business, best
        practices, advice or support. The network enables small
        business owners to search for and connect with relevant
        businesses.

   --  Manage more efficiently-- Small business owners can access
        tools kits from content partners that provide easy-to-use
        products, including Google Docs(TM), Google Calendar(TM), and
        Google Sites(TM), to help increase business efficiency. Small
        business owners can also quickly get an online presence
        through Google Maps(TM). In partnership with The Wall Street
        Journal marketing, small business owners can also "Ask the
        Experts." They can connect with leading small business experts
        from Entrepreneur by participating in Q forums and expert
        advice columns. Also in partnership with All Business,
        Forbes.com, Fast Company and Microsoft, Visa is providing
        small business owners with exclusive access to small-business
        news feeds, videos, blogs and editorial commentary about
        issues such as cash flow management, new ways to attract
        customers and cost management.

   --  Grow business -- Small business owners can grow their business
        by reaching more than 80 million active users worldwide and
        more than 80,000 small businesses on Facebook. People can stay
        connected with their friends and peers and the people around
        them. Facebook users communicate and share information through
        the social graph -- digital mapping of the connections and
        relationships between people that exist in the real world.
        It's the power of the social graph that helps business owners
        connect with one another and connect with their customers on
        Facebook. In addition, Facebook Ads allow businesses to
        deliver relevant advertising that can be targeted to users
        based on their interests.

   "Facebook plays a central role in people's daily lives by helping
them communicate and share information with the people they know,"
said Dan Rose, vice president of business development at Facebook.
"With more than 80 million active users worldwide, Facebook gives
small businesses a great opportunity to connect with their customers
and other business owners. We are proud to work with Visa on the Visa
Business Network to bring even more tools to small businesses."

   Business owners Vivian Wang and Ingrid Chen, of San
Francisco-based Viv, Co. jewelry, see the Visa Business Network
as a valuable tool to help find advisers, peers and new customers. "As
a small business, connection is extremely important to our ability to
grow," said Wang and Chen. "Just as we have to stay connected to
trends in jewelry and fashion, we also have to connect with our
customers to remain competitive. With the Visa Business Network,
building and maintaining those relationships will be easy and access
to expert resources will help grow our business."

   Getting Started Couldn't Be Easier

   Joining the Visa Business Network is not only simple, but
rewarding. Visa will provide the first 20,000 U.S.-based businesses
that join the Visa Business Network with a $100 Facebook Ads credit,
allowing business owners to reach the exact audience they want on
Facebook through advanced targeting capabilities. Facebook Ads allow
businesses to deliver relevant advertising for users based on their
interests as well as targeting categories such as location, age and
gender. Small business owners can quickly create their Facebook
account by logging on to Facebook. From there, they can visit
www.visabusinessnetwork.com on Facebook to join the Visa Business
Network.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 24 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan upgraded U.S. defense
contractor Raytheon Co (RTN.N) to "overweight" from "neutral"
and said it still sees the defense sector to be relatively safe
in a period of economic weakness and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, it downgraded SAIC Inc SAI.N, whose customers
include the U.S. armed services and NASA, to "neutral" from
"overweight," citing the stock's recent outperformance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raytheon shares have lost about 13 percent since April 24,
underperforming the SP 500 .SPX by 13 percent, while SAIC
shares have gained 8 percent since Jan. 9, outperforming the
SP 500 by 14 percent, JP Morgan noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which sees defense stocks outperforming the
broader market, said it still expects Raytheon's revenue to
grow about 8 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009, with the
potential for more sustained international growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The upcoming second-quarter earnings could be a catalyst
for reversing the recent underperformance of the defense stocks
and there is a possibility for higher outlook as well, it
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The five large-cap defense stocks we follow (General
Dynamics (GD.N), Raytheon, Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), L-3
Communications Holdings (LLL.N) and Northrop Grumman (NOC.N))
are down 7 percent in June versus a 6 percent decline for the
SP 500," the brokerage wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raytheon shares closed at $57.37 Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange. SAIC shares closed at $20.69.

   About the WALL-E Movie

   What if mankind had to leave Earth, and somebody forgot to turn
the last robot off?

   Academy Award(R)-winning writer-director Andrew Stanton ("Finding
Nemo") and the inventive storytellers and technical geniuses at Pixar
Animation Studios ("The Incredibles," "Cars," "Ratatouille") transport
moviegoers to a galaxy not so very far away for a new
computer-animated cosmic comedy about a determined robot named WALL-E.

   After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for,
WALL-E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers
a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he meets
a sleek search robot named EVE. EVE comes to realize that WALL-E has
inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races
back to space to report her findings to the humans (who have been
eagerly awaiting word that it is safe to return home). Meanwhile,
WALL-E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets into motion one of the
most exciting and imaginative comedy adventures ever brought to the
big screen.

   Joining WALL-E on his fantastic journey across a universe of
never-before-imagined visions of the future, is a hilarious cast of
characters including a pet cockroach, and a heroic team of
malfunctioning misfit robots.

   Filled with surprises, action, humor and heart, WALL-E was written
and directed by Andrew Stanton, produced by Jim Morris, co-produced by
Lindsey Collins and features original and innovative sound design by
Academy Award(R)-winner Ben Burtt ("Star Wars," "Indiana Jones," "E.T.
the Extra-Terrestrial"). The film is due for release on June 27, 2008.

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: XenoPort, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Sempra Energy and Royal Bank of Scotland

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: XenoPort Inc. (Nasdaq: XNPT),
GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Sempra Energy (NYSE:
SRE) and Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE: RBS).

   Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the
free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

   Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:

   XenoPort Drug May Have "Legs"

   We consider XenoPort Inc.'s (Nasdaq: XNPT) restless leg syndrome
(RLS) drug candidate, XP-13512 (to be called Solzira in the U.S.), to
be a potential blockbuster opportunity. The data has been highly
encouraging and XP-13512 could launch in late 2009. XenoPort is
partnered with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) for development and
commercialization in the U.S. and select countries outside the U.S.

   As for now we are holding off on modeling sales in neuropathic
pain and migraine until we see more data. However, we believe that if
XenoPort can see Solzira to commercialization, it will improve the
future partnering plans for other compounds such as XP-19986 for
gastroesophageal reflux disease, and allow management to move forward
with other candidates such as the intravenous anesthetic XP-20925.

   XenoPort stock is down 25 percent year-to-date and some 35 percent
on several concerns. We think the market is coming to grips with the
power XenoPort's Transported Prodrug technology.

   Pfizer's (NYSE: PFE) Lyrica could represent significant
competition to Solzira in the RLS market. The overall market
conditions have been poor, specifically with respect to volatile names
in the biotechnology market, and even more so with stocks that had
outstanding past performance as investors are looking to book profits
on their winners.

   Buy Sempra Energy on Value

   Impressive results in the first quarter, led by strong performance
in its utilities pipelines and storage business, conclusion of general
rate cases, operational REX-West, launch of its commodities
joint-venture, and completion of its Baja California liquefied natural
gas (LNG) terminal, collectively support the bullish outlook for
Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE).

   Looking ahead, with the initiation of a $1 billion share
repurchase program, new solar power contracts and a recently increased
$1.40 annual dividend, we see consistent growth in earnings power.
However, we note that the company may face difficulties from a higher
level of capital expenditures. Nevertheless, in a valuation call given
a discount in forward earnings valuation, we maintain our Buy
recommendation on SRE with a six-month target price of $60.75, or
16.4x our 2008 EPS estimate and 13.3x our forward 2009 estimate.

   SRE appears to be relatively well-positioned to benefit from core
electric and natural gas operations, wholesale energy commodities
marketing and trading, development of LNG resources, and earnings
accretive acquisitions. Financially, the company's 9% dividend
increase to an annual rate of $1.40 per share in May 2008. This may
attract conservative income-seeking investors.

   The SRE common stock trades at only 15.0x and 12.1x, respectively,
our 2008 and 2009 earnings per share estimates, or at a moderate
discount to the natural gas distribution industry. We attribute the
stock's current earnings-based discount valuation to the uncertainty
surrounding the lack of visibility into regulatory proceedings,
declining business from the company s natural gas operations, as well
as a below-industry average dividend yield.

   We see earnings growth through 2009 driven by impressive
profitability at one of its components, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric,
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's approval of the Rockies
pipeline project, the joint venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland
(NYSE: RBS) and additional asset sales.

&lt;p&gt;  BEIJING and JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA, Jun 24 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the opening of new "cloud computing"
centers in South Africa and China. Cloud computing enables the delivery
of personal and business services from remote, centralized servers (the
"cloud") that share computing resources and bandwidth -- to any device,
anywhere.

    The shift to cloud computing is fueled by the dramatic growth in business
collaboration, connected devices, real-time data streams, and Web 2.0
applications such as streaming media and entertainment, social networking
and mobile commerce. Cloud computing represents a major step up in
computing -- as it enables governments, businesses and individuals to
access super-computing power, analysis of massive amounts of data, and
applications five to 10-times more cost effectively.*

    The new centers are designed to help clients in Africa and China tackle
issues they would otherwise not be able to address. For example, using
IBM's new centers, a university could access the computational power of a
supercomputer to analyze data and determine how diseases might spread in a
region or how climate changes will affect natural resources.

    "These centers will enable our clients in China and sub-Saharan Africa to
better embrace the services-based, global economy," said Nick Donofrio,
IBM's executive vice president of Innovation and Technology. "Much like
the power-generation and manufacturing infrastructures before it, the data
center continues to consolidate for scale and become increasingly more
efficient and interconnected with partners and the public Internet
infrastructure. From that, a global value chain of information technology
is emerging."

    IBM has set aside $120 million over two years in sub-Saharan Africa to
capitalize on enormous populations of skills and expertise and to capture
rapid growth in emerging market countries as they heavily invest in IT to
modernize their societies and build out their fundamental business
infrastructures in areas such as government services, banking and
telecommunications. The new centers are part of IBM's overall investment
in the world's growth markets, to which the company committed an
additional $1.6 billion earlier this year.

    The two new centers are part of IBM's expansion of its cloud computing
capabilities around the world. IBM launched Europe's first Cloud Computing
Center in Dublin, Ireland in March. Over the past year, IBM has provided
cloud computing services to clients such as Wuxi City of China, Sogeti,
the Local Professional Services Division of Capgemini, the Vietnamese
government institutions and universities, and iTricity, a computing host
service company based in the Netherlands.

    The new center in Beijing draws upon experts from IBM's research and
development labs in China, where IBM has established a significant
research and development presence. There currently are more than 3,200
IBM engineers and scientists employed by IBM labs in Beijing and
Shanghai. China is home to one of IBM's eight research labs worldwide.

    "China is focused on transforming itself into a services-led economy,"
said Henry Chow, Chairman of the IBM Greater China Group. "New business
models are key to the change and growth. Cloud computing and our
expertise can help Chinese enterprises with their agenda."

    The Beijing center will help clients test proofs of concept, as well as
design and deploy cloud computing infrastructures and projects. The center
will provide clients with resources such as reference studies and skills
training about the cloud computing environment.

    The new Africa Innovation Center located in Johannesburg is the first of
its kind on the continent. In addition to cloud computing, the center will
showcase Web 2.0 technologies, service-oriented architecture (SOA),
systems management, next-generation banking systems, and environmentally
friendly computing designs as it nurtures information technology skills
and addresses business challenges in the economic growth of Sub-Saharan
Africa.

    Speaking at the opening ceremony of the South African center, Mrs.
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the Deputy President of the Republic of South
Africa, said, "We are highly energized by IBM's investment because it
directly responds to our call for increased private sector investment
into sustainable initiatives that advance priority technical skills. It
is also encouraging that the company's plans integrate the entire
Sub-Saharan Africa, which assures us that in the long term we will secure
a thriving South Africa in a prosperous region."

    The new center will offer an array of services for IBM business partners,
software start-ups, IT professionals and academia, who will be able to use
its resources to develop skills and deliver solutions to global markets
using IBM's open architecture. They will be able to access IBM services
such as product demonstrations, business consulting, and workshops for
designing, testing, as well as piloting projects to drive business growth,
reduce time-to-market and lower development costs.

    "The Africa Innovation Center is a landmark investment for IBM because it
represents our commitment to be a partner in the continent's growth
agenda," said Steve Mills, Senior Vice President and Group Executive, IBM
Software Group. This commitment is backed by IBM's globally integrated
enterprise strategy driven by a newly created IBM Growth Markets
Organization to accelerate the company's performance in rapidly expanding
markets, such as Africa.

    IBM has also deployed IBM Idea Factory for Cloud Computing for the
University of Pretoria's Computational Intelligence Research Group.
Computer science students will be able to access this new service -- based
on Web 2.0 technologies and delivered through IBM's cloud computing
environment -- to create new projects and collaborate with other members
of their community.

    "IBM's cloud solution will help our researchers reduce the total time to
set-up and run simulations from weeks to days, thereby expanding our scope
of research capabilities and improving the productivity of our research
students," said Professor Andries Englebrecht of the University of
Pretoria.

    IBM also has launched "Blue Cloud," a collection of enabling technologies
that is used to create cloud computing experiences for customers in data
center, hosting service and other cloud environments. Blue Cloud is a key
technology for IBM's New Enterprise Data Center (NEDC) initiative, as well
as for all of the IBM Cloud Computing centers worldwide.

    The two new centers offer access to IBM's global network of 39 Innovation
Centers and 60 research and development labs. Companies are able to tap
into IBM expertise regardless of their proximity to any global center.

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, June 24 (Reuters) - Talks between Nigeria's oil
workers' union and Chevron (CVX.N) will resume on Thursday, a
union official said on Tuesday, to avert an all-out strike that
could further slash output from the OPEC producer.&lt;/p&gt;

in Lagos, but oilfield operations were not affected, said
PENGASSAN Secretary General Bayo Olowoshile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This action is aimed at putting more pressure on management
ahead of talks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three-party talks between the union, Chevron and the
government are planned for Thursday and Friday in the Nigerian
capital Abuja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron branch of PENGASSAN has been demanding the
transfer of the expatriate managing director from Nigeria,
accusing him of violating safety standards, having too many
foreign staff and a lack of respect for Nigerian workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's output from Nigeria is around 350,000 barrels per
day, of which its equity share is around 129,000 bpd. A strike
at the firm could further cut Nigeria's production, already
driven down by militant attacks on oil facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fears of supply disruption in the world's eighth largest oil
exporter, have contributed to a rise in global crude prices to
record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, a strike by an oil workers' union at Exxon Mobil's
(XOM.N) unit in Nigeria shut down nearly all of the company's
800,000 bpd output in the West African country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For full Reuters Africa coverage and to have your say on

&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, June 24 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Cairn
Energy (CNE.L) have signed a deal with Bangladesh to undertake
further gas exploration and seismic survey works in country's
south-west, a senior Bangladesh oil official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We have signed the production sharing contract (PSC) with
the U.S energy firm Chevron and British firm Cairn Energy for
an additional seismic and drilling programmes," said Muhammad
Muqtadir Ali, director of the Bangladesh oil, gas and mineral
corporation or Petrobangla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Work will consist of 450 kilometres of 2D seismic data
surveying on Block-7, beginning at the end of 2008, followed by
the drilling of an exploration well, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2006, Chevron conducted a seismic survey in the region
and found three potential hydro-carbon zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The programme aims to identify new reserves to help
increase the energy supply to Khulna (industrial city) and
other neighbouring parts and also to justify the investment in
the energy-starved South West gas hub," said Steve Wilson,
President of Chevron in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is currently producing more than a third of
Bangladesh's total gas from its three fields -- Jalalabad,
Moulavibazar and Bibiyana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron and Cairn Energy each own a 45 percent stake in
Block-7, with the remaining 10 percent owned by state-run
Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Celebrity homemaker Martha Stewart has 
been denied entry to Britain because of her 2004 U.S. 
conviction for lying about a stock sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc, the company founded by

to travel to Britain for business meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "She has engagements with English companies and business 
leaders and hopes this can be resolved so that she will be able 
to visit soon," Charles Koppelman, chairman of Martha Stewart 
Living Omnimedia, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Britain's Home Office, which runs the UK

&lt;p&gt;BUENAVENTURA, Colombia (Reuters) - Colombians who thought they had seen everything in the war on drugs were treated to something new this year: cocaine smuggling in a submarine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In images shown on national television, several men emerged from the makeshift fiberglass craft, opened hatches designed to let in water and sent the submarine and its cargo of cocaine to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the they had traces of the drug on their clothing, the smugglers were rescued from their lifeboat and, in the absence of further evidence, released without charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We kept the cargo from being distributed in the international market, which is our main goal," said Navy Capt. Gustavo Angel, who estimated the contents at about 10 tonnes (tons). "So it was a partial success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the authorities step up efforts to stop airplanes and speedboats long used to export drugs from the world's biggest cocaine producing country, traffickers are turning to vessels that travel under water to carry on their trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From his base near the Pacific port city of Buenaventura Angel is helping lead the crackdown on the blimp-shaped vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With only breathing tubes and mini navigation equipment above the surface, they leave almost no wake, making them hard to spot from the air. They can sometimes be spied by coast guard patrols and their sound can be picked up by Navy submarines equipped with sonar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angel estimates that more than 30 tonnes of cocaine have been intentionally sent to the bottom of the ocean by fleeing crew members over the last two and a half years, which makes authorities wonder how much is getting through to the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diesel-fueled craft are used mostly on the Pacific coast to take drugs to Central America and Mexico for eventual sale in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Navy estimates the boats travel up to two weeks to get to their destinations. They can transport up to 10 tonnes of cocaine on each voyage, after which they are scuttled to avoid questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each costs about $600,000 to make, carries four to five crew members and is outfitted with one or two propellers, allowing it to travel at 10 to 12 knots, the Navy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most are more than 50 feet long and built by drug smuggling groups sometimes in collusion with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which funds its four-decade-old Marxist insurgency with the drug trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia exports 600 tonnes of cocaine per year, according to United Nations monitors, about a third of it from the Pacific coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ANYTHING COULD BE ABOARD"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vice Admiral Edgar Cely worries that the FARC could use the craft to transport arms and explosives in an attack on a port. "Anything could be aboard those things," Cely told Reuters in his office at the Defense Ministry in Bogota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craft are constructed inland on ramps to keep them off the wet ground of the mangroves that line the Pacific coast. Overhead vegetation hides the construction sites from the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Painted blue to blend in with the water, they are loaded with their illegal cargo and taken by river at high tide to the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is much more difficult to build and hide them on the heavily populated Caribbean coast, which is benefiting from a tourism boom under U.S.-backed security policies that have made many parts of Colombia safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight were found on the Pacific coast last year and one on the Caribbean, the Navy says, their hulls fitted with lead panels or water tanks to submerge them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities say they are bracing for the day when smugglers figure out how to make full-fledged submarines capable of diving deep and navigating even more quietly than the current generation, which known locally as "semi-submersibles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Cely said he is increasing land patrols along the coast to find the vessels where they are most likely to be detected, on their construction ramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are evolving quickly in terms of technology. They are getting bigger, faster and are outfitted with GPS navigation systems and satellite telephones," Cely said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really have to stay on top of this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Hugh Bronstein; Editing by Eddie Evans)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska, June 25 (Reuters) - The state of Alaska
vowed to tighten oversight on Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) after the
U.S. Supreme Court struck down a $2.5 billion punitive damage
judgment for the 1989 Valdez disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "It's sad to consider that there's probably celebration
going on in some industry board rooms right now, while right
here in Alaska you're not seeing that celebration," Gov. Sarah
Palin told Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon will know that we're very disappointed in this
ruling. They will know that our commitment is to stringent,
responsible oversight of the industry," said Palin during a
break in a cabinet meeting on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Exxon Valdez spill was the lowest point in Alaska's
sometimes rocky relationship with the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil money provides the backbone of the economy and most of
the tax revenue that Alaska uses to run its operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet Alaskans have chafed at what many believe is industry's
undue political influence, and there is a litany of complaints
that oil development has spoiled a once-pristine environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Republican governor said new oil developments will not
take place in Alaska unless they meet safety and ethics
standards. As word spread on the Supreme Court ruling, Alaskans
expressed anger, disappointment and shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Every Alaskan has to be angry, hurt and deflated after all
these years of expecting a reasonable punishment, only to see
it gutted by the Supreme Court," said State Sen. Hollis French,
an Anchorage Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Cordova, the Prince William Sound fishing town of 2,400
that was particularly hard-hit by the spill, residents said
they were shocked at how little Exxon will now have to pay at a
time the corporation is raking in billions in profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Instead of taking a large corporation to the woodshed,
they just give them a slap on the wrist," Mayor Tim Joyce said
of the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ruling said Exxon should pay no more than $507 million
in punitive fines, equal to compensatory payments made to
individual plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jim Ayers, a past executive director of the council that
oversees the $900 million fund paid by Exxon to settle
government spill damages, said the ruling reminded him of the
day when, as director of the state ferry system, he arrived at
the site of the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You couldn't stop yourself from crying when you saw what
happened to Prince William Sound," said Ayers. "This morning,
it just brought it all back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Prince William Sound, where many animal species and
resources have yet to recover to pre-1989 conditions, a
once-vibrant herring fishery has collapsed and pockets of
buried oil are still on some beaches, physical impacts of the
spill linger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement, Exxon Mobil Chairman Rex Tillerson said the
company has spent over $3.4 billion in compensatory payments,
cleanup payments, settlements and fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We know this has been a very difficult time for everyone
involved," he said. "We have worked hard over many years to
address the impacts of the spill and to prevent such accidents
from happening in our company again."

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior executives from a range of businesses, including Boeing Co, Ford Motor Co, and JPMorgan Chase  Co, met on Wednesday with Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

He has pitched proposals for tax cuts and other ideas to workers in general election battleground states such as Michigan, Ohio and Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives at the meeting, according to the campaign, included: Ford's Mulally; James Bell, chief financial officer of Boeing; Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan; Mark Gallogly, founder of Centerbridge Partners private equity firm; Jim Rogers, CEO of Duke Energy Corp; Ronald Williams, CEO of Aetna Inc; Brian Roberts, CEO of Comcast Corp; and Robert Glaser, CEO of RealNetworks Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies represented at the Obama meeting are powerful players in the U.S. economy, but some of the sectors they represent are struggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Wall Street firms have lost billions in a global credit crunch driven by a severe slump in the U.S. housing market. Auto sales are hemorrhaging due to the softening economy and $4 a gallon gasoline, and aircraft manufacturers face fallout from deteriorating finances of U.S. airlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama is scheduled to hold a forum on economic competitiveness on Thursday in Pittsburgh that will include other business leaders like General Motors Corp chief executive Rick Wagoner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Obama and his Republican rival John McCain are pressing proposals for tackling high energy prices that are dragging on the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auto companies, particularly, are seeking tax credits and other help from Washington to retool factories and spur consumer demand for energy-efficient vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford, GM and Chrysler, with sales of once popular sport utilities and pickups sliding dramatically this year, are moving with new urgency to develop hybrids, battery, and fuel cell vehicles and those that can run on gasoline-ethanol blends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain of Arizona said this week, that if elected, his administration would offer a $300 million cash prize to the company that develops the next generation battery technology to power cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Caren Bohan in Chicago and John Crawley in Washington; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday threw out the record $2.5 billion in punitive damages that Exxon Mobil Corp had been ordered to pay for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska, the nation's worst tanker spill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By a 5-3 vote, the high court ruled that the punitive damages award should be slashed to a maximum amount equal to the total relevant compensatory damages of $507.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The justices overturned a ruling by a U.S. Court of Appeals that had awarded the record punitive damages to about 32,000 commercial fishermen, Alaska natives, property owners and others harmed by the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the majority opinion, Justice David Souter concluded the $2.5 billion in punitive damages was excessive under federal maritime law, and should be cut to the amount of actual harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soaring oil prices have propelled Exxon Mobil to previously unforeseen levels of profitability in recent years; the company posted earnings of $40.6 billion in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took Exxon Mobil just under two days to bring in $2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound in March 1989, spilling about 11 million gallons of crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spill spread oil to more than 1,200 miles of coastline, closed fisheries and killed thousands of marine mammals and hundreds of thousands of sea birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal jury in Alaska awarded $5 billion in punitive damages in 1994. A federal judge later reduced the punitive damages to $4.5 billion, and the appeals court further cut it to $2.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, then appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Souter rejected Exxon Mobil's argument that the federal clean water law's water pollution penalties preempt punitive damage awards in maritime spill cases. But he sided with the company in slashing the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We ... hold that the federal statutory law does not bar a punitive award on top of damages for economic loss, but that the award here should be limited to an amount equal to compensatory damages," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Irving, Texas, Rex Tillerson, Exxon Mobil's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement, "The Valdez oil spill was a tragic accident and one which the corporation deeply regrets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know this has been a very difficult time for everyone involved.

The business group said the ruling could have an impact far beyond federal maritime law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company lawyers had called the $2.5 billion the largest punitive damage award ever affirmed by a federal appellate court -- larger than the total of all punitive damage awards upheld by federal appellate courts in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was decided by eight Supreme Court members.

The ruling will likely take a small bite out of upcoming earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the ruling was announced, Exxon Mobil shares dropped around 80 cents, or just less than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company's shares later recovered and closed up 68 cents at $87.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling could create a new public relations challenge for Exxon, which is already facing heat from Congress and consumers because of high gasoline prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are already being vilified in the news because of their profits," said Argus Research analyst Phil Weiss, who said the company's tenacious legal defense was good for its shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But if I'm a consumer who doesn't own Exxon stock and doesn't care about Exxon stock, I'm looking at the money I'm paying to put gas in my tank and thinking 'Here they are, taking advantage of somebody else,'" Weiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michael Erman in New York and Yereth Rosen in Alaska; Editing by Dave Zimmerman, Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; By James Vicini&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on

that Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) had been ordered to pay for the

&lt;p&gt;TENERO, Switzerland (Reuters) - The players preach the value of traditional German virtues but Joachim Loew's side have only made it to the semi-finals of Euro 2008 thanks to an uncharacteristic streak of improvisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We will play against Turkey with commitment and hard running," centre-back Per Mertesacker said in a typical comment in the build-up to Wednesday's semi-final in Basel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's only by employing those virtues that we get results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany have indeed worked hard but it would be wrong to give all the credit to the small army of fitness instructors employed since the days of Juergen Klinsmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, Germany are unlikely to have made it this far had Loew not encouraged Lukas Podolski to reinvent himself as a midfielder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Podolski had apparently lost his touch in front of goal after two disappointing seasons at Bayern Munich but instead of discarding him, Loew played him on the left of the midfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be an inspired choice, as Podolski struck twice to lead Germany to their opening 2-0 win over Poland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Podolski scored his third goal in the second match against Croatia but it was not enough to prevent a 2-1 defeat in what was generally a much flatter performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German media put it down to arrogance and suggested a focus on those famous German virtues, the ones that earned the country three European Championship titles and three World Cups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team duly responded, beating co-hosts Austria 1-0 in a tense match in Vienna, with captain Michael Ballack getting the only goal with a thunderbolt free kick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result secured a place in the quarter-finals as Group B runners-up but the performance still left a lot to be desired heading into the match against Group A winners Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INSPIRED CHOICE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loew responded with a tactical masterstroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coach abandoned his beloved 4-4-2 formation, brought in two new holding midfielders in Simon Rolfes and Thomas Hitzlsperger and took the shackles off Ballack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result was spectacular, as Bastian Schweinsteiger scored once and set up two for Miroslav Klose and Ballack in a brilliant 3-2 win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Against Portugal, Ballack was moved into what I call the 'free spirit role' playing up front and suddenly -- boom," was how UEFA's chief technical director Andy Roxburgh described it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big worry in Germany now is that the players will bask in the applause for that performance and make the mistake of underestimating Turkey, the tournament's comeback kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth, however, is that if Ballack plays with the same freedom, if Podolski and Schweinsteiger show the same speed and deftness of touch, if Klose makes those darting runs they will overwhelm a Turkey team ravaged by injuries and suspensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is just that no one wants to be caught admitting it -- hence all the talk about concentration and commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jon Bramley)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Disney-Pixar blasts off into uncharted territory with Friday's release of animated film "Wall-E," a space adventure mixing an unusual love story with somber messages about the future of Earth and humankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film features dystopian landscapes, social commentary and a lack of conventional dialogue that are rare under the Walt Disney Co banner, but it sticks to Pixar's basic themes of love, loyalty and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the sober tone and odd love-story between robots has prompted concerns that the "Wall-E" box office may not compensate for Disney's other big summer release, "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian," whose $259 million box office take has lagged forecasts so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors have been wary of 'Wall-E's' box office potential given Pixar's risky bet on an offbeat main character, who rarely speaks during the film," Pali Capital analyst Rich Greenfield said in a note to clients this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A solid performance by "Wall-E" could boost Disney's results in upcoming quarters, in which the company faces tough comparisons with 2007 hits "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" ($961 million worldwide) and "Ratatouille" ($621 million) in theaters and DVD frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Greenfield noted Wall Street concern, he added that "Wall-E" had been well-received in early screenings, and he pegged the film's ultimate global box office take at $500 million to $600 million. He also predicted it also would be a "solid contributor" to DVD and consumer products sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie will debut in more than 3,900 U.S. theaters on Friday and roll out around the world through December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD I KNEW'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The character Wall-E, or Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class, is the last of a cadre of robots tasked with cleaning up piles of trash discarded by humans who abandoned the planet centuries before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human race set off on a luxury space cruise during a planned five-year clean-up that lasts much longer and results in unfortunate changes in the human physique and psyche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Wall-E faithfully reports to work each day on Earth with his pet cockroach and a lunch box in which he stores the knick knacks he finds among mountains of trash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of a sleek girl robot named Eve, sent to Earth by the orbiting humans to look for plant life, sends Wall-E on an adventure that changes his own and humanity's destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Andrew Stanton, who won an Academy Award for Pixar's most lucrative film, "Finding Nemo," said he wanted to show a future in which people had lost track of what matters in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought, 'Well that's the question that Wall-E is trying to figure out: What is the point of living?'" Stanton said. "It's to love one another. It's to further a relationship."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In choreographing the non-verbal courtship of Wall-E and Eve, Stanton and his animators looked to "the hard process of a boy going over to ask a girl to dance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all just metaphor for what it's like for a boy to court a girl," Stanton said. "It's all in there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film's references to current hot-button issues -- the environment, obesity and corporate greed -- were a coincidence, Stanton said, because he conceived the premise in 1994 with the idea of reviving the science-fiction films he loved as a boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just was using elements of the world I knew," he said. "I wasn't trying to put anybody to task. I knew that, 'Wow this is starting to make some really uncomfortable parallels' but ... as long as I don't have an agenda I'm not going to worry about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bob Tourtellotte and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statement by ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO, Rex W. Tillerson, Regarding the Valdez Supreme Court Ruling

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
The Supreme Court today ruled on legal questions relating to
punitive damages and the Valdez oil spill.

   The Valdez oil spill was a tragic accident and one which the
corporation deeply regrets.

   We know this has been a very difficult time for everyone involved.
We have worked hard over many years to address the impacts of the
spill and to prevent such accidents from happening in our company
again.

   We took immediate responsibility for the spill and have spent over
$3.4 billion as a result of the accident, including compensatory
payments, cleanup payments, settlements and fines.

   The company cleaned up the spill and voluntarily compensated more
than 11,000 Alaskans and businesses. The clean-up was declared
complete by the State of Alaska and the United States Coast Guard in
1992.

   In the aftermath of the Valdez accident, we redoubled our
long-time commitment to safeguard the environment, our employees and
the communities in which we operate.

&lt;p&gt;EVANSVILLE, Ind.--(Business Wire)--
Mannon Oil is pleased to announce, through a newly formed
affiliate company, that we have secured the exclusive North American
license to airborne electromagnetic impulse survey technology
developed by Pinemont Technologies, LLC. 

   Acquisition of this technology license will enable us to:

   --  reduce the risk of drilling dry holes,

   --  prioritize future drilling efforts to focus on optimum
        risk/reward scenarios,

   --  identify new geographic areas of opportunity,

   --  Avoid participation in areas with limited upside potential,

   --  Assist in the interpretation of seismic features with
        hydrocarbon content 

   The recently patented technology involves utilization of a passive
geophysical prospecting method and apparatus that operates in both
ground and airborne configurations to identify hydrocarbon reservoirs
by remote sensing of transient electromagnetic pulses. As presented by
the inventor of the technology at the 2006 AAPG Annual Meeting, over
30 discovery wells have been documented as being drilled on positive
transient-pulse anomalies with, to the inventor's knowledge, no dry
holes having been drilled on any of the positive anomalies. The
technology works over land and water and has been extensively tested
in the US and Canada, as well as in the North Sea and Australia. We
have already begun implementing the technology throughout our drilling
program, and expect it to significantly impact our success. 

   Here's how it works: An inherent magnetic field of electromagnetic
energy is present and can be sensed at the earth's surface, and from
low-flying aircraft. Vertical components of this primary field contain
transient random impulses of energy varying across a wide frequency
range including in the audio-frequency range. Although speculative, it
is widely believed that the impulses are related to lightning activity
around the Earth. Regardless of their source, however, the existence
of random occurring impulses is recognized. Secondary magnetic fields
are associated with the microseepage plumes and accompanying Redox
cells over hydrocarbon reservoirs. These secondary fields interact
with the random impulses in the primary field and generate secondary
impulses.  Once these random impulses are captured and tied back to
the plane's flight path, a map can be constructed showing the areas
overlying potential hydrocarbon accumulations - a treasure map for oil
and gas. 

   The technology is designed as a reconnaissance tool and can be
used stand-alone in certain circumstances to discover new potential
hydrocarbon deposits. However, the technology is also used very
effectively in conjunction with other technologies and conventional

&lt;p&gt; (Adds reaction, details of ruling)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By James Vicini&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on
Wednesday threw out the record $2.5 billion in punitive damages
that Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) had been ordered to pay for the
1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska, the nation's worst
tanker spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By a 5-3 vote, the high court ruled that the punitive
damages award should be slashed -- limited by the circumstances
of the case to an amount equal to the total relevant
compensatory damages of $507.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The justices overturned a ruling by a U.S. Court of Appeals
that had awarded the record punitive damages to about 32,000
commercial fishermen, Alaska natives, property owners and
others harmed by the nation's worst tanker spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the majority opinion, Justice David Souter concluded the
$2.5 billion in punitive damages was excessive under federal
maritime law, and should be cut to the amount of actual harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soaring oil prices have propelled Exxon Mobil to previously
unforeseen levels of profitability in recent years; the company
posted earnings of $40.6 billion in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It took Exxon Mobil just under two days to bring in $2.5
billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground in Alaska's Prince
William Sound in March 1989, spilling about 11 million gallons
of crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spill spread oil to more than 1,200 miles (1,900 km) of
coastline, closed fisheries and killed thousands of marine
mammals and hundreds of thousands of sea birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A federal jury in Alaska awarded $5 billion in punitive
damages in 1994. A federal judge later reduced the punitive
damages to $4.5 billion, and the appeals court further cut it
to $2.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. company by market
capitalization, then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing it
already had paid more than $3.5 billion for the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Souter rejected Exxon Mobil's argument that the federal
clean water law's water pollution penalties preempt punitive
damage awards in maritime spill cases. But he sided with the
company in reducing the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We ... hold that the federal statutory law does not bar a
punitive award on top of damages for economic loss, but that
the award here should be limited to an amount equal to
compensatory damages," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DISAPPOINTMENT IN ALASKA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Alaska, Riki Ott, a fisherman and scientist and longtime
environmental activist in the Prince William Sound town of
Cordova, where most of the area's fishing fleet is
concentrated, was disappointed by the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We were really counting on punitive damages paying for our
long-term losses in the fishery. That's obviously not going to
happen," Ott said. "Well, that's an affront to everyone's sense
of justice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
said: "This is good news for companies concerned about reining
in excessive punitive damages." The business group said the
ruling could have an impact far beyond federal maritime law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Passacantando, executive director of the environmental
group Greenpeace USA, said the ruling "makes a mockery of
justice" and added: "The worst environmental calamity in U.S.
history will continue to haunt the Prince William Sound and
those dependent upon it for their livelihoods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Company lawyers had called the $2.5 billion the largest
punitive damage award ever affirmed by a federal appellate
court -- larger than the total of all punitive damage awards
upheld by federal appellate courts in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case was decided by eight Supreme Court members. The
ninth, Justice Samuel Alito, who owns Exxon Mobil stock,
recused himself from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dissenting Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen Breyer would have upheld the award. Stevens and
Ginsburg said Congress, not the court, should set limits on
punitive damages under maritime law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Breyer said this was no ordinary reckless behavior case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RELAPSED ALCOHOLIC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The jury could reasonably have believed that Exxon
knowingly allowed a relapsed alcoholic repeatedly to pilot a
vessel filled with millions of gallons of oil through waters
that provided the livelihood for the many plaintiffs in this
case," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given that conduct, it was only a matter of time before a
crash and spill like this occurred," Breyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has not set aside any legal reserves for possible
damages as the company has argued that it was not possible to
predict the ultimate outcome. The ruling will likely take a
small bite out of upcoming earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Immediately after the ruling was announced, Exxon Mobil
shares dropped around 80 cents, or just less than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the company's shares later recovered and were up 18
cents at $87.10 each in early afternoon trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ruling could create a new public relations challenge
for Exxon, which is already facing heat from Congress and
consumers because of high gasoline prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are already being vilified in the news because of
their profits," said Argus Research analyst Phil Weiss, who
said the company's tenacious legal defense was good for its
shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But if I'm a consumer who doesn't own Exxon stock and
doesn't care about Exxon stock, I'm looking at the money I'm
paying to put gas in my tank and thinking 'Here they are,
taking advantage of somebody else,'" Weiss said.

&lt;p&gt;Milpitas Unified School District Partners With Chevron and Bank of America on 3.4MW Solar and Energy Efficiency Program Expected to Save $12 Million for Education

  Solar Arrays at 14 Sites Expected to Generate 75 Percent of Annual
     Power Needs and Lower Carbon Emissions by 23,600 Metric Tons
MILPITAS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Milpitas Unified School District, in collaboration with Chevron
Energy Solutions and Bank of America, today announced it has begun
construction on a 14-site, districtwide solar power and energy
efficiency program designed to supply 75 percent of the district's
total annual electricity needs through solar energy.

   The 3.4-megawatt solar installation will generate what is believed
to be the highest percentage of solar power for any K-12 school
district in the United States and will supply 100 percent of the
district's power during the peak-demand summer months, when
California's electricity needs are greatest.

   The program benefits the district and school community in several
ways:

   --  Cost Savings - The program is designed to reduce the
        district's energy costs by more than 22 percent and will
        result in $12 million in savings for the district's general
        fund over the life of the solar power system, while providing
        positive cash flow and budget predictability through known
        energy costs.

   --  Clean Energy - By lowering the district's purchase of utility
        power, the solar project will reduce carbon emissions by an
        estimated 23,600 metric tons - equivalent to planting 270
        acres of trees.

   --  Education - The program provides an on-site laboratory for
        alternative energy and opportunities for providing energy
        science education.

   --  Comfort - The new solar-paneled structures will provide shade
        for cars and people.

   "We are proud to do our part to contribute toward the state of
California's goal of using renewable and ultraclean power generation
to achieve grid-neutral school facilities," said Dr. Karl Black,
superintendent of Milpitas Unified School District. "We appreciate the
support that David Thorman, state architect of California, and his
team provided and the partnership with Chevron Energy Solutions and
Bank of America to make this program a reality."

   Chevron Energy Solutions (CES), a unit of Chevron (NYSE:CVX), will
construct parking canopies and shade structures mounted with solar
photovoltaic arrays at 13 schools and one district site. CES will
provide maintenance for the solar power system as well as measure and
guarantee its performance. CES will also install energy management
software on the district's computers to improve energy efficiency.
Chevron Energy Solutions has developed more than 900 projects
involving energy efficiency or renewable power for education,
government and business customers in the U.S. since 2000.

   Bank of America, through Banc of America Leasing Energy Services
team, structured and provided financing for the project as part of its
$20 billion environmental initiative. The California Solar Initiative
and other incentives offset the overall cost of the program by $4.2
million.

   The start of construction was celebrated today at a Rancho
Milpitas Middle School event attended by government, business and
district officials. The project is scheduled to be completed by the
end of the year.

   "Milpitas Unified School District, along with other education
institutions, is using solar power to benefit the community and reduce
their carbon footprint while achieving cost savings," said Jim Davis,
president of Chevron Energy Solutions. "We are delighted to be part of
this growing trend through partnership programs such as this that are
delivering effective energy solutions to communities."

   "Bank of America provides strategic and cost-effective financing
solutions for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects for our
clients throughout the public and private sectors," said Doug Bowers,
president of Banc of America Leasing. "This exciting effort with the
Milpitas Unified School District and Chevron Energy Solutions
demonstrates that school districts large and small can go solar, save
money and reduce their carbon footprint."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) shares fell to a two-year low on Wednesday after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the plane maker and defense company to "sell" from "neutral," reflecting falling orders, problems facing airlines and high fuel prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock fell 5.5 percent -- its biggest one-day drop in more than five years -- to $70.68 on the New York Stock Exchange, its lowest point since February 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock is down 34 percent from its all-time high of $107.80 last July, hurt by delays on its 787 Dreamliner program and general concern about high oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect the weak macroeconomic backdrop and record fuel prices to hurt airlines and translate to a significant slowing in the order book," said Goldman analyst Richard Safran in a research note published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He put a $60 price target on the stock for the next 12 months, but said there was substantial risk the stock could go lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safran, who downgraded the whole commercial aerospace sector to "cautious" from "neutral," expects orders for the sector to drop 50 percent in 2008 and another 50 percent in 2009 as airlines focus on restoring profitability through aggressive capacity cuts and price increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aerospace stocks are off nearly 30 percent from October highs, but history indicates the stocks could fall another 20 percent or more as we think the market is not factoring in that the combined effect of accelerated crude prices, a weak economy and rapidly deteriorating airline fundamentals could pose a worse problem for the aerospace group than 9/11 and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)," wrote Safran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there is more risk to the 787 program than is priced in as the program has yet to even enter flight test, where historically most issues on development aircraft are found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other aerospace suppliers also fell sharply on Wednesday, including Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), Precision Castparts Corp (PCP.N), Textron Inc (TXT.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Esha Dey and Neha Singh in Bangalore, Bill Rigby in New York; Editing by Brian Moss and Deepak Kannan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 25 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities started coverage
on major U.S. pharmaceuticals, including Merck  Co Inc (MRK.N)
and Schering-Plough Corp SGP.N which it rated "overweight",
saying it saw selected opportunities in the sector following a
20 percent sell-off from the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said it expects earnings upside for Merck from
the rollout of its diabetes drug Januvia and its cervical
cancer vaccine Gardasil, coupled with ongoing restructuring
efforts, despite recent cholesterol franchise setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schering-Plough's acquisition of Organon BioSciences, the
drugs arm of Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS), creates significant margin
leverage potential over the next several years, analyst Chris
Schott wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Merck have fallen more than 36 percent since the
start of the year, while Schering-Plough has declined more than
27 percent as of Tuesday's closing prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite being cautious on the industry, which faces Food
and Drug Administration uncertainty, a wave of upcoming patent
expirations and mixed pipeline prospects, Schott said cost
cutting and pipeline development would be potential positive
drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also noted that sector valuations are at a multi-decade
low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. major pharma group currently trades at roughly
12.5 times forward 2008 earnings, a 15 percent to 20 percent
discount to the SP 500, Schott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The valuation leaves the group open to a short-term rally
on a positive datapoint but the challenges facing the sector
preclude outperformance longer term, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schott started Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), Eli Lilly 
Co (LLY.N), Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Wyeth WYE.N with a
"neutral" rating.

&lt;p&gt;  MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, Jun 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRSN), the trusted provider of Internet
infrastructure services for the networked world, today announced that it
has been selected by Microsoft(R) as an OpenID provider for users of
HealthVault(TM), a free service that enables consumers to store and
manage their health information online. HealthVault's acceptance of
VeriSign OpenIDs will begin later this week.

    VeriSign combines the convenience of OpenID single sign-on with the
security of strong authentication via VeriSign Identity Protection (VIP)
credentials. Acceptance of VeriSign's OpenIDs secured by the VeriSign
Identity Protection Service gives consumers another choice when signing
into Microsoft HealthVault to help safeguard their personal health
information. Microsoft HealthVault members who have activated their VIP
credential on their VeriSign OpenID can also utilize the same VIP
credential on eBay, PayPal, AOL and a number of other sites that
participate in the VeriSign Identity Protection Network.

    The need for securing online health records is growing. Some 47 million
Americans are uninsured(1), a situation that has spawned a brisk black
market for health insurance policy information stolen from consumers and
sold the same way Social Security Numbers and credit card numbers are
stolen and sold. By securing their OpenID log-ins with VIP credentials,
HealthVault members are making it harder for identity thieves to illegally
access sensitive medical and insurance data.

    "HealthVault is about empowering people to take control of their personal
health information, and that means making their Web experience easier
while also helping them safeguard their privacy," said George Scriban,
senior product manager, Microsoft Health Solutions Group. "That's why
we're happy to give our users the option of using a VeriSign OpenID with
a VIP credential."

    When a user logs into their HealthVault record using VeriSign OpenID
secured with a VIP credential, they will be prompted for their OpenID user
name and password, and then asked for a one-time-password (OTP) generated
by their VIP credential. The process makes it extremely difficult for
fraudsters to access accounts illegally because it combines something
users know (user name/password), with something they have (a VIP
credential). Moreover, as the same credential can be used by other
members of the VIP network, users have the convenience of utilizing these
credentials to secure their identities across multiple Web sites.

    "Moving health information online creates tremendous convenience for
consumers since they will now be able to access critical healthcare
information that has traditionally been physically housed in one place and
controlled by outside parties," said Fran Rosch, vice president, Identity
and Authentication Services at VeriSign. "However, just as we've seen in
online banking, providing convenience to consumers creates potential
opportunities for fraudsters. By accepting OpenIDs secured with our VIP
user credentials, Microsoft HealthVault can offer an online healthcare
solution that balances convenient access with a secure experience."

constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of

VeriSign's actual results to differ materially from those stated or
implied by such forward-looking statements. The potential risks and
uncertainties include, among others, the uncertainty of future revenue
and profitability and potential fluctuations in quarterly operating
results due to such factors as the inability of VeriSign to successfully
develop and market new products and services and customer acceptance of
any products or services, including VIP and OpenID; the possibility that
VeriSign's announced new services may not result in additional customers,
profits or revenues; and increased competition and pricing pressures.

&lt;p&gt;USTelematics Announces Appointment of Ex-Motorola, GE, IBM, Wasserstein Executive George Lauro to Spearhead Strategic Alliances and Capital Structuring

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
USTelematics, Inc. (OTC:UTLM), at the forefront of the
connected-car revolution, today announces that George Lauro joins the
Company as Senior Advisor to the Board of Directors. Mr. Lauro's
history includes positions as a former Rapid Commercialization Manager
of IBM (NYSE:IBM); Investment Banker with Wasserstein Perella, Needham
and CE Unterberg; Director of New Business Development for Motorola
(NYSE:MOT); and Aerospace Group Marketing Manager for General Electric
(NYSE:GE).

   USTelematics' CEO Howard Leventhal said, "We are thrilled that
George Lauro has visualized the future of our company and seen fit to
help guide us to it. George's experiences in crafting profitable
partnerships between symbiotic companies and extensive network of
contacts within successful technology firms, particularly in Silicon
Valley, should substantially brighten our future. Chicago is a great
place and we love it because our families are here; but it lacks the
cross-breeding 'fertilizer' effect that energizes so many Northern
California tech company success stories. We fully expect that George
will help us compensate for this and strengthen a number of other
important areas within USTelematics. George is literally, a rocket
scientist, and you can never have too many of those. Among his other
experiences, he was a Staff Scientist at the MIT Draper Lab, where he
designed inertial guidance systems for spacecraft and missiles."

   Mr. Lauro graduated from Brown University in 1981, BSEE; attended
MIT for graduate studies in digital control and aeronautics and made
the Wharton Director List with an MBA in 1986. According to his
resume, George conceived Motorola's Traxar product, the first handheld
GPS navigator. Also at Motorola, Mr Lauro was Director of New Business
Development for that company's RFID Products Group and launched
Motorola's entry into RFID products, where it retains a leading
position.

   In his responsibilities as advisor to other boards of directors,
Mr. Lauro has led the investment process including deal sourcing, term
sheet negotiation, syndication, diligence, post-transaction company
building and exit negotiation. He raised follow-on financing for
several Wasserstein companies; served on the boards of 15 companies
and was member of several Compensation, Search and Budget Committees.
He has had a lead role in CEO/VP/board search projects, business
restructuring and strategy projects and led the M process for
selling portfolio companies.

&lt;p&gt;Web-based technology that utilizes the Internet as its delivery
            platform maximizes benefits and minimizes costs
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Technology has revolutionized the human resource department by
streamlining administrative tasks and supporting HR best practices.
Whether it is a fully integrated HRIS package or a company-wide
intranet, technology has redefined the workplace and boosted internal
performance. Despite the benefits associated with implementing a
successful technology solution, IT spending is expected to decline due
to the faltering economic environment. VISANOW, a leading immigration
solutions provider, offers a simple solution for moving forward with
an IT investment while working within a reduced budget.

   "For HR departments to accelerate productivity and ROI in today's
economic climate, Web-based solutions can enhance performance and
provide a competitive edge while spreading the cost of ownership
across multiple departments," said VISANOW CEO Robert Meltzer. "When
compared with traditional software packages and Web-enabled solutions,
Web-based applications offer more security and accessibility and are
far less expensive to set up and manage."

   The differences between Web-based and Web-enabled applications are
significant. Web-based systems use the Internet as their platform and
have no additional software requirements. Web-enabled systems are
modified software applications that provide Internet capability
through the use of an entry point or add-on software. Because
Web-enabled systems utilize client-server technology, not Web
technology, they involve added costs for deployment and support.
Additional software needs to be purchased, distributed, installed and
maintained on all user workstations and laptops. In contrast,
Web-based systems are customized and updated on the server so that all
users log onto the most current software version and the same data
regardless of geographic location.

   By utilizing the Internet as its application delivery platform,
Web-based solutions offer multiple advantages:

   --  Broad accessibility: By leveraging the Internet as its
        architecture, Web-based applications support HR departments'
        increasing need for access to information across multiple
        locations. Secure access to information is available from any
        computer with Web browser software and Internet access.

   --  Ease of set up: Web-based applications require no
        installation, configuration or hard drive space, eliminating
        the time and expense required to install and configure new
        software packages at each work station.

   --  Ease of management: Because the vendor handles all system
        upgrades and enhancements, the latest updates are instantly
        available to all users whenever and wherever they access the
        application.

   --  Cost reduction: Web-based options can reduce or eliminate many
        upfront and ongoing expenses such as those associated with
        deployment, software licensing, operational and maintenance.

   "HR departments need to be prepared to prove that the technology
investment will deliver a substantial bang for the buck," said
Meltzer. "Immigration services provide a compelling example of the
advantages of utilizing an innovative Web-based solution to slash
costs and improve HR performance. With a Web-based solution,
immigration service providers can easily scale to increase workload,
expedite client communications and more effectively respond and adapt
to a full range of client needs."

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 25 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Securities began coverage of
Allied Capital Corp ALD.N with an "underweight" rating,
saying the business development company may need to
consistently raise capital to avoid shrinking its investment
portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allied has sufficient liquidity for the short-to-medium
term, the brokerage said, adding that it expects the company to
neither raise nor cut its per-share dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combination of cash net investment income, returned
capital from investment portfolio, and its liquidity portfolio
of cash and treasury bills should be sufficient to cover the
dividend, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But recurring cash net investment income may be
significantly less than expected cash dividend payments, making
the firm more dependent upon limited, non-recurring capital
sources, analyst Jim Ballan said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Allied has become more dependent upon realizations,
which could slow amid the credit crunch, and/or equity capital
raises that could be less accretive, the management could take
greater risks to enhance returns, which could make the firm
more susceptible, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We also believe that even in the event of an upswing in
the credit cycle, Allied's total return could lag its peers,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares, which have shed more than a quarter
of their value so far this year, closed at $14.73 Tuesday on
the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Citrix Work in Ghana, Africa Secures Additional 2008 Microsoft
                     Partner Award for Citizenship
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
Today, Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS), the global leader in
application delivery infrastructure, announced it has won the 2008
Microsoft Partner of the Year Global ISV - Infrastructure Special
Recognition award. This award recognizes the global independent
software vendor (ISV) for superior technology, delivering innovative
infrastructure solutions based on Microsoft platforms.

   Microsoft also honored Citrix with its Partner of the Year award
for Citizenship for the company's collaborative work on behalf of the
Traditional Area of Ashanti-Agogo, Ghana, Africa to provide an
infrastructure and training, allowing local residents access to
applications and the Internet for the first time.

   Building on an almost 20-year relationship, the 2008 Microsoft
Partner of the Year Global ISV - Infrastructure award is a testament
to the strength and commitment the two companies have in bringing
solutions to market that benefit their mutual and respective
customers. Over the past year, Citrix and Microsoft have reinvented
their already broad relationship in application virtualization to
include server and desktop virtualization, creating a complete
end-to-end virtualization solution from the datacenter to the desktop
that leverages technology from both companies.

   "It is a privilege to be honored by Microsoft with these
prestigious awards. It is clear evidence that the strength of our
relationship and joint go-to-market strategies are benefiting our
mutual customers across an increasingly broad set of product lines,"
said Mark Templeton, president and chief executive officer of Citrix
Systems. "After almost 20 years of building and nurturing our
relationship with Microsoft, we remain more committed than ever to
creating IT infrastructure solutions that leverage Microsoft
technologies as platforms for innovation."

   Joint Solutions Lay Foundation for the Dynamic Delivery Center

   Beginning in 1989, the two companies launched what was to become
an industry standard for Windows application delivery with Citrix
XenApp(TM) (previously known as Citrix Presentation Server(TM))
running on the Microsoft Windows Server Terminal Services platform. By
leveraging Windows as an innovation platform, Citrix has continued to
expand these technical and business synergies with Microsoft over the
years across an increasingly broad range of virtualization solutions.
Today, the two companies are working together closely to extend this
relationship to new Microsoft platforms such as Windows Server 2008
Hyper-V, bringing customers added value in server virtualization
solutions with Citrix XenServer(TM), application virtualization
solutions with Citrix XenApp and desktop virtualization solutions with
Citrix XenDesktop(TM). By ensuring these joint solutions are
integrated with Microsoft System Center, Citrix and Microsoft can
provide customers with comprehensive server, application and desktop
virtualization solutions that are interoperable and easy to manage.

   "It's great to see Citrix being honored for their contributions.
I've personally been working with Mark at Citrix for the last 13
years," said Bob Muglia, senior vice president of Microsoft's server
and tools business. "During that time, our teams have worked closely
together to ensure we're building complementary technologies that,
when combined, make an impact not only for our customers, but also for
the industry."

   At Citrix Synergy(TM) in May 2008, Citrix and Microsoft extended
their longtime alliance into the application networking arena by
introducing a new line of jointly developed branch office appliances
that combine Windows branch services with innovative application
delivery technology from Citrix (see press release). The new Citrix
Branch Repeater(TM) appliance sits between corporate datacenters and
branch offices, staging and retransmitting streamed applications to
branch office users and accelerating all application traffic over the
wide area network. Based on Windows Server and available with
Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server software,
the new Citrix Branch Repeater provides an ideal complement to
application virtualization solutions, enhancing application delivery
and performance while simultaneously delivering all critical Windows
Server infrastructure services in a single remotely managed appliance.

   "We congratulate Citrix on its award," said Ricky Caldwell,
systems engineer for Continental Airlines. "We have significantly
benefited from the close relationship between the two companies.
Continental chose to implement Citrix XenApp to provide virtualized
applications and desktops to our reservation agents working from home.
The combination of Citrix XenApp and Microsoft Windows Server and
Terminal Services has resulted in a high-value, high-availability
implementation that has increased employee efficiency and strengthened
our commitment to a more green environment. We feel it's a positive
step that Citrix and Microsoft have extended their strong relationship
this year into new areas like XenServer and XenDesktop to create a
partnership for end-to-end virtualization."

   Work in Ghana Inspires Partner of the Year for Citizenship Award

   Citrix was also awarded the 2008 Microsoft Partner of the Year
award for Citizenship. This award recognizes exceptional partners that
have made substantial commitments to society and their communities,
and can demonstrate the impact of their work. Citrix is being honored
with this award for bringing an IT infrastructure and related skills
to Ghana, Africa. Working with the Kofi Annan Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) Center for Excellence, Citrix trained
the next generation of faculty and systems engineers capable of
building and operating the latest and most cost-effective ICT access
infrastructure in Agogo, Ghana.

   The Agogo ICT Center offers this rural African village a window
into the world of online information. Using Citrix XenApp to access
applications remotely - including the Microsoft Office suite and the
Internet - holds the promise of improved healthcare, expanded
education and communications and new economic opportunities. Citrix
has worked closely with Sister Cities International (SCI), Digital
Development Partnership (DDP), and the Kofi Annan Center of Excellence
in ICT to provide guidance, technological expertise and contributions
to the project. Government officials in Ghana hope to replicate the IT
success in Agogo across the country, providing affordable,
subscription-based access to hosted applications and making high-speed
Internet connectivity available to everyone. More information on this
inspiring project can be found at http://www.citrix.com/microsoft .

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Bill Gates' retirement from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) later this week marks the end of an era for the software giant, thrusting CEO Steve Ballmer into the spotlight during one of the most challenging periods in the company's history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The departure of Gates, who will remain the company's non- executive chairman, coincides with an escalating rivalry with Google Inc (GOOG.O) and other competitors who are using the Internet to chip away at Microsoft's software dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Gates taking a step back, the weight of Microsoft's future falls squarely on Ballmer's shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has to think about some radical changes within the organization to not just fix the online business, but start innovating in some of the other ones," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the threat of new online rivals, Ballmer, who replaced Gates as the company's chief executive in 2000, made one of the boldest moves in Microsoft's history, with a $47.5 billion bid to buy Web pioneer Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The failure to clinch a deal has highlighted the company's shortcomings in its Web business and the urgency with which it needs to act or risk slipping farther behind Google in the growing and lucrative world of online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say Microsoft, which has grown from 30 employees in 1980, the year Ballmer joined the company, to almost 90,000 now, is not agile enough to keep up with rivals and its massive bureaucracy has stifled innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft just hasn't come up with anything all that innovative," said Andrew Loechl, director at Eagle Harbor Asset Management. "It's been buying up companies left and right for years, but it has not come up with anything internally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters for Microsoft is that its new set of competitors are changing the traditional rules of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has built its empire by charging one-time license fees for software such as Windows and Office, which run locally on a computer's hard drive. After a few years, it would encourage customers to upgrade to a new version of the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, its competitors are delivering software through Web browsers as a service, for which they either charge a monthly subscription or offer it for free with advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHANGES AHEAD?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company believes in a hybrid model that combines both software and services. It is a position being advocated by the man tapped to replace Gates as Microsoft's chief software architect, Ray Ozzie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Microsoft, Gates will work full-time at his charitable foundation, the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, but he will spend one day a week at the company, taking part in special projects in areas such as Web search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Helm, director of research at independent research firm Directions on Microsoft, said Gates' departure will not mean a major change in direction for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bill and Steve broadly agree on company strategy as a whole, especially in the view point of an investor. It's about protecting the legacy," said Helm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both Steve and Bill have been focused on protecting the two dominant businesses (Windows and Office) and making sure no competitor gets traction to compete in those areas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates and Ballmer are the two biggest shareholders of Microsoft. Gates still holds nearly a 9 percent stake in the company, while Ballmer owns roughly 4.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has downplayed the exit of Gates, emphasizing that Ballmer has been the main decision maker for nearly a decade, with Gates taking on a more technical role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Ballmer's reign as CEO, the company has managed to protect its dominant market share in Windows and Office. It has also built an $11 billion server business and entered the video game industry with the Xbox console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer has grown Microsoft's revenue to an estimated $67 billion this year from $25 billion in fiscal 2001. Net profit will nearly triple to an estimated $21 billion, according to analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the positive. The negative has been the company's stock price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, Microsoft's stock has fallen 52 percent. It has underperformed the Nasdaq, down 42 percent over the period, and SP 500, down 11 percent. Microsoft's stock performance also trails International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), up 14 percent, and Oracle Corp ORCL.O, which has fallen 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Kimberly-Clark, Procter &amp; Gamble, CuraGen, Microchip Technology and Repsol YPF

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: Kimberly-Clark Corporation
(NYSE: KMB), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG), CuraGen Corporation (Nasdaq:
CRGN), Microchip Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) and Repsol YPF S.A.
(NYSE: REP).

   Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the
free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

   Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:

   Competition for Kimberly-Clark

   Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE: KMB) has strong consumer brands
and is well respected for product innovation, especially in the diaper
category. Rising raw material costs, weak European operations, and
competitive pressures are constraining earnings growth despite the
company's progress on three cost savings programs - FORCE, the Global
Business Plan, and the Strategic Cost Reduction Plan.

   The company has strong free cash flow. It has repurchased shares,
financed in part by the issuance of debt, in order to achieve EPS
growth targets. However, in the attempt to balance growth and
profitability, the management faces many challenges, especially as
Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG) poses a significant market-share threat to
the diaper business.

   CuraGen Risk/Reward Balanced

   The proceeds from the sale of Belinostat, for treating solid
tumors and hematologic malignancies, strengthened CuraGen
Corporation's (Nasdaq: CRGN) balance sheet, but further weakened its
pipeline, especially after the termination of its key clinical program
Velafermin for the treatment of severe oral mucositis. We see this
deal to be neutral to the company.

   The failure of the Velafermin program, due to lack of efficacy, is
a big setback for CuraGen. The company has only one candidate in
clinical development now, CR-011, for breast cancer in addition to
melanoma indication.

   Competition Pressures Microchip

   We continue to see Microchip Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP)
well-positioned in its core microcontroller market for several
reasons. First, the company continues to be a leading player in the
8-bit microcontroller space. Moreover, the company is targeting the
high-performance 16-bit microcontroller market and demand is
reflecting strong momentum.

   Meanwhile, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the company
reported revenues of $260.4 million, which were up 0.8% year over year
and higher than our estimate of $255 million. GAAP EPS of $0.40 came
in above the updated guidance of $0.36-$0.38 (previously $0.35-$0.38),
easily beating consensus estimate of $0.37, namely due to a one-time
tax advantage.

   Neutral on Gas Producer Repsol

   We are maintaining our Hold recommendation on Repsol YPF S.A.
(NYSE: REP) ADRs following the quarterly results, which benefited from
higher commodity prices and improved refined product mix. We also like
the company's recent exploratory successes and the move to reduce its
Argentine exposure.

   However, we continue believe that the challenges facing the
company will continue to weigh on valuation, limiting its upside from
current levels. This is characterized by declining reserves, weak
volumes, very low reserve lives, and rising costs. The company's
proved reserves declined nearly 28% in the last two years.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI, June 25 (Reuters) - Mid-sized Chinese construction
machinery maker Changsha Zoomlion has won a joint bid with
Goldman Sachs and two other investors to buy Italy's Compagnia
Italiana Forme Acciaio SpA (Cifa) for 271 million euros ($422
million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Changsha Zoomlion Industry Science and Technology Development
000157.SZ, which is eager to secure a foothold in developed
markets, said on Wednesday it would pay 163 million euros for a
60 percent stake in the Italian construction machinery maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman (GS.N), Mandarin Capital Partners and Chinese
private-equity firm Hony Capital will hold the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's another major move by a second-tier Chinese
construction machinery maker in mature markets after Sany
announced plans for a U.S. plant," said Chen Yaobang, an industry
analyst with Huatai Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zoomlion rival Sany Heavy Industry Co (600031.SS) said
earlier this year it planned to invest more than $100 million in
a new U.S. facility, which will make it the first Chinese firm to
manufacture construction gear in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The moves will give them a foothold in mature markets and
boost their overall exports," Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zoomlion's shares, traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange,
fell their daily limit to 18.94 yuan on Wednesday,
underperforming a 3.64 percent gain in the Shanghai Composite
Index .SSEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said Zoomlion, whose shares had been suspended from
trading since April 8, was merely catching up with the benchmark
index, which slumped more than 20 percent during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OVERSEAS PRESENCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many Chinese machinery makers are building up their presence
overseas in hopes of eventually competing with global leaders
such as Caterpillar (CAT.N). The Chinese government is also
encouraging domestic companies to invest abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Zoomlion deal also shows an increasing connection between
China Inc and private equity firms. With equity markets
struggling, private equity firms are seeking more chances to sell
companies to hungry Chinese buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for buyers, a China-private equity link-up allows buyout
firms to deploy more capital across the region, and helps prevent
a Chinese company from over-paying for an asset -- something
government officials are especially sensitive about after several
poorly performing overseas deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese telecommunications company Huawei Technologies
[HWT.UL] teamed up with U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital
last year in an unsuccessful bid for 3Com Corp COMS.O, a U.S.
network equipment maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zoomlion will use $50 million of its own cash and borrow $200
million from the Hong Kong branch of Britain's Barclays Bank to
fund the purchase of Cifa, which is being sold by Italian private
equity company Magenta and eight other shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zoomlion expects the acquisition to help it expand sales
overseas, which came to 1.02 billion yuan ($148.6 million) in
2007, or roughly 11 percent of its overall sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its chairman and chief executive Chunxin Zhan has said that
he expected the company to generate 40 percent of its sales
outside China by 2010.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, June 25 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N)
declared a force majeure on its Nigerian Escravos crude oil
exports after armed youths blew up a supply pipeline last week,
a company official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There has been no impact on Chevron's offshore production
and Escravos terminal is still operating," said spokeswoman
Margaret Cooper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, we have declared force majeure because production

obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Armed youths on Thursday sabotaged Chevron's Abiteye-Olero
crude pipeline in the Niger Delta, cutting about 120,000 barrels
per day of crude output, according to the military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has declined to say how much production was affected
by the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A wave of attacks in the West African country has cut
production by a fifth since early 2006, helping push world oil
prices to record highs.

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, June 25 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N)
declared a force majeure on its Nigerian Escravos crude oil
exports after armed youths blew up a supply pipeline last week,
a company official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "There has been no impact on Chevron's offshore production
and Escravos terminal is still operating," said spokeswoman
Margaret Cooper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, we have declared force majeure because production
losses will result in delayed loadings of a few cargoes at the

&lt;p&gt;DETROIT (Reuters) - Shares of General Motors Corp hit their 
lowest level since 1955 and dragged down the auto sector on 
Thursday after Goldman Sachs cut the struggling U.S. industry's 
largest manufacturer to a "sell" rating and warned it would 
have to raise capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The panicky slide in GM (GM.N) shares capped a period of 
growing concern about liquidity risks to U.S. automakers and 
suppliers from a domestic auto market reeling from record gas 
prices and the impact of a housing slump and tighter credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman Sachs warning, including the unusual "sell" 
call on the U.S. auto industry's largest player after a period 
of sharp stock price declines just ahead of the close of the 
second quarter, prompted selling across the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said the embattled 
automaker had enough liquidity to carry it through the year and 
had financial flexibility beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've got a very good, solid funding base under any 
scenario we see, solid through the end of this year," Wagoner 
told reporters after an economic event hosted by U.S. 
presidential candidate Barack Obama. "We have a lot of options 
to fund beyond that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chrysler LLC, for its part, denied rumors it was facing a 
cash crunch or that it had been driven to filing for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy. Those rumors had driven down loan prices for the 
privately held automaker, according to Reuters LPC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The rumor is without merit," Chrysler spokesman Dave 
Elshoff said. "There is no basis for the rumor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Debt and equity markets were affected by growing concern 
for the deepening risks for the auto sector. The cost to insure 
the debt of GM and Ford Motor Co (F.N) hit records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM shares were down nearly 11 percent in early afternoon 
trade and touched a low of $11.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major GM suppliers were also hammered. Shares in American 
Axle  Manufacturing Holdings (AXL.N), which supplies axles for 
GM trucks, dropped 12 percent. Lear Corp (LEA.N), downgraded to 
a "sell" rating by Goldman, tumbled 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Ford, which had its price target cut by Goldman, 
dropped almost 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the Thursday price fall, GM's market cap fell to less 
than $6.5 billion. The company has the smallest market 
capitalization in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of 
which it has been a component since 1925.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Next above GM in terms of market value in the Dow is Alcoa 
Inc (AA.N), with a market cap of about $30 billion. Walt Disney 
Co's (DIS.N) cap is 10 times GM's at about $60 billion and 
Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is the leader at about $460 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GM shares have lost 38 percent over the last month as more 
evidence has piled up that U.S. auto sales weakened further in 
June, raising doubts about the prospect for the second-half 
recovery that GM and other major automakers had anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch Ratings on Wednesday cut debt ratings on GM and 
Chrysler ratings deeper into the "junk" category," citing the 
fallout from weaker sales and high gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch also said it would review Ford ratings over the next 
six weeks, which could also result in a downgrade.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CASH BURN RAISES CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three U.S. automakers, which have been hardest hit by 
the collapse in demand for pickup trucks and SUVs, have faced 
scrutiny in recent days over whether they have sufficient 
liquidity to ride out the current downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, who has invested about 
$1 billion in a contrarian bet on Ford, has offered to provide 
more capital to support the automaker's turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kerkorian's chief auto adviser, Jerry York, told Reuters on 
Wednesday that he did not expect the U.S. auto market to bounce 
back in the second half of this year with an only limited 
rebound in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, Chrysler drew down a $2 billion credit 
line from Cerberus and Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), the German car 
maker that sold off a roughly 80 percent stake in Chrysler to 
Cerberus last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under terms of the sale, Chrysler had until August to draw 
on the credit line, which included $1.5 billion from Daimler. 
The credit line pays interest fixed at 7 percentage points 
above the London interbank rate, Daimler has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chrysler, which lost $1.6 billion in 2007, has said it 
ended the year with $9 billion in cash. Its U.S. sales are down 
23 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have also fixed their sights on GM, which ended 
the first quarter with $31 billion in cash and undrawn credit. 
Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan both warned last week that GM would 
be forced to borrow heavily to shore up its liquidity position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Archambault, who also cut his 
ratings on Tenneco Inc (TEN.N), said he expected GM shares to 
continue to underperform as market fundamentals deteriorate. He 
cut his six-month price target on GM stock by $8 to $11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think GM's automotive cash flow burn this year and next 
is likely to lead it to look to raise capital, which we believe 
could lead to significant shareholder dilution and/or a cut to 
the company's dividend," Archambault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Kevin Krolicki in Detroit, Eric Yep and

&lt;p&gt; (Changes first and third paragraph to reflect that any
increase in revenue will not be material)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) said it was
cutting fees gas stations pay to process credit and debit card
transactions, a move that may encourage motorists to pay for
gas with Visa cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said it was capping its interchange fees, or the fee
the merchant pays to the customer's credit or debit card bank
to process a sale. The move will not result in any loss of
revenue for Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But gas stations paying lower fees may be more willing to
accept Visa cards for transactions instead of encouraging
motorists to use cash, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a consumer using a Visa credit card to buy $60 worth of
gas, the merchant will pay 94 cents in interchange fees, down
14 percent from the current level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Average retail gasoline prices have reached $4.07 per
gallon, up more than a $1 per gallon from year-ago levels.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Thursday that it has extended a $28.82 billion loan to JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) for the acquisition of Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Total credit extended by the New York Fed is lower than originally anticipated as a result of an extensive review of the portfolio," the New York Fed said in a statement on its Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, JPMorgan has extended a $1.15 billion loan to a Delaware limited liability company (LLC), the statement said. The LLC, which will be consolidated on the books of the New York Fed, will use the proceeds of the loans to finance the purchase of a portfolio of assets formerly owned by Bear Stearns Cos Inc, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, in a highly unusual move, the Fed provided the financing for JPMorgan to acquire Bear Stearns in order to prevent Bear from going bankrupt and potentially dragging down the entire financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line of credit is backed by the $28.8 billion portfolio of bonds and other fixed-income products held by Bear Stearns before it collapsed in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed has said the portfolio contains collateralized mortgage obligations, most of which are backed by government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N. It also consists of asset-backed securities -- a sector that includes subprime mortgage bonds -- adjustable-rate mortgages, commercial mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized bond obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns gave a $30 billion marked to market value for this portfolio as of March 14, when it was the fifth-biggest U.S. investment bank. JPMorgan Chase agreed to acquire Bear on March 16 with the Fed's approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimated fair value of the portfolio, as of June 26, will be released in the Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.1. on July 3, the Fed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, the estimated fair value of the portfolio will be updated quarterly in the H.4.1 release, "generally within two weeks following the quarter end," the Fed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed's balance sheet, presented weekly, will include consolidated LLC activity such as purchases, sales and accruals, the central bank added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by John Parry and Al Yoon; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Dissident shareholder Carl Icahn renewed pressure on Yahoo Inc to strike a merger deal with Microsoft Corp and replace Chief Executive Jerry Yang in his latest proxy filing on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In papers filed with the U.S. Securities  Exchange Commission ahead of a showdown for control of Yahoo at its August 1 shareholder meeting, Icahn said his nine-member alternative slate of directors still seeks a friendly deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he called on Microsoft not to consider any alternative transaction short of an outright merger unless it can ensure Yahoo's stock price reaches a level of $33 a share or higher. This was the price Microsoft offered Yahoo in early May which was rebuffed by Yahoo, ending full-out merger talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholder activist also reiterated plans to hire a "talented and experienced CEO" to replace Jerry Yang as CEO and return him to his previous role as "Chief Yahoo" -- executive without portfolio and public cheerleader for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang, who co-founded Yahoo in 1994, was elevated a year ago this month to replace outgoing CEO Terry Semel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn says his group beneficially owns 68.8 million shares, or 4.98 percent of Yahoo's outstanding shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Eric Auchard; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Thursday it started selling its new server virtualization software about six weeks ahead of schedule, putting pressure on market leader VMware Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Chevron output, edits)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Randy Fabi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, June 26 (Reuters) - Nigeria's oil minister said on
Thursday he was confident a deal could be reached between the
country's senior oil workers union and Chevron (CVX.N) to avert
an all-out strike that could sharply cut output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some union officials expressed growing impatience with
talks and left open the possibility of a strike early next
week, even if negotiations were to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are reasonable men. We will find a way (to reach a
deal)," Oil Minister Odein Ajumogobia told Reuters after the
first day of talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government is helping to broker a deal between the two
sides, after talks collapsed last week and the oil ministry was
forced to intervene at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks will resume on Friday with the two sides expected to
meet with Abubakar Yar'Adua, group managing director of state
oil firm the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Abuja is hoping to avoid a further hit on its production.
Militant attacks have shut a fifth of the country's output
since early 2006, helping push world oil prices to record
highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Union workers have staged a partial strike at Chevron this
week, stopping administrative staff from getting to their
offices in the main commercial city Lagos, but output has not
been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is still further progress to be made," said Bayo
Olowoshile, secretary general of the PENGASSAN union. "We have
to find a way for talks to continue that assures those on the
ground that it will meet their expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said talks could continue into next week as the oil
ministry has asked the union to submit a report on its
grievances with Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOME DISAPPOINTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some union members expressed disappointment with the
progress of talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think the (workers') congress will be happy with
what was said today," said John Nwanosike, chairman of
Chevron's union branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said union members were due to meet on Monday and could
vote on whether any action was needed in response to this
week's talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron branch of PENGASSAN has been demanding the
transfer of the expatriate managing director from Nigeria,
accusing him of violating safety standards, having too many
foreign staff and a lack of respect for Nigerian workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's output from Nigeria is around 350,000 barrels per
day, of which its equity share is around 129,000 bpd.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs, respected and
feared on Wall Street for its investment savvy, displayed its
sway over markets on Thursday when it almost single-handedly
pushed U.S. blue chips to within a whisker of a bear market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a barrage of downbeat research notes issued before U.S.
stocks opened, Goldman (GS.N) urged investors to dump bank and
car stocks. Its call on General Motors (GM.N) sank shares of
the American automotive icon to lows last seen in 1955.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman analysts also cut U.S. brokerages to "neutral" and
put Citigroup (C.N) on its "conviction sell" list, pushing its
shares to 10-year lows. Goldman also forecast a second-quarter
loss for Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N, and its shares tumbled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the ensuing selling frenzy that engulfed Wall Street,
the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 358 points. The Dow is
now down 19 percent from its record high in October -- close to
the 20 percent decline that the Street considers the onset of a
bear market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course,  the famed investment bank has made its share of
mistaken calls, but the ability of the investment bank to move
markets seems more noticeable than usual of late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman in mid-May said that the price for a barrel of
crude would average $141 in the second half of 2008. Oil prices
jumped over $140 for the first time on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weeks earlier, Goldman predicted $200-a-barrel oil over the
next two years, and oil markets jumped on that forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman research has greater credibility that other
firms," said Stanley Nabi, vice chairman at Silvercrest Asset
Management Group. "I receive their research every morning, and
this is the first thing I read every morning," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nabi said Goldman, like everyone else on Wall Street, can
have feet of clay, but the high-profile firm hires the best and
trains them well. "That counts for something," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Goldman has been tainted by the crisis in subprime
lending, the bank has "taken less hits relative to the size of
their capital," Nabi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Matt McCormick of Bahl  Gaynor said the fact that
Goldman has missed most of the subprime implosion has given the
bank more credibility than everybody else on the Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When most of the herd is going one way, and Goldman goes
another way, it takes real guts and research," McCormick said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If they make calls, you can almost hear your CIO saying,
'If Goldman is doing it, why aren't we?'" he said, referring to
the chief investment officer, the person who calls the shots at
money management firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Add it all up, and Goldman has "a mystique about them; they
hire brilliant people," McCormick said. "If they make the call,
it's almost self-fulfilling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's aura can feed the bank's detractors. An analyst
at a money manager who requested anonymity said Goldman is good
at creating volatility for its hedge fund clients. He pointed
to its research on Citigroup, which he said was not new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They're just trying to stir up the market," the analyst
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has tried to rebut its alleged influence over
markets. Its chief financial officer said last week that market
views of the trading prowess of Goldman, the most active
investment bank in energy markets, was "way overblown."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regardless, Goldman has been influential in its calls on
the price of crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was the first to forecast the price of crude oil
would hit $100 a barrel more than two years ago, when those
levels were still far away. It was in the news in early May
with a $200-a-barrel forecast for oil over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Goldman's rare missteps, the bank on Monday
acknowledged it had goofed when it ugraded U.S. financial and
consumer shares seven weeks ago. Goldman's downgrades sparked
selling in those two sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our thesis was clearly wrong in hindsight," wrote Goldman
strategists.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds further context)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By John Parry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of
New York said on Thursday that it has extended a $28.82 billion
loan, slightly less than the $29 billion originally expected,
to JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) for the acquisition of Bear
Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, in a highly unusual move, the Fed provided the
financing for JPMorgan to acquire Bear Stearns in order to
prevent Bear from going bankrupt and potentially dragging down
the entire financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Total credit extended by the New York Fed is lower than
originally anticipated as a result of an extensive review of
the portfolio," the New York Fed said in a statement on its Web
site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, JPMorgan has extended a $1.15 billion loan to
a Delaware limited liability company (LLC), the statement said.
The LLC, which will be consolidated on the books of the New
York Fed, will use the proceeds of the loans to finance the
purchase of a portfolio of assets formerly owned by Bear
Stearns Cos Inc, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The line of credit is backed by the $28.8 billion portfolio
of bonds and other fixed-income products held by Bear Stearns
before it collapsed in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed has said the portfolio contains collateralized
mortgage obligations, most of which are backed by
government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae FNM.N and
Freddie Mac FRE.N. It also consists of asset-backed
securities -- a sector that includes subprime mortgage bonds --
adjustable-rate mortgages, commercial mortgage-backed
securities, and collateralized bond obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Markets for many of these investments have deteriorated
this month as outlooks for U.S. housing worsen and investors
see banks and hedge funds continuing to unload risky assets
from balance sheets. Brokers alone sold $300 billion in balance
sheet assets this quarter, including $45 billion in residential
and commercial mortgage debt, according to Citigroup analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Increased risk aversion has erased some or all of the
rallies that followed the Fed's orchestrated rescue of Bear
Stearns and its programs to boost liquidity to banks eased
expectations of asset sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders pushed prices on the "AAA" portion of the ABX-HE
07-2 subprime mortgage bond index to a record low on Wednesday
of 46.83, down from a close to 60 in May and piercing the March
low of just above 50, according to Markit, the index's
administrator. The index was weaker again on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A similar derivative index for commercial mortgage bonds
has worsened to April levels but is far from the record high
yield spreads in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear Stearns gave a $30 billion marked to market value for
the portfolio as of March 14, when it was the fifth-biggest
U.S. investment bank. JPMorgan Chase agreed to acquire Bear on
March 16 with the Fed's approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The estimated fair value of the portfolio, as of June 26,
will be released in the Federal Reserve Statistical Release
H.4.1. on July 3, the Fed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After that, the estimated fair value of the portfolio will
be updated quarterly in the H.4.1 release, "generally within
two weeks following the quarter end," the Fed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed's balance sheet, presented weekly, will include
consolidated LLC activity such as purchases, sales and
accruals, the central bank added.

&lt;p&gt;Lower Interchange Rates and Processing Changes Can Make Buying Gas
Easier for Consumers and Benefit Gas Stations
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) today announced that it is implementing
processing and rate changes that will result in benefits for American
consumers and fuel merchants frustrated by rising prices at the pump.
Visa's new processing approach for fuel transactions will enable
consumers to buy gas more easily and allow motorists and station
owners to better avoid the risks and inconveniences associated with
pump limits and holds on funds. Visa also will reduce interchange
rates for fuel transactions, which can lower costs for oil companies
and service stations and can be passed onto consumers at the pump.

   "While Visa cannot lower the price of crude oil, there are things
we can do to help make the process of buying gas easier for our
cardholders. And by lowering our rates, we hope to see oil companies
pass these savings along to their stations and ultimately to
consumers," said Bill Sheedy, global head of corporate strategy and
business development for Visa Inc. "As oil prices rapidly rise to
unprecedented levels, we are accelerating our ongoing efforts to
address the issues in the fuel segment."

   The new programs come amid a nearly 100 percent jump in the price
of crude oil in the past year, which has driven gas prices in the U.S.
from an average of $2.98 a gallon in June 2007 to $4.07 in June
2008(1). In this extraordinary environment, Visa's combination of
fuel-payment changes can provide consumers with increased purchasing
power at the pump and offer fuel merchants opportunities to improve
their business operations.

   Visa is restructuring consumer interchange for transactions at
automated fuel dispensers and service stations in the United States,
effectively lowering interchange rates. Interchange for Visa consumer
debit cards (Visa Check Card and Visa prepaid) will be capped at $0.95
per transaction. This change will become effective July 18, 2008. Visa
credit interchange applied to fuel transactions has been restructured
into a single, lower rate across all consumer credit card
transactions. This adjustment will take effect system-wide for all
fuel transactions in October 2008. In the meantime, Visa is willing to
work with fuel merchants and their acquirers individually to process
credit transactions at these lower rates, ahead of October.

   "Even though Visa's interchange rates on fuel transactions are
already among the lowest in our system, the run-up in fuel prices to
today's unprecedented levels requires an exceptional response," said
Sheedy.

   As an example, under the new rates, if a motorist uses a Visa
Signature credit card to fill a 15-gallon tank at $4 a gallon - or $60
total - the acquiring institution generally would pay $0.94 in
interchange fees, a savings of 14 percent over current rates. Using a
debit card, that same transaction could be cleared within hours,
quickly removing the $60 hold that is often placed on a consumer's
funds for one or two days in the current system. For higher
transaction amounts, these interchange adjustments have an even
greater impact. For a $120 consumer transaction, the level of
interchange for the same Visa Signature transaction would be $1.63,
for a 43 percent savings. With the cap on Visa Check Card interchange,
an acquirer would see a reduction of 59 percent on fuel transactions.

   "People are frustrated enough with the price of gas today; they
shouldn't be frustrated with the payment process as well," said
Sheedy. "We took an entirely new approach to processing fuel payments,
and created a solution that removes many of the major barriers that
consumers and station owners face today at the pump."

   This fall, Visa will implement Real-Time Clearing, which
represents a fundamental change and significant improvement in how
fuel transactions are processed. With Real-Time Clearing, transactions
will be processed immediately instead of at the end of the day. This
can significantly reduce the hold times that financial institutions
place on cardholders' accounts. Gas stations will send a final
transaction amount within hours - if not minutes - of a cardholder's
purchase. Current fuel-payment processing can take up to two days or
more.

   Real-Time Clearing also provides merchants and acquirers with more
control over their acceptance processes, allowing them to make better
authorization decisions. This can help drive increased sales for
stations because it reduces the number of consumers that encounter a
shut-off before their tanks are full. Consumers benefit by being able
to pump more gas in a single transaction before hitting authorization
limits. Real-Time Clearing can also qualify a station's transactions
for better interchange rates at higher ticket amounts, which can lower
station owners' costs.

   Until the new processing changes are implemented in Visa's October
systems upgrade, Visa is allowing consumer fuel transactions up to
$125 to qualify for its best-available interchange rates. This interim
step is effective July 18, 2008 and will remain in place through
October 2009. Once gas stations and their financial institutions
migrate to Real-Time Clearing, consumer fuel transactions up to $500
can qualify for Visa's best available interchange rates.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings upgraded The Walt Disney Company's (Disney) Issuer
Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt rating to 'A' and the
company's commercial paper (CP) program rating to 'F1'. The Outlook is
Stable.

   The Walt Disney Company

   --IDR upgraded to 'A' from 'A-';

   --Senior unsecured debt upgraded to 'A' from 'A-';

   --Commercial paper upgraded to 'F1' from 'F2'.

   ABC Inc.

   --IDR upgraded to 'A' from 'A-';

   --Senior unsecured debt upgraded to 'A' from 'A-'.

   Disney Enterprises, Inc.

   --IDR upgraded to 'A' from 'A-';

   --Senior unsecured debt upgraded to 'A' from 'A-'.

   Disney's ratings continue to reflect the company's leading market
positions in core businesses, unique brand franchises, strong cash
flows, and significant financial flexibility. Disney has benefited
from strong multi-year performance at its cable networks which has
resulted in significant increases in stable, incrementally high-margin
carriage fees. In addition, Disney continues to benefit from cyclical
improvements in virtually all of its business segments as it continues
to successfully leverage its hit-driven brands across multiple
distribution platforms. Credit concerns center on the cyclical
volatility of its theme parks and resorts, studio and broadcast
network businesses. Also, while credit metrics have improved from
already strong levels, share repurchase activity has been aggressive
and could be concerning if sustained while the operations experienced
weakness. The stresses required to impair the company's financial
flexibility are consistent with an 'A' rating, and Fitch believes that
potential rating pressure is less likely to be driven by operating
performance than by discretionary actions on the part of management.

   Operating performance has been extremely strong as consolidated
EBITDA climbed $2.1 billion or 29% over the last 18 months, resulting
in EBITDA of $9.4 billion (before dividends from equity investments)
for the latest twelve month (LTM) period ended March 31, 2008. The
growth is due to a combination of continued monetization of its
cyclical hits, but also, importantly, continued growth in the cash
flows from its cable networks which has been driven by carriage fees
at ESPN and the Disney Channel. Fitch views cable network carriage
fees as a very stable source of cash flow when linked with the top
channels that Disney offers. The company's cable network segment alone
covers interest expense by over 5 times (x) (i.e., by excluding a
large portion of the more volatile, cyclical hit-driven components of
Disney's business, there is still substantial interest coverage).
While competitors do exist for Disney's cable channels, Fitch is not
concerned with the stability of this segment.

   The media &amp; entertainment industry currently faces both secular
and cyclical challenges. While secular challenges related to time
shifting technologies and piracy do exist, management at Disney's TV
and Film studios have been pro-active to embrace video-on-demand
technologies, as well as integrated marketing opportunities. As stated
previously, Fitch expects the major studios (including Disney) to be
less exposed to the secular challenges of the industry as they own the
content that can be applied to whatever distribution platform viewers
find most appealing.

   The cyclical challenges facing the industry relate to both the
existing weak macro-economic environment, as well as the general
volatility that accompanies hit-driven businesses. Fitch believes that
Disney is less exposed to some of the advertising-based cyclical
challenges facing other Media &amp; Entertainment Companies given its
small reliance on local advertising. While the current macro-economic
environment could put pressure on the Parks and Resorts segment, Fitch
believes the company's focus on its lower cost value packages and
efforts to cross collaborate and implement best practices rather than
operating the parks as stand alone businesses could make any potential
downturn less severe than historical periods. While results have been
resilient thus far, the segment's revenues are generally tied to the
health of the macro-economy and its profits can swing widely (2x -3x
the changes in revenue) due to the significant operating leverage in
the business. That being said, the base cash flows from this segment
are substantial even with a significant decline (2002 segment EBITDA
declined nearly 20% after the events of 2001, yet was still $1.2
billion after CapEx). Fitch believes that under a downside case the
parks business could experience 10%-15% declines in attendance, modest
pricing pressure and reduction in consumer spending, and a more than
20% reduction in EBITDA. This stressed scenario still results in
significant segment cash flows.

   The hit-driven business segments have benefited over the last few
years from major theatrical, network and DVD hits. Fitch is somewhat
skeptical whether Disney's current run of studio hits is sustainable
as it attempts to replace the strong Pirates franchise and as the DVD
market matures further. That being said, the Broadcast and Film
segments account for less than 25% of the company's cash flows and
Fitch believes Disney's strategy shift in 2006 to concentrate on
family-friendly films that can be easily integrated with theme parks,
cable networks, consumer products and other businesses was a prudent
move that should help position the company to align its cost structure
with future revenue prospects. Unlike most of the other media
conglomerates, there are significant synergies between Disney's Film
studios and its other operating segments that continue to fuel growth
overall. Fitch believes the leveragability of this operating strategy
and Fitch's belief that they are the only conglomerate to successfully
broadly implement such strategy, at least partially mitigates the
cyclicality hit component of their businesses.

   Fitch generally looks at a range of adjusted and supplemental
leverage metrics when assessing Disney. These metrics span the
inclusion/exclusion of the non-recourse debt from the company's Euro
Disney and Hong Kong Disney investments, dividends from its Lifetime
and A stakes, and the 20% minority interest in ESPN held by Hearst
Corporation. For the LTM period ended March 31, 2008 and taking into
account the conversion of $1.3 billion of convertible notes on April
15, 2008, consolidated gross (recourse and non-recourse) debt to
operating EBITDA (excluding dividends from equity investments) was
1.5x; while recourse debt to EBITDA (including dividends from equity
investments) was 1.1x. Free cash flow (after dividends) was 25% of
gross consolidated debt and approximately 33% of recourse debt.
Consistent with Fitch's methodology, non-recourse debt is included in
metrics due to Fitch's belief that the company would be inclined to
support the debt because the absence of such support could result in
harming the company's reputation and opportunity for expansion into
desirable markets. Fitch recognizes the consolidated leverage metrics
are conservative and therefore also uses the supplemental metrics when
assessing the Disney credit. Disney's financial metrics (regardless of
adjustments) and business models presently place the company
comfortably within the 'A' rating category and offer the company
flexibility to continue to invest in its businesses, return capital to
shareholders, make prudent (in terms of both size and strategy)
acquisitions and endure a cyclical downturn.

   Disney's liquidity is solid with $3.9 billion of cash and $2.2
billion of revolver availability (net of commercial paper and
outstanding letters of credit). In addition, Fitch expects the company
to generate in excess of $3 billion in annual free cash flow. The bank
facilities consist of a $2.25 billion senior unsecured revolver
expiring in February 2010 and a $2.25 billion senior unsecured
revolver expiring in February 2011.

   Fitch links the IDRs of the issuing entities (predominantly based
on the lack of any material restrictions on movements of cash between
the entities) and treats the unsecured debt of the entire company as
pari passu. Fitch recognizes the absence of upstream guarantees from
the operating assets and that debt at Disney Enterprises is
structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, Fitch does
not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to the
strong 'A' category investment grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of
stable financial policies and the anticipation that future debt will
be issued by Walt Disney Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing
between the security ratings if Fitch viewed there to be heightened
risk of the company's IDR falling to non-investment grade (where
Disney Enterprises' superior recovery prospects would be more
relevant).

&lt;p&gt;In morning trading, the shares were down $1.03, or 5.5 percent, at $17.82 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares were among the biggest drags on the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard  Poor's 500, which both fell more than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also touched their lowest level since October 1998, the month that Sanford "Sandy" Weill merged his Travelers Group with Citicorp to create Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Tanona, the Goldman analyst, added Citigroup to Goldman's "Americas conviction sell" list and cut his price target on the stock to $16 from $20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommended a "paired" trade in which investors sell Citigroup shares short, betting on a decline, and buy Morgan Stanley shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst said Citigroup might take $8.9 billion of write-downs for the April-to-June period, leading to its third straight quarterly loss. He also said the bank might need to cut its quarterly dividend for a second time this year, after lowering it 41 percent to 32 cents per share in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanona's forecast suggests deeper problems for Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit, who is trying to turn the bank around after nearly $15 billion of losses in the last two quarters, and more than $46 billion of credit losses and write-downs since the middle of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see multiple headwinds for Citigroup including additional write-downs, higher consumer provisions as a result of rapidly deteriorating consumer credit trends, and the potential for additional capital raises, dividend cuts, or asset sales," the analyst wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandit became chief executive in December, replacing Charles Prince, who resigned under pressure the previous month. Weill had hand-picked Prince as his replacement when he gave up the top job in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden said on a Deutsche Bank conference call that Citigroup could take substantial write-downs this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIVIDEND CUT MAY BE NEEDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanona said Citigroup might write off $7.1 billion related to collateralized debt obligations and associated hedges related to monoline insurers, $1.2 billion for other asset classes and $600 million for structured note liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He now expects Citigroup to lose 75 cents a share this quarter, compared with his earlier forecast of a profit of 25 cents. He also expects a full-year loss of $1.20 a share, compared with his prior view for a profit of 30 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of May, Citigroup had raised some $42 billion since last fall, including injections from sovereign wealth funds, data compiled by Reuters News show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanona said the bank may now need to issue common stock or sell assets to raise capital, because regulators may forbid it from issuing more preferred or convertible securities. He also said halving the dividend could preserve $3.5 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the firm's current level of earnings power, we do not believe the dividend is safe," Tanona wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 24, Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski projected $8 billion of write-downs for Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanona also downgraded the U.S. brokerage sector to "neutral" from "attractive," saying deteriorating fundamentals will likely prolong any recovery from the credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He projected a $4.2 billion second-quarter write-down for Merrill Lynch  Co, leading to a quarterly loss for the largest U.S. brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect write-downs for Citigroup and Merrill to outpace what we saw from Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers Holdings recently, due to Citigroup's and Merrill's large exposures to ABS CDOs (asset-backed security CDOs) and associated hedges with the monolines," Tanona wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co analyst, on Thursday projected a $3.5 billion second-quarter write-down for Merrill. Banc of America Securities analyst Michael Hecht made the same forecast earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 17, Goldman analysts led by Richard Ramsden said U.S. banks may need $65 billion more capital to cope with a global credit crisis that will not peak until 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DETROIT (Reuters) - Shares of General Motors Corp hit their lowest level since 1955 and dragged down the auto sector on Thursday after Goldman Sachs cut the struggling U.S. industry's largest manufacturer to a "sell" rating and warned it would have to raise capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panicky slide in GM (GM.N) shares capped a period of growing concern about liquidity risks to U.S. automakers and suppliers from a domestic auto market reeling from record gas prices and the impact of a housing slump and tighter credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs warning, including the unusual "sell" call on the U.S. auto industry's largest player after a period of sharp stock price declines just ahead of the close of the second quarter, prompted selling across the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said the embattled automaker had enough liquidity to carry it through the year and had financial flexibility beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've got a very good, solid funding base under any scenario we see, solid through the end of this year," Wagoner told reporters after an economic event hosted by U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama. "We have a lot of options to fund beyond that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrysler LLC, for its part, denied rumors it was facing a cash crunch or that it had been driven to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Those rumors had driven down loan prices for the privately held automaker, according to Reuters LPC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rumor is without merit," Chrysler spokesman Dave Elshoff said. "There is no basis for the rumor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debt and equity markets were affected by growing concern for the deepening risks for the auto sector. The cost to insure the debt of GM and Ford Motor Co (F.N) hit records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM shares were down nearly 11 percent in early afternoon trade and touched a low of $11.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major GM suppliers were also hammered. Shares in American Axle  Manufacturing Holdings (AXL.N), which supplies axles for GM trucks, dropped 12 percent. Lear Corp (LEA.N), downgraded to a "sell" rating by Goldman, tumbled 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Ford, which had its price target cut by Goldman, dropped almost 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Thursday price fall, GM's market cap fell to less than $6.5 billion. The company has the smallest market capitalization in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of which it has been a component since 1925.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next above GM in terms of market value in the Dow is Alcoa Inc (AA.N), with a market cap of about $30 billion. Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) cap is 10 times GM's at about $60 billion and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is the leader at about $460 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GM shares have lost 38 percent over the last month as more evidence has piled up that U.S. auto sales weakened further in June, raising doubts about the prospect for the second-half recovery that GM and other major automakers had anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings on Wednesday cut debt ratings on GM and Chrysler ratings deeper into the "junk" category," citing the fallout from weaker sales and high gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch also said it would review Ford ratings over the next six weeks, which could also result in a downgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CASH BURN RAISES CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three U.S. automakers, which have been hardest hit by the collapse in demand for pickup trucks and SUVs, have faced scrutiny in recent days over whether they have sufficient liquidity to ride out the current downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, who has invested about $1 billion in a contrarian bet on Ford, has offered to provide more capital to support the automaker's turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerkorian's chief auto adviser, Jerry York, told Reuters on Wednesday that he did not expect the U.S. auto market to bounce back in the second half of this year with an only limited rebound in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Chrysler drew down a $2 billion credit line from Cerberus and Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), the German car maker that sold off a roughly 80 percent stake in Chrysler to Cerberus last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under terms of the sale, Chrysler had until August to draw on the credit line, which included $1.5 billion from Daimler. The credit line pays interest fixed at 7 percentage points above the London interbank rate, Daimler has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrysler, which lost $1.6 billion in 2007, has said it ended the year with $9 billion in cash. Its U.S. sales are down 23 percent so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have also fixed their sights on GM, which ended the first quarter with $31 billion in cash and undrawn credit. Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan both warned last week that GM would be forced to borrow heavily to shore up its liquidity position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Archambault, who also cut his ratings on Tenneco Inc (TEN.N), said he expected GM shares to continue to underperform as market fundamentals deteriorate. He cut his six-month price target on GM stock by $8 to $11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think GM's automotive cash flow burn this year and next is likely to lead it to look to raise capital, which we believe could lead to significant shareholder dilution and/or a cut to the company's dividend," Archambault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kevin Krolicki in Detroit, Eric Yep and Dilipp S.

&lt;p&gt;  BURLINGTON, MA, Jun 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Sysload Software, a leader in systems measurement, performance and
capacity management solutions for servers and data centers, today
announced the launch of additional versions of its SP Analyst agents
supporting WPARs on IBM AIX. Thanks to this new feature, Sysload SP
Analyst can now control the performance of each individual WPAR within
the host AIX system and assess the real impact that each individual
partition has on physical resources, including processor, memory, disk and
network utilization. Sysload SP Analyst already supports LPARs on AIX and
is now one of the only solutions on the market that supports WPARs.

    Under the AIX virtualization platform, physical machines can be
partitioned into LPARs, which function as virtual machines, each having
its own operating system. LPARs can further be partitioned into WPARs,
which share the same operating system. The advantage of WPARs is that
they do not require installation of multiple operating systems on the
same machine (physical or virtual) and therefore fewer system resources
are consumed. However, as with other virtualization platforms, WPARs
present a more complex and dynamic environment with an increased risk of
resource saturation. IT managers require accurate information that
pinpoints the resource utilization of individual applications and
processes running on virtualized partitions.

    "We are pleased to expand the range of virtualization solutions covered by
our SP Analyst agents," said Jerome de Monteil, Chief Executive Officer of
Sysload Software. "At Sysload, we understood the technological challenges
brought about by virtualization early on and focused our R investments
on the perfection of our performance metrics and their adaptation to the
new constraints that it imposes."

    About Sysload Software:

    Sysload Software, a privately held corporation founded in 1999, is a world
leader in systems measurement, performance and capacity management
solutions for servers and data centers. It provides a solution to manage
both physical and virtual environments on all types of servers found
within today's corporate environment (Windows, HP-UX, Solaris, AIX,
Linux, Citrix, I-series, Netware, etc.). Sysload's unique technology
allows companies to maximize use of current server infrastructure,
optimize new server investment and reduce IT management costs. The
company has joint headquarters in Creteil, France and Burlington,
Massachusetts, USA as well as offices in the UK. For more information on

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Disney-Pixar blasts off into uncharted territory with Friday's release of animated film "Wall-E," a space adventure mixing an unusual love story with somber messages about the future of Earth and humankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film features dystopian landscapes, social commentary and a lack of conventional dialogue that are rare under the Walt Disney Co banner, but it sticks to Pixar's basic themes of love, loyalty and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the sober tone and odd love-story between robots has prompted concerns that the "Wall-E" box office may not compensate for Disney's other big summer release, "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian," whose $259 million box office take has lagged forecasts so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors have been wary of 'Wall-E's' box office potential given Pixar's risky bet on an offbeat main character, who rarely speaks during the film," Pali Capital analyst Rich Greenfield said in a note to clients this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A solid performance by "Wall-E" could boost Disney's results in upcoming quarters, in which the company faces tough comparisons with 2007 hits "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" ($961 million worldwide) and "Ratatouille" ($621 million) in theaters and DVD frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Greenfield noted Wall Street concern, he added that "Wall-E" had been well-received in early screenings, and he pegged the film's ultimate global box office take at $500 million to $600 million. He also predicted it also would be a "solid contributor" to DVD and consumer products sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie will debut in more than 3,900 U.S. theaters on Friday and roll out around the world through December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD I KNEW'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The character Wall-E, or Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class, is the last of a cadre of robots tasked with cleaning up piles of trash discarded by humans who abandoned the planet centuries before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human race set off on a luxury space cruise during a planned five-year clean-up that lasts much longer and results in unfortunate changes in the human physique and psyche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Wall-E faithfully reports to work each day on Earth with his pet cockroach and a lunch box in which he stores the knick knacks he finds among mountains of trash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of a sleek girl robot named Eve, sent to Earth by the orbiting humans to look for plant life, sends Wall-E on an adventure that changes his own and humanity's destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Andrew Stanton, who won an Academy Award for Pixar's most lucrative film, "Finding Nemo," said he wanted to show a future in which people had lost track of what matters in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought, 'Well that's the question that Wall-E is trying to figure out: What is the point of living?'" Stanton said. "It's to love one another. It's to further a relationship."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In choreographing the non-verbal courtship of Wall-E and Eve, Stanton and his animators looked to "the hard process of a boy going over to ask a girl to dance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all just metaphor for what it's like for a boy to court a girl," Stanton said. "It's all in there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film's references to current hot-button issues -- the environment, obesity and corporate greed -- were a coincidence, Stanton said, because he conceived the premise in 1994 with the idea of reviving the science-fiction films he loved as a boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just was using elements of the world I knew," he said. "I wasn't trying to put anybody to task. I knew that, 'Wow this is starting to make some really uncomfortable parallels' but ... as long as I don't have an agenda I'm not going to worry about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bob Tourtellotte and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs trimmed its ad sales view
for yellow pages directories publisher R.H. Donnelley Corp
RHD.N by 50 to 75 basis points for the rest of 2008, citing
weak May ad results for the newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weak ad sales would mean slightly lower earnings for the
company, said analyst Peter Salkowski, who also cut his price
target on the stock to $7 from $8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of company fell as much as 10 percent to a 52-week
low of $3.11 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May, the company had said it was on track to achieve its
2008 net revenue view of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion with a
mid single digit fall in advertising sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R.H. Donnelley has been plagued by investor concerns about
the sustainability of its printed directory business amid a
surge of online research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Salkowski said that George Bednarz's appointment
to lead sales and operations would help the company boost its
digital offerings given his experience in R.H. Donnelley's
online local search solutions unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst kept his "neutral" rating on the Cary, North
Carolina-based company.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Jun 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Honourable Diane Finley, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,
announced today that the Department is enhancing the services offered by
its visa office in Beirut, Lebanon. Effective immediately, permanent
resident applicants from Lebanon can choose to be interviewed by
immigration officers in Beirut.

    "Citizens of Lebanon deserve to have their visa interviews conducted in
their own country," said Minister Finley. "We are upgrading our services
at the visa office in Beirut in order to make it easier for people to
complete their application process."

    Until now, permanent resident applicants were required to travel to
Damascus, Syria, for an interview since immigrant applications from
Lebanon are processed by the visa office in Damascus. The only exception
applied to family class applicants who had the choice of being
interviewed in either Beirut or Damascus. In such cases, immigration
officers would travel from Damascus to Beirut to conduct the interviews.

    This new change means that applicants requiring interviews will now have
a choice between Beirut, Lebanon and Damascus, Syria.

    The Government of Canada is continuously looking at ways to improve
services to applicants.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Jun 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Honourable Diane Finley, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,
announced today that the Department is enhancing the services offered by
its visa office in Beirut, Lebanon. Effective immediately, permanent
resident applicants from Lebanon can choose to be interviewed by
immigration officers in Beirut.

    "Citizens of Lebanon deserve to have their visa interviews conducted in
their own country," said Minister Finley. "We are upgrading our services
at the visa office in Beirut in order to make it easier for people to
complete their application process."

    Until now, permanent resident applicants were required to travel to
Damascus, Syria, for an interview since immigrant applications from
Lebanon are processed by the visa office in Damascus. The only exception
applied to family class applicants who had the choice of being
interviewed in either Beirut or Damascus. In such cases, immigration
officers would travel from Damascus to Beirut to conduct the interviews.

    This new change means that applicants requiring interviews will now have
a choice between Beirut, Lebanon and Damascus, Syria.

    The Government of Canada is continuously looking at ways to improve
services to applicants.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group added Monsanto Co
(MON.N) to its Americas conviction buy list, saying the recent
weakness in the agricultural products company's stock price was
a buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monsanto on Wednesday reported a higher-than-expected
third-quarter profit and raised its full-year forecast, but
Wall Street expressed disappointment that the company's results
and outlook were not stronger, sending shares down more than 6
percent in Wednesday's trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the outlook is stronger than ever for Monsanto
and suggest investors use today's weakness to build or add to
positions," analyst Robert Koort wrote in a note to clients. He
has a price target of $155 on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Koort, who raised his 2008 profit estimate on the St.
Louis-based company by 5 cents to $3.50 a share, said he
expects a 30 percent rise in Monsanto's 2009 earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Monsanto were down 32 cents at $131.84 in early
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Sensing the start of a personal computer revolution, Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard University in 1975 to start Microsoft Corp and pursue a vision of a computer on every desk and in every home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three decades later, Gates is set to step down on Friday from what is now the world's largest software company to work full-time at the charitable organization -- the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation -- built by his vast fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No longer the world's richest man -- he has been topped by investor Warren Buffett and Mexico's telecoms tycoon Carlos Slim -- Gates says great wealth brings with it great responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 52-year-old, whose boyish looks seem at odds with his graying hair, will leave behind a life's work developing software to devote energy to finding new vaccines or to micro-finance projects in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft's biggest shareholder, Gates will remain chairman and work on special technology projects. His 8.7 percent stake in Microsoft is worth about $23 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates first programmed a computer at 13, creating a class scheduling system for his Seattle high school. As he gained more experience, he realized the potential that software held to change how humans worked, played and communicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I was 19, I caught sight of the future and based my career on what I saw. I turned out to have been right," Gates wrote in his 1995 book "The Road Ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates realized at an early stage of the PC revolution that software would be more important than hardware. Working with boyhood friend Paul Allen, Gates founded Microsoft, naming the company for its mission of providing microcomputer software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIVILEGED UPBRINGING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates was born October 28, 1955, the second of three children in a prominent Seattle family. His father, William Henry Gates Jr., was a partner at one of the city's most powerful law firms, while his late mother, Mary, was an active charity fund-raiser and University of Washington regent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was introduced to computers at the exclusive Lakeside Preparatory School, where the teen prodigy began programming in BASIC computer language on a primitive ASR-33 Teletype unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at Lakeside that Gates met Allen, a student two years his senior who shared his fascination with computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, in those days we were just goofing around, or so we thought," Gates recalled in "The Road Ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his two years at Harvard, Gates devoted much of his time to programming marathons and all-night poker sessions before dropping out to work on software for the Altair, a clunky desktop computer that cost $400 in kit form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at Harvard, Gates became friends with an ebullient Detroit native who shared his love of math and cynical humor. Gates eventually talked that classmate, current CEO Steve Ballmer, into leaving business school to join Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates dropped out of Harvard and relocated with Allen to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where they established Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their big break came in 1980 when Gates and his carelessly dressed young colleagues signed an agreement to build the operating system that became known as MS-DOS for International Business Machines Corp's new personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a critical blunder by IBM, Microsoft was allowed to license the operating system to others, spawning an industry of "IBM-compatible" machines dependent on Microsoft software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His legacy has to be as one of the shrewdest businessmen and technologist of the 20th century," said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft went public in 1986 in one of the most celebrated offerings of its time. By the next year, the soaring stock made Gates, at age 31, the youngest self-made billionaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overseeing Microsoft's steady growth, he became known as a bare-knuckles businessman and manager, sometimes dismissing a suggestion as "the stupidest thing I have ever heard."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft grew to dominate its industry and became the target of a landmark antitrust case, which it fought every step of the way before eventually settling with U.S. prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Helm, director of research at independent research firm Directions of Microsoft, said Gates will go down as one of the great businessmen in history like John D. Rockefeller -- for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's never going to be necessarily a widely admired figure, but someone who created an activity that came to represent a chunk of the American economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Braden Reddall and Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates will retire from the company on Friday and move to a full-time role at his charitable organization, the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft's biggest shareholder, Gates will maintain a role at the software company as its nonexecutive chairman. He will also take part in special technology projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Gates' departure leave a leadership vacuum at the company? Here's a list of the remaining leaders at Microsoft after Gates leaves:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Steve Ballmer, Chief Executive Officer, 52&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer joined the company in 1980 when Gates, a Harvard University classmate, talked him into dropping out of Stanford University business school to join Microsoft as its first business manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since replacing Gates as CEO in 2000, Ballmer has been the main decision maker at the company, which has seen revenue more than double during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known for his histrionics and sharp intellect, Ballmer has said in interviews that he would stay at Microsoft for another "9 or 10 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ray Ozzie, Chief Software Architect, 52&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie replaced Gates as the company's top software guru in 2006. He joined the company as chief technical officer in 2005 when Microsoft bought his software company called Groove Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The white-haired, soft-spoken Ozzie competed with Microsoft for years, creating products like International Business Machines' Lotus Notes e-mail and calendaring software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie is responsible for mapping out the company's "software plus services" strategy, which call on Microsoft's software to incorporate an online services element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Kevin Johnson, President, Platforms  Services Division, 47&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson has the dual task of protecting Microsoft's most important business, Windows, and building out its future cash generator, online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since joining Microsoft in 1992, Johnson has taken on various roles in sales and marketing including being the head of worldwide sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was one of the main drivers behind Microsoft's bid to acquire Yahoo Inc. After Yahoo's board rejected Microsoft's offer to buy the company, Johnson and his team countered with an alternative offer to buy Yahoo's search business and assume a minor stake in the company. That was also rejected by Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Christopher Liddell, Chief Financial Officer, 50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddell joined Microsoft from International Paper as CFO in 2005 with no background in technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Zealander has played a big role in transforming Microsoft from a company that hoards cash for a rainy day into a more aggressive spender for acquisitions and stock buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has simplified Microsoft's earnings reports and he has been praised by Wall Street analysts as helping improve communication between the company and its investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Brian McAndrews, Senior Vice President, Advertiser  Publisher Solutions Group, 49&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McAndrews joined Microsoft in 2007 as part of the company's acquisition of digital advertising company aQuantive Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his extensive experience in the advertising industry, McAndrews is expected to spearhead Microsoft's efforts to create an online advertising platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to being CEO of aQuantive, McAndrews had a background in broadcast and communications. He held executive positions at ABC Sports, ABC Entertainment and ABC Television Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Craig Mundie, Chief Research and Strategy Officer, 59&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mundie took over as Microsoft's top technical visionary in 2006 in anticipation of Gates' exit from Microsoft this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mundie's Microsoft career began in 1992 at the consumer platforms division where he was responsible for developing software for non-PC platforms such as game-consoles and handheld devices. Microsoft eventually introduced mobile phone software and a game console to compete with Sony's PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He manages the company's $7 billion research and development budget, believed to be the largest RD budget of any technology firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle and Syantani Chatterjee in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

 June 26 (Reuters) - Wachovia Capital Markets downgraded

to slow down as "big ticket" capital raises drop and small

Morgan Stanley (MS.N), saying that it has an opportunity to
take share in a host of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which rates Raymond James Financial Inc

&lt;p&gt;Infor Offers Customers More Choices, Enhanced Value Through New
                Relationship with IBM Global Financing
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Infor today announced a new financing relationship with IBM Global
Financing, the lending and leasing business segment of IBM (NYSE:IBM),
and the largest IT financier in the world. The new agreement will
enable Infor's customers around the world to finance products from
Infor's entire line of enterprise business software, as well as
complementary hardware and services, through IBM Global Financing.
Under the terms of the agreement, Infor's channel partners can also
offer financing to their customers through IBM Global Financing.

   "Most organizations today walk a narrow line between preserving
day-to-day cash flow and making fiscally prudent investments to
improve their business," said Robin Pederson, chief operating officer,
Infor. "The expansion of our relationship with IBM will help to make
this decision easier."

   The new financing relationship provides many benefits to Infor's
customers. For example, organizations can move forward with their
technology initiatives while spreading up-front payments over time,
conserving cash for other investments. Companies can also put
technology to work immediately to establish a stronger competitive
edge, rather than delaying until the next budget cycle. Additionally,
customers who deploy Infor solutions on IBM technology, such as Infor
ERP XA running on IBM System i, will realize further economic benefits
through special promotions offered by IBM.

   "IBM Global Financing is pleased to align with Infor and its
channel partners for the benefit of their rapidly expanding customer
base," said Dan Ransdell, general manager, WW Client Financing, IBM
Global Financing. "Limited access to capital in a tightening credit
market is one of the largest inhibitors to enterprise investment
today. Simple and flexible financing solutions put technology back
within their reach with low up-front costs and regular, manageable
payments."

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, updates stock movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 26 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (C.N) may suffer $8.9
billion of second-quarter write-downs, forcing it perhaps to
cut its dividend again, Goldman Sachs  Co analyst William
Tanona wrote on Thursday, sending shares of the largest U.S.
bank down 4.5 percent to $18.00 in trading before the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst also added Citigroup to Goldman's "Americas
conviction sell" list and cut his price target on the stock to
$16 from $20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman recommended a pair trade with a short position on
Citigroup and a long on Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the bank's 32 cents-per-share quarterly dividend is
"not safe," and that the bank may have to issue common stock or
sell assets to raise capital because regulators may forbid it
from issuing more preferred or convertible securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see multiple headwinds for Citigroup including
additional write-downs, higher consumer provisions as a result
of rapidly deteriorating consumer credit trends, and the
potential for additional capital raises, dividend cuts, or
asset sales," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment on the Goldman
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tanona also downgraded the U.S. brokerage sector to
"neutral" from "attractive," saying deteriorating fundamentals
will likely prolong any recovery from the year-long credit
market tightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European financials fell in early trade on Thursday
following the report. The FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of
top European shares was down almost 2 percent at 1,205.35
points by 1230 GMT, while the DJ Stoxx European Bank Index
.SX7P was down nearly 4 percent at 292.33 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Citigroup's shares fall below $18.00 in regular trading,
they would touch their lowest level since October 1998, the
month Citicorp and Travelers Group merged to form Citigroup,
Reuters data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAPITAL, DIVIDEND CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though Citigroup in January cut its quarterly dividend 41
percent, Tanona said another cut may be warranted by the bank's
lack of current earnings power. He said halving the current
dividend could preserve $3.5 billion of capital annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the firm's current level of earnings power, we do
not believe the dividend is safe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On June 17, Goldman analysts led by Richard Ramsden said
U.S. banks may need to raise $65 billion of additional capital
to cope with mounting losses from a global credit crisis that
will not peak until 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of May, Citigroup had raised $42 billion, including
capital injections from sovereign wealth fund Government of
Singapore Investment Corp, data compiled by Reuters News show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank has also suffered more than $46 billion of
write-downs and credit losses in the last three quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHALLENGING QUARTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tanona now expects Citigroup to post a second-quarter loss
of 75 cents a share compared with his earlier forecast of a
profit of 25 cents. He changed his 2008 forecast for the bank
to a loss of $1.20 a share from his prior view of a profit of
30 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said of the $8.9 billion writedown, $7.1 billion was
related to CDOs and associated hedges with the monolines, $1.2
billion for other asset classes and $600 million for a
mark-to-market loss of its own structured note liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup could be more exposed than Merrill Lynch and
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) to hedges on its leveraged loan and
commercial mortgage-backed securities portfolios, Tanona said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will be a challenging quarter once again in fixed
income, currency and commodities, impacted by a number of
write-downs and trading losses, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect write-downs for Citigroup and Merrill to outpace
what we saw from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Lehman Brothers
Holdings LEH.N recently, due to Citigroup's and Merrill's
large exposures to ABS CDOs (asset-backed security
collateralized debt obligation) and associated hedges with the
monolines (insurers)," Tanona said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski
projected a second-quarter loss and $8 billion of new
write-downs for Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Gary
Crittenden said on a Deutsche Bank conference call that the
bank could take substantial write-downs this quarter.

&lt;p&gt;  FREMONT, CA, Jun 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: NWK), a global provider of
multi-service network and voice exchange solutions for government and
enterprise customers, announced today that Brepols Publishers, an
international academic publishing house in Belgium, successfully
facilitated its Microsoft Office Communications Server (OCS)-based
implementation of unified communications (UC) and unified messaging using
NET's VX Series intelligent VoIP switches and gateways.

    The NET VX Series' exceptional compatibility and interoperability enabled
Brepols to effectively implement Microsoft's solution in its existing
network-and-telecom environment so that it could rapidly gain the business
benefits of convergence without losing the use of its existing fax
machines, compromising access to local emergency services, or otherwise
disrupting its ongoing business.

    Brepols has two main offices plus a warehouse in Belgium, as well as an
office in New York. Nearly half of the company's employees are teleworkers
utilizing a laptop and VPN connection. By moving to VoIP and unified
communications, Brepols sought to significantly improve staff productivity
and accelerate a wide range of important day-to-day business processes. It
selected OCS as its core convergence platform.

    The company faced several challenges, however, in implementing Microsoft
OCS in conjunction with VoIP on its existing infrastructure. These
challenges included:


--  Avoiding costly PBX replacement and/or re-configuration
--  Ensuring reliability of communication between all internal and
    external end-points
--  Supporting existing fax machines, door phones, and other legacy analog
    devices
--  Implementing Auto-Attendant functionality for three different
    languages (French, Dutch, and English) for a single inbound number
--  Allowing the company to migrate to Microsoft UC over time in a manner
    that makes the most sense for the business
    

    
To address these challenges, Brepols selected the NET VX1200 gateway.
The VX Series intelligent VoIP switches and gateways provide flexible
'any-to-any' connectivity, robust call routing functions, Active Directory
integration, and the granular control of messaging parameters necessary to
accommodate complex Microsoft OCS configurations. The VX Series also
provides essential features such as SIP registration for WiFi clients,
embedded QoS mechanisms, and simplified connectivity to both PSTN and
external IP telephony service providers -- which gives the company optimum
flexibility for reducing its international toll charges.

    Because of this rich, complete feature set, Brepols was able to fulfill
all of its communications objectives without project delays, cost
over-runs, or unexpected problems.

    "NET's VX Series enabled Brepols to quickly and effectively implement
highly sophisticated converged communications in a relatively small -- but
still rather complex -- existing infrastructure," said Wim Borgers, IT and
Administration Manager for Brepols. "We are extremely satisfied with both
the functionality of NET's hardware and the obvious expertise that NET
demonstrated in accommodating our very exacting technical requirements."

    "There are a lot of potentially lucrative things that companies can do
with communications to improve their bottom lines, but there can also be
significant obstacles to achieving those short- and long-term project
goals," said Chuck Rutledge, VP of Corporate Marketing for NET. "Brepols
has used the advanced VoIP gateway features found in the VX1200 to address
the complexities of integrating Microsoft OCS into their network. Their
roadmap has a number of challenges, including SIP WiFi clients registered
to the VX, SIP trunks to other countries, such as France, the US and
Italy, and Polycom SIP phones. All of these can be addressed with the VX
Series."

&lt;p&gt; (For pix click here#a=1)  (For video click here) By Hugh Bronstein BUENAVENTURA, Colombia, June 26 (Reuters) - Colombians who thought they had seen everything in the war on drugs were treated to something new this year: cocaine smuggling in a submarine. In images shown on national television, several men emerged from the makeshift fiberglass craft, opened hatches designed to let in water and sent the submarine and its cargo of cocaine to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Even though the they had traces of the drug  on their clothing, the smugglers were rescued from their lifeboat and, in the absence of further evidence, released without charge. We kept the cargo from being distributed in the international market, which is our main goal, said Navy Capt. Gustavo Angel, who estimated the contents at about 10 tonnes (tons). So it was a partial success. As the authorities step up efforts to stop airplanes and speedboats long used to export drugs from the world's biggest cocaine producing country, traffickers are turning to vessels that travel under water to carry on their trade. From his base near the Pacific port city of Buenaventura Angel is helping lead the crackdown on the blimp-shaped vessels. With only breathing tubes and mini navigation equipment above the surface, they leave almost no wake, making them hard to spot from the air. They can sometimes be spied by coast guard patrols and their sound can be picked up by Navy submarines equipped with sonar. Angel estimates that more than 30 tonnes of cocaine have been intentionally sent to the bottom of the ocean by fleeing crew members over the last two and a half years, which makes authorities wonder how much is getting through to the U.S. market. The diesel-fueled craft are used mostly on the Pacific coast to take drugs to Central America and Mexico for eventual sale in the United States. The Navy estimates the boats travel up to two weeks to get to their destinations. They can transport up to 10 tonnes of cocaine on each voyage, after which they are scuttled to avoid questions. Each costs about $600,000 to make, carries four to five crew members and is outfitted with one or two propellers, allowing it to travel at 10 to 12 knots, the Navy says. Most are more than 50 feet long and built by drug smuggling groups sometimes in collusion with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which funds its four-decade-old Marxist insurgency with the drug trade. Colombia exports 600 tonnes of cocaine per year, according to United Nations monitors, about a third of it from the Pacific coast. ANYTHING COULD BE ABOARD Vice Admiral Edgar Cely worries that the FARC could use the craft to transport arms and explosives in an attack on a port. Anything could be aboard those things, Cely told Reuters in his office at the Defense Ministry in Bogota. The craft are constructed inland on ramps to keep them off the wet ground of the mangroves that line the Pacific coast. Overhead vegetation hides the construction sites from the air. Painted blue to blend in with the water, they are loaded with their illegal cargo and taken by river at high tide to the ocean. It is much more difficult to build and hide them on the heavily populated Caribbean coast, which is benefiting from a tourism boom under U.S.-backed security policies that have made many parts of Colombia safer. Eight were found on the Pacific coast last year and one on the Caribbean, the Navy says, their hulls fitted with lead panels or water tanks to submerge them. Authorities say they are bracing for the day when smugglers figure out how to make full-fledged submarines capable of diving deep and navigating even more quietly than the current generation, which known locally as semi-submersibles. Meanwhile, Cely said he is increasing land patrols along the coast to find the vessels where they are most likely to be detected, on their construction ramps. They are evolving quickly in terms of technology. They are getting bigger, faster and are outfitted with GPS navigation systems and satellite telephones, Cely said. We really have to stay on top of this.  (Reporting by Hugh Bronstein; Editing by Eddie Evans)

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Billboard) - Culture Club frontman Boy 
George's North American summer tour is in doubt after U.S. 
authorities refused to issue him a visa, citing looming legal 
issues overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; George's 24-date trek is scheduled to begin July 11 at the 
House of Blues in Las Vegas, and wrap August 23 at the House of 
Blues in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At the moment, Boy George cannot come to the United States 
of America because he has been refused permission to enter by 
the USA Administration," read a statement from the artist's 
management. "This is not in respect of anything he has done in 
the past but because he is facing a trial in November in London 
for something that happened in April last year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; George was arrested last year after a 28-year-old male 
escort from Norway accused the singer/DJ of false imprisonment 
and assault. George later denied the allegations and was 
released on bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "George's lawyers in London have absolutely forbidden us to 
speak about the facts of that case and all I can say is that 
George is astounded at the decision and is having lawyers here 
in the States look at it in the hope that someone will change 
their mind," the statement continued. "George really would love 
to come to America and repay his American fans loyalty and that 
is why we are asking the US Authorities to reconsider their 
decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2001, George supported the release of his "Essential 
Mix" collection with a brief DJ-tour of the U.S. George has 
also toured and performed DJ sets in Australia, Asia, Europe 
and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Billboard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, June 26 (Reuters) - Nigerian senior oil workers union
and Chevron (CVX.N) are expected to resume talks on Thursday in
a last-ditch effort to avert an all-out strike that could
sharply cut output from the world's eighth largest exporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Union workers have staged a partial strike this week,
stopping administrative staff from getting to their offices in
Lagos, to pressure management ahead of the two-day talks in
Nigeria's capital Abuja. Output has not been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I consider this a last attempt to avert a strike. If the
talks fail, it shows that some are not sensitive to the plight
and grievances of the workers," said Bayo Olowoshile, secretary
general of the PENGASSAN union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Olowoshile was optimistic the two sides would come to an
agreement as a workers' strike would devastate Chevron's
operations in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's output of around 350,000 barrels per day was
reduced by a third last week when armed youths in the Niger
Delta blew up one of its supply pipelines, a military source
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has declined to say how much production was
affected. It declared a force majeure on its Escravos crude
exports on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fears of further supply disruptions in the West African
country have contributed to a rise in global crude prices to
near record highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron branch of PENGASSAN has been demanding the
transfer of the expatriate managing director from Nigeria,
accusing him of violating safety standards, having too many
foreign staff and a lack of respect for Nigerian workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are too many expats," Olowoshile said. "They have
been here too long without building the capacity of the
nationals to work in certain areas, especially mid-level and
lower level management."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An eleventh hour intervention by the Nigerian government
averted a workers' strike last week and brought both sides back
to the negotiating table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron and the workers' union were expected to meet with
Oil Minister Odein Ajumogobia on Thursday and with Abubakar
Yar'Adua, group managing director of state oil firm the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp (NNPC), on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Washington (Reuters) - Bill Gates said a teary goodbye on Friday to Microsoft Corp, the software maker he built into the world's most valuable technology company based on the ambitious goal of placing a computer on every desk and in every home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He leaves his full-time executive role at Microsoft, which he co-founded with childhood friend Paul Allen in 1975, to focus on his philanthropic organization, the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's largest charity, funded in part by his vast fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an event at Microsoft's headquarters campus here, Gates, who will become a non-executive chairman and work part-time, joined Chief Executive Steve Ballmer on stage to deliver a short speech and field questions from employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There won't be a day in my life that I'm not thinking about Microsoft and the great things that it's doing and wanting to help," said Gates, who wiped away tears as the group of employees rose to give him a standing ovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, a Harvard University classmate who joined Microsoft at Gates' behest, got choked up as he tried to describe Gates' impact on the company and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no way to say thanks to Bill. Bill's the founder. Bill's the leader," said Ballmer. "We've been given an enormous, enormous opportunity and it was Bill that gave us this opportunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates will leave behind a life's work developing software to devote energy to finding new vaccines or to microfinance projects in the developing world. He will still work on special technology projects at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the world's richest man, Gates' personal fortune has been estimated at about $58 billion, according to Forbes Magazine.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Sensing the start of a personal computer revolution, Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard University in 1975 to start Microsoft Corp and pursue a vision of a computer on every desk and in every home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three decades later, Gates is set to step down on Friday from what is now the world's largest software company to work full-time at the charitable organization -- the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation -- built by his vast fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No longer the world's richest man -- he has been topped by investor Warren Buffett and Mexico's telecoms tycoon Carlos Slim -- Gates says great wealth brings with it great responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 52-year-old, whose boyish looks seem at odds with his graying hair, will leave behind a life's work developing software to devote energy to finding new vaccines or to micro-finance projects in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft's biggest shareholder, Gates will remain chairman and work on special technology projects. His 8.7 percent stake in Microsoft is worth about $23 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates first programmed a computer at 13, creating a class scheduling system for his Seattle high school. As he gained more experience, he realized the potential that software held to change how humans worked, played and communicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I was 19, I caught sight of the future and based my career on what I saw. I turned out to have been right," Gates wrote in his 1995 book "The Road Ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates realized at an early stage of the PC revolution that software would be more important than hardware. Working with boyhood friend Paul Allen, Gates founded Microsoft, naming the company for its mission of providing microcomputer software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRIVILEGED UPBRINGING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates was born October 28, 1955, the second of three children in a prominent Seattle family. His father, William Henry Gates Jr., was a partner at one of the city's most powerful law firms, while his late mother, Mary, was an active charity fund-raiser and University of Washington regent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was introduced to computers at the exclusive Lakeside Preparatory School, where the teen prodigy began programming in BASIC computer language on a primitive ASR-33 Teletype unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at Lakeside that Gates met Allen, a student two years his senior who shared his fascination with computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course, in those days we were just goofing around, or so we thought," Gates recalled in "The Road Ahead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his two years at Harvard, Gates devoted much of his time to programming marathons and all-night poker sessions before dropping out to work on software for the Altair, a clunky desktop computer that cost $400 in kit form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at Harvard, Gates became friends with an ebullient Detroit native who shared his love of math and cynical humor. Gates eventually talked that classmate, current CEO Steve Ballmer, into leaving business school to join Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates dropped out of Harvard and relocated with Allen to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where they established Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their big break came in 1980 when Gates and his carelessly dressed young colleagues signed an agreement to build the operating system that became known as MS-DOS for International Business Machines Corp's new personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a critical blunder by IBM, Microsoft was allowed to license the operating system to others, spawning an industry of "IBM-compatible" machines dependent on Microsoft software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His legacy has to be as one of the shrewdest businessmen and technologist of the 20th century," said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft went public in 1986 in one of the most celebrated offerings of its time. By the next year, the soaring stock made Gates, at age 31, the youngest self-made billionaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overseeing Microsoft's steady growth, he became known as a bare-knuckles businessman and manager, sometimes dismissing a suggestion as "the stupidest thing I have ever heard."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft grew to dominate its industry and became the target of a landmark antitrust case, which it fought every step of the way before eventually settling with U.S. prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Helm, director of research at independent research firm Directions of Microsoft, said Gates will go down as one of the great businessmen in history like John D. Rockefeller -- for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's never going to be necessarily a widely admired figure, but someone who created an activity that came to represent a chunk of the American economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Braden Reddall and Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Wash., June 27 (Reuters) - Bill Gates said a teary
goodbye on Friday to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), the software
maker he built into the world's most valuable technology
company based on the ambitious goal of placing a computer on
every desk and in every home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He leaves his full-time executive role at Microsoft, which

focus on his philanthropic organization, the Bill  Melinda
Gates Foundation, the world's largest charity, funded in part
by his vast fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At an event at Microsoft's headquarters campus here, Gates,
who will become a non-executive chairman and work part-time,
joined Chief Executive Steve Ballmer on stage to deliver a
short speech and field questions from employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There won't be a day in my life that I'm not thinking
about Microsoft and the great things that it's doing and

of employees rose to give him a standing ovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer, a Harvard University classmate who joined
Microsoft at Gates' behest, got choked up as he tried to

evolve from a fledgling start-up to a company of more than
90,000 employees making everything from video game consoles to
computer software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pair remembered the battles with computer industry
titan International Business Machines Corp's (IBM.N), an early
partner turned rival when it rolled out a competing operating
system to Microsoft's flagship software, Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We went toe to toe with the biggest, most powerful
computer company in the world and we beat them," said Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 52-year-old Gates said the company had made "a mistake"
not recognizing earlier how Web search and online advertising

five today, so they could get started on that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go to Reuters MediaFile blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/

&lt;p&gt; (New throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Randy Fabi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, June 27 (Reuters) - Nigeria's senior oil workers'
union said on Friday it was suspending all strike action at the
local unit of U.S. energy giant Chevron (CVX.N) after reaching
agreement in a labour dispute with the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All industrial action has been suspended," Mustapha Nuhu
Wali, deputy national president of the PENGASSAN union, told
Reuters at the end of two-day talks with the government and
Chevron management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Union workers had staged a partial strike at Chevron this
week, stopping administrative staff from getting to their
offices in the main commercial city Lagos, but output has not
been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some union members warned of an all-out strike if talks had
failed this week, potentially cutting output sharply in the
world's eighth largest exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's output from Nigeria is around 350,000 barrels per
day, of which its equity share is around 129,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nigerian government brokered the deal, after talks
between the two sides collapsed last week and the oil ministry
was forced to intervene at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The OPEC producer wants to avoid a further hit on its
output. Militant attacks have shut a fifth of the country's
output since early 2006, helping push world oil prices to record
highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EXPAT CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron branch of PENGASSAN has been demanding the
transfer of the expatriate managing director from Nigeria,
accusing him of violating safety standards, having too many
foreign staff and a lack of respect for Nigerian workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have agreed with the Chevron management that with
government intervention we will form a committee to look at all
of the problems with the intention of closing the issue in a
month," Nuhu Wali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State-oil firm Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. agreed to
communicate the union's concerns to Chevron's main headquarters
in San Ramon, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The union said Chevron agreed to review its expatriate
positions in Nigeria to see whether more positions could be made
available to locals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has more than 2,000 workers in Nigeria, of which
90 percent are Nigerian, according to its website.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates will retire from the company on Friday and move to a full-time role at his charitable organization, the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Microsoft's biggest shareholder, Gates will maintain a role at the software company as its nonexecutive chairman. He will also take part in special technology projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Gates' departure leave a leadership vacuum at the company? Here's a list of the remaining leaders at Microsoft after Gates leaves:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Steve Ballmer, Chief Executive Officer, 52&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer joined the company in 1980 when Gates, a Harvard University classmate, talked him into dropping out of Stanford University business school to join Microsoft as its first business manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since replacing Gates as CEO in 2000, Ballmer has been the main decision maker at the company, which has seen revenue more than double during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known for his histrionics and sharp intellect, Ballmer has said in interviews that he would stay at Microsoft for another "9 or 10 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ray Ozzie, Chief Software Architect, 52&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie replaced Gates as the company's top software guru in 2006. He joined the company as chief technical officer in 2005 when Microsoft bought his software company called Groove Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The white-haired, soft-spoken Ozzie competed with Microsoft for years, creating products like International Business Machines' Lotus Notes e-mail and calendaring software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie is responsible for mapping out the company's "software plus services" strategy, which call on Microsoft's software to incorporate an online services element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Kevin Johnson, President, Platforms  Services Division, 47&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson has the dual task of protecting Microsoft's most important business, Windows, and building out its future cash generator, online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since joining Microsoft in 1992, Johnson has taken on various roles in sales and marketing including being the head of worldwide sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was one of the main drivers behind Microsoft's bid to acquire Yahoo Inc. After Yahoo's board rejected Microsoft's offer to buy the company, Johnson and his team countered with an alternative offer to buy Yahoo's search business and assume a minor stake in the company. That was also rejected by Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Christopher Liddell, Chief Financial Officer, 50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddell joined Microsoft from International Paper as CFO in 2005 with no background in technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Zealander has played a big role in transforming Microsoft from a company that hoards cash for a rainy day into a more aggressive spender for acquisitions and stock buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has simplified Microsoft's earnings reports and he has been praised by Wall Street analysts as helping improve communication between the company and its investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Brian McAndrews, Senior Vice President, Advertiser  Publisher Solutions Group, 49&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McAndrews joined Microsoft in 2007 as part of the company's acquisition of digital advertising company aQuantive Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his extensive experience in the advertising industry, McAndrews is expected to spearhead Microsoft's efforts to create an online advertising platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to being CEO of aQuantive, McAndrews had a background in broadcast and communications. He held executive positions at ABC Sports, ABC Entertainment and ABC Television Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Craig Mundie, Chief Research and Strategy Officer, 59&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mundie took over as Microsoft's top technical visionary in 2006 in anticipation of Gates' exit from Microsoft this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mundie's Microsoft career began in 1992 at the consumer platforms division where he was responsible for developing software for non-PC platforms such as game-consoles and handheld devices. Microsoft eventually introduced mobile phone software and a game console to compete with Sony's PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He manages the company's $7 billion research and development budget, believed to be the largest RD budget of any technology firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle and Syantani Chatterjee in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) has named Bear Stearns' former Asia CEO as head of its sovereign wealth group coverage as Wall Street seeks greater access to the financial clout of state-run funds from the Middle East and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan completed the fire-sale acquisition this month of Bear Stearns BSC_pf.N, following its stock plunge and collapse earlier this year. Like the rest of Bear's employees, the future of former Asia head John Moore was uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore, whose new title is head of Global Sovereign Coverage, will be based in Hong Kong. His appointment was announced internally earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asia Chairman Gaby Abdelnour said in an interview on Friday that of Bear's roughly 500 employees in Asia, his firm hired a "good chunk" of them, many of whom are already working in JPMorgan's Hong Kong offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear's collapse prompted the cancelling of a proposed partnership between Bear and CITIC Securities (600030.SS), China's biggest listed brokerage. The proposed partnership included a $1 billion investment in Bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Citic is a client of JPMorgan and we always talk about ideas. Is that going to lead to anything concrete? I don't know," Abdelnour said, when asked if JPMorgan would pick-up where Bear left off. "But is there anything of the Bear deal we're going to salvage? No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdelnour was excited about JPMorgan picking up Bear's securitized products group in Asia, moving most of them from Tokyo to Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a business that almost shut down but we think now is a good time to start seriously thinking about it," he said, adding that project financing and other real asset securitization were areas that this could benefit JPMorgan in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SWF GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sovereign wealth funds are the state-run investment vehicles of Middle Eastern countries, of China and Singapore that through commodity prices or trade surpluses have amassed trillions of dollars and increasingly invested it in companies across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore will be responsible for maintaining the bank's relationship with sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) as well as its central banks coverage, two significant growth areas for JPMorgan, Abdelnour said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore will report to Abdelnour and Klaus Diederichs, head of EMEA investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last August, New York-based Bear appointed Moore as its Hong Kong-based Asia CEO as it tried to build its business overseas. Previously, he was co-head of fixed income for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore joined Bear Stearns in 2001 as global head of agency capital markets in New York. He moved to London to manage fixed income sales and trading in 2004 and in 2006 became co-head of fixed income in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's move to hire him as their sovereign wealth chief comes as other Wall Street firms such as Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley have expanded coverage of their relationships with sovereign wealth funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banks are seeking an opportunity following the downturn in financial activity in Europe and North America to boost their presence in emerging markets, where the economies are more buoyant and state-backed funds are looking to diversify their holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan report predicts that assets under management of the more than 50 sovereign funds totaled between $3 to $3.7 trillion at the end of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sovereign funds have provided more than $43 billion in capital to Wall Street banks starved of funds during the credit crisis that erupted last summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kevin Plumberg; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree/Ian Jones)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, Jun 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Storebaelt Ltd., the company managing the toll bridge connecting central
parts of Denmark, has signed a three year agreement with IBM (NYSE: IBM)
for IBM to manage Storebaelt's information technology (IT) infrastructure
and services.

    The Great Belt Fixed Link, opened in 1998, is the largest engineering
project in the history of Denmark.

    The Link consists of a 6,790 meter long suspension bridge linking Zealand
-- where the Danish capital Copenhagen is located -- and the small island
of Sprogoe, a 6,611 meter combined rail and road bridge between Sprogoe
and Funen, and a 8,000 m rail tunnel between Zealand and Sprogoe. At 254
meters above sea level, the East Bridge's two pylons are the highest
points in Denmark.

    The number of cars crossing the bridge has tripled since the opening of
the bridge 10 years ago. In May 2008, nearly one million vehicles crossed
the bridge -- and traffic growth is continuing.

    This growth has placed increased pressure on IT systems, compounded by the
need for additional IT solutions for employees, customers and partners to
access bridge information through web-based Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) solutions. This makes for increased complexity within the
IT environment with heightened demands on security, resiliency, and
flexibility and IBM is delivering a robust IT environment with high
availability.

    "IBM's goal is to provide Storebaelt with the best quality IT Services in
order to help the company manage its future growth," says Sven Kolstrup,
Country Executive Manager, Global Technology Services, IBM Denmark.

    IBM has provided services to Storebaelt Ltd. for the past 18 years,
working closely with the company to develop, maintain, and monitor
Storebaelt's dynamic IT infrastructure. A dedicated on-site IBM team
works closely with Storebaelt's own IT managers.

    The agreement was signed on June 2, 2008.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jun 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Microsoft is among the first clients
to implement IBM's iDataPlex system -- a new category of server developed
by IBM for Internet-scale computing. IBM also introduced today a new high
performance computing (HPC) option for iDataPlex, to bring supercomputing
power to Cloud environments.

    iDataPlex helps relieve massive, sprawled out data centers that are
pushing the limits of power and space available to them. Designed to
dramatically increase compute density while significantly decreasing
energy consumption and associated data center costs, iDataPlex uses 40
percent less power and increases by five times the amount of computing
done in the same space. iDataPlex also uses all industry-standard
components as well as open source software such as Linux to lower costs.

    Since launching the brand new category of server just over 30 days ago,
IBM has already begun to deliver the iDataPlex system to clients globally.
Among the first clients to adopt iDataPlex is Microsoft. The High
Performance Computing product unit within Microsoft's Windows Server Group
is leveraging IBM iDataPlex systems for internal benchmarking of their
cluster computing operating system, Windows HPC Server 2008.

    "Power efficiency and high density are among the top issues of concern for
customers who rely on large scale HPC resources to support their research
and innovation," said Kyril Faenov, general manager, Microsoft High
Performance Computing. "Microsoft is excited to work with IBM on ensuring
that Windows HPC Server 2008, with its advanced power management
capabilities, is a perfect complement to the iDataPlex system for a broad
range of HPC applications."

    IBM's New HPC Server Turns iDataPlex Into World-Class Supercomputer

    IBM has also expanded its new iDataPlex line of servers with high
performance options that will allow the system to pack 145 teraflops (145
trillion operations per second) of compute power in a 315-square-foot
area.*

    The new iDataPlex DX360 HPC server uses the latest 3GHz, quad-core Xeon
processors from Intel and new software from Silicon Valley start-up
ScaleMP to boost bandwidth and memory performance to levels demanded by
HPC applications.

    IBM also expanded interconnect options for iDataPlex with InfiniBand
switches from Voltaire and QLogic, InfiniBand adapters from Mellanox,
Fiber Channel adapters from Emulex, and 10G Ethernet switches from Blade
Network Technologies, SMC, Cisco and Force 10.

    iDataPlex is an important element in helping clients develop a new
enterprise data center, which offers dramatic improvements in IT
efficiency and provides for rapid deployment of new IT services to
support future business growth. IBM is helping clients move to new
enterprise data centers by focusing on best practices around
virtualization, green IT, service management and cloud computing.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut Canadian restaurant
chain Tim Hortons Inc (THI.TO) (THI.N) to "sell" from "neutral"
and added it to the Americas sell list as rising costs will
challenge margins and a stronger U.S. dollar versus the
Canadian dollar would put pressure on U.S. earnings per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage cut the price target of Tim Hortons, which
also has warehouse and distribution operations, to $30 from $34
on concerns that a premium multiple would be unlikely and hard
to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman raised Brinker International Inc (EAT.N), which
owns brands like Chili's Grill  Bar, Romano's Macaroni Grill
and Maggiano's Little Italy, to "neutral" from "sell", removing
it from Americas sell list on positive factors that include
better cash flow, stronger sales and the sale of Mac Grill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Proceeds from Brinker's sale of Mac Grill are to be used to
pay down debt or share repurchases. Brinker's price target was
raised to $22 from $19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brinker's shares closed at $18.50 Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange, while Tim Hortons closed at $30 on the Toronto
Exchange and at $29.65 on the NYSE.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 27 (Reuters) - J.P.Morgan Securities initiated
coverage of Bristow Group Inc (BRS.N), which provides
helicopter services to the offshore energy industry, with an
"overweight" rating, saying the company could benefit from the
expansion of deepwater drilling activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bristow's deepwater services are likely to grow as
helicopters are the primary providers of personnel transport to
and from deepwater rigs and floating production units, JP
Morgan added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soaring demand from energy companies exploring for oil in
deepwater has inturn helped a number of offshore services like
support vessels and helicopter services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The global oil  gas aviation market is relatively
concentrated as Bristow and CHC Helicopter Corp FLYa.TO
FLI.N have about one third market share each," analyst David
Smith said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The supply of helicopters would remain tight over the next
two to three years as order books for medium and large
helicopters are locked up, the brokerage said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bristow's fleet currently consists of 107 medium, and 71
large helicopters, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan also said Bristow's shares were trading at a
discounted valuation which provided an attractive entry point
for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bristow shares closed at $48.52 Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Disney-Pixar blasts off into 
uncharted territory with Friday's release of animated film 
"Wall-E," a space adventure mixing an unusual love story with 
somber messages about the future of Earth and humankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The film features dystopian landscapes, social commentary 
and a lack of conventional dialogue that are rare under the 
Walt Disney Co banner, but it sticks to Pixar's basic themes of 
love, loyalty and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the sober tone and odd love-story between robots has 
prompted concerns that the "Wall-E" box office may not 
compensate for Disney's other big summer release, "The 
Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian," whose $259 million box 
office take has lagged forecasts so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investors have been wary of 'Wall-E's' box office 
potential given Pixar's risky bet on an offbeat main character, 
who rarely speaks during the film," Pali Capital analyst Rich 
Greenfield said in a note to clients this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A solid performance by "Wall-E" could boost Disney's 
results in upcoming quarters, in which the company faces tough 
comparisons with 2007 hits "Pirates of the Caribbean: At 
World's End" ($961 million worldwide) and "Ratatouille" ($621 
million) in theaters and DVD frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Greenfield noted Wall Street concern, he added that 
"Wall-E" had been well-received in early screenings, and he 
pegged the film's ultimate global box office take at $500 
million to $600 million. He also predicted it also would be a 
"solid contributor" to DVD and consumer products sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie will debut in more than 3,900 U.S. theaters on 
Friday and roll out around the world through December.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD I KNEW'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The character Wall-E, or Waste Allocation Load Lifter 
Earth-Class, is the last of a cadre of robots tasked with 
cleaning up piles of trash discarded by humans who abandoned 
the planet centuries before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The human race set off on a luxury space cruise during a 
planned five-year clean-up that lasts much longer and results 
in unfortunate changes in the human physique and psyche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the meantime, Wall-E faithfully reports to work each day 
on Earth with his pet cockroach and a lunch box in which he 
stores the knick knacks he finds among mountains of trash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The arrival of a sleek girl robot named Eve, sent to Earth 
by the orbiting humans to look for plant life, sends Wall-E on 
an adventure that changes his own and humanity's destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Andrew Stanton, who won an Academy Award for 
Pixar's most lucrative film, "Finding Nemo," said he wanted to 
show a future in which people had lost track of what matters in 
life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I thought, 'Well that's the question that Wall-E is trying 
to figure out: What is the point of living?"' Stanton said. 
"It's to love one another. It's to further a relationship."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In choreographing the non-verbal courtship of Wall-E and 
Eve, Stanton and his animators looked to "the hard process of a 
boy going over to ask a girl to dance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's all just metaphor for what it's like for a boy to 
court a girl," Stanton said. "It's all in there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film's references to current hot-button issues -- the 
environment, obesity and corporate greed -- were a coincidence, 
Stanton said, because he conceived the premise in 1994 with the 
idea of reviving the science-fiction films he loved as a boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I just was using elements of the world I knew," he said. 
"I wasn't trying to put anybody to task. I knew that, 'Wow this 
is starting to make some really uncomfortable parallels' but 
... as long as I don't have an agenda I'm not going to worry 
about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Bob Tourtellotte and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, June 27 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) on Friday
said it tapped Bear Stearns' former Asia CEO to run its sovereign
wealth group, joining other Wall Street banks in seeking more
business from state-run funds from the Middle East and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Like the rest of Bear Stearns' BSC_pf.N employees, the
future of former Asia head John Moore was uncertain after
JPMorgan agreed to buy Bear amid its stock plunge and collapse
earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan completed the fire-sale acquisition this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sovereign wealth funds are state-run investment vehicles
that, through mainly soaring oil prices or trade surpluses, have
amassed huge sums of money and have increasingly invested in
companies around the world, from London to Wall Street.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (C.N) shares fell to 
their lowest level in nearly a decade after a Goldman Sachs  
Co analyst said investors should sell the largest U.S. bank's 
stock short as losses mount from troubled debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In morning trading, the shares were down $1.03, or 5.5 
percent, at $17.82 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares 
were among the biggest drags on the Dow Jones industrial 
average .DJI and Standard  Poor's 500 .SPX, which both 
fell more than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also touched their lowest level since October 1998, 
the month that Sanford "Sandy" Weill merged his Travelers Group 
with Citicorp to create Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; William Tanona, the Goldman analyst, added Citigroup to 
Goldman's "Americas conviction sell" list and cut his price 
target on the stock to $16 from $20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He recommended a "paired" trade in which investors sell 
Citigroup shares short, betting on a decline, and buy Morgan 
Stanley (MS.N) shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said Citigroup might take $8.9 billion of 
write-downs for the April-to-June period, leading to its third 
straight quarterly loss. He also said the bank might need to 
cut its quarterly dividend for a second time this year, after 
lowering it 41 percent to 32 cents per share in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tanona's forecast suggests deeper problems for Citigroup 
Chief Executive Vikram Pandit, who is trying to turn the bank 
around after nearly $15 billion of losses in the last two 
quarters, and more than $46 billion of credit losses and 
write-downs since the middle of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see multiple headwinds for Citigroup including 
additional write-downs, higher consumer provisions as a result 
of rapidly deteriorating consumer credit trends, and the 
potential for additional capital raises, dividend cuts, or 
asset sales," the analyst wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pandit became chief executive in December, replacing 
Charles Prince, who resigned under pressure the previous month. 
Weill had hand-picked Prince as his replacement when he gave up 
the top job in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden said on 
a Deutsche Bank conference call that Citigroup could take 
substantial write-downs this quarter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DIVIDEND CUT MAY BE NEEDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tanona said Citigroup might write off $7.1 billion related 
to collateralized debt obligations and associated hedges 
related to monoline insurers, $1.2 billion for other asset 
classes and $600 million for structured note liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He now expects Citigroup to lose 75 cents a share this 
quarter, compared with his earlier forecast of a profit of 25 
cents. He also expects a full-year loss of $1.20 a share, 
compared with his prior view for a profit of 30 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of May, Citigroup had raised some $42 billion since last 
fall, including injections from sovereign wealth funds, data 
compiled by Reuters News show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tanona said the bank may now need to issue common stock or 
sell assets to raise capital, because regulators may forbid it 
from issuing more preferred or convertible securities. He also 
said halving the dividend could preserve $3.5 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the firm's current level of earnings power, we do 
not believe the dividend is safe," Tanona wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On June 24, Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski projected 
$8 billion of write-downs for Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tanona also downgraded the U.S. brokerage sector to 
"neutral" from "attractive," saying deteriorating fundamentals 
will likely prolong any recovery from the credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He projected a $4.2 billion second-quarter write-down for 
Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N, leading to a quarterly loss for the 
largest U.S. brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect write-downs for Citigroup and Merrill to outpace 
what we saw from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Lehman Brothers 
Holdings LEH.N recently, due to Citigroup's and Merrill's 
large exposures to ABS CDOs (asset-backed security CDOs) and 
associated hedges with the monolines," Tanona wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co analyst, on 
Thursday projected a $3.5 billion second-quarter write-down for 
Merrill. Banc of America Securities analyst Michael Hecht made 
the same forecast earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On June 17, Goldman analysts led by Richard Ramsden said 
U.S. banks may need $65 billion more capital to cope with a 
global credit crisis that will not peak until 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Steve Ballmer has been CEO at Microsoft Corp for eight years, but he will finally get to move into the corner office vacated by Bill Gates, the college friend who brought him to the company nearly three decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure of leading the world's largest software maker will only escalate in the wake of a bungled attempt to acquire Yahoo Inc, a move that forced the Web pioneer into the waiting arms of Microsoft's archrival, Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding fuel to the fire has been a lukewarm reception by customers for the company's flagship product, Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pressure is certainly on," said Alan Davis, analyst at investment firm D.A. Davidson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in his career, the 52-year-old Ballmer, whose public histrionics often overshadow a sharp intellect and a gift for numbers, must shoulder the weight of Microsoft's future without Gates, who stepped down on Friday from the company he co-founded to focus on philanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their partnership was forged at Harvard University, where the pair formed an unlikely friendship: Gates, the middle child of a prominent Seattle family, and Ballmer, a Detroit native whose parents never went to college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They both lived in a dormitory full of "anti-social math types," according to Gates. Ballmer, outgoing and involved in many social clubs on campus, seemed to be a study in contrast to the aloof Gates, who preferred all-night programming sessions and poker games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the pair shared a love of math and bonded over their reputations as energetic guys. To this day, they still engage each other in numbers games, calling it "math camp."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After college, Ballmer went to work at Procter  Gamble Co, sharing an office with current General Electric Co CEO Jeffrey Immelt, who has said the two disliked a common boss and would pass the days playing garbage-can basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer spent a year at Stanford University business school before Gates persuaded him to drop out and become Microsoft's first business manager. A month after joining, he found it was running behind on orders and its engineers were overworked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I decided to quit," Ballmer said at an employee event to mark Gates's last day at Microsoft. "I said, 'Jeez, I just dropped out of business school to come to a 30-person company as the bookkeeper'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates persuaded Ballmer to stay at the company over dinner, explaining Microsoft's ambitious vision: to place a computer on every desk and in every home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SCARY" MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives talk about Ballmer's ability to digest large chunks of data, while carefully probing business proposals for weaknesses in logic or reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer's sales and marketing prowess complemented Gates's technical acumen as Microsoft grew from a fledgling start-up into a world-beating software company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He worked up the ranks, becoming Microsoft's president in 1998 and replacing Gates as CEO in 2000. Ballmer is Microsoft's second-biggest shareholder after Gates with a 4.3 percent stake in the company, valued at more than $11 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Silver, analyst at research firm Gartner, describes Ballmer's management style as "scary," but credits him for being a good listener to the needs of his customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Steve's a bright, tough guy and a good marketeer," said Silver. "His personality can be very imposing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer often grabs headlines with sharply worded jabs at competitors. He once called free Linux software "a cancer" and dismissed Web search leader Google as "a one-trick pony."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His exuberance for all-things Microsoft has also earned him viral video fame on par with lonelygirl15 or Obama Girl. Video of Ballmer's enthusiastic support for software developers has been viewed more than 1 million times on YouTube, a performance that earned him the unflattering nickname of "Monkey Boy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was always the foil to Gates," said Mary Jo Foley, author of "Microsoft 2.0: How Microsoft Plans to Stay Relevant in the Post-Gates Era."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gates is such a serious, plodding, methodical guy and Ballmer knew that to be part of the dynamic duo with Bill, he needed to be the opposite."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"WALL-E," bolstered by near-unanimous critical praise, sold an estimated $62.5 million of tickets in its first three days, said Pixar's Walt Disney Co parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tied with 2001's "Monsters, Inc." to become Pixar's third-best opener. Pixar has gone to No. 1 with all nine of its movies, an unprecedented run that begin in 1995 with "Toy Story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company record of $70.5 million was set in 2004 by "The Incredibles." Industry pundits had forecast an opening for "WALL-E" in the $50 million to $60 million range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anything north of 60 (million dollars), we were going to be ecstatic," said Mark Zoradi, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Jolie, whose career has been overshadowed in recent years by breathless tabloid coverage of her personal life, kicked off at No. 2 with "Wanted."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) reigned 
supreme across global debt and equity underwriting for the last 
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The commercial bank underwrote over $147 billion dollars 
globally, but fell behind Citigroup Inc (C.N) in terms of fees, 
according to ThomsonReuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a rare glimmer of positive news for beleaguered Citi -- 
in second place for debt and equity underwriting -- it was on 
top of Wall Street when it came to fees this quarter, pushing 
JPMorgan into third place behind Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc 
LEH.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citi also came out on top of U.S. common stock 
underwriting, although Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N topped 
U.S. initial public offerings and Lehman snagged the top spot 
for follow-on offerings over the first six months of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the debt side, JPMorgan was also in first position 
across U.S. debt classes, including securitizations, high yield 
and investment grade corporate debt and agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy, power and utilities companies were the financial 
stalwarts of a lackluster quarter for capital markets and 
bankers expect this trend to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While some companies, notably banks, came to the capital 
markets through necessity, the opportunistic capital raising 
from the energy and power sector was the story of the second 
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Those two themes don't appear to us to be anywhere near 
abating," said Doug Baird, co-head of equity capital markets at 
Bank of America, which rose to fourth place in ThomsonReuters' 
U.S. initial public offering issuance table for the first half 
of the year, compared with eighth place for the first half of 
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But more generally, the picture is a bleak one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across the debt and equity markets in the United States, 
both the numbers and sizes of the deals were down on the year 
before -- in some cases dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High-yield debt issuance was down 59 percent on the first 
half of 2007 and deal size was down 68 percent. Investment 
grade issuance was also down close to 50 percent, although 
total deal size for the first half of the year -- at $4.8 
billion -- fell only just short of the $5.25 billion this time 
last year. IPOs, meanwhile, picked up somewhat on the first 
quarter, but with only 14 deals this quarter, activity is still 
at multi-year lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think the story's all bad, there's some silver 
lining to the cloud," said Dan Cummings, co-head of equity 
capital markets for the Americas at Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baird noted the financial sector is likely to remain a key 
capital markets player in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's more balance sheet repair work globally in the 
financial services sector that must continue to play out 
through the rest of the year," Baird said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The question is whether activity will remain at this 
quarter's levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect continued volatility in the second half of the 
year, with new issue volume very dependent on fundamental 
credit conditions," said John Cokinos, head of high yield 
capital markets at Bank of America, which rose to third place 
for debt underwriting for the first half of this year, compared 
with sixth place for the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plummeting stock market and widening credit spreads 
have dimmed investor appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I do think it impacts investor psychology," said Cummings. 
"What we have seen is a lot of money emerge that was previously 
in cash or cash equivalents, or was invested in lower-yielding 
securities, has returned to equity securities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He noted that again, energy stocks, which in some cases are 
up 10 percent on the year so far, are the biggest draws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) on Sunday 
proudly announced it added ArcelorMittal (ISPA.AS) Chairman 
Lakshmi Mittal to its board, but don't be surprised if some of 
the firm's investment bankers have mixed feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As the chairman and chief executive of ArcelorMittal, 
Mittal is one of the world's richest men and an influential 
businessman in his native India. Mittal and his family strung 
together a series of acquisitions to create the world's largest 
steelmaker, responsible for 10 percent of global steel output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet with rivals and critics always on the lookout for 
conflicts of interest, Goldman's bankers now must go to greater 
lengths when doing business with ArcelorMittal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding Mittal "creates some hurdles," a Goldman spokesman 
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly this is the kind of client that investment banks 
are loathe to lose. According to Thomson Reuters data, Mittal 
has been involved in 179 transactions totaling $79 billion over 
the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has advised Mittal on five deals since 2006 
totaling $47 billion in volume. Goldman and Citigroup are tied 
for second place behind Credit Suisse, which since 1998 is the 
steelmaker's top advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Times have changed since banks eagerly added industrial 
chiefs to their boards and sent managing directors to serve on 
the boards of clients. Today insider dealing rules and 
heightened worries about conflicts mean banks need to tread 
more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman in particular has come under fire since it is the 
world's largest securities firm, and therefore likely to be

accused of trying to influencing their client and win more deal 
assignments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think Goldman adds a client to its board because

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) reigned supreme across global debt and equity underwriting for the last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial bank underwrote over $147 billion dollars globally, but fell behind Citigroup Inc (C.N) in terms of fees, according to ThomsonReuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rare glimmer of positive news for beleaguered Citi -- in second place for debt and equity underwriting -- it was on top of Wall Street when it came to fees this quarter, pushing JPMorgan into third place behind Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi also came out on top of U.S. common stock underwriting, although Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N topped U.S. initial public offerings and Lehman snagged the top spot for follow-on offerings over the first six months of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the debt side, JPMorgan was also in first position across U.S. debt classes, including securitizations, high yield and investment grade corporate debt and agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy, power and utilities companies were the financial stalwarts of a lackluster quarter for capital markets and bankers expect this trend to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some companies, notably banks, came to the capital markets through necessity, the opportunistic capital raising from the energy and power sector was the story of the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those two themes don't appear to us to be anywhere near abating," said Doug Baird, co-head of equity capital markets at Bank of America, which rose to fourth place in ThomsonReuters' U.S. initial public offering issuance table for the first half of the year, compared with eighth place for the first half of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more generally, the picture is a bleak one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the debt and equity markets in the United States, both the numbers and sizes of the deals were down on the year before -- in some cases dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-yield debt issuance was down 59 percent on the first half of 2007 and deal size was down 68 percent. Investment grade issuance was also down close to 50 percent, although total deal size for the first half of the year -- at $4.8 billion -- fell only just short of the $5.25 billion this time last year. IPOs, meanwhile, picked up somewhat on the first quarter, but with only 14 deals this quarter, activity is still at multi-year lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the story's all bad, there's some silver lining to the cloud," said Dan Cummings, co-head of equity capital markets for the Americas at Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baird noted the financial sector is likely to remain a key capital markets player in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's more balance sheet repair work globally in the financial services sector that must continue to play out through the rest of the year," Baird said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is whether activity will remain at this quarter's levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect continued volatility in the second half of the year, with new issue volume very dependent on fundamental credit conditions," said John Cokinos, head of high yield capital markets at Bank of America, which rose to third place for debt underwriting for the first half of this year, compared with sixth place for the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plummeting stock market and widening credit spreads have dimmed investor appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think it impacts investor psychology," said Cummings. "What we have seen is a lot of money emerge that was previously in cash or cash equivalents, or was invested in lower-yielding securities, has returned to equity securities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that again, energy stocks, which in some cases are up 10 percent on the year so far, are the biggest draws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) said on Sunday it had added ArcelorMittal SA (ISPA.AS)
Chairman Lakshmi Mittal to its board, gaining the help of one
of the world's richest men but also creating hurdles for its
bankers to overcome to avoid conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the chairman and chief executive of ArcelorMittal,
Mittal is a dealmaking businessman whose influence now extends
far beyond his native India. Mittal and his family strung
together a series of acquisitions to create the world's largest
steelmaker, responsible for 10 percent of global steel output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet with rivals and critics always on the lookout for
conflicts of interest, Goldman's bankers now must go to greater
lengths when doing business with ArcelorMittal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding Mittal "creates some hurdles," a Goldman spokesman
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly this is the kind of client that investment banks
are loath to lose. According to Thomson Reuters data, Mittal
has been involved in 179 transactions totaling $79 billion over
the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has advised Mittal on five deals since 2006
totaling $47 billion in volume. Goldman and Citigroup are tied
for second place behind Credit Suisse, which since 1998 is the
steelmaker's top advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Times have changed since banks eagerly added industrial
chiefs to their boards and sent managing directors to serve on
the boards of clients. Today, insider dealing rules and
heightened worries about conflicts of interest mean banks need
to tread more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman in particular has come under fire since it is the
world's largest securities firm and therefore likely to be
involved in more deals. The bank also aggressively pursues work
as a lender, adviser and investor -- sometimes all in the same
transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When former co-president John Thornton sat on Ford Motor
Co's (F.N) board, it created headaches for the firm's bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some merger industry analysts argue the presence of former

than Mittal," Coffee added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said in a regulatory filing that Mittal would
receive a $37,500 retainer for his 2008 service (half of the
12-month retainer for directors of $75,000) as well as an
unspecified annual grant at the end of the year.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plans to cut the price of its best-selling Xbox 360 Pro model by $50, to $299 in the next few weeks, the Hollywood Reporter reported citing anonymous sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price cut for the Xbox 360 model with the 20 gigabyte hard drive will come before the video game industry's biggest trade show, E3, taking place in Los Angeles on July 15-17, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors of the Xbox price cut swirled on popular gaming blogs Joystiq and Kotaku last week. The two sites received snapshots of Kmart and Radio Shack flyers advertising the $299 price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft last cut the price of the Xbox Pro in August, from $399 to $349, prior to the release of "Halo 3" the following month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cut to $299 would make the Xbox 360 Pro $100 less than one of the console's major rivals, Sony Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation 3 with a 40 gigabyte hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is locked in a three-way competition with Nintendo's 7974.OS Wii and the PlayStation 3, which comes with a high-definition Blu-ray video player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jennifer Martinez; Editing by Daisuke Wakabayashi and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

(GS.N) announced on Sunday it had added ArcelorMittal SA

&lt;p&gt;Hypervisor Technology now supports Microsoft(R) Windows(R) XP on Intel Multi-Core Execution Platforms

RAVENSBURG, Germany--(Business Wire)--
Real-Time Systems GmbH announced the availability of the latest
version of its Real-Time Hypervisor software. Available immediately,
this software product, which was demonstrated for the first time last
week at the RadiSys Technology Day in Germany, enables the
simultaneous running of multiple operating systems on multi-core
processors, and also supports Microsoft Windows XP!

   Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on an integrated
computer chip doubles approximately every two years while all other
measures of performance increase correspondingly. Although true in the
past, it is known that physical and economical factors would one day
set a limit to the promise of constantly increasing CPU performance
while maintaining customary price levels. For that reason, and in
order to maintain the upward trend, the semiconductor industry has
turned to multi-core CPU designs, which have permitted Moore's Law to
continue to be valid. While the potential for exploiting the power of
multiple CPU cores has not yet been completely realized, manufacturers
of standard operating systems are pressing on with development
programs that will one day allow their operating systems to take
greater advantage of such platforms.

   The situation for embedded system designs is different, however.
To take advantage of multi-core CPU's, more and more real-time
software manufacturers have been forced to develop individual, i.e.,
custom, solutions. A few years ago, having recognized with foresight
the problems inherent in custom solutions, Real-Time Systems GmbH
developed a software product to make it possible for embedded
application engineers to run standard operating systems, both
real-time and conventional, on Intel multi-core platforms.

   Conventional virtualization solutions ('hypervisors') are
generally implemented by interposing an additional software layer
between an operating system and the CPU core that it uses.
Unfortunately, this kind of solution often influences the
deterministic behavior of the real-time system.

   In contrast to that, the RTS Real-time Hypervisor makes it
possible to run -- simultaneously, independently and robustly -- a
number of standard (homogeneous or heterogeneous) operating systems on
a single x-86 multi-core execution platform. Moreover, RTS software
technology does not in the least interfere with any of the supported
operating systems' timing behavior.

   By means of the RTS Hypervisor's configuration file, users
exclusively assign each operating system to (at least) one CPU core;
in a comparable fashion, they assign other system resources, such as
PCI devices or memory regions, to specific operating systems. To
secure and protect real-time system behavior, the RTS Hypervisor gives
each real-time operating system direct control of its own assigned
peripheral devices. And because such devices are neither virtualized
nor simulated, standard off-the-shelf device drivers can be used. To
provide additional flexibility, a user may specify the booting
sequence of the various operating systems; even in a fully-running
system, any individual operating system can be re-booted, if desired.
Despite the strict separation of the operating system environments,
provision for inter-system communication has been made by means of
Shared Memory and a Virtual Network.

   By enabling the support of Microsoft Windows XP in the RTH
Hypervisor environment, RTS has opened up an entirely new world of
possibilities for innovative embedded systems. There are countless
time-critical applications that would profit by simultaneously running
both the real-time software and Windows-based man-machine interfaces
on the same PC. Industrial Automation is just one of many disciplines
for which this technology would be interesting. Finally, it is
important to note that by using a single host platform for both
real-time and conventional processing, overall system costs and
complexity can be dramatically reduced. Currently, the RTS Hypervisor
supports Windows XP, Windows CE and Linux, as well as VxWorks, PharLab
ETS and Microware (R) OS-9. Support for additional operating systems
is in progress. RTS Hypervisor, ver. 1.5, is available now. Version
2.0 is scheduled to be released in the fall.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc on Monday sought to rally shareholder support in the face of a proxy battle with billionaire Carl Icahn, saying the activist investor had an "ill-defined plan" for the future of the Internet company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo detailed its rationale for rejecting a $47.5 billion takeover offer by Microsoft Corp, questioning whether the software maker was ever serious about a full-scale merger in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The record casts doubt on whether Microsoft was ever committed to a whole-company transaction," the filing states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokeswoman Jamie Moser fired back at Yahoo's allegations that the software giant was not earnest in pursuing the deal: "This is simply revisionist history," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn is running a slate of directors to replace Yahoo's board and has called for the removal of Chief Executive Jerry Yang ahead of the company's annual shareholder meeting to be held in Silicon Valley on August 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activist shareholder has said the company should still offer to sell itself, though Microsoft has said it is no longer interested in a full buyout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Icahn misrepresents the manner in which we negotiated with Microsoft," Yahoo said in an investor presentation it plans to make at the meeting. "Our board remains the best and most qualified group to maximize value for Yahoo stockholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company struck a similar tone in a letter to shareholders last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several major Yahoo investors said on Friday they are not sure whether they will side with Icahn in his proxy fight, including Legg Mason Capital Management, its third-largest institutional shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Yahoo rejected an alternate Microsoft proposal to buy its search business and a 16 percent stake in the company for $9 billion, plus annual advertising payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft proposed (a) last-minute 'hybrid' search-only structure, which does not benefit Yahoo financially or strategically and is based on flawed assumptions," Yahoo revealed in its filing on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead Yahoo reached a nonexclusive pact with larger rival Google Inc on search advertising. Yahoo says that deal will add as much as $450 million in operating cash flow within the first year and allow it to build other money-generating partnerships as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youssef Squali, an analyst with brokerage Jefferies  Co, sided with Yahoo in many of its arguments, but said the most likely outcome at the annual meeting was that investors would elect some of Icahn's board nominees to pressure the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that shareholders may want to confer a handful of board seats to Icahn's slate in order to maintain the sense of urgency and accountability to the current board," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares fell 2.9 percent to $20.72. The stock is down sharply since Microsoft withdrew its offer to buy Yahoo or to strike a partial deal to invest in it and buy its Web search arm. It now trades less than $2 above the $19.18 level where it stood before Microsoft's original bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock has fallen from a high near $30 in February -- when expectations were high that Yahoo would eventually accept Microsoft's January 31 offer of $31 per share in cash and stock. Microsoft withdrew its offer to buy the company in early May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dave Zimmerman and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SOMERS, NY, Jun 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
New IBM (NYSE: IBM) consulting offerings can help clients understand and
improve their societal impact -- from carbon management to labor
practices -- increasing their competitive position and appeal to
consumers and other interested parties.

    "Operating a business ethically and environmentally is not only a
requirement today, but also an opportunity -- companies that demonstrate
they adhere to the highest societal expectations of conduct have a
significant advantage in attracting consumers, investors and talent," said
George Pohle, IBM vice president and global leader for business strategy
consulting. "But in order to do that, companies must be able to accurately
assess how well they meet those expectations now, and where and how to
make improvements."

    The ability to meet these expectations has become critical, as people are
watching company behavior more closely than ever on a whole range of
issues -- the environment, fair wages and workplace safety, international
trade, product safety and reliability, philanthropy, and more. Empowered
by the Internet, they are equipped to organize and act quickly to reward
or punish brands depending on what they observe -- deciding what to buy,
who to work for, where to invest, and how business should be regulated.

    IBM's Corporate Social Responsibility Benchmarking Utility helps
clients
assess:


--  Whether they're currently treating CSR as an expense or an investment;
--  The effectiveness of their environmental policies, labor practices,
    regulatory compliance, corporate values, and other CSR-related activities,
    and where they may have gaps;
--  How well they engage customers and other stakeholders to understand
    their concerns and to communicate CSR performance.
    

    
The benchmarking utility is based on data from a survey by IBM of
c-level executives at more than 250 companies worldwide. The study, titled
"Attaining Sustainable Growth Through Corporate Social Responsibility,"
shows that 68 percent of the executives surveyed see CSR as an opportunity
to grow revenue and 54 percent believe it gives them a competitive
advantage.

    But the report also shows some significant gaps in how companies are
approaching CSR -- more than three quarters of the executives surveyed
admitted they don't understand their customers' concerns about CSR, and
only 17 percent are even asking them. This indicates that many companies
need to analyze and improve their CSR practices to ensure they line up
with what customers and other key stakeholders expect.

    In another survey conducted by IBM of more than 1,100 CEOs worldwide, the
majority of respondents said they plan to increase their investments in
CSR activities by 25 percent over the next three years. The key for them
is to ensure they are investing in the right programs, policies and
practices to meet the expectations of their stakeholders, and that is
what these new consulting offerings from IBM are designed to help them do.

    Based on what the benchmarking utility reveals about a client, IBM can use
its CSR Strategy Assessment and Roadmap offering to help it improve its
business processes and operations, address any shortcomings, and integrate
CSR into its overall strategies and objectives.

    IBM can then assist clients in a range of CSR areas, including:


--  Carbon footprint analysis and management;
--  Environmental procurement;
--  CSR policy development and monitoring for suppliers;
--  "Green" data center;
--  Information sharing and engagement with customers, shareholders,
    regulators and advocacy groups;
--  Linking philanthropy to corporate strategy;
--  Diversity and labor practices;
--  Engagement with employees on CSR.
    

    
This is an example of IBM's focus on higher value services and
innovative solutions to address client needs.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Steve Ballmer has been CEO at Microsoft Corp for eight years, but he will finally get to move into the corner office vacated by Bill Gates, the college friend who brought him to the company nearly three decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure of leading the world's largest software maker will only escalate in the wake of a bungled attempt to acquire Yahoo Inc, a move that forced the Web pioneer into the waiting arms of Microsoft's archrival, Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding fuel to the fire has been a lukewarm reception by customers for the company's flagship product, Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pressure is certainly on," said Alan Davis, analyst at investment firm D.A. Davidson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in his career, the 52-year-old Ballmer, whose public histrionics often overshadow a sharp intellect and a gift for numbers, must shoulder the weight of Microsoft's future without Gates, who stepped down on Friday from the company he co-founded to focus on philanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their partnership was forged at Harvard University, where the pair formed an unlikely friendship: Gates, the middle child of a prominent Seattle family, and Ballmer, a Detroit native whose parents never went to college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They both lived in a dormitory full of "anti-social math types," according to Gates. Ballmer, outgoing and involved in many social clubs on campus, seemed to be a study in contrast to the aloof Gates, who preferred all-night programming sessions and poker games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the pair shared a love of math and bonded over their reputations as energetic guys. To this day, they still engage each other in numbers games, calling it "math camp."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After college, Ballmer went to work at Procter  Gamble Co, sharing an office with current General Electric Co CEO Jeffrey Immelt, who has said the two disliked a common boss and would pass the days playing garbage-can basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer spent a year at Stanford University business school before Gates persuaded him to drop out and become Microsoft's first business manager. A month after joining, he found it was running behind on orders and its engineers were overworked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I decided to quit," Ballmer said at an employee event to mark Gates's last day at Microsoft. "I said, 'Jeez, I just dropped out of business school to come to a 30-person company as the bookkeeper'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates persuaded Ballmer to stay at the company over dinner, explaining Microsoft's ambitious vision: to place a computer on every desk and in every home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SCARY" MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives talk about Ballmer's ability to digest large chunks of data, while carefully probing business proposals for weaknesses in logic or reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer's sales and marketing prowess complemented Gates's technical acumen as Microsoft grew from a fledgling start-up into a world-beating software company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He worked up the ranks, becoming Microsoft's president in 1998 and replacing Gates as CEO in 2000. Ballmer is Microsoft's second-biggest shareholder after Gates with a 4.3 percent stake in the company, valued at more than $11 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Silver, analyst at research firm Gartner, describes Ballmer's management style as "scary," but credits him for being a good listener to the needs of his customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Steve's a bright, tough guy and a good marketeer," said Silver. "His personality can be very imposing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer often grabs headlines with sharply worded jabs at competitors. He once called free Linux software "a cancer" and dismissed Web search leader Google as "a one-trick pony."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His exuberance for all-things Microsoft has also earned him viral video fame on par with lonelygirl15 or Obama Girl. Video of Ballmer's enthusiastic support for software developers has been viewed more than 1 million times on YouTube, a performance that earned him the unflattering nickname of "Monkey Boy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was always the foil to Gates," said Mary Jo Foley, author of "Microsoft 2.0: How Microsoft Plans to Stay Relevant in the Post-Gates Era."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gates is such a serious, plodding, methodical guy and Ballmer knew that to be part of the dynamic duo with Bill, he needed to be the opposite."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan today announced that it has been selected by Telmex Internacional,
S.A.B. de C.V. (Telmex Internacional) to serve as the depositary bank for the
company's new Series "A" share and Series "L" share American Depositary Receipt
(ADR) programs.

Telmex Internacional offers a wide array of telecommunications services
including voice, data, Internet, Pay TV, video transmission and integrated
telecommunications solutions in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador,
Peru and Uruguay. Telmex Internacional is present in the residential, SMEs and
corporate markets of these countries and also offers regional telecommunications
products for the needs of multinational companies operating in Latin America.

Telmex Internacional was created in December 2007, when Telefonos de Mexico
S.A.B. de C.V. (TELMEX) received approval from its Board of Directors and
Shareholders to separate the company into two independent companies. TELMEX
offers telecommunications services in Mexico through the nation's most complete
local and long distance networks, in addition to connectivity, Internet access,
co-location, web hosting and interconnection services to other
telecommunications operators.,

JPMorgan, as depositary for TELMEX, arranged for the distribution of the shares,
in the form of Telmex Internacional ADRs.

The Telmex Internacional ADR programs were launched on the New York Stock
Exchange (Series "L" ADRs: TII; Series "A" ADRs: TII.A) on June 10th, 2008.
TELMEX has been a JPMorgan ADR client since 1991 when the government privatized
the Mexican telecommunications sector.

William Kirst, head of JPMorgan's Latin America Depositary Receipts (DR)
business, said:

"JPMorgan is proud to serve as the depositary bank for the Telmex Internacional
ADR programs, as well as for the Telmex ADR programs. Thanks to clients like
Telmex and Telmex Internacional, JPMorgan is the leading provider of DR services
in Latin America with 49% of the marketplace and administers more Latin American
DRs than any other bank."

JPMorgan also serves as depositary for four of the five largest DR programs in
Latin America. In 2007, JPMorgan launched a global depositary shares (GDS)
program for Grupo Clarin, the first Argentine company to have a DR listing on
the London Stock Exchange, and a global depositary share program for Almacenes
Exito S.A., the first primary offering of equity securities by a Colombian
company outside of its home market in over 10 years.

JPMorgan created the first-ever DR in 1927 (Selfridges). Today the overall DR
market comprises more than 1,800 companies from over 75 countries which sponsor
over 2,200 DR programs in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that
list on U.S. exchanges or Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) which typically list
in London or Luxembourg.

JPMorgan provides a full complement of ADR and GDR services to issuers seeking
to have their equity traded on exchanges beyond their home markets. JPMorgan
also offers a range of value-added Investor Relations and Advisory services to
issuers, with the singular goal of facilitating the DR's highest potential
liquidity, ownership and visibility.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, stock movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 30 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities cut its price
target on Marriott International Inc MAR.N and Starwood
Hotels  Resorts Worldwide Inc (HOT.N), saying the decrease in
corporate and leisure transient volumes would continue to hurt
the next three quarters of U.S. lodging demand and occupancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage lowered its price target on the stock of
Starwood Hotels to $50 from $60 and made a deeper cut of $13,
or 28 percent, to Marriott's price target of $47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think Starwood Hotels continues to outperform Marriott
(fundamentally) given its position in better performing
urban/higher price point U.S. lodging markets and greater
exposure to growing international lodging markets and a weak
U.S. dollar," analyst Joseph Greff wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the analyst maintained his "overweight" rating on
both the companies, saying the weak share price performance had
created a reasonably attractive valuation level and entry
points for longer-term investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greff, who lowered his 2008-2010 estimates on the
companies, said he expected investor sentiments to improve
later this year as earnings expectations get reset and
investors start to feel better about industry-wide supply and
demand trends in the second half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Marriott fell more than 2 percent to $26.03 and
that of Starwood Hotels were down about 2 percent to $39.44 in
early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  HAIFA, ISRAEL, Jun 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) is announcing a collaboration with European Union
partners at the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Summit to develop new
software that will improve performance and drastically cut down
time-to-market of mobile web applications. Specifically, partners of the
Milepost project -- (MachIne Learning for Embedded PrOgramS opTimization)
-- are developing advanced artificial intelligence technology that
automatically learns how to best optimize newly developed programs for
embedded processors in mobile devices.

    This May, IBM released a study which revealed 80 percent of consumers
would prefer a service provider that gave them more choice in the
applications and services available on their mobile device. For
developers, the study points to how consumer demand for customization and
personalization will drive the need for projects like Milepost to enable
a faster path to market for new mobile applications.

    Today's mobile hardware designs are rapidly changing and current
hand-crafted approaches to mobile software development are no longer
sustainable. The project's partners have released a prototype version of
their software at the GCC Summit showcasing successful preliminary
results. Within one month, Milepost was able to improve the performance
of a state-of-the-art complier by 10 percent -- something that would
normally take several years to accomplish.

    "The Milepost solution uses artificial intelligence and machine learning
to understand what kind of compiler optimizations are optimal for use with
each new hardware design," explained Mike O'Boyle, Professor of Computer
Science at the University of Edinburgh and Project Coordinator for
Milepost. "This will help completely automate compiler construction and
enable more rapid code design of hardware and software -- dramatically
reducing time to market in these systems."

    With each generation of reconfigurable architecture, the compiler
development time increases and the performance improvement achieved is at
risk. As high performance embedded systems move from application specific
ASICs to programmable heterogeneous processors, this problem is becoming
critical. Compiler designs simply can't keep up with so many different
kinds of new processors.

    "Milepost is realizing the vision of customized hardware with tailor fit
software," noted Dr. Bilha Mendelson, Manager of Code Optimization
Technologies at the IBM Haifa Research Lab. "Aside from shorter design
cycles, Milepost opens new opportunities by enabling engineers to leap
ahead and work with more experimental hardware. Opening the compiler
infrastructure and combining it with machine learning techniques enables
us to generate several sets of optimizations sequences for each hardware
application area."

    As part of the project, IBM Research is working to take advantage of new
architectural improvements. "There is something very rewarding in
accomplishing significant optimizations through cooperation with the EU
community," continued Mendelson. "This collaboration between industry,
academia, and the research community has enabled us to embark on bold and
adventurous research projects that are producing real measurable results."

    Milepost partners are in the midst of a three-year program, at the end of
which, they expect to release a fully robust version of their compiler
optimization software into the GCC main product. The Milepost GCC version
will be available to everyone in the open source community and is
scheduled for release in June 2009. The project consortium includes the
IBM Haifa Research Lab, Israel; the University of Edinburgh, UK; ARC
International Ltd., UK; CAPS Enterprise, France; and INRIA, France.

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Announces Internal Restructuring Transactions and Guarantees Related to Bear Stearns Acquisition

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today that it intends to take several
steps over the next several weeks related to the integration of the businesses
of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. that will result in the assumption of Bear
Stearns' preferred stock and debt securities by JPMorgan Chase and the
termination of Bear Stearns' reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

As previously announced, JPMorgan Chase expects to complete on July 15, 2008 an
internal merger transaction, as a result of which each series of outstanding
preferred stock of Bear Stearns will be automatically converted into a series of
JPMorgan Chase preferred stock having substantially identical terms. Following
the completion of this transaction, depositary shares, each representing a
one-fourth interest in a share of Bear Stearns preferred stock, will continue to
trade on the New York Stock Exchange, but will instead represent a one-fourth
interest in a share of JPMorgan Chase preferred stock and will trade under a new
symbol and CUSIP number.

Following completion of this transaction, Bear Stearns plans to transfer its
broker-dealer subsidiary Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. to JPMorgan Chase, resulting
in a transfer of substantially all of Bear Stearns' assets to JPMorgan Chase. In
connection with such transfer, JPMorgan Chase will assume (1) all of Bear
Stearns' then-outstanding registered U.S. debt securities; (2) Bear Stearns'
obligations relating to trust preferred securities; (3) Bear Stearns'
then-outstanding foreign debt securities; and (4) Bear Stearns' guarantees of
then-outstanding foreign debt securities issued by subsidiaries of Bear Stearns,
in each case, in accordance with the agreements and indentures governing these
securities.

Pending completion of the above transactions, effective June 30, 2008, JPMorgan
Chase has fully and unconditionally guaranteed each series of outstanding
preferred stock of Bear Stearns, as well as all of Bear Stearns' outstanding
registered U.S. debt securities and obligations relating to trust preferred
securities. As a result of these guarantees, Bear Stearns will cease to
separately file current and periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Exchange Act.

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) is a leading global financial services firm
with assets of $1.6 trillion, as of March 31, 2008, and operations in more than

&lt;p&gt;IBM and Epicor(R) Collaborate on Comprehensive Retail Management Offering for Specialty Retailers

   Expanded Relationship Bolsters Value-Add Offering to Retailers by
Tightening Integration from Retail Point-of-Sale to Hardware, Services
                              and Support
IRVINE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Epicor Software Corporation (NASDAQ:EPIC) today announced a
collaborative agreement with IBM to deliver a comprehensive,
integrated retail system management product for specialty and
department store retailers. As part of the expanded relationship, the
two companies will develop and market a total offering to centrally
manage and support point-of-sale (POS) hardware and software via IBM's
Remote Management Agent (RMA).

   "Our expanded relationship with Epicor demonstrates our joint
commitment to providing retailers fully integrated retail management
products--hardware, software and services--with a one-stop shopping
experience," said Juhi Jotwani, vice president of marketing and
strategy, IBM Retail Store Solutions business. "Retailers will benefit
from lower total cost of ownership and a central point of contact for
service and support."

   RMA is part of an end-to-end systems solution that empowers
retailers to manage their store environments more competitively,
enabling them to perform remote configuration, software distribution,
proactive remote monitoring, asset tracking, diagnostic and problem
determination down to the device level.

   The combination of the IBM RMA and Epicor Retail Store products
provides specialty retailers the ability to remotely monitor,
configure and track hardware, software and applications in one store
or multiple store locations, from a central point. The offering gives
retailers the tools they need to run their operations more efficiently
and effectively, resulting in an enhanced customer shopping
experience.

   According to Gartner, "The current global economic slowdown is
signaling that now, more than ever, retailers must focus on executing
as well as they can on in-store consumer service basics to attract
consumers and to sustain repeat spending. Retailers must also balance
and align their strategies and capabilities with customer priorities
for the segments they service and the type of goods they sell."(1)

   For a number of specialty retailers, the combination of Epicor
Retail Store solutions and IBM hardware is already the solution of
choice. Hudson Group, a privately held corporation that operates more
than 500 newsstands, bookstores, cafes and premier specialty retail
shops in 70 transportation terminals and airports throughout North
America, is one such customer. "We believe there will be significant
value add to our company as IBM and Epicor align more closely in
delivering software, hardware and services as a complete package,"
said Gary MacRae, vice president and CIO of Hudson Group.

   Epicor provides a full set of solutions for retailers
comprising integrated POS, cross-channel order management, CRM,
planning, sourcing, merchandising, replenishment, store inventory,
warehousing and financial systems. Epicor's sophisticated and
integrated software powers the entire retail enterprise providing
proactive tools to help a retailer react quicker, be more effective,
support customer relationship and brand initiatives, and increase and
achieve retail success.

   "Epicor and IBM are both committed to serving the needs of
specialty retailers--from regional chains to multichannel global
brands," said David Henning, executive vice president and general
manager of Epicor Retail. "Expanding our existing alliance
demonstrates the added value that Epicor and IBM bring to the
specialty retail market, with tailored software, hardware, services
and support that provides a solid technology platform for retailers to
streamline operations, enhance the customer experience and improve the
bottom-line."

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's New Prescription-Only Convenia(R) Eliminates Difficulty Owners Have
                         Giving Pills to Pets for Weeks
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Animal Health has announced the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
approved Convenia(R) (cefovecin sodium), the first and only antibiotic for dogs
and cats available in a single veterinarian-administered injectable dose.

Convenia provides up to 14 days of antibiotic treatment in a single dose for the
most common skin infections in dogs and cats - the No. 1 reason pets are
prescribed antibiotics.(1)

By relieving pet owners of the often impractical responsibility of giving pills
to their pets several times a day for weeks at a time, Convenia ensures the
antibiotic course of treatment is completed on time, giving the pet the best
chance for treatment success.

"We understand how difficult it can be for owners to give their pets the right
pills at the right time. With career and family responsibilities, many people
simply aren't around at appropriate intervals once, twice or even more times a
day despite their best intentions," said George Fennell, vice president,
Companion Animal Division, Pfizer Animal Health. "With Convenia, the pet gets
the dose it needs right in the veterinarian's office - so owners don't have to
worry about when and how to give pills to their pets."

The third in a string of new companion animal products in 15 months - following
the approvals of the first canine obesity medication and the first veterinary
drug to control vomiting in dogs, both in early 2007 - Convenia represents yet
another first from Pfizer Animal Health. Convenia is now available at veterinary
practices nationwide.

'Pilling' is a Challenging Responsibility for Pet Owners

Antibiotics currently in use for dogs and cats, while generally effective, can
be challenging for owners to give due to the need for daily or twice daily oral
doses over several weeks. Besides busy lifestyles that often don't allow owners
to be physically present to give their pets oral medications at the right times,
owners often forget to give pills and they prematurely end therapy when their
pets start to look or act better.

Some pet owners report that pets resist "pilling" or other orally administered
medications. Research shows that 30 percent of dog owners have trouble pilling
their dogs, while cat owners rank pilling as one of the most stressful
activities involved with caring for their cats.(2)

When doses are not given on time or when they are missed or stopped prematurely,
pets do not receive optimal treatment and risk treatment failure, deterioration
of health, and additional veterinary visits. Veterinarians report that
non-compliance is the major cause of treatment failures and/or relapses in
antibiotic therapy.(3)

"The approval of Convenia, the first in its class, marks a significant milestone
in the effective administration of antibiotics for companion animals," said Amy
Trettien, DVM, Pfizer Animal Health. "For the first time, we may be able to see
what 100 percent antibiotic compliance looks like."

Full Course of Antibiotic Treatment

Skin infections, which are caused by a variety of bacterial pathogens, are the
No. 1 reason dogs and cats receive antibiotic treatment.(1) In dogs, skin
infections are typically a response to an allergy or parasite infestations that
result in scratching, licking and biting behavior that can weaken skin and make
it susceptible to bacterial infections. In cats, skin infections are typically
in response to wounds or bites that become infected.

In U.S. clinical trials with 26 veterinary clinics, Convenia was proven to be
statistically equivalent to a 14-day course of antibiotics with a
veterinary-labeled, multi-day oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Study results
showed that, in most cases, a single dose of Convenia was effective against
naturally occurring skin infections in dogs and cats. Treatment outcomes for
both dogs and cats were as effective as the oral antibiotic used in the study.
In most cases, only a single injection was necessary. Only 14 percent of treated
canines required a second dose of Convenia to complete treatment.

Convenia is well tolerated, and its safety has been demonstrated in adult dogs
and cats as well as in puppies and kittens. The most common side effects seen
with Convenia are similar to those seen with other antibiotics, vomiting,
diarrhea, decreased appetite and lethargy. More than 4 million doses of Convenia
have been administered to pets globally since 2006.

             SKIN INFECTIONS IN DOGS AND CATS FACT SHEET

How common are skin infections in dogs and cats?

Skin infections are the No. 1 reason pets are prescribed
 antibiotics.(1) Common skin infections include pyoderma (literally,
 "pus in the skin"), wounds and abscesses. For cats, abscesses and
 wounds are more common.

What are the causes of skin infections?

Skin infections are caused by a variety of bacterial pathogens, the
 most common being Staphylococcus intermedius. In dogs, skin
 infections typically occur in association with an allergy or parasite
 infestation that causes the animal to scratch, lick, and bite the
 affected area. This reaction can weaken the skin and disrupt the
 skin's natural defense mechanisms, making it susceptible to bacterial
 infections. In cats, skin infections more commonly occur after the
 animal sustains a trauma or bite.

Pyodermas in dogs are classified by the depth of the infection.
 Superficial pyodermas affect the top layers of skin, while deep
 pyodermas involve the deeper layers of skin, and commonly extend
 beneath the hair follicle.

Less commonly, skin infections may be secondary to a hormonal disease,
 such as Cushing's disease or hypothyroidism, or other diseases that
 suppress the immune system.

How can you spot skin infections?

Since skin infections are generally secondary to underlying skin
 problems including allergies and parasite infections, pet owners may
 first notice certain behaviors that indicate a problem. For dogs that
 might include biting or chewing areas like the top of the tail or
 legs; closer examination might reveal broken hairs, a rash-like
 appearance, red pustules and patches of thickened skin that may look
 darker than the surrounding skin. Cats will sometimes appear to be
 itchy, especially around their head and ears, and scratch these
 areas.

How are skin infections treated?

Skin infections in both dogs and cats are generally treated with
 systemic antibiotics. For superficial infections, antibiotics are
 generally administered for 14-21 days. For deeper, more severe
 infections, treatment can last eight weeks or even longer.

Along with oral antibiotics, veterinarians may also recommend an
 antiseptic shampoo and if the primary disease that led to skin
 infection can be determined (for example, allergies or a parasite
 infection like fleas), treatment of the underlying problem.

Are skin infections difficult to treat?

While antibiotics currently used to treat skin infections in dogs and
 cats are generally effective, treatment can prove difficult for some
 owners, generally because the treatment is administered at home over
 a long period of time. Some common challenges include:

-- Scheduling: Antibiotic therapies usually require dosing at regular
 intervals over an extended period of time, generally twice a day at
 12-hour intervals. Some owners, due to scheduling issues and other
 demands on time, occasionally have difficulty administering the
 correct dose in the proper timeframe, especially when the treatment
 period is of long duration.
-- Stopping therapy too soon: Some owners, once their pet begins to
 heal, stop treatment early, or skip or forget to administer the
 antibiotic. This can lead to less than optimal treatment, and put the
 pet at risk of treatment failure. Skin infections, although sometimes
 appearing to be cured, can persist under the skin or in small pockets
 that might not be easily seen by the owner.
-- Pilling: Most antibiotics in the market are administered orally,
 which can prove stressful and challenging with some pets. Research
 indicates that 30 percent of dog owners have trouble pilling their
 pets, while cat owners rank pilling as one of the most stressful
 activities involved with caring for their cats.(2)

What are the long-term implications for skin infections?

Untreated skin infections can adversely effect a pet's quality of life
 and often, the relationship between owner and pet. Non-compliance
 with antibiotic treatment can contribute to a failure to cure the
 condition, a prolonged disease process, recurring infection,
 deteriorating health, and the need for additional visits to the
 veterinarian.

&lt;p&gt;Taylor Morrison, Disneyland and Partners Unveil Innoventions Dream Home at Disneyland(R) Resort

      Home Builder Lent Industry Expertise to Innovative Project
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(Business Wire)--
Home builder Taylor Morrison, in a partnership with the
Disneyland(R) Resort in California, unveiled the eagerly anticipated
Innoventions Dream Home in Tomorrowland today.

   The Innoventions Dream Home is a "high-tech, high-touch"
experience delivered by Microsoft, HP, Life-ware and Disneyland(R)
Resort in a 5,000-square-foot home designed in collaboration with
Taylor Morrison. The home demonstrates how technology can be
accessible, fun and intuitive while being seamlessly integrated into a
home environment that celebrates the past while looking ahead to the
future.

   "Our homes are inspired by the families who live in them," said
Taylor Morrison CEO and President Sheryl Palmer. "We applied that
philosophy when it came time to collaborate on the Innoventions Dream
Home."

   The Taylor Morrison team worked closely with Disney designer Tom
Zofrea to understand his design concept and style esthetic for the
home. Inspired by Zofrea, Taylor Morrison then contributed many of the
design elements shown on the facade and in the patio and party tent
areas.

   "Much the same way as we work with our home buyers in helping them
with their homes, we consulted with Tom to help him complete his
vision for the Innoventions Dream Home," said designer Deborah Foster
of Taylor Morrison.

   Given the theme of the home, it was important to both Zofrea and
Taylor Morrison that the home have a warm, authentic feel to it,
starting with the exterior.

   Foster and her staff worked to help translate Zofrea's designs for
the exterior of the home into architectural elements befitting a
traditional Taylor Morrison product. The end result was an
Innoventions Dream Home facade that incorporated authentic stone work,
custom wrought iron work and architecturally detailed wood beams and
trim.

   Taylor Morrison designers also helped achieve the Disney vision
through the selection of interior materials such as the home's kitchen
surfaces, flooring and various fabrics.

   The Taylor Morrison team suggested finishes and color palettes for
the kitchen's countertops and backsplashes and collaborated with
Zofrea on the use of fabrics in the living spaces. They also consulted
on the flagstone flooring that runs throughout the home.

   "We had to keep in mind the level of traffic expected for the
home," Foster said of the selection of the warm yet durable flagstone
flooring. "The flooring materials we used needed to be durable."

   The Taylor Morrison influence is most recognizable in the home's
patio area, an outdoor living space that is drawn directly from the
home builder's southern California collections of homes.

   Overall, the designer is delighted with the finished product.

   "The home showcases the technology while still looking warm and
inviting," Foster said. "We really feel visitors will be able to
relate to the home and will marvel at the technology."

   Taylor Morrison, Inc., is one of the top home builders in North
America, building a wide range of product for discerning home buyers
across the country. With more than 280 communities in Arizona,
California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Texas, Taylor Morrison,

&lt;p&gt;Research and Markets: Microsoft 2.0 Focuses on the People, Products, and Strategies That Will Define the Next Chapter for Microsoft

DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/d7f30a/microsoft_2_0_how)
has announced the addition of the "Microsoft 2.0: How Microsoft Plans
to Stay Relevant in the Post-Gates Era" report to their offering.

   No one - including Microsoft's own leadership - can predict
exactly what's next for Microsoft. But lots of smart folks, inside and
outside the company, have some pretty educated guesses. This book
provides a quick look back at Microsoft's past, and then it focuses on
the people, products, and strategies that will define the next chapter
for Microsoft.

   The People: The author looks at both the public faces of the
company (CEO Steve Ballmer, Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie,
Platform and Services leader Kevin Johnson), as well as some of the
key behind-the-scenes movers and shakers who are really leading the
Microsoft 2.0 charge. The Products: Contrary to popular belief,
Windows isn't going away any time soon (in spite of Google's influence
on the market). The author delves into the Microsoft products that
will fuel the company's growth for the short term (two to three years)
and its longer-term offerings that are expected to push profitability
into the next decade.

   The Strategies: What are some of the latest buzzwords at
Microsoft, and what do they indicate about the company's future
direction? Who are Microsoft's foremost competitors likely to be in
the next 2-5 years? What kinds of market forces will have an impact on
the way Microsoft does business going into the next decade.

   This is a book about the future, not the past. As such, it has
broad appeal to investors, Microsoft customers, software partners,
hardware partners, service providers and competitors.

   There are many Microsoft business books out there. However, 99% of
them are about Microsoft's and/or Bill Gates' past. There are books on
the Microsoft antitrust trial; on its strategy gaffes around the
Internet; and on what it's like to work at and interview at Microsoft.
But nothing on the shelf provides a look at what's likely next for
Microsoft Corporation. This is a must-read for those who are curious,
and in many ways, are affected by the changes that are to come.

   "The award-winning journalist author has access to inside
information and what she has to reveal will bring tremendous media
attention".(The Bookseller, Friday 14th March 2008)

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats story that ran on Sunday)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, June 29 (Reuters) - Steve Ballmer has been CEO at
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) for eight years, but he will finally
get to move into the corner office vacated by Bill Gates, the
college friend who brought him to the company nearly three
decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pressure of leading the world's largest software maker
will only escalate in the wake of a bungled attempt to acquire
Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), a move that forced the Web pioneer into the
waiting arms of Microsoft's archrival, Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding fuel to the fire has been a lukewarm reception by
customers for the company's flagship product, Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The pressure is certainly on," said Alan Davis, analyst at
investment firm D.A. Davidson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the first time in his career, the 52-year-old Ballmer,
whose public histrionics often overshadow a sharp intellect and
a gift for numbers, must shoulder the weight of Microsoft's
future without Gates, who stepped down on Friday from the
company he co-founded to focus on philanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their partnership was forged at Harvard University, where
the pair formed an unlikely friendship: Gates, the middle child
of a prominent Seattle family, and Ballmer, a Detroit native
whose parents never went to college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They both lived in a dormitory full of "anti-social math
types," according to Gates. Ballmer, outgoing and involved in
many social clubs on campus, seemed to be a study in contrast
to the aloof Gates, who preferred all-night programming
sessions and poker games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the pair shared a love of math and bonded over
their reputations as energetic guys. To this day, they still
engage each other in numbers games, calling it "math camp."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After college, Ballmer went to work at Procter  Gamble Co
(PG.N), sharing an office with current General Electric Co
(GE.N) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, who has said the two disliked a
common boss and would pass the days playing garbage-can
basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer spent a year at Stanford University business school
before Gates persuaded him to drop out and become Microsoft's
first business manager. A month after joining, he found it was
running behind on orders and its engineers were overworked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I decided to quit," Ballmer said at an employee event to
mark Gates's last day at Microsoft. "I said, 'Jeez, I just
dropped out of business school to come to a 30-person company
as the bookkeeper'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gates persuaded Ballmer to stay at the company over dinner,
explaining Microsoft's ambitious vision: to place a computer on
every desk and in every home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "SCARY" MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft executives talk about Ballmer's ability to digest
large chunks of data, while carefully probing business
proposals for weaknesses in logic or reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer's sales and marketing prowess complemented Gates's
technical acumen as Microsoft grew from a fledgling start-up
into a world-beating software company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He worked up the ranks, becoming Microsoft's president in
1998 and replacing Gates as CEO in 2000. Ballmer is Microsoft's
second-biggest shareholder after Gates with a 4.3 percent stake
in the company, valued at more than $11 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Silver, analyst at research firm Gartner, describes
Ballmer's management style as "scary," but credits him for
being a good listener to the needs of his customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Steve's a bright, tough guy and a good marketeer," said
Silver. "His personality can be very imposing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer often grabs headlines with sharply worded jabs at
competitors. He once called free Linux software "a cancer" and
dismissed Web search leader Google as "a one-trick pony."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His exuberance for all-things Microsoft has also earned him
viral video fame on par with lonelygirl15 or Obama Girl. Video
of Ballmer's enthusiastic support for software developers has
been viewed more than 1 million times on YouTube, a performance
that earned him the unflattering nickname of "Monkey Boy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He was always the foil to Gates," said Mary Jo Foley,
author of "Microsoft 2.0: How Microsoft Plans to Stay Relevant
in the Post-Gates Era."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Gates is such a serious, plodding, methodical guy and
Ballmer knew that to be part of the dynamic duo with Bill, he
needed to be the opposite."

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Animation giant Pixar scored its ninth consecutive No. 1 on Sunday with its robot love story "WALL-E," while Angelina Jolie achieved a personal best with her violent assassination thriller "Wanted."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"WALL-E," bolstered by near-unanimous critical praise, sold an estimated $62.5 million of tickets in its first three days, said Pixar's Walt Disney Co parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tied with 2001's "Monsters, Inc." to become Pixar's third-best opener. Pixar has gone to No. 1 with all nine of its movies, an unprecedented run that begin in 1995 with "Toy Story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company record of $70.5 million was set in 2004 by "The Incredibles." Industry pundits had forecast an opening for "WALL-E" in the $50 million to $60 million range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anything north of 60 (million dollars), we were going to be ecstatic," said Mark Zoradi, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Jolie, whose career has been overshadowed in recent years by breathless tabloid coverage of her personal life, kicked off at No. 2 with "Wanted." The Universal Pictures release earned about $51.1 million, easily beating forecasts of an opening in the mid- to high-$30 million range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her previous record for a live-action movie was 2005's "Mr.  Mrs. Smith," which opened to $50 million. The General Electric Co-owned studio said "Wanted" ranks as the third-highest opening for an R-rated action film, behind "The Matrix Reloaded ($91.7 million) and "300" ($70.9 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALES SOAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"WALL-E" and "Wanted," clearly aimed at disparate audiences, helped pushed overall sales to their highest level of the year, said tracking firm Media By Numbers. The top 12 films grossed $179 million, up 29 percent from last weekend, and up 20 percent from the year-ago period, when Pixar's "Ratatouille" opened at No. 1 with $47 million on its way to $206 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last weekend's champion, the Warner Bros spy comedy "Get Smart," slipped to No. 3 with $20 million, taking its 10-day haul to $77.3 million. The film, which stars Steve Carell as the inept hero Maxwell Smart, should finish up with about $130 million, said the Time Warner Inc-owned studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the top five, Pixar rival DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc's "Kung Fu Panda" slipped one to No. 4 with $11.7 million, taking its total to $179.3 million. The film opened four weeks ago to $60.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marvel Entertainment Inc's "The Incredible Hulk" fell three to No. 5 with $9.2 million. The superhero adaptation has earned $115.5 million after three weeks, roughly on par with its unloved 2003 predecessor "The Hulk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"WALL-E," a space adventure mixing an unusual love story with somber messages about the future of Earth and humankind, was directed by Andrew Stanton, who won an Academy Award for Pixar's 2003 hit "Finding Nemo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title character, or Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class, is the last of a cadre of robots tasked with cleaning up piles of trash discarded by humans who abandoned the planet centuries before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human race set off on a luxury space cruise during a planned five-year clean-up that lasts much longer and results in unfortunate changes in the human physique and psyche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of a sleek girl robot named Eve, sent to Earth by the orbiting humans to look for plant life, sends Wall-E on an adventure that changes his own and humanity's destinies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics heaped praise on the film. According to Rotten Tomatoes, a Web site that collects reviews, an astonishing 96 percent of critics liked the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said on TV's "Ebert  Roeper" that it was perhaps "the best American studio picture of the year," but the Hollywood Reporter said "it might be too clever to connect with mainstream audiences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's Zoradi said "WALL-E" was not a conventional cartoon, but the studio was "confident from the get-go" that it would work. He declined to reveal the film's budget, in line with Disney's policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"WALL-E" also opened at No. 1 in six small foreign markets, led by Brazil with $1.6 million, Zoradi said. It will reach Russia and Mexico next weekend, followed by the U.K. in mid-July, timed with the school holidays in each market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wanted," a $74 million comic book adaptation directed by Kazakhstan-born filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov, stars Scottish actor James McAvoy ("The Last King of Scotland") as an office drone recruited to an elite order of assassins by Jolie and Morgan Freeman. Critics were also enthused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dean Goodman and Gina Keating; Editing by Vicki Allen)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSLO, June 30 (Reuters) - Norway's financial watchdog said
on Monday it will probe the auditor of Fast Search  Transfer, a
Norwegian firm bought this year by Microsoft (MSFT.O), for
suspected irregularities in the computer group's accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A few days after Microsoft bid $1.2 billion for Fast in
January, the company had "restated" its 2006 accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We must go through all relevant information that Deloitte 
Touche [DLTE.UL] has about Fast, particularly for 2006," Anne
Merethe Bellamy, a director at watchdog Kredittilsynet, told
daily Dagens Naeringsliv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dagens Naeringsliv said that according to a Microsoft
statement it received, Fast accounts for 2006 and 2007 had been
corrected to reflect about $6 million in irregular payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fast was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fast was the second largest provider of enterprise search
software which lets companies comb internal corporate documents,
data and other information, a market also targeted by Google
(GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before Microsoft's buyout, Fast stock had tumbled after the
company said in mid 2007 it would no longer recognise revenues
from memorandums of understanding, and instead book revenue only
from final deals.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI, June 30 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and the
Shanghai government on Monday both denied a media report that a
planned Disneyland project in Shanghai has obtained central
government approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po reported on Saturday that a Disneyland
park would open as early as in 2012 in the eastern Chuansha
district of Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai Disney Park, the first on the mainland and the
third in Asia after Tokyo and Hong Kong, would be eight times as
large as the Hong Kong one, and will cost a total of 40 billion
yuan ($5.8 billion), the Beijing-backed newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The project still needs central government approval and
Shanghai will obey Beijing's decision," Shanghai spokesman Chen
Qiwei said, adding he will make new inquiries on this to relevant
departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney also denied the report. "There is no agreement and
there is no deal," Disney spokeswoman Alannah Hall-Smith said in
an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has been in talks with China for about a decade to
build a Disneyland in Shanghai, with an original goal of opening
ahead of the Shanghai World Expo in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng said the city had applied
to the National Development and Reform Commission to build a
park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (US$=6.8569 Yuan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Samuel Shen; Editing by Keiron Henderson)
