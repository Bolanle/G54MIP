&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, March 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
said on Monday it has shut down a couple of units in its
refinery and chemical plant in Singapore for six weeks of
planned maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have commenced the shutdown of several operating units
for planned maintenance from today and this is expected to last
about six weeks," an Exxon spokeswoman said, confirming an
earlier Reuters report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The shutdown will affect a couple of units in the
Singapore refinery and chemical plant," she told Reuters
without giving details of the units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Feb. 19, Reuters reported that ExxonMobil will partially
shut its mainland Singapore refinery and some petrochemical
units at its Jurong Island facility for a month or more from
March for routine maintenance, quoting six industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spokeswoman said that despite the shutdown, Exxon
expects to be able to meet the product needs of its customers
during this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. energy giant will close a number of secondary
units in the 309,000 barrels per day (bpd) mainland refinery
from early-March to mid-April, sources had told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil's more than 900,000 tonnes a year naphtha
cracker -- the largest such unit in Southeast Asia -- and
aromatics plant, the core facilities in the Jurong Island
petrochemical operations, will also be shut during March, the
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources had said that the March turnaround at Jurong Island
would include the aromatics unit that can produce more than
300,000 tonnes of benzene a year, while a cracking facility
will start its month-long turnaround in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One industry source said the visbreaking units at both the
mainland and Jurong Island refineries would be shut in stages
during the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shutdown of the visbreakers comes at a time when the
viscosity spread between 180- and 380-centistoke fuel oil has
stayed narrow at less than $3.00, after hitting a low of around
$1.50 in mid-February on waning demand for the 180-cst grade
from China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Jurong Island plant has a capacity of 296,000-bpd,
making Exxon's facilities in Singapore the fifth-biggest
refining complex in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mainland refinery, which has two crude distillation
units (CDUs) -- one with a capacity of more than 200,000 bpd
and the other with up to 100,000 bpd -- was shut for major
maintenance in June 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery on Jurong Island, also called the Pulau Ayer
Chawan (PAC) facility, operates two CDUs with a capacity of
about 115,000 bpd and 185,000 bpd. The smaller one was shut for
over two weeks in May 2007 after a fire. (Reporting by Jennifer

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. today announced that experienced banker and civic leader
Phyllis Campbell will become its Chairman of the Pacific Northwest April 1. The
lifelong resident of the region has been President and CEO of The Seattle
Foundation for the past six years. 

She will be on JPMorgan Chase`s Executive Committee and will be the firm`s
senior executive in Washington, Oregon and Idaho across businesses, representing
the firm at the most senior levels to clients. She will build on three decades
in banking, including eight years as President and Chief Executive Officer of
U.S. Bank of Washington and two years as chairman of its community board. 

"We could not have found a better person than Phyllis to lead our expansion of
financial services in this important region," said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO
of JPMorgan Chase. "Phyllis`s hard work, integrity and success in banking and
philanthropy define true leadership in the community." 

Campbell will step down March 31 from The Seattle Foundation, the largest
community foundation in the state and among the top 20 in the country. During
her tenure, the Foundation`s total charitable assets more than doubled and it
has sharpened its focus on education and economic opportunity. 

"We will miss Phyllis, but are very supportive of this important new
opportunity," said Bill Lewis, Chair of the board of trustees of The Seattle
Foundation. "The foundation`s healthy and responsible growth has been largely a
result of her strong and effective leadership. We know Phyllis will continue to
play an important role in the philanthropic community in concert with The
Seattle Foundation." 

Throughout her career, Campbell has been actively involved in civic and
charitable causes, including currently chairing the Board of Trustees of Seattle
University. She also serves as a director on the boards of Nordstrom and Alaska
Air Group. 

"I am excited to join a world-class firm and to help build on the community
legacy forged by Washington Mutual," Campbell said "Returning to my banking
roots and staying in the community I love is a wonderful combination for me." 

Campbell earned a bachelor`s degree at Washington State University and an M.B.A.
at the University of Washington. During her banking career, she had
responsibilities for private banking, commercial banking and retail banking -
all areas that JPMorgan Chase plans to expand in the region. 

JPMorgan Chase acquired Washington Mutual`s banking operations in September,
2008, honoring all customer deposits, including uninsured deposits. The bank
plans to refurbish and convert all 316 WaMu bank branches in Washington, Oregon
and Idaho to the Chase brand by June, setting the stage for customer access to
5,000 branches around the country by the end of the year. It also will expand
commercial and business banking to large and small companies under the Chase
brand and help many more families manage wealth through J.P. Morgan`s private
banking businesses. 

"By providing financial services and civic leadership, JPMorgan Chase will keep
the community`s well being front and center," Campbell said. "This new
opportunity allows me to build on a legacy that started in helping the city
rebuild from the Great Seattle Fire of 1889." 

Washington Mutual`s predecessor -- The Washington National Building Loan and
Investment Association - incorporated in September of 1889, creating the
financing to help Seattle residents rebuild after the fire. 

In the last few months, JPMorgan Chase announced two key community investments:

* A commitment to $2.65 million in grants to Washington non-profits in 2009 --
matching WaMu's local corporate giving in 2008. 
* A $10 million grant to the Seattle Art Museum, capping a tradition of support
begun by Washington Mutual in 1999. The grant will be paid over the next five
years.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil and Volunteer Houston announced today that applications were now
being accepted for ExxonMobil`s 2009 Community Summer Jobs Program, which offers
65 summer internships at local nonprofit agencies in the Houston area. 

Now in its 12th year, the Houston-area ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs Program
enables selected agencies to hire a college student for an eight-week internship
to assist with the heavy workload and low staffing often associated with the
busy summer months. In addition to regular job responsibilities, interns will
attend development seminars designed to broaden their exposure to the nonprofit
sector, volunteerism and community needs. Each intern will be paid a $2,750
stipend which is an increase over last year`s payment. 

"There is an increased movement toward volunteering and a greater appreciation
for this type of experience in today`s marketplace. This ExxonMobil program
offers a rare opportunity for college students to work in a nonprofit and be
paid for that invaluable experience," said Neil Chapman, president of ExxonMobil
Global Services Company. "We believe strongly in supporting our local nonprofits
and this is just one of the many programs we foster to do just that." 

"This ExxonMobil program continues to be one of the highlights of our year and
has been for the last 12 years," said Carrie Moffitt, CEO of Volunteer Houston.
"Thanks to the Community Summer Jobs Program, we find that a number of college
graduates decide to pursue a career in the nonprofit sector. Others go on to
volunteer and encourage their friends and family to do the same, providing a
positive ripple effect in our community." 

ExxonMobil will provide grants totaling more than $211,250 for intern salaries
and Volunteer Houston expenses associated with the program. Volunteer Houston
will also offer participating agencies training in recruiting and selecting
interns and managing an internship program. 

Since the program began in 1971 in New York City, ExxonMobil has provided more
than $9.3 million to support nearly 4,300 community summer job internships in
ten states including: Alabama, Alaska, California, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana,
Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming, and internationally in Angola. In the
Houston program alone, ExxonMobil has provided more than $1.6 million to place
almost 600 college students in summer internships. 

ExxonMobil Community Summer Jobs interns will be selected by the participating
agencies. The intern must be a currently enrolled, full-time, undergraduate
student who will be returning to college as a full-time (minimum 12 credit hours
per semester) sophomore, junior, or senior student in the fall of 2009. College
students interested in internship positions may contact the selected agencies
directly. For a list of participating agencies, visit Volunteer Houston`s web
site at www.volunteerhouston.org.

&lt;p&gt;Free Camps Help Students Have Fun While Learning Math and Science
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil, in conjunction with Dr. Bernard Harris and the Harris Foundation,
announced today the ExxonMobil Bernard Harris Summer Science Camp program will
expand to 30 residential camps and include participation by 11 new universities.


The two-week camps are designed for under-privileged middle school students
across the country and provide a fun-filled setting for them to gain a deeper
understanding of science, technology, engineering and mathematics and to promote
exciting careers in science. 

Dr. Harris, a former NASA astronaut and the first African American to walk in
space, created the camps four years ago with support from ExxonMobil. More than
1,500 students will take part in this year`s camps and explore themes such as
"Mission to Mars," "Revolutionary Robotics," and "Energy and Motion." The camps
are free and all student expenses are paid for by the program. 

"The success of this program is due to the support from ExxonMobil and our
partnership with renowned universities across the country," said Dr. Harris.
"It`s rewarding to realize how many kids we can reach by providing a new and fun
experience involving science while raising awareness about math and science
careers." 

Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil
Corporation, said the camps help inspire young minds. 

"ExxonMobil is dedicated to supporting programs that generate interest in math
and science education and provide career options for students," said Tillerson.
"Our country needs future scientists and engineers and these camps are an
investment in that future." 

At camp, students attend daily classes in natural science, engineering,
mathematics and technology, taught by faculty of participating universities and
secondary classroom teachers, who also receive professional development
training. Activities include classroom study, experiments, individual, team and
group projects, weekly field excursions and guest speakers who motivate students
to fulfill their dreams. 

To apply to attend the ExxonMobil Bernard Harris Summer Science Camps, students
must be academically qualified, genuinely interested in mathematics and science
and be recommended by two teachers. More information about student eligibility
and selection criteria can be found at the ExxonMobil Bernard Harris Summer
Science Camp website at www.theharrisfoundation.org. 

Numerous studies show that the United States faces a critical shortage of
engineers, scientists and other workers in math and science. ExxonMobil is
supporting programs and organizations that focus on improving mathematics and
science education. The company also sponsors programs to increase the number of
highly trained mathematics and science teachers, provide professional
development and training opportunities for teachers, and attract students to
pursue science- and math-related courses in middle school, high school and
college.

&lt;p&gt;TBILISI, March 2 (Reuters) - Russia will resume issuing visas to Georgian citizens this week, seven months after diplomatic relations were cut in the aftermath of a brief war, Georgian and Russian officials said on Monday. Georgian Foreign Minister Grigol Vashadze told reporters Russia would begin issuing visas on March 4 from the Russian embassy in Tbilisi, which was abandoned after ties were severed. The Russian visas will be issued from the former Russian embassy in Tbilisi where Swiss and Russian diplomats will be working, a spokeswoman for the Georgian Foreign Ministry said. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed visas would be issued by Swiss diplomats, Russia's RIA news agency reported. Tbilisi cut off diplomatic ties in August when the Kremlin recognised Georgia's two breakaway regions -- South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- as independent states after Russian troops repelled a Georgian assault on South Ossetia. Both the pro-Russian regions threw off Tbilisi's rule in the early 1990s. Georgia said Swiss diplomats at the Georgian embassy in Moscow would resume issuing visas for Russian citizens planning to spend more than three weeks in Georgia. Russians are currently issued with visas for up to three weeks on entering the country.  (Reporting by Niko Mchedlishvili and Matt Robinson; editing by Andrew Dobbie)

&lt;p&gt;March 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Kohl's Corp
(KSS.N) a notch to "neutral," while removing the stock from its
Americas conviction sell list, citing the mid-priced retailer's
more realistic profit outlook for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We see little company-specific news pressuring shares in
the near term aside from an ongoing negative macro back drop,"
analyst Adrianne Shapira wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The retailer's February same-store sales in the negative
low single digits is expected to outpace its peers, the analyst
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kohl's and other retailers like Macy's Inc (M.N) and J.C.
Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) have seen revenue fall sharply as
consumers refuse to spend on discretionary items like clothes,
or look for deep discounts while they do shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "KSS is not a fresh money buy as we believe current levels
do not present overly compelling risk/reward," Shapira said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, an impressive inventory and expense management
should persist and enable the company to outperform its peers
on strong fundamentals, the analyst added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Kohl's forecast 2009 earnings of $2.00 to $2.30
a share and a decline of 1 percent to 4 percent in total sales.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola lidera iniciativa de reciclaje durante el famoso festival callejero 
MIAMI--(Business Wire)--
&#191;Qu&#233; sucede cuando se combina la bebida favorita del mundo, un mill&#243;n de
personas, 200 contenedores de reciclaje y el festival callejero m&#225;s grande de
los Estados Unidos en una de las ciudades m&#225;s populares de Am&#233;rica? Para el
Festival de la Calle Ocho significa una de las tareas de reciclaje m&#225;s intensas
del sur de Florida. El 15 de marzo, Coca-Cola Recycling se unir&#225; al Club Kiwanis
de La Peque&#241;a Havana para crear una iniciativa de reciclaje durante el Festival
de la Calle Ocho en Miami con el objetivo de generar mayor consciencia sobre
reciclaje entre los consumidores. 

"Coca-Cola est&#225; comprometida en cumplir su objetivo de reciclar y reutilizar el
100 por ciento de las botellas pl&#225;sticas y latas que produce en los Estados
Unidos", dijo Alejandro G&#243;mez, gerente de mercadeo multicultural, regi&#243;n sudeste
de Coca-Cola North America. "Estamos muy contentos de unirnos con el Club
Kiwanis para traer el tema de reciclaje a la Calle Ocho lo cual nos da la

bebida usados", dijo Mike Tewey, gerente del distrito, WSI. "Estoy seguro de que
los residentes del Sur de Florida aprovechar&#225;n esta oportunidad para reducir los
residuos y reciclar estos recursos valiosos". 

En enero, Coca-Cola abri&#243; la planta de reciclaje de botellas de pl&#225;stico m&#225;s
grande del mundo en Spartanburg, Carolina del Sur, y lanz&#243; un esfuerzo de
mercadeo de varios millones de d&#243;lares con el fin de apoyar el programa de
reciclaje denominado "Give it Back". El programa "Give it Back" est&#225; dise&#241;ado
para recordar a los consumidores que las botellas y las latas de Coca-Cola son
valiosos elementos reciclables.

&lt;p&gt;MONROVIA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Xencor, Inc., an antibody discovery and development company, announced today
that is has entered into a technology license and evaluation agreement with
Pfizer Inc to optimize the performance of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.
Pfizer will apply Xencor`s proprietary Xtend antibody half-life prolongation
technology and XmAb ADCC enhancing technology to its antibody drug candidates. 

Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will have access to Xencor`s antibody
optimization technology during a non-exclusive research period for evaluation of
the technology in several of its discovery projects. In addition, Pfizer has
taken a commercial license to Xencor`s technology for one program. 

Xencor will receive an upfront payment from Pfizer and is eligible to receive
additional consideration based on Pfizer`s successful commercialization of
products that incorporate the Xencor technology. Further details of the
agreement were not disclosed. 

"We are delighted that a world class leader in the antibody space such as Pfizer
will be broadly investigating the use of Xencor`s antibody optimization
technology within its R organization to potentially enhance specific
properties of its therapeutic antibody drug candidates," commented Bassil
Dahiyat, Ph.D., Xencor`s chief executive officer. 

"The ability to enhance the pharmaceutical properties of antibody drug molecules
and customize this class of drugs for specific therapeutic settings is a central
differentiating factor which Xencor will continue to pioneer," commented James
Posada, Ph.D., MBA, Xencor`s acting chief business officer. 

About Xtend technology

Enhance Antibody Half-Life

Xencor`s proprietary antibody technology platform provides a validated solution
to enhancing the serum half-life of immunoglobulin molecules. Using its
proprietary series of Xtend antibody Fc variants, antibody half-life can be
readily prolonged to enhance performance in a number of different therapeutic
indications. 

Commercial Benefits

Dosing frequency is an important attribute and differentiating factor in certain
indications. By prolonging the serum half-life of antibody drug molecules the
opportunity arises to address chronic indications with an antibody drug product
that potentially has the ability to be administered at greater than monthly
intervals, greatly enhancing patient convenience and improving market
positioning. In addition, it is possible to reduce the dose of the biologic that
is required to maintain effective drug levels, potentially improving the cost,
profitability and capital expense profile of the product. 

About XmAb ADCC technology

The XmAb platform can increase the potency of therapeutic antibodies by
specifically engaging the body`s immune system against target antigen cells. A
proprietary suite of XmAb Fc variants allows the selective improvement of
antibody cytotoxic properties by enhancing antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity
(ADCC), phagocytosis and/or complement activation. Increased antibody potency
has the potential to improve antibody efficacy in a variety of therapeutic
areas, including oncology, infectious disease and autoimmune disorders. 

About Xencor

Xencor, Inc. engineers superior biotherapeutics using its proprietary Protein
Design Automation technology platform and is a leader in the field of antibody
Fc engineering to significantly improve antibody potency and half-life. The
company is advancing XmAb antibody drug candidates optimized for activity
against biologically validated targets and its XPro protein therapeutic
candidate into the clinic. Xencor's product development is led by an antibody
candidate, XmAb2513, in a Phase I clinical trial for the treatment of Hodgkin
lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and a protein therapeutic drug
candidate, XPro1595 DN-TNF, for the treatment of inflammatory disease. With
multiple partners, such as industry leaders Genentech, Boehringer Ingelheim,
MedImmune and Human Genome Sciences, Xencor is applying its suite of proprietary
antibody Fc domains to improve antibody drug candidates for traits such as
potency and sustained half-life. For more information, please visit

&lt;p&gt;Nuance Delivers Natural Language Voice Control for Microsoft Auto Powered
Navigation Systems
BURLINGTON, Mass. &amp; AACHEN, Germany--(Business Wire)--
Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUAN), a leading provider of speech
solutions, today announced One-Shot Destination Entry technology on Microsoft`s
Auto platform at Embedded World, taking place in Nuremberg, Germany, March 3-5,
2009. Nuance will be demonstrating the technology in the Microsoft Automotive
Business Unit Partner booth in Hall 11.0, Stand 11-414, and at the Nuance
Automotive Usability Forum taking place in St. Goar, Germany on March 11. 

Nuance`s One-Shot Destination Entry is based on the latest version of Nuance
VoCon 3200, the industry-leading speech recognition engine that now supports new
search algorithms to allow one-shot, multi-slot entry in just one spoken
command. Instead of walking through a multi-step dialog and responding to
independent prompts for city name, street name and house number, the user can
simply speak the address in one shot, stating for example, "196 Sunset
Boulevard, San Francisco, California." 

"We`re seeing strong demand for voice-driven user interfaces that control
today`s automotive telematics, navigation and infotainment systems," says Greg
Baribault, director of marketing, Microsoft ABU. "The combination of Nuance`s
state-of-the-art speech technology and the Microsoft Auto platform enables auto
manufacturers and suppliers to quickly and easily build intuitive and
easy-to-use speech-enabled solutions that immediately deliver increased consumer
value." 

The increased demand for natural language user interfaces is due in part to the
need to reduce driver distractions. A recent study on in-car distraction
implemented by the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany revealed that
speech recognition combined with Natural Language Understanding (NLU) technology
significantly reduces distractions and improves driving performance while using
navigation systems in the car. The study compared the impact of conventional
destination entry by voice requiring individual confirmation of city name,
street name and house number, and a more advanced user interface requiring a
single confirmation (both versus manual operation). The system supporting single
confirmation reduced the reaction time by 47 percent, while the conventional
speech input for city, street and address reduced reaction time by 24 percent. 

"Nuance`s speech technology on the Microsoft Auto Platform has been a driving
force in bringing voice user interfaces to mass market platforms like the
popular Ford SYNC and Fiat Blue," says Arnd Weil, general manager, Nuance
Automotive Solutions. "Nuance`s proven speech technology combined with
Microsoft`s flexible platform architecture allows for quick application
development and implementation of new features, a warrant for innovation and
competitive leadership." 

Nuance`s VoCon 3200 speech recognition engine currently supports 23 languages.
This coupled with Nuance`s text-to-speech engine that supports 34 languages is
fully integrated into Microsoft`s Auto platform, and is available today for the
world`s auto manufacturers and suppliers. 

About Microsoft Auto

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Auto 3.1 is designed to allow carmakers and Tier One
suppliers to more quickly and easily implement state-of-the-art infotainment
systems. With Microsoft Auto, applications are developed for the platform rather
than for a specific device model, so development costs can be amortized through
easy design portability. Microsoft Auto 3.1 provides an integrated middle-ware

&lt;p&gt;LIMERICK, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Teleflex Incorporated ("Teleflex" or the "Company") announced today that it has
signed a definitive agreement to sell to General Electric Company ("GE") its 51
percent share of Airfoil Technologies International - Singapore Pte. Ltd.
(ATI-Singapore), a joint venture between GE and Teleflex. Teleflex will receive
$300 million for the sale of its joint venture interest and plans to use the net
proceeds primarily to pay down debt. The transaction is subject to receipt of
various regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to
close by the end of the first quarter. 

As a result of this agreement, ATI will be reflected in the Company's future
consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation. ATI revenues of
approximately $250 million are comprised of both repair and replacement
component revenues. The business generates free cash flow to Teleflex of
approximately $30 million, and has a tax rate of approximately 6%. The
transaction is expected to result in a pre-tax gain on sale of over $250
million. The Company expects a debt-to-total capital ratio below 50% after the
application of net proceeds to debt repayment. Teleflex will provide pro-forma
disclosures post-closing of the transaction in accordance with required
guidelines and intends to update its annual guidance at that time. 

"We have enjoyed our long-term partnership with GE in this venture and are
pleased to have structured a transaction that allows us to further reduce our
outstanding debt and focus on our important growth objectives," stated Jeffrey
P. Black, chairman and chief executive officer. "We are also pleased to be
transitioning the ownership of ATI to an industry leader with strong customer
relationships." 

Teleflex and GE have also entered an agreement that will permit Teleflex to
transfer its ownership interest in the remaining ATI business to GE by the end
of 2009. 

ATI-Singapore started operations in 1998 and has become a leader in the repair
of cold section compressor airfoils with industry-leading turnaround time and
excellent quality. The facility services all GE commercial aviation, marine and
industrial engines, all CFM56 engines as well as Pratt &amp; Whitney and Honeywell
components. Located in Loyang Industrial Park, ATI-Singapore has about 535
employees who repair more than two million compressor airfoils a year.

&lt;p&gt; (Correcting day in lead paragraph to Monday from Wednesday)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, March 2 (Reuters) - Wall Street bank Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) will launch its "dark pool" trading platform in
Hong Kong on Monday, providing an alternative source of
liquidity to clients at a time when trading volumes are
thinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In dark pools, buyers and sellers anonymously match large
stock orders, keeping details about order prices and volumes
concealed so big orders do not distort the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman dark pool -- named SIGMA X -- was first launched
in 2005 in the United States and also operates in Europe. It
comprises hedge funds, institutions, broker dealers, as well as
franchise flow from Goldman Sachs' trading desks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The growth potential of Hong Kong's market remains
significant and we think alternative pools of liquidity will
play an important role in its development going forward," said
Gene Reilly, managing director and head of trading and execution
for Goldman Sachs in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daily average trading volume on the Hong Kong stock exchange
is expected to fall by as much as 47 percent this year,
according to a Morgan Stanley forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other dark pool operators in Hong Kong include brokerage
CLSA, Investment Technology Group (ITG.N), and the Instinet unit
of Nomura Holdings (8604.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIGMA X is the largest non-displayed liquidity pool in the
United States by equity shares traded daily, Goldman said in a
statement. Its average daily volume has grown 10-fold in the
last two years, and trades over 300 million shares per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, market analysts said anywhere from 10 to 20
percent of U.S. equity trades could be occurring in dark pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Reporting by Joseph Chaney; Editing by Ken Wills)

&lt;p&gt;Single Global Campaign Creates Operational Efficiencies - Focuses on Migrating
Spending to Electronic Payments
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today unveiled its first global advertising campaign,
entitled "More people go with Visa," reflecting the company`s evolution to a
single, global company. The new campaign enables Visa to align its worldwide
marketing under a single theme that highlights the superior value Visa delivers
versus cash and checks - including more security, more control and more
convenience. The campaign also enables Visa to achieve cost efficiencies by
consolidating its global marketing efforts. The "More people go with Visa"
campaign will debut today globally; television advertising launches in the
United States on March 4. 

The "More people go with Visa" campaign focuses on Visa`s core growth strategy -
migrating consumer and business spending from cash and checks to a better form
of electronic payment, Visa. The campaign establishes a single global marketing
message that will be executed locally for maximum relevance, delivering Visa`s
global message in an efficient and cost-effective way. 

"Visa gives people the ability to take action - the actions that are most
important to them," said Antonio Lucio, chief marketing officer of Visa Inc.
"The `More people go with Visa` campaign is an invitation to make the most out
of life every day, a powerful message. It`s not about spending more, it`s about
using Visa for those things that are important to you every day." 

By focusing on encouraging Visa usage over cash and checks, the campaign helps
grow the payments business of Visa`s financial institution clients. At the same
time, it better enables them to focus their marketing efforts on differentiating
their Visa products from those of competitors while strengthening their customer
relationships. The campaign also supports Visa merchant partners by promoting
the convenience of using electronic payments in key merchant categories like
restaurants and online music, among others. 

The "More people go with Visa" campaign is both optimistic yet grounded in the
reality that people are seeking to live both in the moment and within their
means. It recognizes that, even in uncertain times, people want to move forward
and highlights that Visa helps them do so by offering a range of payment
products, by empowering financial literacy, and by providing money management
tools. (For more information on these products and other management tools,
please visit www.visa.com/goresponsibly.) 

"Underpinning the campaign is a simple and universal assertion that is
fundamental to Visa`s view of the world and how we operate as a company," added
Lucio. "Simply put, this campaign is an invitation that reflects Visa`s belief
that our products are for anyone who wants to go. And when they go, Visa offers
them a better way to go, confidently, conveniently, safely and responsibly." 

Campaign Overview

The "More people go with Visa" platform is relevant across all geographic
regions and demographics, and will be used to promote the vast product choices
that Visa offers, as well as the Visa brand itself. The campaign is well suited
for traditional and new media, and will strongly support Visa`s global
sponsorship properties and merchant marketing programs. 

In the United States, two national television spots - "Let`s go" and "Aquarium"
- will premier on March 4 during "American Idol" on FOX. "Let`s go," which will
introduce the campaign, portrays an optimistic view of life that focuses on the
possibilities of a new day - from stepping outside your comfort zone to
challenging yourself to do things differently - and positions Visa as the brand
to help consumers achieve their dreams and ambitions. "Aquarium," celebrates
moments where Visa`s debit product, the Visa Check Card, allows cardholders to
experience the beauty of every day. In this spot, viewers are told the story of
a father-daughter trip to the Aquarium viewed through the eyes of the child. 

Visa`s international markets will launch with a television commercial named
"Gofesto." The spot, which will be customized by each Visa region, takes viewers
on a journey across the globe showing different people from different places
enjoying what the world has to offer - from experiencing the great outdoors to
taking simple trips to the supermarket. The spot reminds cardholders that life
is not about collecting possessions, but more importantly, about collecting
experiences. 

In the coming weeks, Visa will roll out a series of print advertisements
focusing on the benefits of the Visa Check Card. 

Visa has also created an array of digital extensions that provide consumers with
tools and information to experience life - enhanced by the "More people go with
Visa" campaign. Rich media banner advertisements will provide live video feeds
of people taking action from six major cities around the world including Buenos
Aires, New York and Ho Chi Minh City. Using Google Maps functionality, other
banners will deliver local merchant recommendations based on user preference and
time of day. Visa also has created a microsite for the campaign
(www.visa.com/globaladvertising) that allows consumers to submit pictures and
provides recommendations on different experiences to try, along with merchant
offers. 

Business Evolution

This campaign launch follows less than a year after the company`s historic
initial public offering (IPO) and reorganization. The alignment of six Visa
regions into a single, global company has enabled Visa, Inc. to realize the
efficiencies, streamlined strategy and decision-making globally that was
anticipated at the time of the IPO. 

The campaign is part of a broader effort to reorganize the company`s marketing
efforts through which Visa consolidated its global media buying and global
creative advertising under a single holding company. This consolidation will
deliver significant operational efficiencies as well as reductions in fees and
production expenses - thus maximizing the effectiveness of its marketing
expense.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, March 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group's (GS.N)
co-head of Asia investment banking, Mark Machin, is relocating
to Beijing to help build the bank's business in China,
spokeswoman Connie Ling said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's China venture has not underwritten any domestic
equity offerings since 2007, and its ranking for handling
overseas stock sales by Chinese firms fell to seventh last year
from first in  2004, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Machin will continue to oversee Goldman's investment banking
business in Asia, excluding Japan, Ling said. Cai Jinyong, the

capital markets environment. Goldman also slipped to tenth in
advising Chinese companies on mergers and acquisitions last year
from fourth in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Local media reported last week that Goldman Sachs Gao Hua

later.

&lt;p&gt;PERTH, March 4 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) massive
Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) venture is expected to cost
as much as A$50 billion ($32.03 billion), a newspaper reported
on Wednesday, citing a government official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron, with joint venture partners ExxonMobil Corp
(XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), is also expected to
reach a final investment decision on the project by around the
middle of this year, the WA Business newspaper said, citing the
Western Australia State Premier Colin Barnett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman from the Premier's office could not
immediately confirm the information. Chevron plans to build the
Gorgon LNG processing plant on Barrow Island, located off
Western Australia state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which owns a 50 percent stake in the Gorgon
project, last year expanded the size of the Gorgon LNG
processing plant to 15 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) from a
previously planned capacity of 10 mtpa. The Gorgon gas fields,
first discovered in 1981, have certified gas reserves of over
40 trillion cubic feet with a nominal development life of
around 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil and Shell each own a 25 percent stake in the
project.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. announced today that it has become aware of an unsolicited
"mini-tender" offer by Latam Investments LLC to acquire up to 5,000 shares per
week of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. common stock. Latam Investments LLC is a
broker/dealer based in Miami, Florida. JPMorgan Chase is not affiliated in any
way with Latam Investments LLC, the offer, or the offer documentation. 

In light of the limited publicly available information concerning Latam
Investments LLC and the "mini-tender" offer, JPMorgan Chase is unable to take a
position regarding a recommendation to its shareholders on accepting or
rejecting the "mini-tender" offer. However, we strongly recommend that you
proceed with caution and consider all of the possible risks before accepting
Latam Investments LLC`s "mini-tender" offer. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cautioned investors about
"mini-tender" offers in an investor alert. "Mini-tender" offers are designed to
seek less than five percent of a company`s outstanding shares, thereby avoiding
many of the SEC`s disclosure and procedural requirements. The SEC noted that
"mini-tender" offers have been increasingly used to catch investors "off guard"
and that many investors who hear about "mini tender" offers "surrender their
securities without investigating the offer, assuming that the price being
offered includes the premium usually present in larger, traditional tender
offers." To read more about the risks of "mini-tender" offers, please see the
SEC`s alert on the SEC`s website at www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm. 

JPMorgan Chase understands that, under the terms of the "mini-tender" offer, at
the time you accept the offer, you will not know the price per share being
offered for your shares of common stock because that price will be set on a
weekly basis based on the shares tendered. We also understand the Latam
Investments LLC will only accept up to 5,000 shares of common stock per week,
and that if your shares are not accepted you will not have the right to withdraw
your shares from the offer and your shares will be carried over to the following
week. Therefore, we understand that there is no assurance as to the price you
will receive for your shares of common stock or when you will receive payment
for your shares. 

If you are considering accepting the "mini-tender" offer, you should consult
your financial advisor and fully investigate the terms of the "mini-tender"
offer before making an investment decision. You should also carefully consider
the value that you will receive for your shares of common stock in the
"mini-tender" offer and whether your shares of common stock could be sold for
more value through other methods.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will favor neither American nor foreign workers as it cuts thousands of jobs, the company said on Tuesday in response to a senator's call that the jobs of U.S. employees be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in January that it would eliminate up to 5,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of its workforce, surprising investors as it released quarterly results that missed Wall Street expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news also caught the eye of Republican Sen. Charles Grassley, who fired off a letter asking that Microsoft detail the cuts, while urging the world's biggest software company to preserve the jobs of Americans ahead of foreigners with visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it was too early to be precise, but the percentage of workers at the company who hold so-called H-1B visas would remain roughly the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not expect to see a significant change in the proportion of H-1B employees in our workforce following the job reductions," General Counsel Bradford Smith said in a letter to Grassley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senator said the response left him wanting more details.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background on job creation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HANOVER, March 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) may create
up to 3,000 jobs as it raises investment in research and
development by $1 billion this year amid a financial crisis
that has also taken its toll on the software giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Realignment of the company will help us reassign people
and could allow us to create some 2,000 to 3,000 new jobs,"
Kevin Turner, chief operating officer, said on Tuesday at
CeBit, Europe's biggest technology trade fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turner said while Microsoft was eliminating jobs in some
areas, new opportunities would arise at the same time. He
reiterated that Microsoft, under pressure to trim costs amid a
global recession, would stick to its research budget this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turner did not provide details on where the jobs are going
to be created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft had announced creating about 2,000 to 3,000 jobs
in January as part of its broader realignment plan for the next
18 months independent of its beefed up research and development
budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will invest a record $9 billion in RD ... spend a
billion more than last year," Turner said, adding
Internet-based applications -- so called cloud computing --
would be a major field for Microsoft's investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The current macroeconomic climate was the most challenging
most people had ever seen in their lifetime, Turner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe while this may be a once in a lifetime event it
may also be a once in a lifetime opportunity to create new
business models," Turner said.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
said on Tuesday that the proportion of its workforce with visas
would stay about the same after it completes thousands of job
cuts, in response to a senator who urged that U.S. jobs take
priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said in January that it would eliminate up to
5,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of its workforce, surprising
many investors and sending shock waves across markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news also caught the eye of Republican Sen. Charles
Grassley, who fired off a letter asking that Microsoft detail
the cuts, while urging the world's biggest software company to
preserve the jobs of Americans ahead of foreigners with visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it was too early to be precise, but the
percentage of workers at the company who hold so-called H-1B
visas would remain roughly the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not expect to see a significant change in the
proportion of H-1B employees in our workforce following the job
reductions," General Counsel Bradford Smith said in a letter to
Grassley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; H-1B employees have always amounted to less than 15 percent
of Microsoft's U.S. workforce, Smith said in the letter dated
March 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The potential to tap into the world's best minds has long
been essential to our success," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has been a champion of expanding the H-1B
temporary visa program, which lets American companies and
universities hire foreign workers in a category the government
considers "specialty occupations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also noted that including positions to be
created, the net impact of the cuts would be between 2,000 and
3,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grassley, who is the ranking member of the Senate Finance
Committee, had asked Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer to
provide a breakdown of the jobs to be eliminated, how many of
those are staffed with individuals with H-1B visas and how many
with Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman from Grassley's office said the senator just
got the letter and would review it.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE: KO;
Coca-Cola) proposed $1.5 billion senior unsecured notes offering, which could be
upsized. The notes will rank pari passu with Coca-Cola's other senior debt.
Fitch expects Coca-Cola to use the proceeds to repay short-term debt and for
general corporate purposes. The notes are being issued under the company's
existing indenture dated April 26, 1988. Significant covenants include, but are
not limited to, limitations on liens and restrictions on sale-leaseback
transactions. 

At Dec. 31, 2008, Coca-Cola's total debt was approximately $9.3 billion, of
which $6.5 billion was short-term. Fitch's ratings for Coca-Cola are as follows:


The Coca-Cola Company 

--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; 

--Bank credit facility 'A+'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; 

--Short-term IDR 'F1'; 

--Commercial paper 'F1'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. 

Fitch's ratings reflect Coca-Cola's substantial cash flow generation, which is
due to its high operating margins; its leading position in the global market for
non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages; and its strengthening
noncarbonated portfolio. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs)
in Coca-Cola's beverage portfolio, the ratings consider the multiyear decline in
CSD volumes in the United States and modest CSD growth in other developed
countries. Moreover, the ratings recognize Coca-Cola's market strength in
developing, high-growth countries. 

Coca-Cola is currently awaiting Chinese regulatory approval of its proposed $2.4
billion acquisition of China Huiyuan Juice Group Limited (Huiyuan), a Hong Kong
listed company with operations throughout China. Huiyuan manufactures and
distributes China's market-leading 100% juice and nectar brands, complementing
Coca-Cola's Chinese juice business, which comprises primarily juice drink
products. A decision by the Chinese authorities is expected soon. Fitch expects
that the acquisition will be funded conservatively. 

For the year ended Dec. 31, 2008, Coca-Cola's credit statistics were in line
with Fitch's expectations. Total debt-to-operating earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was approximately 0.9 times (x)
and operating EBITDA-to-gross interest expense was about 22.3x. Cash balances
were approximately $4.7 billion at the end of the period. While Coca-Cola's
credit profile is stronger than similarly rated food and beverage companies, its
ratings reflect the credit metrics of the Coca-Cola system, which comprises The
Coca-Cola Company and its significant and/or strategic bottlers. The company's
strong credit metrics are counterbalanced by the more highly leveraged credit
metrics of Coca-Cola's bottlers. 

For further information, please see Fitch's press release, 'Fitch 2009 U.S.
Beverage Outlook: Volumes Likely to Remain Challenged in 2009,' dated Nov. 18,
2008, and Fitch's research report, 'Credit Update: The Coca-Cola Company' dated
Dec. 11, 2008, both available on the Fitch ratings web site,

&lt;p&gt;Market Intelligence Solution Links Microsoft Technologies to Exec Dashboard
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Hitachi Consulting, the IT and management consulting company of Hitachi, Ltd.,
was named one of the first recipients of the Partner of the Year Award during
the Enterprise Search Innovation Awards at the Microsoft FASTforward`09
conference. Selected in part for its overall track record of innovation with
Microsoft products, Hitachi Consulting was also recognized for its new market
intelligence solution that combines internet search with real-time business
data. 

The award, according to Microsoft, recognizes companies that "continually engage
with FAST Search &amp; Transfer, a Microsoft subsidiary, and Microsoft to address
business issues through the innovative adoption of search technologies. This
award is presented for utilizing the power and potential of search to change
customers` decision-making processes by providing a total view of business
information assets and unique access that enables customers to tap into their
human capital." 

According to Ellen Dowd, Hitachi Consulting Vice President who led development
of the new offering, "the solution is an innovative use of Microsoft platforms
that already exist in many organizations. It helps decision makers keep a finger
on the pulse of the marketplace by monitoring trends that impact key business
functions." 

"When talking with companies about investing in this new solution the discussion
inevitably leads to the conclusion that their business can`t be run successfully
without the multi-faceted data it provides. We have reached a point now where
smart leaders understand that lacking the right information, at the right time,
can cost their company market share and ultimately revenue," Dowd said. 

"To be market responsive, enterprises need more support managing information
assets. This award from Microsoft validates our investments and capabilities,"
said Drew Naukam, Managing Vice President, Microsoft Practice. "Hitachi
Consulting," he added, "is working to become a market leader in the Enterprise
Search market, with deep investments in technology skills, methodology, and
innovative solutions that help enterprises derive value from their information
assets." 

The new market intelligence solution combines existing Microsoft technologies of
FAST, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and Microsoft Office
PerformancePoint Server to provide an executive dashboard of information sourced
from critical business areas. 

"Our partner ecosystem offers customers a variety of ways to make the most of
their investments in Microsoft products," said Jared Spataro, Director of
Enterprise Search, Microsoft. "Hitachi Consulting is blazing trails and working
closely with us to develop the best business solutions for our Enterprise Search
customers, earning them the prestigious 2009 Partner of the Year Award." 

"Search is the next frontier in enterprise platforms, and we intend to be a
market leader in this space," Naukam said. 

For its success implementing Microsoft products Hitachi Consulting was nominated
as one of two finalists for Microsoft Corp.`s 2008 Partner of the Year Award in
Microsoft Dynamics AX. Hitachi Consulting won the Microsoft BI/Data Management
Partner of the Year award in 2006, the Information Worker Solutions, Messaging
and Collaboration award in 2007, and received the Microsoft Dynamics Partner of
the Year award in 2005 and 2006.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is
deteriorating more severely than previously anticipated and
will shrink at an annual rate of 7 percent this quarter, with
the unemployment rate rising to 10 percent by the end of next
year, a Goldman Sachs economist forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Our expectations for near-term U.S. economic activity
swung sharply to the downside last week," wrote Goldman
economist Ed McKelvey in a research note dated Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among factors behind that shift in view were steep falls in
consumer spending, fresh signs of weakening industrial
activity, further evidence of a sharp fall in housing activity
and ongoing deterioration in the labor market, McKelvey wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The estimated 7 percent annual rate of contraction for U.S.
gross domestic product in the first quarter exceeds Goldman's
previous forecast for a 4.5 percent contraction. The bank
expects GDP to contract 3 percent in the second quarter,
exceeding its earlier forecast for a 1 percent fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. unemployment rate, currently at 7.6 percent, is
now expected to rise to 9.5 percent by the end of this year and
to 10 percent by the end of 2010, the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Year-over-year U.S. consumer prices are expected to rise 1
percent by the end of this year and to be at zero by year-end
2010, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Reporting by John Parry; Editing by Kenneth Barry)

solution) and Bausch &amp; Lomb`s Alrex&#174; (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic
suspension 0.2%), Lotemax&#174; (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.5%)
and Zylet&#174; (loteprednol etabonate 0.5% and tobramycin 0.3% ophthalmic
suspension). The co-promotion agreement also will apply to Bausch &amp; Lomb`s
investigational anti-infective eye drop, besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension,

&lt;p&gt;March 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and

risk that they may be forced to buy unwanted stock, Bloomberg
reported.&lt;/p&gt;

billion pounds ($18.13 billion) the London-based bank plans to

&lt;p&gt;  CHELMSFORD, MA, Mar 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Aspect, a unified communications (UC) solutions provider, today announced
the successful rollout of Microsoft(R) Office Communications Server 2007
R2 at the company headquarters in Chelmsford, Mass. Aspect(R)
Professional Services worked closely with the company's IT organization
to complete the deployment on 18 February 2009 and the company is
continuing its global deployment throughout offices in the Americas,
Europe and the Asia Pacific (APAC) regions over the coming months. The
implementation was accelerated through UC RapidStart, a packaged UC
Services offering from Aspect that helps companies gain hands on
experience with a pilot deployment of Microsoft(R) Office Communications
Server 2007 (OCS).

    The company's headquarters, with more than 300 employees, is the first
Aspect site to have completely migrated to Office Communications Server
2007 R2 for all voice and voicemail services, audio and Web conferencing,
instant messaging (IM) and presence, making the Chelmsford office the
company's first phone-free location. Aspect has also retired its
Chelmsford PBX for all employee peer-to-peer and corporate calling
services.

    "This journey to 'go-live' is really a significant milestone in Aspect's
company-wide unified communications strategy," said Jamie Ryan, senior
vice president, Information Technology and chief information officer,
Aspect. "This effort was successful because of the joint efforts of
Aspect Professional Services and IT throughout the deployment. Aspect
Professional Services can now bring the same skills and experience to our
customers around the globe to help customers develop a UC strategy and
deploy it effectively.

    "The best part is the cost benefits we'll be able to see as a result of
the implementation, including saving $75,000 per month on conference
calling in the first year alone," Ryan added. "Furthermore, both local
and long distance costs will drop significantly as a result of our use of
session initiation protocol (SIP) Trunking and will result in additional
savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars as we complete our
deployment. With these types of savings, our ROI will be extremely
aggressive."

    Aspect continues its global rollout of Office Communications Server 2007
R2 to more than 1,800 employees. The company's deployment across North
America and Europe will be completed by June, with APAC following in the
second half of 2009.

    "Through this implementation, Aspect has applied our understanding of
global mission critical voice deployments, in addition to our expertise as
one of the first Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 Voice
specialization partners," said Kevin Schwartz, executive vice president of
Global Professional Services, Aspect. "To the company's knowledge, the
Aspect implementation will be one of the largest Microsoft Office
Communications 2007 R2 rollouts globally, and this implementation further
validates our expertise as an enterprise-class UC services provider."

    About UC RapidStart

    UC RapidStart from Aspect helps organizations jumpstart their UC journey
with a pilot deployment of Microsoft(R) Office Communications Server 2007
(OCS) and Microsoft(R) Office Communicator 2007 to a small number of
users, combined with introductory workshops on business and IT strategy
to help organizations move forward into subsequent detailed planning,
architecture, and design activities.

    "The best part is the cost benefits we'll be able to see as a result of
the implementation, including saving $75,000 per month on conference
calling in the first year alone," Ryan added. "Furthermore, both local
and long distance costs will drop significantly as a result of our use of
session initiation protocol (SIP) Trunking and will result in additional
savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars as we complete our
deployment. With these types of savings, our ROI will be extremely
aggressive."

    Aspect continues its global rollout of Office Communications Server 2007
R2 to more than 1,800 employees. The company's deployment across North
America and Europe will be completed by June, with APAC following in the
second half of 2009.

    "Through this implementation, Aspect has applied our understanding of
global mission critical voice deployments, in addition to our expertise as
one of the first Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 Voice
specialization partners," said Kevin Schwartz, executive vice president of
Global Professional Services, Aspect. "To the company's knowledge, the
Aspect implementation will be one of the largest Microsoft Office
Communications 2007 R2 rollouts globally, and this implementation further
validates our expertise as an enterprise-class UC services provider."

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) generated $5 billion in profit during the worst year in Wall Street history by trading over-the-counter fixed-income derivatives, Bloomberg said, citing two people with knowledge of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank, which reported $5.6 billion of total profit in 2008, has not disclosed earnings for its interest-rate swap, municipal bond and foreign exchange derivatives group, the agency said. The unit was among the most profitable at the New York-based company, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan trading desk may have benefited as the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK and JPMorgan's takeover of Bear Stearns Cos left companies and hedge funds with fewer trading partners in the private derivatives markets, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among commercial lenders, JPMorgan dominates OTC derivatives trading, the agency said, citing data compiled by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank held $87.7 trillion worth of outstanding OTC contracts as of September 30, more than the next two banks, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), combined, the agency reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan could not be immediately reached by Reuters for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ratul Ray Chaudhuri in Bangalore; editing by Simon Jessop)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Management Console now also supports Amazon EC2 in EU Region, giving
developers an easy-to-use, web-based management tool for their EU-based AWS
solutions
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
Amazon Web Services LLC (AWS), a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN),
today launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) running Microsoft
Windows Server and Microsoft SQL Server in its EU Region, allowing customers to
access Windows-based compute resources for Europe and running on the reliable
and proven AWS cloud. Also starting today, the AWS Management Console will
provide support for Amazon EC2 in the EU enabling developers to manage their
Amazon EC2 resources in the EU Region using a simple, point-and-click web
interface. Launched in August of 2006, Amazon EC2 is the popular AWS service
that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud for businesses and
developers. To sign up for Amazon EC2 and other AWS services, go to
http://aws.amazon.com. 

Amazon EC2 running Microsoft Windows is a fast and dependable environment for
deploying applications using the Microsoft Web Platform, including ASP.NET,
AJAX, Silverlight, and Internet Information Server (IIS). Amazon EC2 also
supports the SQL Server Express and SQL Server Standard databases. With these
announcements, Amazon EC2 running Windows is now joining Linux/Unix-based Amazon
EC2 environments, the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon
CloudFront in the EU Region. As with all AWS services, Amazon EC2 running
Microsoft Windows is priced on a cost-effective, pay-as-you-go pricing model so
that customers pay only for the compute capacity that they use. 

Also announced today, the AWS Management Console now supports the Amazon EC2 EU
Region, allowing developers to start and stop Amazon EC2 instances, view and
perform actions on running instances, and manage Amazon Elastic Block Store
volumes with simple clicks of a mouse. The AWS Management Console provides a
quick, global picture of a developer`s cloud computing environment, giving them
an easy tool for managing their AWS cloud-based assets. 

"Many AWS customers have asked us for Amazon EC2 running Windows instances in
Europe," said Peter De Santis, General Manager of Amazon EC2. "Businesses and
developers can now access and manage all of their compute resources, whether
Windows-based or Linux/Unix-based, close to their European customers, partners,
and other computing services including Amazon S3." 

eXpansys PLC is a retailer of smartphones and handheld devices shipping over 1.5
million products to over 250,000 customers in over 125 different countries.
"eXpansys has been preparing to move our global ecommerce infrastructure to
Amazon EC2, a move that we forecast will halve our operating costs and almost
eliminate IT capital expenditure," said Matt Kydd, CTO of eXpansys. "With the
expansion of Amazon EC2 running Microsoft Windows, we are able to launch
immediately." 

"Our European clients with Windows-based services will now recognise that Amazon
has eradicated one of the last barriers to cloud adoption. Amazon EC2 running
Windows adds to the already compelling benefits of speed, flexibility, and
cost-reduction when moving to our European Amazon-based service," said Karl
Deacon, CTO Capgemini Outsourcing UK. 

Since 2003, Folk, a creative agency in the UK, has been delivering award-winning
solutions from the worlds of design, online, advertising, publishing, gaming,
brand development, film production, television and music. "With the launch of
EC2 running Windows for Europe, we can use Amazon Web Services to launch a video
based media system running completely in the cloud," said Simon Jenkinson,
Interactive Director at Folk. "AWS is scalable, cost-effective, fast, reliable
and is by far the best of the cloud based solutions in the market. It`s made my
job a whole lot easier, which is all we developers really want!" 

About Amazon EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (http://aws.amazon.com/ec2) is a web service that
provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2's simple web
service interface allows businesses to obtain and configure capacity with
minimal friction. It provides complete control of your computing resources and
lets you run on Amazon's proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the
time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you
to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements
change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay
only for capacity that you actually use.

&lt;p&gt;March 3 (Reuters) - Spanish banks may suffer from
deteriorating credit quality due to rising unemployment and
real-estate sector problems in the country, Goldman Sachs said,
keeping its "cautious" view on the banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman downgraded Spain's second-largest bank BBVA
(BBVA.MC) to "neutral" from "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The valuation levels of the domestic banks do not
appropriately reflect the credit risk embedded in these
businesses and we remain cautious on these," Goldman said in a
note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which cut its price targets on several Spanish
banks, said the capacity to withstand credit losses would be a
key differentiator among the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this respect, Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC) and BBVA are
the best, while Banco De Sabadell SA (SABE.MC), Banco Popular
Espanol SA (POP.MC) and Banco Pastor SA PAS.MC come out
worst, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also said credit quality looked significantly
weaker for most Spanish banks, particularly Sabadell, Popular
and Pastor, in terms of non-performing-asset rates and
coverage, while BBVA and Bankinter SA (BKT.MC) were little
affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it continued to prefer BBVA over Santander,
particularly in view of Santander's UK exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a summary of price-target changes made by Goldman Sachs

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANKARA, March 3 (Reuters) - Turkish Petroleum Corporation
(TPAO) has signed deals with Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and EOG
(EOG.N) for oil exploration in Turkey's southeastern region,
TPAO Chief Executive Mehmet Uysal said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major oil importer Turkey has stepped up efforts to exploit
hydrocarbon reserves on its territory and in the Black Sea as it
looks to diversify energy sources and reduce its fuel bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have signed a non-disclosure agreement with Exxon Mobil
for the exploration of oil in the region of southeastern
Anatolia," Uysal told a news conference. The region borders
oil-rich Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uysal said TPAO believed the Black Sea had 10 billion
barrels of crude and 1.5 trillion cubic metres of natural gas
reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TPAO said previously it aimed to launch production in
2015-2016 if drilling is carried out by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an attempt to diversify its energy sources, Turkey has
signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran to exploit
natural gas reserves in the Islamic Republic's South Pars field,
and Uysal said investment for the project is seen increasing to
$6 billion from a previously announced $3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uysal also said it was still in talks with other companies
for oil exploration in Iraq, including BP (BP.L), Royal Dutch
Shell (RDSa.L), Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and India's ONGC (ONGC.BO).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) has agreed
to license an array of generic pills and injectable medicines
from India's Aurobindo Pharma Ltd (ARBN.BO) as the world's
largest drugmaker looks to off-patent medicines for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the deal announced on Tuesday, Pfizer said it expectedthe products acquired to deliver more than $200 million in
annual revenue in 2013, according to David Simmons, general
manager of Pfizer's established products business unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The products expand Pfizer's growing generics portfolio and
are versions of drugs originally made by companies other than
Pfizer. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer is focusing on off-patent medicines as one avenue to
spur profits as the drugmaker encounters generic competition
that threatens revenue of its own top sellers. Pfizer's current
roster drugs that have lost patent protection amounts to $10
billion in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're committed to dramatically changing our established
products portfolio from a significantly shrinking segment of
the business to an engine of positive growth," Simmons said in
an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simmons previously told Reuters that Pfizer was seeking
licensing arrangements to expand the generics business. The
company expects more deals this year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the Aurobindo deal, Pfizer will gain rights to 38 pills
in the United States and 20 in Europe as well as an additional
11 in France. Pfizer declined to name the medicines, saying
they covered a broad range of therapy areas including
cardiovascular disease and central nervous system disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the United States, the pills will be sold through
Pfizer's Greenstone unit, which currently sells about 60-80
generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based Pfizer also acquired U.S. and European
rights to 12 injectable antibiotics, including penicillins and
cephalosporins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which has had about 18 injectable drugs in the
United States, has prioritized making licensing deals to expand
its injectables business, in which it believes there are
relatively few rivals and maintains it has a competitive cost
structure. Simmons previously said he wants a U.S. portfolio of
100 injectable drugs perhaps in five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement expands on a five-product U.S. deal entered
into in July 2008 with Aurobindo, with which Pfizer first
worked in 2006 through its animal health division, Simmons
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Going forward, we plan to expand our product portfolio
through additional activities with Aurobindo and other
companies as well," Simmons said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simmons said the deal involved strict quality controls,
including allowing Pfizer to have its employees in the
Aurobindo plant during production runs for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're focused on making sure any medicine that gets sold
with the Pfizer brand name on it is held to the same quality
standards as our original branded products," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts question whether generics fit well with
pharmaceutical companies that specialize in brand-name drugs,
partly because they are viewed as a lower-margin commodity
business. But Simmons said the profit margins from the deal and
future agreements would meet Pfizer's standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're not deteriorating Pfizer's margin standards because
we're going into the off-patent market," he said.

&lt;p&gt;Deals Broaden Pfizer`s Established Products Portfolio to Deliver Affordable
Quality Off Patent Medicines to Patients
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) announced today that it has entered into a series of
agreements with Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., a pharmaceutical company based in India,
to commercialize medicines that are no longer patent protected, and have lost
market exclusivity in the United States and Europe, further progressing its
Established Products Business Unit strategy. Pfizer`s Established Products
Business Unit, focused on the commercialization of products where market
exclusivity has been lost, was launched in 2008 as part of the Company`s
initiative to create smaller, more accountable business units aligned with
customer needs. Currently, Pfizer`s Established Products Business Unit has
annual sales of $10 billion globally. 

Under the terms of the agreements, Pfizer has acquired rights to 39 generic
solid oral dose products in the United States and 20 in Europe, plus an
additional 11 in France. These medicines cover a broad range of therapeutic
areas including cardiovascular disease and Central Nervous System disorders, and
will be commercialized in the U.S. through Pfizer`s Greenstone subsidiary. 

Pfizer has also acquired rights to 12 sterile injectable products in the United
States and Europe. These medicines are antibiotics including penicillins and
cephalosporins. 

"We will dramatically change Pfizer`s Established Products portfolio to an
engine of positive growth. These agreements represent solid, measurable
progress, and a strong commitment to achieve our growth objectives," said David
Simmons, president &amp; general manager of Pfizer`s Established Products Business
Unit. 

The global non-exclusive market represents about $270 billion with solid oral
dose products representing the largest drug category. This category is
anticipated to continue its rapid increase in market share and has an estimated
growth potential of over $500 billion within the next five years. 

"Established Products has the benefit of Pfizer`s strong brand recognition,
track record of proven efficacy and safety, broad and deep commercial
infrastructure around the world and a powerful portfolio. Going forward, Pfizer
plans to expand the Established Products Business Unit`s product portfolio
through additional activities with Aurobindo and other companies to provide our
customers with a wider product offering," said Mr. Simmons. 

These agreements are an expansion of a five-product U.S. deal Pfizer and
Aurobindo entered into in July 2008. Together, the two transactions bring 44
solid oral dose products to Pfizer`s diversified existing portfolio of
established brands in the U.S. 

Financial terms were not disclosed.

&lt;p&gt;Deals Broaden Pfizer`s Established Products Portfolio to Deliver Affordable
Quality Off Patent Medicines to Patients
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) announced today that it has entered into a series of
agreements with Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., a pharmaceutical company based in India,
to commercialize medicines that are no longer patent protected, and have lost
market exclusivity in the United States and Europe, further progressing its
Established Products Business Unit strategy. Pfizer`s Established Products
Business Unit, focused on the commercialization of products where market
exclusivity has been lost, was launched in 2008 as part of the Company`s
initiative to create smaller, more accountable business units aligned with
customer needs. Currently, Pfizer`s Established Products Business Unit has
annual sales of $10 billion globally. 

Under the terms of the agreements, Pfizer has acquired rights to 39 generic
solid oral dose products in the United States and 20 in Europe, plus an
additional 11 in France. These medicines cover a broad range of therapeutic
areas including cardiovascular disease and Central Nervous System disorders, and
will be commercialized in the U.S. through Pfizer`s Greenstone subsidiary. 

Pfizer has also acquired rights to 12 sterile injectable products in the United
States and Europe. These medicines are antibiotics including penicillins and
cephalosporins. 

"We will dramatically change Pfizer`s Established Products portfolio to an
engine of positive growth. These agreements represent solid, measurable
progress, and a strong commitment to achieve our growth objectives," said David
Simmons, president &amp; general manager of Pfizer`s Established Products Business
Unit. 

The global non-exclusive market represents about $270 billion with solid oral
dose products representing the largest drug category. This category is
anticipated to continue its rapid increase in market share and has an estimated
growth potential of over $500 billion within the next five years. 

"Established Products has the benefit of Pfizer`s strong brand recognition,
track record of proven efficacy and safety, broad and deep commercial
infrastructure around the world and a powerful portfolio. Going forward, Pfizer
plans to expand the Established Products Business Unit`s product portfolio
through additional activities with Aurobindo and other companies to provide our
customers with a wider product offering," said Mr. Simmons. 

These agreements are an expansion of a five-product U.S. deal Pfizer and
Aurobindo entered into in July 2008. Together, the two transactions bring 44
solid oral dose products to Pfizer`s diversified existing portfolio of
established brands in the U.S. 

Financial terms were not disclosed.

&lt;p&gt;March 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) generated $5
billion in profit during the worst year in Wall Street history
by trading over-the-counter fixed-income derivatives, Bloomberg
said, citing two people with knowledge of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank, which reported $5.6 billion of total profit in

municipal bond and foreign exchange derivatives group, the
agency said. The unit was among the most profitable at the New
York-based company, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The JPMorgan trading desk may have benefited as the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK and JPMorgan's
takeover of Bear Stearns Cos left companies and hedge funds with
fewer trading partners in the private derivatives markets, the
agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among commercial lenders, JPMorgan dominates OTC derivatives
trading, the agency said, citing data compiled by the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank held $87.7 trillion worth of outstanding OTC
contracts as of Sept. 30, more than the next two banks, Bank of
America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), combined, the
agency reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan could not be immediately reached by Reuters for
comment.

&lt;p&gt;AWS Management Console Now Also Supports Amazon EC2 in EU Region, Giving
Developers an Easy-to-Use, Web-Based Management Tool for Their EU-Based AWS
Solutions
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
Amazon Web Services LLC (AWS), a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN),
today launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) running Microsoft
Windows Server and Microsoft SQL Server in its EU Region, allowing customers to
access Windows-based compute resources for Europe and running on the reliable
and proven AWS cloud. Also starting today, the AWS Management Console will
provide support for Amazon EC2 in the EU enabling developers to manage their
Amazon EC2 resources in the EU Region using a simple, point-and-click web
interface. Launched in August of 2006, Amazon EC2 is the popular AWS service
that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud for businesses and
developers. To sign up for Amazon EC2 and other AWS services, go to
http://aws.amazon.com. 

Amazon EC2 running Microsoft Windows is a fast and dependable environment for
deploying applications using the Microsoft Web Platform, including ASP.NET,
AJAX, Silverlight, and Internet Information Server (IIS). Amazon EC2 also
supports the SQL Server Express and SQL Server Standard databases. With these
announcements, Amazon EC2 running Windows is now joining Linux/Unix-based Amazon
EC2 environments, the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon
CloudFront in the EU Region. As with all AWS services, Amazon EC2 running
Microsoft Windows is priced on a cost-effective, pay-as-you-go pricing model so
that customers pay only for the compute capacity that they use. 

Also announced today, the AWS Management Console now supports the Amazon EC2 EU
Region, allowing developers to start and stop Amazon EC2 instances, view and
perform actions on running instances, and manage Amazon Elastic Block Store
volumes with simple clicks of a mouse. The AWS Management Console provides a
quick, global picture of a developer`s cloud computing environment, giving them
an easy tool for managing their AWS cloud-based assets. 

"Many AWS customers have asked us for Amazon EC2 running Windows instances in
Europe," said Peter De Santis, General Manager of Amazon EC2. "Businesses and
developers can now access and manage all of their compute resources, whether
Windows-based or Linux/Unix-based, close to their European customers, partners,
and other computing services including Amazon S3." 

eXpansys PLC is a retailer of smartphones and handheld devices shipping over 1.5
million products to over 250,000 customers in over 125 different countries.
"eXpansys has been preparing to move our global ecommerce infrastructure to
Amazon EC2, a move that we forecast will halve our operating costs and almost
eliminate IT capital expenditure," said Matt Kydd, CTO of eXpansys. "With the
expansion of Amazon EC2 running Microsoft Windows, we are able to launch
immediately." 

"Our European clients with Windows-based services will now recognise that Amazon
has eradicated one of the last barriers to cloud adoption. Amazon EC2 running
Windows adds to the already compelling benefits of speed, flexibility, and
cost-reduction when moving to our European Amazon-based service," said Karl
Deacon, CTO Capgemini Outsourcing UK. 

Since 2003, Folk, a creative agency in the UK, has been delivering award-winning
solutions from the worlds of design, online, advertising, publishing, gaming,
brand development, film production, television and music. "With the launch of
EC2 running Windows for Europe, we can use Amazon Web Services to launch a video
based media system running completely in the cloud," said Simon Jenkinson,
Interactive Director at Folk. "AWS is scalable, cost-effective, fast, reliable
and is by far the best of the cloud-based solutions in the market. It`s made my
job a whole lot easier, which is all we developers really want!" 

About Amazon EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (http://aws.amazon.com/ec2) is a web service that
provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2's simple web
service interface allows businesses to obtain and configure capacity with
minimal friction. It provides complete control of your computing resources and
lets you run on Amazon's proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the
time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you
to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements
change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay
only for capacity that you actually use.

&lt;p&gt;Effort Supports the Growth of Community Weatherization Programs
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and the National Community Action Foundation
announced today a new partnership to enhance training programs for the tens of
thousands of new workers required to meet the needs of rapidly growing
weatherization programs around the country. 

ExxonMobil will donate $5 million to the Foundation to support projects that
will expand the scale and scope of existing training programs so workers are
well-prepared for sustainable careers in the growing fields of energy efficiency
and weatherization. ExxonMobil`s grant is the largest ever private contribution
to community organizations that work with the Department of Energy`s

efficiency and expanding career opportunities for American workers." 

The Foundation will establish a competitive grant program to finance innovative
projects that will significantly expand the capacity of weatherization training
programs funded through the Weatherization Assistance Program. 

The recently passed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act increases funding for
the Weatherization Assistance Program. This program, implemented by 900 local
community agencies represented by the Foundation, enables low-income Americans
to reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient. 

"Our partnership with ExxonMobil will allow us to leverage the best thinking and
most innovative approaches in weatherization training to create a weatherization
workforce for the 21st century," said David Bradley, executive director of the
Foundation, which works with the Department of Energy, state weatherization
offices and community based organizations that deliver weatherization services
and train workers. 

"Through enhanced training programs, we can prepare workers for new skills and
careers while helping families use less energy and save money."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Mar 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that IDC, a leading IT market research
and advisory firm, reported that for Q3'08, IBM was the number-one tape
product vendor in the world, based on branded tape revenue (1). Overall,
IBM captured 35.8 percent share of the total branded tape revenue global
market for Q3'08.

    The IDC report -- "IDC Branded Tape Vendor Analysis Q3CY08" -- marks the
twenty-second consecutive quarter that IBM has held the number-one
position in worldwide branded total tape revenue. IBM was also the
number-one vendor for branded tape revenue share for enterprise tape
drives and enterprise tape libraries.

    "Delivering a tiered storage architecture for our clients forms the
foundation of the company's Information Infrastructure solutions," said
Cindy Grossman, IBM vice president of tape and archive storage systems.
For nearly six straight years, IBM has led the branded tape market,
because IBM's tape system and tape virtualization offerings help address
customers' needs, including long-term data retention, data protection,
data security, energy consumption and total cost of ownership."

    About IBM's System Storage Tape Leadership

    IBM continues to deliver leading tape and archiving solutions to help
clients with their Information Infrastructure needs. In the fourth
quarter, the company introduced the IBM System Storage TS3500 Tape Library
High Density Storage Frames models S24 and S54, which offer up to three
times the capacity of existing frames in the same footprint. As companies
seek more energy-efficient options for long-term archive, the TS3500 also
reduces downtime during capacity upgrades, and allows for the archiving of
data at rest, while helping to minimize power and cooling costs.

    The IBM TS1130 enterprise tape drive and the IBM TS3500 tape library are
also two of the products helping IBM's overall tape leadership. The TS1130
provides one terabyte of uncompressed cartridge capacity and up to 3.6
terabytes per hour of backup capability, while the TS3500 tape library
high-density frames can store up to one petabyte of uncompressed capacity
in ten square feet of floor space, helping clients reduce their overall
total cost of ownership.

    "Conserving resources like precious floor space while still maintaining
access to critical data is a key objective of our data storage strategy.
IBM's high density TS3500 tape storage frames help us do just that," said
Vladimir Bahyl, tape service manager of CERN, the European Organization
for Nuclear Research. "With the use of the IBM's TS1130 high-speed tape
drives we can store up to one petabyte per high density frame,
dramatically consolidating our storage environment."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on
Wednesday said it may cut its ratings on Wells Fargo  Co
(WFC.N) and changed its outlook on JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
to negative, from stable, indicating it is more likely to be
cut over the next one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Moody's currently rates both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan
"Aa3," its fourth highest investment grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The review on Wells Fargo "was prompted by a concern that
Wells Fargo's capital ratios could deteriorate in 2009 from
their current levels, which are comparatively low, because of
the potential need to take high loan loss provisions in 2009,"
Moody's said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's low capital ratios "result from the fact that
the equity Wells Fargo raised for its purchase of Wachovia was,
in Moody's view, modest in comparison to the amount and quality
of the acquired Wachovia assets," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capital generation at the bank may be constrained as Wells
Fargo will need to record provisions and merger-related
expenses in 2009 and 2010 against assets at Wachovia that were
not marked down on Dec. 31, 2008, Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The review for possible downgrade is expected to be
completed by the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's outlook was revised to negative, meanwhile, on
concerns the bank's results will be "saddled by sustained high
provisions and credit costs for the coming four to six
quarters, due to increasing financial strains for U.S.
consumers and the global recession," Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As a result, JPMorgan's capital generation could be modest
at best," the credit ratings agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cost to insure the debt of JPMorgan with credit default
swaps rose 10 basis points on Wednesday to around 190 basis
points, or $190,000 per year for five years to insure $10
million in debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo's credit default swap spreads also widened 10
basis points to 255 basis points.

&lt;p&gt;  ANAHEIM, CA, Mar 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The NAMM Foundation and Disney Channel today announced the recipients of
"Disney's High School Musical: The Music in You Grant Program" that
encourages middle and high schools across the U.S. to put on their own
school stage production of Disney's "High School Musical."

    This is the second year that the two organizations have teamed to support
this public affairs initiative, which is designed to utilize the
popularity of the "High School Musical" movies to encourage kids to get
involved in music and the arts in school.

    The ten grant award winners are:


--  Brooklyn Theater Arts High School, Brooklyn, NY
--  Bucyrus High School, Bucyrus, OH
--  Carver Edisto Middle School, Cope, SC
--  Mt. Zion High School, Jonesboro, GA
--  Mather High School, Chicago, IL
--  Necedah High School, Necedah, WI
--  Parkway Middle School, Kissimmee, FL
--  Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI
--  South Dade Middle School, Homestead, FL
--  Troy Middle School, Plainfield, IL
    

    
The grant program supports a $5,000 monetary grant and school license
to produce an adapted version of "High School Musical." The funds are to
support music and arts-related educational costs of the production such as
hiring music and dance coaches, and to help schools that do not have
sufficient lighting and sound equipment for the production.

    "For the NAMM Foundation, the collaboration with the Disney Channel
creates a wonderful opportunity for kids to be involved in music and the
arts -- activities that are subject to budget cuts in public schools
across the United States," said Mary Luehrsen, executive director of the
NAMM Foundation. "Participating in theatrical productions like these can
be life-changing experiences for young people."

    In 2007, the NAMM Foundation and Disney Channel teamed up to create
projects supporting the public affairs initiative, which included "High
School Musical: The Music in You," a "documusical" that chronicled a
school theater production of "High School Musical" in Fort Worth, Texas.
Additional joint initiatives were "The Music in You" micro Web site
featuring interactive music and arts activities; public service
announcements encouraging students to get involved in music and arts and
communities to invest in more performing arts opportunities for kids; and
a series of interstitials illustrating students involvement in the arts as
part of their core curriculum. The interstitials were presented on Disney
Channel, DisneyChannel.com and Radio Disney.

    "We want to thank and applaud all of the schools that applied for the
grant program," said Adam Sanderson, senior vice president, Brand
Marketing, Disney ABC Networks Group. "We applaud their continued support
for music and arts education activities, which allow kids to express
their talent, imagination and creativity."

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
General Electric's (NYSE: GE) recent dividend cut has done little to bolster
faith in the company's credit-worthiness. In fact, UBS Investment Research said
in a note late yesterday that GE could still be hit with a credit-rating
downgrade despite last week's dividend cut. According to the brokerage firm,
GE's financial arm, GE Capital, is still undercapitalized and should see more
losses from its real estate assets. 

While options traders had recently expressed a preference for calls, the
speculative group has shifted back to a bearish stance given today's heavy put
volume. Specifically, a whopping 291,917 puts have changed hands so far today,
more than quintupling the stock's daily average. Naturally, GE has made an
appearance in our Intraday Volume Explosion List. While the March 5 put has seen
the lion's share of today's volume, with more than 101,434 contracts trading,
the March 6 strike has attracted some 50,000 contracts on no open interest.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase announced today that it strongly supports the Administration`s
mortgage modification program, as detailed today. 

"This builds on the efforts we have already implemented and extends them to more
struggling homeowners and provides us and other servicers more options to keep
families in their homes," said Jamie Dimon, Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co. "The plan appropriately balances the interest of homeowners,
mortgage servicers and investors. As a result, more families will be helped with
long-term and sustainable solutions through a consistent process, including a
verification of income." 

We support the program because:

* The guidelines establish a clear, fair and consistent set of standards for all
servicers to follow. 
* It is intended for the right borrowers: those with mortgages below $729,750. 
* All borrowers must fully document their income. 
* All borrowers must clearly demonstrate financial hardship. 
* It covers verified owner-occupied homes only. 
* The owners of the mortgages will be confident that servicers will follow
owners` best economic interests in making modifications.

"JPMorgan Chase believes that this program, along with the fiscal stimulus plan
and the TALF program, are all strong steps to improve both the economy and the
financial system and to help those who are deserving and in need of assistance,"
Dimon said. 

"There is no silver bullet," he said. "The thoughtful and rapid roll-out of
various programs is the only intelligent way to begin to solve these problems.
These mortgage modifications are economically and morally the right thing to do
for individual customers. It is the respectful way in which we all would want to
be treated. We will work hard to incorporate the new criteria into our own loan
modification process to quickly help customers, and we urge all to participate
in this plan as soon as possible." 

"This program maintains the essential principle that individuals, businesses and
corporations should pay their loans if they can afford to do so," Dimon said.
"We believe this program`s completeness eliminates the need for judicial
modification in bankruptcy, but if legislated, judicial modifications should be
consistent with this plan and only for borrowers who couldn`t qualify or were
not offered a modification." 

"Extraordinary times need extraordinary measures. It is time to implement this
program - even if it`s not perfect in everyone`s view - and move on," Dimon
said.

&lt;p&gt;Based in Taiwan, Technology Will Serve as a New Business Model
DENVER &amp; ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
IBM, Enterprise Information Management Inc. (EIM), C-Lock Technology, Inc.
(C-Lock), a subsidiary of Evergreen Energy Inc. (NYSE Arca: EEE) and Foxconn/Hon
Hai Technology Group today announced a global agreement to jointly deliver and
deploy GreenCert, the world`s first enterprise content management system that
can accurately calculate and certify the amount of greenhouse gas emissions
produced by a facility. 

As part of the announcement, which took place in Tucheng, Taiwan, Foxconn and
IBM will together bring the GreenCert technology to Taiwan, where it will serve
as a new business model and an exclusive distribution source of GreenCert for
the Asia Pacific region to promote energy saving, carbon reduction and other
green energy opportunities. 

Today`s announcement marks the first time that GreenCert technology will be
available in the Asia Pacific region. GreenCert is an information technology
solution for environmental protection and energy production developed originally
in the United States by IBM and its Business Partners, EIM and C-Lock. The
solution combines technology from the IBM industry-leading software portfolio
that includes WebSphere, DB2, Lotus, Tivoli and Rational. 

In addition to calculating carbon emissions, GreenCert provides instant data
analysis and test reports that allow customers to use it as a base for carbon
trading. Foxconn will make a significant investment leveraging IBM software and
hardware technology to enable this analysis and management. At Kaohsiung
Software Park, they will recruit several hundred software engineers with special
industry skills to help make the GreenCert technology system meet the specific
needs of different Asian industries. Additionally, it will help enterprises in
the Asia Pacific region realize their social responsibilities toward energy
saving and carbon emissions reduction. 

As the carbon trading market continues to gain strength, GreenCert is widely
regarded as a driving force in saving energy and reducing carbon emissions. It
is an important application for enterprises in industries such as power,
petrochemicals, iron and steel and other energy businesses that attach great
importance to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. 

The Kyoto Protocol promotes carbon trading as a key means of reducing worldwide
emissions. Under the framework established by the Protocol, the amount of carbon
emissions produced by a company will become a price tagged commodity to be
traded on world markets under international law. This provision of the Protocol
has proven to be very popular and, in fact, the World Bank`s "State and Trends
of the Carbon Market 2007," pointed out that the use of carbon trading to
encourage reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has become the most important
international policy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 

"As part of this announcement, Foxconn will employ a large number of software
engineers at the Kaohsiung Software Park to cultivate the talent needed to meet
the increasing demand for environmental and energy saving technologies, and to
deal with the global warming threat," said Terry Gou, chairman of Foxconn. "As
the most preferred partner to all aspects of contract manufacturing, Foxconn
firmly believes it is our duty to take action to help save energy, share our
experience in reducing carbon dioxide and recycle." 

"Our clients have identified a great need for accurate measurements in carbon
trading. To meet this demand, IBM worked closely with EIM and C-Lock to develop
GreenCert, which replaces manual calculation with computational technology. This
can help enterprises collect pollutant emission data and allow them to conduct
carbon trading and follow environment protection rules in their countries," said
Mark Easton, vice president of IBM software sales. "Partnering with an
environmentally conscious company like Foxconn in such a strategic way greatly
enhances GreenCert`s ability to help enterprises in Asia Pacific reduce
greenhouse gases."

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Mar 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Cast Iron Systems, the #1 SaaS and Cloud integration company, today
announced that Simon Peel, Cast Iron's Senior Vice President of Strategy,
is presenting in a panel session entitled Selling SaaS to the Enterprise
at 1:55 pm, Thursday, March 12th, at OpSource SaaS Summit 2009, which is
being held March 11th through 13th at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in San
Francisco. The session will showcase successful strategies for SaaS
vendors and Cloud providers to offer solutions to enterprise customers.
Mr. Peel will focus on the core issue of integration that is emerging as
one of the top issues to be addressed as Cloud infrastructure and SaaS
applications evolve. He will reveal how Cast Iron has used the innovative
Powered By Cast Iron(TM) program to successfully enable providers to
address these issues quickly.

    According to Mr. Peel, "By accelerating IT's ability to deliver new
solutions without requiring an investment in new hardware, personnel, or
software, Cloud computing addresses the two conflicting challenges faced
by enterprise IT today -- cutting costs and delivering rapid innovation.
The true value of Cloud computing is fully realized when on- and
off-premise business processes and the associated applications are
seamlessly integrated."

    Powered By Cast Iron(TM), a comprehensive program uniquely designed for
SaaS providers, solves the challenges of selling SaaS into the enterprise
by combining leading products, proven services methodologies, and
customized sales and marketing strategies. The program eliminates the
need for SaaS vendors, VARs, SIs, and OEMs to develop and maintain their
own integration solutions and gives them everything they need to deliver
low-risk, high-reward Integration as a Service (IaaS) to their customers.

    "SaaS Summit 2009 stands out from other SaaS conferences because of its
uniquely compelling content and the unmatched quality of its networking
possibilities," added Mr. Peel. "If you are -- or want to be -- a player
in the cloud space, this is the one conference you should attend this
year."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - Media group Walt Disney Co
(DIS.N) is bringing together its operations in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa under the management of its Latin America
director Diego Lerner, it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lerner will oversee all Disney's business in EMEA -- which

-- excluding the Disneyland Paris theme park and the ESPN sports
network, Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under Lerner, Latin America was the first region in which
Disney integrated all its divisions. Lerner created new
businesses in the region including pay-TV operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Expansion in international markets is a key strategic
priority for Disney, and Diego's proven ability to nurture and
grow Disney's businesses makes him an ideal choice for this new
position," said Walt Disney International Chairman Andy Bird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lerner will report to Bird and be based in London. His
appointment will take immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He will also remain president of Disney Latin America, but
day-to-day business in that region will be handled by Claudio
Chiaromonte as chief operating officer and finance chief.

&lt;p&gt;Harwood Feffer LLP Files Class Action On Behalf of Purchasers of General
Electric Common Stock After the Announcement of Maintaining Its Dividend -- GE

NEW YORK, March 4, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Harwood Feffer LLP
announces that it filed a class action lawsuit on March 3, 2009 on behalf of
purchasers of the common stock of General Electric Company (the "Company")
(NYSE:GE) during the period January 23, 2009 through February 27, 2009,
inclusive (the "Class Period"). Shareholders may obtain a copy of the complaint
by calling our offices or emailing us at the e-mail addresses listed below. The
action is pending in United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York.

The complaint alleges that on January 23, 2009, the Company's Chairman and CEO,
Jeffrey Immelt, stated unequivocally that GE would maintain its quarterly $.31
per share dividend, having sufficient cash on hand and cash flow to achieve that
goal. Then on February 27, 2009, GE suddenly announced it was cutting the
dividend to $.10 per share. On the first trading day after the dividend
reduction announcement, GE shares fell from $8.51 per share the previous trading
day to close at $7.60 per share. The shares have continued to plummet, currently
trading at $6.30 per share, an almost 30% plunge. During the Class Period, Mr.
Immelt sold over 52,000 shares of GE stock at $11.10 per share and other
officers of the Company sold over 380,000 shares at that same price. Mr. Immelt
then repurchased 50,000 shares after the announcement at between $7.51 and $8.30
per share. As a result, Mr. Immelt and the other officers violated Sections
10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by issuing false and
misleading statements or knowingly or recklessly failing to know of those
statements, sold GE shares at inflated prices based on those statements.

If you bought GE stock from January 23, 2009 through February 27, 2009, no later
than May 2, 2009, you may move the court to appoint you as lead plaintiff, a
representative party that acts on behalf of other class members. The court must
determine whether the class member's claim is typical of other members' claims,
and whether the class member will adequately represent the class. Your ability
to recover is not, however, affected by your decision whether or not to serve as
a lead plaintiff.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Mar 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) is making it easier for widely dispersed businesspeople
to interact and collaborate without the time and expense of in-person
meetings.

    What is making all this possible is the marriage between "virtual world"
Web sites, and "unified communications and collaboration tools" --
technology that links such things as voicemail, audible chat, and instant
messaging. Virtual worlds are interactive, immersive Web sites with
three-dimensional graphics. There, people are represented by versions of
themselves, called avatars. With origins in multi-player gaming sites,
virtual worlds re-create the social and visual dynamics and cues of human
interaction, and are now increasingly used in business settings.

    IBM is now allowing selected clients test Sametime 3D, a new tool which
will let business colleagues not only exchange instant messages and chat
verbally, but also share presentations and ideas in private,
prefabricated, reusable meeting spaces located in a variety of virtual
worlds. These spaces will allow participants to, literally, throw ideas
on the wall during a meeting to "see what sticks," and to vote on,
organize, and save the most promising proposals. Avatars can make
presentations to one another, socialize, debate, or, literally, examine
ideas and 3D objects from all angles.

    IBM's new software enables groups based in different locations to meet on
a regular, periodic or impromptu basis in these virtual worlds. With this
new software tool, IBM is providing several reusable meeting spaces,
including a theater-style amphitheatre, a boardroom and a collaboration
space which can each be used for impromptu or scheduled brainstorming
sessions, status updates, town hall-style meetings, rehearsals, training
classes, and more.

    "This project is part of IBM's ongoing work to redefine the nature of
online meetings," said Colin Parris, IBM's Vice President for Industry
Solutions and Emerging Business. "The work that takes place during a
meeting is hard enough; people shouldn't have to struggle with logistics.
Whether through improvements to Web conferencing capabilities or with
special offerings such as Sametime 3D, IBM is offering new ways to engage
and collaborate, making meetings more effective and productive."

    The new software overcomes several challenges that have existed for
businesses wishing to hold meetings in virtual worlds: First, businesses
can collaborate the way in which they are accustomed, using software they
may already have, such as electronic presentations, enterprise security,
and instant messaging tools. Second, IBM has prefabricated a variety of
re-useable spaces specifically designed for productive meetings, making it
unnecessary for adopters to painstakingly build meeting rooms each time
they want to meet. Third, these spaces are secure, overcoming privacy
concerns manifest in many public areas of popular virtual worlds. And
finally, colleagues not wishing to participate in a given virtual meeting
can still view documents, presentations and results from those sessions --
or even snapshots of a previous meeting.

    In the future, the software will provide a variety of ways for
participants to circulate reports to one another that document the
meetings' progress. IBM will also make it easier for users to chat
verbally and exchange information generated by and for virtual meetings,
with traditional computer software already installed on their computers
and servers.

    Selected IBM clients and business partners are now being invited to work
with IBM's Lotus Services organization to test this new software. The
solution, which may be available by the second half of 2009, uses version
8.0 of IBM Lotus Sametime, and a plug-in designed by IBM Research for
virtual worlds. When the software is developed fully, clients will be able
to use it to connect any number of virtual worlds, such as OpenSim or
Second Life. A demonstration of the software's capabilities is available
at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfqGwKFStuw

    IBM is in the forefront in exploring virtual worlds. Hundreds of IBM
researchers, consultants, and developers are developing and providing new
ways of learning, collaborating and doing business in virtual worlds. IBM
is helping clients to develop their virtual world strategies, and is
providing them with solutions and services that enable adopters to better
collaborate. In addition, IBM is leading an initiative to help improve
compatibility between disparate virtual worlds. Internally, IBM uses
virtual worlds to conduct research, host events, and to acclimate new
employees.

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA, March 4 (Reuters) - Colombia extradited one of its most-wanted drug lords to the United States on Wednesday to face charges of running an armed cocaine-smuggling gang with his twin brother, police said. Ex-paramilitary leader Miguel Angel Mejia Munera was handcuffed and wearing a bullet-proof before he boarded a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) plane in Bogota bound for the United States, which had offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. With all the necessary procedures completed, Miguel Angel Mejia Munera was carried on a DEA plane to the United States, Colombian police said in a statement. Mejia, 49, had been held in a high-security prison in Colombia since his arrest last May. He is expected to be charged with drug trafficking and money laundering after his arrival in Miami. The U.S. State Department says he and his brother, Victor, shipped at least 68 tonnes of cocaine to the United States and Europe over a two-year period before their network was broken up in 2003. Victor Mejia was killed in a shootout with police days before his brother, known as The Twin, was found in a secret compartment of a truck headed to Bogota. The brothers were leaders of far-right militias embroiled in a four-decade-old armed conflict in the world's top cocaine producer. They helped negotiate a controversial peace deal with President Alvaro Uribe starting in 2003 but refused to surrender after the talks and instead set up a cocaine smuggling network staffed by demobilized militia members. Paramilitary groups formed in the 1980s to help wealthy Colombians fight left-wing rebels. They also massacred civilians, trafficked cocaine and seized farmland in the name of the counter-insurgency. Since Uribe took office in 2002, he has led a U.S.-funded military crackdown and extradited more than 700 Colombians. But the South American nation still produces at least 600 tonnes of cocaine a year, most of which is sold on the streets of the United States and Europe.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - Global services and
manufacturing activity contracted even faster in February and
data suggests the first quarter of 2009 may be as bad as the end
of 2008, JP Morgan said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Global Total Output Index, produced by JP Morgan with
research and supply management organisations, fell to 38.4 in
February from 40.3 in January, well below the 50.0 mark that
divides growth from contraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fallback in the headline activity index raises the
possibility of the global downturn remaining as deep in Q1 2009
as the sharp decline in GDP seen at the end of last year," said
David Hensley, a director at JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The global service sector indicator remained in negative
territory for the ninth consecutive month, sinking to 39.8 in
February from 43.0 the month before, as rates of contraction
accelerated in the U.S., the euro zone and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier on Wednesday the ISM index covering the U.S.
non-manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 80 percent of
U.S. economic activity, showed the sector shrank further in
February, but by less than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 16-nation euro zone's dominant service sector sank still
deeper into recession during February as new business levels
plummeted and firms slashed jobs, but in China and the UK it may
have hit the bottom, earlier data suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The index combines data from countries including the United
States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Mozilla Firefox 3 overtook Microsoft`s Internet Explorer 6 for the first time in
February in the Internet browser wars according to monthly data from StatCounter
Global Stats (http://gs.statcounter.com) - the new free analysis tool. Internet
Explorer 7 continues to lead globally with 41% market share. However, Firefox 3
is now in second place with 24% replacing IE 6. 

"Since its launch less than a year ago, Firefox 3 has attained nearly one
quarter of the global market," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO and founder,
StatCounter. "IE 7 is consistently holding about 40% of the global market but IE
6 has fallen from 28% in July last to 22% in February this year."* The growth in
usage of Firefox 3 can be partly attributed to users upgrading to the new
version - Firefox 2 market share has fallen from 16% to 3% in the period. 

Microsoft`s combined IE 7 and IE 6 market share has fallen from 68% in July last
year to 63% now. IE 8 has gained a toehold in the market of just over 1%.
Firefox 3 and 2 has grown from 25% in July last to 27% in February `09. "The
overall trend is what is interesting here," added Aodhan Cullen. 

The StatCounter analysis is based on four billion pageloads per month.
StatCounter is one of the largest website traffic monitoring companies in the
world with over two million members globally. Over 40% are located in the US
with 25% in Europe.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 for Government Contractors to be Introduced at
Microsoft Technology Innovation Center in Reston on March 19
RESTON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Pleasant Valley Business Solutions (PVBS) announced today that it has been
selected by Microsoft to launch the new Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 for
Government Contractors at the Microsoft Technology Innovation Center in Reston
on March 19. Microsoft is launching the new version of its flagship Dynamics NAV
product line in over 30 cities across the United States in February and March.
PVBS was selected to roll out the solution to companies that provide services or
sell products to the Federal Government. This represents Microsoft`s biggest
Dynamics product launch in years. 

Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 for Government Contractors is Defense Contract Audit
Agency (DCAA) compliant and helps companies that provide services and/or sell
products to the Federal Government streamline their project accounting, ERP, and
financial management business processes. 

The product launch will happen on Thursday, March 19 at 11:30am at the Microsoft
Technology Innovation Center in Reston. In addition to an extensive overview and
demonstration of Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 for Government Contractors, the
event will also feature a panel discussion with government contractor
professionals that use the solution to run their companies. The event is open to
all government contractors in the Mid-Atlantic region however pre-registration
is required. To register, please go to http://www.pvbs.net/pvbsevents.htm. Lunch
will be served at the product launch. 

PVBS is a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner that supplies Microsoft Dynamics NAV
to government contractors and product resellers. Customers include fast-growing
companies such as Management Consulting (MANCON) out of Virginia Beach and Force
3 (Crofton, MD). Another customer, Progeny Systems (Manassas, VA), recently
announced that it has already purchased Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009. "We could
see how easily it could be shaped to our specific needs," said Progeny Systems
Chief Financial Officer Alexander Kot. "Pleasant Valley showed us how easy it is
to customize the system, even on the fly." 

David Willis, vice president for the US Dynamics business at Microsoft, said,
"Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 enables companies that provide services and sell
products to the government to more effectively link their services and product
sales businesses all from within one comprehensive application, which helps them
integrate their data, simplify their processes and better service their
government customer. What they'll see at the March 19 product launch is
something that has not been available to them before." 

For government contractors, Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 supports compliance for
indirect rates and billing rates, with the flexibility to support various cost
structures and differing contract billing scenarios, such as time and materials,
cost-plus with incentives, and reward fees. For government resellers, the
solution supports the complete sales process. It is the only solution on the
market that supports companies that sell products and/or provide services to the
Government. 

Features that government contractors and product resellers will find
particularly valuable include:

* More self-service reporting and business intelligence capabilities that reduce
ad-hoc requests to the IT department for reports and information. 
* Utilize Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services to export to Excel for further
analysis and graphical presentation. 
* Accelerate business insight and expand the value of business data even further
by combining Microsoft Dynamics NAV with Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services
and SQL Server Analysis Services. 
* Online access to real-time data, reports, and collaboration tools with
Employee Portal in Microsoft Dynamics NAV, a Web-based interface built on
Windows SharePoint Services. 
* Unleash the power to communicate and collaborate effectively and optimize your
technology investments through deep integration with the Microsoft Office
system, including Excel, and Windows SharePoint Services.

Bernard Mustafa, CEO and President at PVBS said, "Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2009 is
a comprehensive business management solution that helps people throughout the
government contractor organization work faster, smarter, and more productively.
For example, the new Role Centers are an integral part of Dynamics NAV 2009 and
provide access to relevant information, tasks, and business processes in a
single overview for company executives, project managers, finance and accounting
professionals, and business development people."

&lt;p&gt;Leading experts will gather in Brussels on the 27th and 28th of May to discuss
upcoming changes to anti-corruption legislation.


BRUSSELS--(Business Wire)--
Legislation on anti-corruption is changing rapidly, and 2009 promises to be a
transformative year. With an increasing amount of new laws, an explosion in
regulation following the financial crisis, and stricter enforcement of acts like
FCPA and legislation resulting from the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, compliance
with the legislative framework as a global business is becoming a real
challenge. 

Whilst enforcement of anti-corruption legislation like the Anti-Bribery
Convention is far from perfect, governments are improving year on year. Germany
brought 43 cases to trial in 2008, compared to just 4 in 2007. France increased
its tally from 9 to 19. With previous outsiders coming in from the cold (Russia
has recently ratified the Council of Europe`s Criminal Law Convention), business
is under increasing pressure to comply with the growing number of
anti-corruption laws in place in Europe, and deal with more and more regulatory
risk. 

On the 27th and 28th May in Brussels, senior figures from government, from
enforcement bodies and from multi-national corporations will gather to debate
the most pressing issues in anti-corruption legislation. Companies contributing
to the discussion include General Electric, TNT, Siemens, Vodafone and Thales. 

Mark Pieth, Chairman of the OECD Working Group on Bribery will discuss how to
bring the public and private sector agendas together. Mathias Korte, head of the
Legislative Department of the German Ministry of Justice, will debate national
enforcement and how the EU`s biggest economies are tackling corruption. 

Other topics to be investigated over the two days include the future of FCPA;
bridging the public-private divide, and how to report on bribery and corruption
issues.

&lt;p&gt;Based in Taiwan, Technology Will Serve as a New Business Model
DENVER &amp; ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
IBM, Enterprise Information Management Inc. (EIM), C-Lock Technology, Inc.
(C-Lock), a subsidiary of Evergreen Energy Inc. (NYSE Arca: EEE) and Foxconn/Hon
Hai Technology Group today announced a global agreement to jointly deliver and
deploy GreenCert, the world`s first enterprise content management system that
can accurately calculate and certify the amount of greenhouse gas emissions
produced by a facility. 

As part of the announcement, which took place in Tucheng, Taiwan, Foxconn and
IBM will together bring the GreenCert technology to Taiwan, where it will serve
as a new business model and an exclusive distribution source of GreenCert for
the Asia Pacific region to promote energy saving, carbon reduction and other
green energy opportunities. 

Today`s announcement marks the first time that GreenCert technology will be
available in the Asia Pacific region. GreenCert is an information technology
solution for environmental protection and energy production developed originally
in the United States by IBM and its Business Partners, EIM and C-Lock. The
solution combines technology from the IBM industry-leading software portfolio
that includes WebSphere, DB2, Lotus, Tivoli and Rational. 

In addition to calculating carbon emissions, GreenCert provides instant data
analysis and test reports that allow customers to use it as a base for carbon
trading. Foxconn will make a significant investment leveraging IBM software and
hardware technology to enable this analysis and management. At Kaohsiung
Software Park, they will recruit several hundred software engineers with special
industry skills to help make the GreenCert technology system meet the specific
needs of different Asian industries. Additionally, it will help enterprises in
the Asia Pacific region realize their social responsibilities toward energy
saving and carbon emissions reduction. 

As the carbon trading market continues to gain strength, GreenCert is widely
regarded as a driving force in saving energy and reducing carbon emissions. It
is an important application for enterprises in industries such as power,
petrochemicals, iron and steel and other energy businesses that attach great
importance to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. 

The Kyoto Protocol promotes carbon trading as a key means of reducing worldwide
emissions. Under the framework established by the Protocol, the amount of carbon
emissions produced by a company will become a price tagged commodity to be
traded on world markets under international law. This provision of the Protocol
has proven to be very popular and, in fact, the World Bank`s "State and Trends
of the Carbon Market 2007," pointed out that the use of carbon trading to
encourage reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has become the most important
international policy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 

"As part of this announcement, Foxconn will employ a large number of software
engineers at the Kaohsiung Software Park to cultivate the talent needed to meet
the increasing demand for environmental and energy saving technologies, and to
deal with the global warming threat," said Terry Gou, chairman of Foxconn. "As
the most preferred partner to all aspects of contract manufacturing, Foxconn
firmly believes it is our duty to take action to help save energy, share our
experience in reducing carbon dioxide and recycle." 

"Our clients have identified a great need for accurate measurements in carbon
trading. To meet this demand, IBM worked closely with EIM and C-Lock to develop
GreenCert, which replaces manual calculation with computational technology. This
can help enterprises collect pollutant emission data and allow them to conduct
carbon trading and follow environment protection rules in their countries," said
Mark Easton, vice president of IBM software sales. "Partnering with an
environmentally conscious company like Foxconn in such a strategic way greatly
enhances GreenCert`s ability to help enterprises in Asia Pacific reduce
greenhouse gases."

&lt;p&gt;  HANNOVER, GERMANY, Mar 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CeBIT (Hall 12, Stand B49) -- APC by Schneider Electric, a global leader
in integrated critical power and cooling services, today announced a
software integration initiative that will enable APC's data center
management suite to tightly couple with Microsoft's System Center
Operations Manager 2007. This integration will give data center managers
the ability to view and manage physical infrastructure, including power,
cooling, physical space and security, as well as providing a comprehensive
view of the health of servers, applications, and clients within the
datacenter.

    "IT services are further developing into a complex combination of people,
processes, and technology, and we are looking forward to working with
Microsoft to provide our mutual customers with the necessary tools to
enable a sound IT and physical infrastructure," said John DiPippo, senior
vice president, Data Center Solutions, Services, and Software, APC.
"Integrating APC's data center management suite with Microsoft's System
Center Operations Manager will allow datacenter managers to not only
understand the needs of an IT environment, but how the physical
infrastructure can support those needs."

    APC's comprehensive Data Center Physical Infrastructure Management Suite,
including InfraStruXure(R) Central, Change Manager and Capacity Manager,
consists of design, operations and monitoring capabilities providing
comprehensive management for power, cooling, security and space. APC's
InfraStruXure Central supports multi-vendor physical infrastructure
equipment, allowing for the consolidation of detailed information of all
the physical devices in this one monitoring application. APC's Change
Manager provides inventory management and workflow tools to enable
datacenter operators to map the IT and physical infrastructure equipment
that is located within the data center. When combined with Capacity
Manager, these applications provide data center operators the ability to
perform predictive simulation and modeling of the physical infrastructure
-- evaluating 'what-if' scenarios before they occur.

    Microsoft's System Center Operation Manager provides a management solution
addressing end-to-end service monitoring in the enterprise IT environment.
A comprehensive view of service health is key to business continuity and
delivering an agile, rapid response to events that may impact the normal
running of business and ultimately cost an enterprise money.

    "Microsoft System Center delivers comprehensive, integrated, cost
effective management capabilities across the enterprise while enabling
customers to also have deep insight into their physical and virtualized IT
infrastructure through Operations Manager 2007," said JD Marymee, Director
of Strategic Partner Alliances, Management and Services Division,
Microsoft. "We are pleased to work with APC to provide our mutual
customers with the capabilities to extend System Center Operations Manager
monitoring capabilities throughout their complex IT environments through
integration with APC's comprehensive Data Center Physical Infrastructure
Management Suite."

    Together APC's data center management suite and Microsoft's System Center
Operations Manager solution will share key data points, including alarm
notifications and historical data on the targeted server deployment
environment. In addition, it provides a comprehensive look at how the
physical and IT environments operate independently and influence each
other, providing critical operating information on power and cooling
capacity. Linking these two management suites will allow datacenter
managers to better visualize the data center, deploy new technologies and
services and the physical infrastructure to support them.

    In the first release, APC expects that customers will have access to the
integrated APC InfraStruXure Central and Microsoft's System Center
Operations Manager solution worldwide in Q1 2009. Today, clients can
contact APC and Microsoft to start the process of evaluating their current
facilities and data center strategy to better manage and control their
energy consumption and costs. To learn more about APC's data center
management suite and other innovative solutions please visit www.apc.com

&lt;p&gt;Single Sign-On Creates Improved Contact Center Experience
SALT LAKE CITY--(Business Wire)--
inContact, Inc. (NASDAQ: SAAS) (www.inContact.com), the market leader in
on-demand contact center software and agent optimization tools, today announced
the integration of its award-winning contact center platform, inContact, with

of the information about the customer automatically pops up for the agent. 

inContact offers all of the benefits of a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) system,
and easily overlays an organization`s existing telephony system (switch),
enabling a number of functional benefits to the customer relationship management
process.

tools, all built on an integrated network connectivity framework," said Paul
Jarman, CEO of inContact. "Now that inContact and the Microsoft offerings are
functionally coupled, Microsoft CRM customers can vastly improve both the agent
and customer experience. The speed of deployment, best in class functionality,
and budget benefits of the inContact SaaS model make the combined solution an
easy decision for organizations large and small." 

"Being a Microsoft CRM Gold Partner, and having been involved in the design and
implementation of the integration, I feel confident that this dynamic pair of
products will satisfy real business needs for a large number of customers," said
Ryan Redmond, President, Customer Dynamics, Inc. "I`m thrilled to have the
best-of-breed customer contact handling functionality of inContact now available
to my customer base." 

The inContact SaaS model allows a Microsoft CRM user to implement inContact
rapidly and without capital expense. It is simple to deploy, with flexible
annual or monthly pricing, and is built to easily scale up or down to meet
seasonal or campaign-based fluctuations in call volume. The inContact
professional services channel, in conjunction with qualified Microsoft Gold
Partners, facilitates each implementation of both inContact and Microsoft CRM to
ensure they are aligned and configured to the customer`s business needs and
rules. 

"inContact is the leading on-demand contact center solution because it is
proven," continued Jarman. "inContact has handled over 10 billion calls and is
deployed in approximately 600 contact centers of all sizes. You can have a
world-class enterprise-grade system at a cost model affordable to all. And now,
with our integration with Microsoft Dynamics, we deliver even more value to our

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and TUCHENG, TAIWAN, Mar 04 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM), Enterprise Information Management Inc. (EIM), C-Lock
Technology (C-Lock), a subsidiary of Evergreen Energy Inc. (NYSE Arca:
EEE) and Foxconn/Hon Hai Technology Group today announced a global
agreement to jointly deliver and deploy GreenCert, the world's first
enterprise content management system that can accurately calculate and
certify the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by a facility. As
part of the announcement, Foxconn and IBM will together bring the
GreenCert technology to Taiwan, where it will serve as a new business
model and an exclusive distribution source of GreenCert for the Asia
Pacific region to promote energy saving, carbon reduction and other green
energy opportunities.

    Today's announcement marks the first time that GreenCert technology will
be available in the Asia Pacific region. GreenCert is an information
technology solution for environmental protection and energy production
that was originally developed in the United States by IBM and its Business
Partners, EIM and C-Lock. The solution combines technology from the IBM
industry-leading software portfolio that includes WebSphere, DB2, Lotus,
Tivoli and Rational.

    In addition to calculating carbon emissions, GreenCert provides instant
data analysis and test reports that allow customers to use it as a base
for carbon trading. Foxconn will make a significant investment leveraging
IBM software and hardware technology to enable this analysis and
management. At Kaohsiung Software Park, they will recruit several hundred
software engineers with special industry skills to help make the GreenCert
technology system meet the specific needs of different Asian industries.
Additionally, it will help enterprises in the Asia Pacific region realize
their social responsibilities toward energy savings and carbon emissions
reductions.

    As the carbon trading market continues to gain strength, GreenCert is
widely regarded as a driving force in saving energy and reducing carbon
emissions. It is an important application for enterprises in industries
such as power, petrochemicals, iron and steel and other energy businesses
that attach great importance to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.

    The Kyoto Protocol promotes carbon trading as a key means of reducing
worldwide emissions. Under the framework established by the Protocol, the
amount of carbon emissions produced by a company will become a price
tagged commodity to be traded on world markets under international law.
This provision of the Protocol has proven to be very popular and in fact
the World Bank's "State and Trends of the Carbon Market 2007" pointed out
that the use of carbon trading to encourage reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions has become the most important international policy in reducing
greenhouse gas emissions.

    "As part of this announcement, Foxconn will employ a large number of
software engineers at the Kaohsiung Software Park to cultivate the talent
needed to meet the increasing demand for environmental and energy saving
technologies, and to deal with the global warming threat," said Terry Gou,
Chairman of Foxconn. "As the most preferred partner to all aspects of
contract manufacturing, Foxconn firmly believes it is our duty to take
action to help save energy, share our experience in reducing carbon
dioxide and recycle."

    "Our clients have identified a great need for accurate measurements in
carbon trading. To meet this demand, IBM worked closely with EIM and
C-Lock to develop GreenCert, which replaces manual calculation with
computational technology. This can help enterprises collect pollutant
emission data and allow them to conduct carbon trading and follow
environment protection rules in their countries," said Mark Easton, vice
president of IBM software sales. "Partnering with an environmentally
conscious company like Foxconn in such a strategic way greatly enhances
GreenCert's ability to help enterprises in Asia Pacific reduce greenhouse
gases."

    About Foxconn

    As the largest contract manufacturer in global electronics outsourcing,
Foxconn pursues its mission to increase the affordability of
environmental-friendly electronics products for all mankind by continuing

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Wednesday that it would use ad hoc technical consultants instead of a "monitoring trustee" to ensure software giant Microsoft complied with a 2004 antitrust decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU executive established a full-time independent monitoring trustee in 2005 to make sure Microsoft provided interoperability information to rivals following its 2004 ruling that the U.S. firm abused its dominance in PC operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission, which polices competition in the 27-nation bloc, has fined Microsoft 1.68 billion euros ($2.13 billion) related to antitrust decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission no longer requires a full-time monitoring trustee to assess Microsoft's compliance," the executive body said in a statement, citing changes in Microsoft's behavior, more opportunities for third parties to exercise their rights in national courts and experience gained since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said it would rely on the ad hoc advice of technical consultants in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission in January accused Microsoft of stymieing competition by bundling its Internet Explorer web browser with Windows systems.

Cazenove posted a 15 percent fall in full-year pretax profit and
said it had seen a "very active" start to 2009 in debt and
equity issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we got close to repeating the profits for 2008 in 2009,
we'd regard that as a pretty good result," chief executive
Naguib Kheraj told reporters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pretax profit in 2008 was 134.5 million pounds ($190

challenging market, Kheraj said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue fell 10 percent to 394.9 million pounds but
operating profit from its UK operations, the continuing
business, was up 7 percent to 143.9 million pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a year's time, Cazenove could require JPMorgan to buy the
other 50 percent share in the joint venture or JPMorgan could
choose to do so, but the two firms have held no conclusive talks
on the future of the business yet, Kheraj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Cazenove is broker to 35 FTSE 100 companies, 78
FTSE 250 clients and 119 smaller companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cazenove simultaneously said it posted a profit of 67.3

&lt;p&gt;NOVA YORK--(Business Wire)--
A Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) anunciou hoje seus planos de investir em
n&#237;veis recordes - entre US$ 25 bilh&#245;es e US$ 30 bilh&#245;es anualmente nos pr&#243;ximos
cinco anos - para atender ao crescimento esperado da demanda mundial por energia
no longo prazo. 

"A economia global atravessa atualmente uma desacelera&#231;&#227;o, mas na ExxonMobil
estamos concentrados no longo prazo", disse Rex Tillerson, presidente e diretor
executivo da empresa, em reuni&#227;o anual com analistas de investimentos na Bolsa
de Valores de Nova York. 

"A s&#243;lida posi&#231;&#227;o financeira da ExxonMobil, resultado da for&#231;a do nosso
portf&#243;lio de neg&#243;cios e da nossa abordagem prudente da gest&#227;o e investimento de
risco, nos permite desenvolver novos projetos de petr&#243;leo e g&#225;s, aumentar nossa
produ&#231;&#227;o de produtos refinados de valor mais alto e fortalecer nosso setor de
produtos qu&#237;micos." 

Tillerson destacou as principais conquistas da ExxonMobil em 2008 e os planos
para o futuro. Os destaques incluem: 

-- A produ&#231;&#227;o foi iniciada em oito importantes projetos no ano de 2008 que, ao
atingirem o pico, devem acrescentar o equivalente l&#237;quido a duzentos e sessenta
mil barris por dia &#224; produ&#231;&#227;o da empresa. Outros nove importantes projetos devem
come&#231;ar a produzir em 2009, que ir&#227;o adicionar o equivalente l&#237;quido a
quatrocentos e oitenta e cinco mil barris por dia &#224; produ&#231;&#227;o. 

-- A empresa recomp&#244;s novamente mais de cem por cento da produ&#231;&#227;o atrav&#233;s de
adi&#231;&#245;es de reservas comprovadas em 2008. Foi o d&#233;cimo quinto ano consecutivo em
que as adi&#231;&#245;es de reservas provadas da empresa mais que recompuseram a produ&#231;&#227;o.
Al&#233;m disso, a &#225;rea de explora&#231;&#227;o foi aumentada em cerca de quarenta por cento
desde 2003. 

-- No refino, a empresa est&#225; desenvolvendo planos para investir mais de US$ 1
bilh&#227;o em projetos de diesel de baixo enxofre em tr&#234;s refinarias nos Estados
Unidos e Europa. Quando conclu&#237;dos em 2010, esses projetos ir&#227;o permitir um
aumento da produ&#231;&#227;o de diesel de enxofre reduzido de cento e quarenta mil barris
por dia. 

-- No setor de produtos qu&#237;micos, a empresa intensificou a atividade de
constru&#231;&#227;o de projetos petroqu&#237;micos em escala mundial na China e em Cingapura,
e continua a investir no crescimento de setores especializados. Isso inclui uma
nova f&#225;brica na Coreia do Sul para a fabrica&#231;&#227;o de pel&#237;culas para separador de
baterias de &#237;ons de l&#237;tio para atender ao crescimento esperado da demanda,
incluindo baterias para ve&#237;culos h&#237;bridos e el&#233;tricos. 

-- A ExxonMobil continuou a apresentar excepcional desempenho com um retorno
m&#233;dio em 2008 de trinta e quatro por cento do capital investido,
significativamente mais alto do que seu concorrente mais pr&#243;ximo. 

"A ExxonMobil est&#225; forte, s&#243;lida e bem posicionada para o futuro", declarou
Tillerson. 

"Nosso compromisso de desenvolver tecnologias avan&#231;adas, nossa lideran&#231;a no
setor em recursos operacionais e de gest&#227;o de projetos e nossos extraordin&#225;rios
funcion&#225;rios continuam a colocar a empresa na posi&#231;&#227;o de parceira preferencial

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE : XOM) a annonc&#233; aujourd`hui des projets
d`investissement &#224; des niveaux records (entre 25 et 30 milliards de dollars par
an sur les cinq prochaines ann&#233;es) pour r&#233;pondre &#224; la croissance de la demande
mondiale en &#233;nergie pr&#233;vue sur le long terme. 

&#171; L`&#233;conomie mondiale est actuellement en r&#233;cession, mais chez ExxonMobil nous
concentrons notre attention sur le long terme &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Rex Tillerson, le
pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral, &#224; l`occasion d`un briefing annuel &#224; l`intention des
analystes en investissements &#224; la Bourse de New York. 

&#171; La solide situation financi&#232;re d`ExxonMobil, que lui conf&#232;rent un portefeuille
commercial robuste et son approche prudente de la gestion des risques et des
investissements, permet &#224; la soci&#233;t&#233; de mettre sur pied des projets p&#233;troliers
et gaziers, d`accro&#238;tre sa production de produits raffin&#233;s &#224; valeur plus &#233;lev&#233;e
et &#224; faire progresser les activit&#233;s de son segment produits chimiques. &#187; 

M. Tillerson a &#233;voqu&#233; les principales r&#233;alisations d`ExxonMobil en 2008 et les
projets pour l`avenir dans les grandes lignes. Parmi les points marquants,
citons : 

-- La production a d&#233;but&#233; dans huit importants projets en 2008, qui une fois la
production de pointe atteinte devraient ajouter l`&#233;quivalent net de 260 000
barils par jour &#224; la production de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Neuf autres gros projets
devraient entrer en production en 2009, qui une fois la production de pointe
atteinte devraient ajouter l`&#233;quivalent net de 485 000 barils par jour
suppl&#233;mentaires &#224; la production. 

-- La soci&#233;t&#233; a encore une fois remplac&#233; plus de 100 % de la production gr&#226;ce
aux additions aux r&#233;serves prouv&#233;es en 2008. Cela fait la quinzi&#232;me ann&#233;e de
suite que les additions aux r&#233;serves prouv&#233;es de la soci&#233;t&#233; ont plus que
remplac&#233; la production. Par ailleurs, la superficie nette d`exploration a &#233;t&#233;
augment&#233;e d`environ 40 % depuis 2003. 

-- En ce qui concerne les activit&#233;s en aval, la soci&#233;t&#233; fait avancer des projets
en vue d`investir plus de 1 milliard de dollars dans des projets de diesel &#224;
plus faible teneur en soufre dans trois raffineries aux &#201;tats-Unis et en Europe.
Une fois achev&#233;s en 2010, ces projets permettront une augmentation de la
production de diesel &#224; plus faible teneur en soufre de 140 000 barils par jour. 

-- Dans le segment produits chimiques, la soci&#233;t&#233; a acc&#233;l&#233;r&#233; la construction sur
des projets p&#233;trochimiques &#224; l`&#233;chelle mondiale en Chine et &#224; Singapour. Elle
continue &#233;galement &#224; investir dans la croissance d`activit&#233;s de sp&#233;cialit&#233;,
notamment dans une nouvelle usine en Cor&#233;e du Sud o&#249; sera fabriqu&#233; du film
s&#233;parateur pour batteries &#224; l`ion-lithium afin de r&#233;pondre &#224; la croissance
pr&#233;vue de la demande, y compris des batteries destin&#233;es aux v&#233;hicules hybrides
et &#233;lectriques. 

-- La performance sup&#233;rieure &#224; la normale d`ExxonMobil s`est poursuivi, avec un
rendement du capital moyen engag&#233; en 2008 de 34 %, un rendement bien plus &#233;lev&#233;
que celui de son concurrent le plus proche. 

&#171; ExxonMobil est solide, r&#233;sistante et bien positionn&#233;e pour l`avenir &#187;, a

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Die Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) hat heute bekannt gegeben, k&#252;nftig
Investitionen in Rekordh&#246;he t&#228;tigen zu wollen - zwischen 25 und 30 Milliarden
US-Dollar j&#228;hrlich w&#228;hrend der n&#228;chsten f&#252;nf Jahre -, um den erwarteten
langfristigen Anstieg der Energienachfrage zu decken. 

&#8222;Die weltweite Wirtschaft erlebt derzeit einen Abschwung, aber bei ExxonMobil
orientieren wir uns langfristig", sagte Rex Tillerson, Chairman und Chief
Executive Officer anl&#228;sslich einer j&#228;hrlichen Informationsveranstaltung f&#252;r
Investmentanalysten an der New Yorker B&#246;rse. 

&#8222;Die starke finanzielle Position von ExxonMobil, resultierend aus der St&#228;rke
unseres Gesch&#228;ftsportfolios, unseres umsichtigen Risikomanagements und bedachten
Investitionen, erm&#246;glicht es uns, neue Erd&#246;l- und Erdgasprojekte durchzuf&#252;hren,
unsere Produktion h&#246;herwertiger Raffinerieerzeugnisse zu erh&#246;hen und unser
Chemiegesch&#228;ft zu steigern." 

Tillerson skizzierte ExxonMobils gr&#246;&#223;ten Erfolge des Jahres 2008 sowie die
Zukunftspl&#228;ne. Einige der H&#246;hepunkte: 

-- 2008 startete an acht gro&#223;en Projektstandorten die F&#246;rderung, die bei
Spitzenauslastung voraussichtlich einen Netto-Gegenwert von 260.000 Barrel pro
Tag zur F&#246;rderleistung des Unternehmens beitragen wird. Weitere neun gro&#223;e
Projekte werden voraussichtlich im Jahr 2009 mit der F&#246;rderung starten und bei
Spitzenauslastung vermutlich einen Netto-Gegenwert von 485.000 Barrel pro Tag
zur F&#246;rderleistung beitragen. 

-- Das Unternehmen ersetzte 2008 erneut mehr als 100 Prozent der F&#246;rderleistung
durch Zug&#228;nge zu den nachgewiesenen Reserven. Es war das 15. Jahr in Folge, in
dem die Zug&#228;nge zu den nachgewiesenen Reserven die F&#246;rdermengen &#252;bertroffen
haben. Dar&#252;ber hinaus wurde die Netto-Explorationsfl&#228;che seit 2003 um etwa 40
Prozent erh&#246;ht. 

-- Beim Downstream treibt das Unternehmen Pl&#228;ne voran, mehr als eine Milliarde
US-Dollar in Projekte an drei Raffinerien in den USA und Europa zu investieren,
bei denen Diesel mit geringerem Schwefelgehalt im Vordergrund steht. Sofort nach
Fertigstellung im Jahr 2010 werden diese Projekte eine Produktionssteigerung bei
Diesel mit geringerem Schwefelgehalt um 140.000 Barrel pro Tag erm&#246;glichen. 

-- Im Chemiegesch&#228;ft hat das Unternehmen die Baut&#228;tigkeit bei petrochemischen
Projekten auf globaler Ebene in China und Singapur aufgestockt und investiert
weiterhin in das Wachstum von Spezialgesch&#228;ften, wie der neuen Fertigungsanlage
in S&#252;dkorea f&#252;r die Fertigung von Separatorfolien f&#252;r Lithium-Ionen-Batterien,
die voraussichtlich die steigende Nachfrage, unter anderem nach Batterien f&#252;r
Hybrid- und Elektrofahrzeuge, decken wird. 

-- ExxonMobil erwirtschaftet weiterhin hervorragende Ergebnisse und konnte 2008
eine durchschnittliche Kapitalrendite von 34 Prozent verzeichnen, was deutlich
&#252;ber der des gr&#246;&#223;ten Konkurrenten liegt. 

&#8222;ExxonMobil ist stark, stabil und gut gewappnet f&#252;r die Zukunft", sagte
Tillerson. 

&#8222;Unser Engagement f&#252;r die Entwicklung fortschrittlicher Technologien, unsere
branchenf&#252;hrenden Betriebs- und Projektmanagementkompetenzen und unsere
au&#223;ergew&#246;hnlichen Mitarbeiter machen das Unternehmen weiterhin zum Wunschpartner
f&#252;r Ressourcenbesitzer auf der ganzen Welt." 

Es ist nun schon das siebte Jahr, an dem ExxonMobil eine j&#228;hrliche Pr&#228;sentation
f&#252;r Analysten an der New Yorker B&#246;rse abh&#228;lt.

&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) today announced it earned
$1.4 million, or basic net income per share of $.15, in the fourth quarter of
2008 compared to a net loss of $1.8 million, or basic net loss per share of
$.19, in the fourth quarter of 2007. The results for the fourth quarter included
a mark-to-market after tax loss of $1.0 million ($2.0 million on a pre-tax
basis), or basic net loss per share of $.11, on the Company`s 2009 fuel hedging
program. 

For the year ended December 28 2008, the Company earned $9.1 million, or basic
net income per share of $.99, compared to $19.9 million, or basic net income per
share of $2.18, in 2007. In addition to the $1.0 million mark-to-market after
tax loss on the Company`s 2009 fuel hedging program, the Company`s 2008 net
income included two charges totaling $9.7 million after tax ($18.6 million on a
pre-tax basis), or basic net loss per share of $1.06, that were primarily
incurred in the third quarter. These charges included $7.3 million after tax
($14.0 million on a pre-tax basis), or basic net loss per share of $.80, related
to freezing the Company`s liability to the Central States, Southeast and
Southwest Areas Pension Fund, a multi-employer pension fund, and settling a
strike by employees covered by this pension fund. The charges also included the
costs of carrying out a restructuring plan during the fiscal year totaling $2.4
million after tax ($4.6 million on a pre-tax basis), or basic net loss per share
of $.26. The Company`s 2007 net income included $1.7 million after tax ($2.8
million on a pre-tax basis), or $.18 basic net income per share, of
restructuring costs. 

J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, "In 2008, we continued to face
very difficult macroeconomic circumstances and business challenges specific to
the soft drink industry. This is not the first time our Company has faced
difficult challenges during our long history. Each time we have emerged a
stronger organization. By exercising decisive leadership in early 2008, our
Company was able to make important strategic and cost management decisions that
were executed with confidence and conviction by our employees and positively
impacted the second half of 2008. Further, we believe these actions have helped
position us to proactively deal with economic uncertainty. We streamlined our
business and reviewed all capital and operating expenditures allowing us, thus
far, to not only weather the severe economic downturn, but also produce a much
improved fourth quarter." 

William B. Elmore, President and COO, added, "We saw fuel prices and other key
commodity inputs including corn, aluminum and PET resin increase rapidly to
record levels in the summer of 2008 before subsiding in the late fall. The
dramatic increases in commodity costs, coupled with the challenges of driving
consumer demand for sparkling beverages, made 2008 a very difficult year. These
challenges put our fellow employees at Coca-Cola Consolidated to the test, and
they demonstrated the resilience, the innovative spirit, the determination and
the flexibility to move quickly and decisively to deal with issues facing our
industry and the economy. We are encouraged by the innovative solutions we have
and continue to bring forward including new packaging configurations; value
pricing and packaging in the convenience store channel; intelligent vending; new
sales support tools; new manufacturing and order fulfillment systems; and a
return to grassroots marketing focus. Even though we see continued challenges in
2009 and the possibility of more difficult decisions in response, we are
encouraged by the momentum we have built over the last three quarters of 2008
and carry into the new year. Most importantly we remain confident about the
long-term prospects for our business."

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Mark Zoradi, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Group, will
present a keynote address during the 2009 NAB Show held April 18-23 in Las
Vegas. Speaking during the Show's Digital Cinema Summit on Sunday, April 19,
Zoradi will offer first-hand insights and news about digital 3D as well as 3D
delivery across multiple platforms. The Digital Cinema Summit, "3D Cinema &amp;
Beyond: Lens to Living Room," will be held April 18-19, and is produced in
partnership with the Society of Motion Picture Television Engineers (SMPTE). 

"The ongoing digital shift in our everyday lives continues to create new
opportunities for content distributors to engage with a broader audience," said
Zoradi. "During this challenging economic climate, it is crucial that
entertainment companies, broadcasters and content creators operate with creative
and business strategies that help to drive revenue across multiple platforms and
channels. As a leading creator of digital 3D content, we are committed to
exploring and utilizing new opportunities, and the NAB Show provides an
excellent venue to share our perspective and learn from others." 

Zoradi, an industry veteran who oversees the worldwide distribution and
marketing of all Walt Disney Studios films including Walt Disney Animation
Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Pictures, and Touchstone Pictures,
has played a pivotal role in the Studio's successful worldwide box office run in
2008, which cumulated an impressive global gross of $2.4 billion. 

"We are excited to bring an industry thought leader such as Mark on board and
share the Disney vision with our audience," said NAB Executive Vice President of
Conventions and Business Operations Chris Brown. "In this paradigm shift, Mark's
deep industry expertise will provide unique insight into the issues that
currently pertain within the industry and generate innovative ideas for the
future of digital entertainment." 

Prior to assuming the current role in July 2006, Zoradi led the Walt Disney
Studios' international distribution and marketing arm formerly known as Buena
Vista International as its president for 14 years. At Buena Vista International,
Zoradi made a global impact and shattered industry records by earning more than
$1 billion at the international box-office for 12 consecutive years, generating
$16.8 billion from 1995-2006. No other company has come close to this
achievement. 

Zoradi's 29-year career at Disney has spanned television, home entertainment and
film businesses. His Disney stint began as marketing manager for Walt Disney
Home Video during the beginning of the home entertainment boom. From there he
moved into television business as marketing director for the Disney Channel
before serving numerous executive roles - including as president - for Buena
Vista International.

&lt;p&gt;NUEVA YORK--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) anunci&#243; hoy que planea invertir cantidades
r&#233;cord (entre US$ 25.000 millones y US$ 30.000 millones por a&#241;o durante los
pr&#243;ximos cinco a&#241;os) para satisfacer el crecimiento a largo plazo esperado para
la demanda mundial de energ&#237;a. 

"Actualmente la econom&#237;a mundial atraviesa una desaceleraci&#243;n, pero en
ExxonMobil nos concentramos en el futuro a largo plazo", dijo Rex Tillerson,
presidente y director ejecutivo, en una sesi&#243;n informativa anual para analistas
de inversiones en la Bolsa de Valores de Nueva York. 

"La s&#243;lida posici&#243;n financiera de ExxonMobil, que resulta de la fortaleza de
nuestra cartera de negocios y de nuestro cauto enfoque de la administraci&#243;n de
riesgos e inversi&#243;n, nos permite desarrollar nuevos proyectos con petr&#243;leo y
gas, aumentar nuestra producci&#243;n de productos refinados de mayor valor y ampliar
nuestros negocios relacionados con productos qu&#237;micos". 

Tillerson hizo un resumen de los logros m&#225;s importantes de ExxonMobil durante
2008 y de los planes para el futuro. Los puntos m&#225;s destacados incluyen: 

-- Ocho importantes proyectos comenzaron a producir en 2008, y se espera que,
cuando lleguen al pico de producci&#243;n, agreguen el equivalente neto a 260.000
barriles por d&#237;a a la producci&#243;n de la compa&#241;&#237;a. Otros nueve importantes
proyectos est&#225;n programados para comenzar en 2009, y se espera que agreguen a la
producci&#243;n el equivalente neto a otros 485.000 barriles por d&#237;a cuando lleguen a
su punto m&#225;s alto. 

-- En 2008, la compa&#241;&#237;a reemplaz&#243; nuevamente m&#225;s de 100% de la producci&#243;n al
a&#241;adir reservas probadas. Fue el decimoquinto a&#241;o consecutivo en que los
agregados de reservas probadas de la compa&#241;&#237;a han reemplazado sobradamente la
producci&#243;n. Adem&#225;s, la extensi&#243;n neta de acres de exploraci&#243;n aument&#243; alrededor
de 40% desde 2003. 

-- En el sector de refinaci&#243;n, transporte y comercializaci&#243;n, la compa&#241;&#237;a planea
invertir m&#225;s de US$ 1.000 millones de d&#243;lares en proyectos de di&#233;sel con menor
contenido de azufre y en tres refiner&#237;as en EE. UU. y Europa. Una vez
finalizados en 2010, estos proyectos permitir&#225;n un aumento en la producci&#243;n de
di&#233;sel con menor contenido de azufre de 140.000 barriles por d&#237;a. 

-- En el negocio de los qu&#237;micos, la compa&#241;&#237;a ha aumentado la actividad para
construir proyectos petroqu&#237;micos de escala mundial en China y Singapur, y sigue
invirtiendo para el crecimiento de negocios espec&#237;ficos, como una nueva planta
en Corea del Sur que produce pel&#237;cula separadora de bater&#237;as de i&#243;n de litio,
destinada a satisfacer el crecimiento que se espera en la demanda de bater&#237;as
para veh&#237;culos el&#233;ctricos e h&#237;bridos. 

-- ExxonMobil continu&#243; con su excelente rendimiento con un 34% de retorno sobre
el capital promedio empleado en 2008, una diferencia significativa en
comparaci&#243;n con su competidor m&#225;s cercano. 

"ExxonMobil es fuerte, tiene capacidad de recuperaci&#243;n y est&#225; bien posicionado
para el futuro", dijo Tillerson. 

"Nuestro compromiso de desarrollar tecnolog&#237;a de avanzada, nuestra capacidad
operativa y de gesti&#243;n de proyectos l&#237;der en la industria, y nuestros
excepcionales empleados siguen posicionando a la compa&#241;&#237;a como el socio a elegir
para los gestores de recursos de todo el mundo". 

Este es el s&#233;ptimo a&#241;o que ExxonMobil hace una presentaci&#243;n anual ante los
analistas en la Bolsa de Valores de Nueva York.

este comunicado son declaraciones prospectivas. Los resultados futuros reales
(entre ellos, el gasto de capital, las tasas de producci&#243;n, los planes de
proyectos, programas y resultados) y el crecimiento en la demanda pueden diferir
considerablemente debido a los cambios en las condiciones del mercado que
afectan la industria del petr&#243;leo y el gas o a los niveles de precio del
petr&#243;leo y el gas a largo plazo; desarrollos pol&#237;ticos o regulatorios;

&lt;p&gt;PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, March 5 (Reuters) - Oil thieves
sabotaged a Chevron-operated (CVX.N) pipeline in the restive
Niger Delta but no oil production was affected, a military
spokesman said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Colonel Rabe Abubakar, spokesman for the joint military

spillages from a burst oil pipeline near the border of Bayelsa
and Delta states in southern Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The spillages in these communities were an act of
sabotage," he said. "Evidence around the spillage area showed
that illegal oil bunkerers were again in operation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria is the world's eighth biggest exporter of crude oil
but thieves take a sizeable proportion of its output by drilling
into pipelines or hijacking barges loaded with oil, theft known
locally as "bunkering".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some estimates say 100,000 barrels of crude are stolen from
the Niger Delta each day, about five percent of the country's
production and equivalent to around $4 million daily or $1.5
billion a year at current prices.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) held its 2009 analyst meeting this morning, and
traders have not responded kindly to the company's revelations. For instance,
Exxon said it plans to increase spending on capital and exploration projects by
11% in 2009, and it plans to spend about $25 billion to $30 billion per year
during the next 5 years on capital projects. By comparison, many of the
company's competitors have announced plans to scale back operations amid the
global economic recession and falling crude oil prices. 

"Exxon Mobil's business is strong, and so is our commitment to investing through
the business cycle," CEO Rex Tillerson said during the presentation. "Our
capital spending plans are largely unaffected by the recent reduction in
commodity prices. Our projects have always been evaluated using a range of
prices to ensure robust returns across the business cycle."

tractors and trucks into the North American market is an outstanding
demonstration of corporate responsibility and sustainability," said Bill Kozek,
Kenworth general manager and PACCAR vice president. "We are very pleased to
partner with Coca-Cola Enterprises to save fuel and reduce emissions," added
Kozek. 

Coca-Cola Enterprises has achieved increased fuel efficiency and decreased
emissions on its original order of 120 Kenworth T370 hybrid beverage delivery
trucks deployed throughout the United States and Canada last year. "The Kenworth
hybrids are performing well, with a more than 30 percent improvement in both
fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, compared to standard beverage
delivery trucks," said Gary Kapusta, the company`s vice president of indirect
procurement, who noted that Coca-Cola Enterprises operates the largest hybrid
fleet in North America. 

Coca-Cola Enterprises` Kenworth T370 hybrids are equipped with a PACCAR PX-6
engine, rated up to 280 hp and up to 660 lb-ft of torque, and the Eaton
diesel-electric hybrid power system.The hybrids also have an integral
transmission-mounted motor/generator and frame-mounted 340-volt, lithium-ion
battery pack. Advanced powertrain controls monitor driving conditions and
automatically select the ideal power mode, smoothly switching among electric
only, combined diesel and electric, and diesel only power modes. Electricity
generated through regenerative braking is stored and used for acceleration,
assisting the diesel engine. The hybrid system is monitored through a dash
display. As the power requirements for different driving conditions change, the
screen constantly updates the driver on system status.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) plans to hike its spending by nearly 12 percent even as most oil and gas producers rein in spending amid the steep drop in oil and natural gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Around the house it feels pretty much business as usual," Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told reporters after an analysts' meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded company, said it would spend about $29 billion in 2009, the upper end of its five-year annual spending target of $25 billion to $30 billion per year, as part of its effort to meet long-term growth in world demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon Mobil's business is strong, and so is our commitment to investing through the business cycle," Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's spending for 2009 could rise even higher, Tillerson said, if it sees new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are well-positioned to fund and progress those opportunities," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those could be new partnerships with national oil companies, although that would not preclude deals with non-state run companies that have growth potential, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has $32 billion on its balance sheet, even as many energy companies have tightened their belts to conserve cash in a weak economy that has knocked oil prices down 70 percent from the highs above $147 a barrel in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon set a company and U.S. record for annual profits in 2008 at $45.2 billion as oil prices skyrocketed to their record highs, and said its spending would help bring on line nine projects in 2009 that will ultimately add 485,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) production per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Tillerson said there was about four to five million barrels a day of excess global oil production capacity in the current environment, and that demand would likely be flat to perhaps only slightly higher this year. Demand for gasoline in the United States, the world's largest oil consumer, would be near flat after last year's decline, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's capital spending was about $26 billion in 2008, up about 28 percent from 2007. The company also spent $32 billion in share buybacks last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of its exploration and spending would go toward projects expected to come on line after 2010, and production for 2008 is likely to be about 4 million BOE per day, near the 4.11 million BOE the company produced last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will also spend about $1 billion on refinery projects in the United States and Europe that would add about 140,000 barrels per day in capacity for lower sulfur diesel fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares fell 3.8 percent to $63.18 on the New York Stock Exchange early Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday's close, the stock had slumped nearly 18 percent so far this year, but was the second-best performer behind McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI over the past six months, with a 17.5 percent decline in that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock was also the second-best performer in the Standard  Poor's Energy Index .GSPE over the last six months and easily outperformed the index, which was down 42 percent in that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Dave Zimmerman, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

Tillerson said, if it sees new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are well-positioned to fund and progress those
opportunities," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among those could be new partnerships with national oil
companies, although that would not preclude deals with

 (Adds other estimates, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Boris Groendahl and Antonita Madonna Devotta &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VIENNA/BANGALORE, March 5 (Reuters) - European banks exposed
to emerging Europe could require additional capital of up to 40
billion euros ($50.3 billion) by 2010, as non-performing loans
and loss ratios are stressed, J.P.Morgan said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage was the latest to assess the possible fallout
of the emerging European economic malaise for shareholders of
western banks, following Morgan Stanley's estimate of up to 46
billion euros in capital requirements earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CA Cheuvreux said in a broader analysis that the entire
continent's banking sector needed up to 110 billion euros in
additional capital, with only the smallest part of that need
originating from emerging Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The western European lenders that bankrolled the region's
growth in the boom years are now facing a severe recession in
the bloc, as bad debt is set to rise and currencies to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors have dumped assets in the region in droves this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the estimates are a far cry from the meltdown
scenarios pegged to the $1.7 trillion in exposure to the former
Communist bloc that the Bank of International Settlements has
recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts warned against using the number the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our base case remains that there will be no meltdown, that
bailouts will come as required," said Morgan Stanley analyst
Ronny Rehn. "However, I definitely think external help will be
required for many countries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the unlikelihood of the entire region being pushed
into the abyss, the risk for shareholders is still material
because the additional capital need would further dilute their
shareholdings, in some cases significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This potential hit could be hard for many banks with
concentrated exposures given the significant dilution risk,"
J.P.Morgan said in a note to clients. "For more diversified
banks, the exposure would appear more manageable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AUSTRIAN, SWEDISH, GREEK BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the banks most threatened by dilution are Raiffeisen
International RIBH.VI, Erste Group Bank (ERST.VI), KBC
(KBC.BR), Swedbank (SWEDa.ST), Piraeus Bank (BOPr.AT), OTP
OTPB.BU, or BRE Bank BREP.WA. More diversified western banks
include UniCredit (CRDI.MI) and Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some banks present in less risky markets, such as Poland and
the Czech Republic, were also offering defensive value. They
included Komercni BKOMsp.PR, Bank Pekao BAPE.WA and PKO
PKOB.WA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of the total 32 billion to 40 billion euros in capital
needs, about 8 billion euros will be needed by Nordic banks,
while Austrian banks could require 5 billion euros, J.P. Morgan
said. It estimated the requirement for Greek banks at 4 billion
euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Large European banks such as UniCredit, Societe Generale
(SOGN.PA) and Intesa would need 10 billion euros between them,
J.P.Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the Polish banks, 3 billion euros was needed, and for
Hungary, 1 billion to 2 billion euros, mainly at OTP. Russian
banks would require 3 billion to 4 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P.Morgan said it did expect non-performing loan ratios to
hit the peaks of 20 percent to 40 percent seen in previous
crises, but gave estimates from 10 percent, in countries like
Poland or Slovakia, to 30 percent, in Ukraine and Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loss ratios -- the percentage of non-performing loans that
cannot be recovered -- are expected to be at 75 percent for the
region, J.P.Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in several emerging European banks fell on Thursday,
although they were not the worst performers on a very weak DJ
Stoxx Banking index .SX7P.

&lt;p&gt;March 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs reinstated coverage of
Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) with a "buy" rating and added the stock to
the conviction buy list, saying the world's biggest drugmaker
was "severely undervalued" after its proposed acquisition of
smaller rival Wyeth WYE.N.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer has been punished mainly due to the 50 percent
dividend cut associated with the Wyeth deal and the market's
wariness of large-scale Pharma MA," the brokerage said in a
note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  However, with the deal, Pfizer is set for stable earnings
through 2015 as one of the strongest players in vaccines and
biologicals, said the brokerage, which has a price target of
$17 on Pfizer shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe there is now minimal risk, if any, for further
cuts to the dividend through the next decade, given the strong
and steady level of cash flows from the combined companies,"
the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With significant free cash flows and stable earnings,
Pfizer could comfortably raise the dividend and/or buy back
shares while it continues to pay down debt, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage expects Pfizer to raise dividend by 20
percent in both 2011 and 2012 and 10 percent in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In January, Pfizer said it would halve its dividend and
raise $22 billion in debt to buy Wyeth for $68 billion in an
acquisition aimed at softening the blow of losing its biggest
product to generic competition. [ID:nN26367941]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares have shed 28 percent of their value since the
deal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer shares have performed so poorly
post-deal-announcement that, in our view, merely closing the
deal and meeting minimal earnings and financial expectations
should be sufficient to drive the shares back to the $17
level," the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Pfizer were flat at $12.50 Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC and ARMONK, NY, Mar 05 (MARKET WIRE) --

IBM (NYSE: IBM) has introduced the first consulting service designed to
help government organizations analyze energy and water use, assess waste
management, evaluate overall environmental impact and develop improvement
strategies.

    The IBM Public Sector Energy and Environment Diagnostic can help
governments better understand their overall performance on environmental
issues, identify improvements that can increase energy efficiency, reduce
environmental impact including greenhouse gas emissions, and help ensure
public institutions meet their own rising environmental standards.

    IBM developed the diagnostic to help U.S. federal agencies comply with
current requirements for broad improvements in efficiency and economy for
all environmental, energy and transportation management operations.
However, it can be adapted to any future requirements for U.S. government
agencies or for use with any other federal, state or municipal government
in any country.

    "Citizens everywhere are demanding that governments improve efficiency and
reduce environmental impact, and public officials at every level are
responding by raising standards for how they operate," said Eric
Riddleberger, IBM's business strategy consulting global leader, who heads
up the company's corporate social responsibility consulting efforts.
"Using a comprehensive approach that employs new, smart processes and
tools to assess current performance and develop improvements can help
public agencies meet those standards while maintaining proper levels of
public service."

    The IBM Public Sector Energy and Environment Diagnostic offering uses a
proprietary Heat Map tool to provide an initial analysis. Based on IBM's
Component Business Model approach, the tool breaks organizations down into
logical segments -- finance, operations, procurement, etc. -- and then
provides an analysis as to how well they are performing in terms of
efficiency, cost and environmental impact.

    Areas for potential environmental improvement are color coded -- red for
"most critical," yellow for "moderately critical," and green for
"performing within guidelines" -- to help government institutions
prioritize where to make changes. From there, IBM can assist government
agencies in developing a comprehensive strategy for prioritizing and
implementing those changes, accounting for the cost and benefit of each
solution.

    Specific areas addressed in the diagnostic are:

    Environmental management systems -- identifying leadership, establishing
targets, tracking performance and communicating with stakeholders; 
Energy and greenhouse gases -- addressing efficiency and use of renewable
sources;  Water management -- reducing consumption and improving quality; 
Waste and disposal -- waste prevention, recycling, environmentally
responsible disposal, and reducing the use of potentially toxic and
hazardous chemicals;  Facilities and equipment -- sustainable practices
in motor fleets and renovation and construction operations;  Workforce
programs -- establishing workforce sustainability programs, training,
benefits, and awards for environmental sustainability leadership.

    The Public Sector Energy and Environment Diagnostic joins a growing
portfolio of consulting offerings from IBM designed to help clients
address CSR issues throughout their operations, including: the CSR
Assessment and Benchmarking Utility, the Carbon Tradeoff Modeler, Green
Sigma(TM), Environmental Product Lifecycle Management, the Supply Chain
Network Optimization Workbench (or SNOW), and Strategic Carbon Management.

    The public sector diagnostic is designed to be used together with many of
these other offerings. For example, after completing an analysis and
identifying areas for improvement with the public sector diagnostic,
clients can use Green Sigma(TM), which applies Lean Six Sigma principles
to measuring and monitoring energy and water usage throughout a
organization's operations, and the Carbon Trade-off Modeler, which helps
evaluate and balance carbon dioxide emissions and energy usage with other
key factors throughout a supply chain -- cost, service and quality.

    These offerings use "smart" approaches, such as advanced business
processes and monitoring dashboards, which allow clients to collect and
analyze large amounts of data to make better decisions.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today announced plans to invest at record
levels -- between $25 billion and $30 billion annually over the next five years
-- to meet expected long-term growth in world energy demand. 

"The global economy is currently experiencing a downturn, but at ExxonMobil we
are focused on the long term," Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive
officer, said at an annual briefing for investment analysts at the New York
Stock Exchange. 

"ExxonMobil`s strong financial position, resulting from the strength of our
business portfolio and our prudent approach to risk management and investment,
enables us to develop new oil and gas projects, increase our production of
higher value refined products and grow our chemical business." 

Tillerson outlined ExxonMobil`s major achievements in 2008 and plans for the
future. Highlights include: 

-- Production started at eight major projects in 2008, which at their peak are
expected to add the net equivalent of 260,000 barrels per day to the company's
production. A further nine major projects are expected to commence production in
2009, and at their peak are expected to add the net equivalent of an additional
485,000 barrels per day to production. 

-- The company once again replaced more than 100 percent of production through
proved reserves additions in 2008. It was the 15th consecutive year that the
company's proved reserves additions have more than replaced production. In
addition, net exploration acreage has been increased by about 40 percent since
2003. 

-- In the downstream, the company is progressing plans to invest more than $1
billion in lower-sulfur diesel projects at three refineries in the US and
Europe. Once complete in 2010, these projects will allow an increase in
lower-sulfur diesel production of 140,000 barrels per day. 

-- In the chemical business, the company has ramped up construction activity on
world-scale petrochemical projects in China and Singapore, and continues to
invest for specialty business growth, including a new plant in South Korea to
manufacture lithium ion battery separator film to meet expected demand growth
including batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles. 

-- ExxonMobil continued its superior performance with a 2008 return on average
capital employed of 34 percent, significantly higher than its closest
competitor. 

"ExxonMobil is strong, resilient, and well positioned for the future," said
Tillerson. 

"Our commitment to developing advanced technology, our industry-leading
operational and project-management capabilities and exceptional employees
continue to position the company as the partner of choice for resource owners
around the world." 

This is the seventh year that ExxonMobil has made an annual presentation to
analysts at the New York Stock Exchange. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Projections, expectations and business plans in this
release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including capital
expenditures; production rates; project plans, schedules, and outcomes; and
demand growth could differ materially due to changes in market conditions
affecting the oil and gas industry or long-term oil and gas price levels;
political or regulatory developments; reservoir performance; timely completion
of development projects; technical or operating factors; and other factors
discussed in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's most recent Form 10-K and posted in the
Investors section of our website (www.exxonmobil.com). The term "reserves," as
used in this release, includes proven reserves from oil sands operations in
Canada which are currently reported separately as mining operations in our SEC
reports. Reserves referenced in this release also represent the combined total
from both consolidated subsidiaries and our interest in equity companies. See
the "Frequently Used Terms" posted in the Investors section of our website for
more information on proved reserves and our calculation of return on average
capital employed.

&lt;p&gt;Automated surveillance to expose high risk activity
LONDON &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
ClusterSeven (London and New York), an international provider of spreadsheet
management solutions that enhance risk management, compliance and business
efficiency for financial institutions and Fortune 500 financial reporting
divisions, today announced the launch of its flagship Enterprise Spreadsheet
Management system as an integrated service for users of IBM Cognos business
intelligence software. 

Many businesses rely on business intelligence and corporate performance
management software for key financial processes. However, even in these
sophisticated organizations, the final reports seen by CFOs are often
spreadsheets produced by the manual manipulation of data downloaded from central
applications. The time involved in reconciling these reports often adds many
hours to the financial close process, with errors and fraud being ever-present
dangers. 

The ClusterSeven solution allows IBM Cognos users to solve these problems by
moving at their own pace toward full spreadsheet control. Information is
presented through their familiar dashboards. At the most basic level,
controllers can simply receive a summary of business-critical spreadsheet
activity in their department. For more detailed needs, users can upgrade to a
full risk analysis, together with maps of all spreadsheet and data dependencies.
And for the most demanding controllers, ClusterSeven offers a full cell-level
audit trail and approval workflow enabling automatic reconciliations and rapid
explanations of business changes. 

"Business intelligence and spreadsheets will always be joined at the hip. With
this new transparency we can ensure our clients are aware of new areas of
critical spreadsheet activity," says Karl Mullins, CEO of Assimil8, an IBM
Business Partner. "We can then help them plan for its control or, if
appropriate, provide efficient replacement by extending their current IBM Cognos
environment." 

"For too long, critical information has been divided between the IT worlds of
central applications and the business world of spreadsheets. ClusterSeven
provides the bridge between them," says Ralph Baxter, CEO of ClusterSeven. 

About ClusterSeven

ClusterSeven (London and New York) provides enterprise-wide, strategic
spreadsheet and data management software to financial institutions and Fortune
500 financial reporting divisions. ClusterSeven`s software non-intrusively
monitors and tracks spreadsheets to enable users to more effectively manage
governance, risk and regulatory compliance obligations in order to generate
revenue, enhance staff efficiency and boost productivity. For more information

&lt;p&gt;Decision-Makers from K-12 Schools Across the Country to Demo Alternative Desktop
Leaders` New Technologies
KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Devon IT Inc., and business partners IBM and RedHat will present their
collaborative virtualization solution at the COSN 2009 Annual Conference in
booth #118 from March 10-12 in Austin, Texas. The event focuses on the use of
technology in K-12 classrooms and brings together key education and policy
makers from around the country. 

Devon, IBM and RedHat will showcase the latest virtualization technology.
Devon`s soon to be released next-generation thin client and mobile thin client
laptop, the SafeBook LVO, will be available for demo. Attendees will experience
firsthand why so many schools are making the switch from PCs to thin virtualized
desktops. 

"More and more schools that are looking to refresh their PCs shy away from
expensive, bulky, traditional desktop deployments and are exploring more
advanced thin clients," says Joe Makoid, President, Devon IT. "Schools have been
reluctant to sacrifice multimedia applications, but new thin client technologies
provide students with the same user experiences as traditional PCs and an
easier, more centralized management program for IT administrators. Coupled with
up-front hardware cost savings and a reduced overall total cost ownership, thin
client solutions are becoming more popular for schools with tight budgets. We
are excited to show our new technologies with IBM and RedHat at the COSN show." 

Devon IT, IBM and RedHat will be in booth #118. The COSN Annual Conference will
take place March 10-12, 2009 at the Hilton Austin in Austin, TX. For more

&lt;p&gt; (Adds ONGC chairman's quote, background, closing stock price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI, March 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said on Thursday
it had cut its earnings estimates on Indian energy explorer Oil
and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC.BO) by 15 percent for the year
ending March 31 due to falling volumes and higher costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also lowered its per share earnings forecast by 6-7
percent for the next two years, citing concerns about state-run
ONGC's overseas growth strategy and poor prospects from its
domestic fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Fifteen major fields of ONGC, which have been producting
for 25-30 years, accounted for 77 percent of ONGC's total
production in 2007/08 and have now started showing signs of
decline," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's expensive purchase of Russia-focused Imperial
Energy IEC.L this year for 1.3 billion pounds, a price agreed
upon when oil was around $130 a barrel against well below $50
now, was a political decision to help buy stakes in future
projects such as Sakhalin-III and IV, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Goldman also reiterated its sell on ONGC shares saying
excessive government interference limited any upside for the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We find it hard to own ONGC, given that it has hardly any
catalysts to surprise on the upside but has downside risk from
adverse government action," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It set a 12-month price target of 574 rupees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in ONGC, which have slumped almost a third in the
past one year, closed down 1.9 percent at 651.85 rupees in weak
a Mumbai market that dropped 2.9 percent to its lowest in more
than three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said the Indian government, which owns 74 percent
of the firm, had taken nearly $20 billion from ONGC since 2004,
without consulting minority shareholders, to subsidise
state-run refiners forced to retail fuel at below market
prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reacting to the report, ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma said the
issue had been openly discussed within the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is no compromise on corporate governance. The
decision to give subsidies has been taken after deliberation in
the board and everything has been done in a transparent
manner," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; India has a regulated fuel price regime whereby state-owned
oil marketing companies sell retail fuels at mandated
discounts, and are in turn compensated with oil bonds from the
government and subsidies from state-owned upstream companies
such as ONGC.

&lt;p&gt;Making it Easier for Consumers to Manage Health Information and Benefit Everyone
SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
MedImpact Healthcare Systems, Inc., today announced they are partnering with
Microsoft Corp. to transform the health care experience, making it easier for
consumers to securely store, access and share their health information using
Microsoft HealthVault. 

HealthVault enables consumers to store their individual health data or their
whole family`s health records-in one secure location. Consumers have complete
control over their information and can enable others to view their health data.
Using HealthVault, consumers can access medical, pharmacy, physician, health
plan, lab data, dental, radiology, and fitness data and can even upload
information from medical devices such as heart rate monitors. 

Members who receive pharmacy benefits through MedImpact will have the ability to
easily view their prescription information integrated with other health
information. Putting this access at the consumer`s fingertips will help
streamline health care delivery and will empower consumers to make informed and
timely choices. These services are expected to be available in the summer of
2009. 

"MedImpact`s adoption of web-based health care will help individuals become more
actively engaged in managing their health, and the health of their family
members," said Dr. James Mault, of Microsoft`s Health Solutions Group. He added
that, "MedImpact and HealthVault represent a new generation of consumer-centric
health care services that can empower individuals and their health providers to
make informed and cost-effective decisions about care and wellness." 

As members of the Center for Health Transformation (CHT), MedImpact and
Microsoft are committed to making it easier for consumers to proactively manage
their health. Health plans, health care providers, pharmacies, and employers all
benefit when consumers have the information they need to manage their health.
For example, consumers with a chronic condition such as hypertension can share
real-time blood pressure readings which streamlines communication and reduces
overall cost-so that everyone in the health care continuum benefits. 

"We are excited to partner with Microsoft to put the power of information at the
fingertips of the consumer. This transformation will bring even greater benefits
and value to our clients and to the members they serve," said Dale Brown, senior
vice president at MedImpact.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/fc5c85/social_computing_w) has
announced the addition of John Wiley and Sons Ltd's new report "Social Computing
with Microsoft SharePoint 2007: Implementing Applications for SharePoint to
Enable Collaboration and Interaction in the Enterprise" to their offering. 

Social computing is a fast-moving technology, and many of the concepts grow or
change every year. Use this book as part of your research for how you will
implement any of the social computing applications, but also use online research
for keeping updated on new changes to this exciting area of software today.
Although social computing applications can be written on any framework or even
on their own, we have taken a unique approach to help you understand the
landscape of social computing as it relates to SharePoint 2007. 

Each chapter introduces you to the concept of the chapter, for example, the RSS
chapter gives a brief overview of what RSS is and the history behind it. Then
the chapter provides a section of how this is possible with SharePoint 2007.
Finally, if there are any extensions that would make it easier to work with
social computing and SharePoint, such as open source code or products you can
buy, we briefly discuss these options so you are aware of them for your
organization. 

This book was written for anyone who is approaching social computing
applications for an enterprise. This would include developers, managers,
directors, and even C-level executives. This book is designed to help decision
makers learn about the concepts and understand how they might implement them in
their own company. Although this book does reach out to developers, most of the
chapters give examples with either built-in options and configuration or show
how to use code already installed on SharePoint. 

Key Topics Covered:

* 1. Intro. 
* 2. Taxonomy, site structure, governance (Building Effective Collaboration
Sites). 
* 3. Content Tagging.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Mar 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled new database software to help companies
make decisions more intelligently and maximize sales opportunities while
reducing expenses.

    With new Informix database software, global companies, for the first
time, can both warehouse their data and conduct ultra fast online
transactions with a simplified software platform. The combination of the
two capabilities in one offering can help deliver new results and
insights to grow businesses and lower costs by making it easier to use
existing Informix infrastructure to help clients work as much as 50% more
efficiently.

    To effectively compete in today's challenging global economy, companies
are now recognizing the need to use information more effectively. Right
now, 85% of CIOs do not believe their information is currently well
managed and shared across the entire business. In addition, most
companies lack a cohesive strategy to get the most value from their
information.

    "On a daily basis, our organization needs to extract patient data to track
outstanding claims that are long overdue. It used to take us months to
collect information that we are now able to retrieve in a matter of
minutes," said Dan Contaldi, vice president, Information Technology,
Women's Health. "Now, this technology allows more time for our central
billing staff to focus on the business rather than spending hours sifting
through the maze of outstanding claims. We see the addition of the
Informix warehousing capabilities providing a complete and cost efficient
solution."

    Konkan Railways in India uses this technology for its "Railway Application
Package" system to help analyze and maintain train schedules to reduce the
likelihood of passenger delays. Not only does this help the railway
operate more efficiently, but it has also seen significant energy savings.
By automating the light-switching at stations as trains arrive and depart,
the system has helped the railway cut energy costs by approximately 20%.

    IMPIRE AG, Germany's largest provider of premium sporting content for live
sporting event broadcasts, uses Informix software. IMPIRE is able to bring
the most up-to-date sports replays and analysis across television, print,
web and mobile services. The new warehouse capabilities will make it even
easier for IMPIRE to build on its Informix foundation to continue to meet
the demand of sports fans who want sports scores instantaneously.

    Customers in all industries, including healthcare, retail and
manufacturing, can take advantage of this instantaneous access to
information with analytical capabilities to understand market and customer
trends. For example, the new software can help retailers easily access and
organize data from store, Web, catalog sales and internal inventory and
merchandising systems to help analyze future buying trends and, in turn,
make smarter business decisions.

    "Today, the volume of information is growing exponentially from a variety
of different sources. We are seeing a growing number of clients who need
to manage the velocity of decision making required to be competitive, and
the nature of what can be analyzed to predict new business
opportunities," said Arvind Krishna, vice president, IBM Worldwide
Information Management Development. "The Informix warehouse platform can
help companies manage their data more cost effectively with a simplified
design and deployment using their existing Informix investments."

    IBM Informix Dynamic Server (IDS) is a strategic element of IBM's
Information Management software portfolio, which includes database
management software that delivers exceptionally fast OLTP performance,
high reliability and low cost administration.

    IDS is a leading DBMS (database management systems) in many industries
such as retail, telecommunications, government/public sector, and travel
and entertainment. In North America alone, IDS is used in critical
business applications by eight of the top 10 U.S. retailers and 95% of
global telecommunications companies. Informix was named the #1 Vendor of
2008 in VendorRate due to input from its loyal customer base.

    The Informix Warehouse Feature will be available to Informix customers
worldwide beginning on March 5, 2009. Customers, developers and partners
can find out more about this offering at www.ibm.com/informix/warehouse.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, March 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) said on Thursday it has no plan to sell its 5 percent
stake in the National Stock Exchange of India, refuting a local
media report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Contrary to a Mumbai newspaper report today, Goldman Sachs
currently has no plans to dispose of its five percent interest in
the National Stock Exchange of India nor is it engaged in any
discussions in relation to the sale of this investment," Goldman
Sachs spokesman Edward Naylor said in an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs along with the New York Stock Exchange
NYX.PANYX.N, private equity firm General Atlantic and
Softbank's Asian infrastructure fund bought a 20 percent stake in
the NSE, India's largest bourse, for $490 million in 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is
developing a feature in its new operating system that allows
users to turn off Internet Explorer and other key Microsoft
programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The new feature is a major step for the world's largest
software company, which has been accused by competitors and
regulators of forcing consumers to run its own software,
squeezing rivals' offerings out of the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In addition to the features that were already available to
turn on or off in Windows Vista, we've added the following
features to the list in Windows 7," said a Microsoft blog
published on Friday, listing Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media
Player and a host of other Microsoft programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The publicly available blog
(here
 turning-windows-features-on-or-off.aspx) was written by Jack
May o, a manager in the team developing Microsoft's new Windows
7 operating system, which will replace the unpopular Vista
early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new design will make it easier for users to remove any
traces of Internet Explorer from their desktop, although the
software will remain installed on the computer, and allow them
to run other browsers more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month Google Inc (GOOG.O), which recently launched its
own Chrome browser, joined the Mozilla foundation, producer of
the Firefox Web browser, and Norway's Opera, in protesting
Microsoft's dominance in the browser market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In January, European regulators brought formal charges
against Microsoft for abusing its dominant market position by
bundling its Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows
operating system, which is used in 95 percent of the world's
personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the past decade, Microsoft has fallen afoul of both U.S.
and European antitrust regulators for bundling key programs
with its operating system.

financial institutions that received payouts from American
International Group Inc (AIG.N) since the Federal Reserve first
began to aid AIG, according to the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM is unlikely to bid for Satyam Computer Services Ltd as the advantage of expanding in India is outweighed by the legal and financial risks related to Satyam's accounting scandal, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satyam SATY.BO SAY.N won regulatory approval on Friday to sell a majority stake in itself, about two months after founder and Chairman Ramalinga Raju admitted the information technology outsourcer's profits had been inflated for years and its assets falsified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, India's Business Standard newspaper said International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) was the "front-runner" to buy Satyam and had brought in a team of bankers and lawyers from the United States and Europe to India to assess the deal size and risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that IBM had not flown a team to India and was unlikely to be interested in bidding for Satyam. It is unclear whether IBM, which declined to comment, has hired financial advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors of IBM's interest in Satyam have circulated for years, as the two compete on technology outsourcing and computer-related services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying Satyam, India's fourth-largest software exporter, could help IBM expand its geographic presence, but analysts say the Armonk, New York-based company already has a lead in India with customers that include top wireless provider Bharti Airtel(BRTI.BO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to Satyam, IBM -- the world's largest technology services company -- also offers a fuller range of software and services including high-end consulting projects that bring in high margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM already has a brand in India," said Susquehanna Financial Group analyst James Friedman. "I don't know that Satyam is going to help that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if IBM were interested, it would be tough to get a fair assessment of Satyam's valuation, making an acquisition difficult, Friedman added.

HP and CSC declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But HP is still digesting its $13.9 billion acquisition of IT services provider Electronic Data Systems, and CSC may not have the financial wherewithal to buy Satyam, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's Larsen  Toubro Ltd (LART.BO), which controls about 12 percent of Satyam, and diversified companies Spice Group and Hinduja Group have expressed interest in Satyam but said they had not decided whether to bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOME ASSETS COMPELLING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satyam provides back office operations to more than 600 global customers, including General Electric Co (GE.N) and Qantas Airways (QAN.AX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two technology bankers suggested IBM might look at buying some Satyam assets rather than a majority stake.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Mar 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced that it has ranked #3 overall on the 100 Best
Corporate Citizens List, outranking all other information technology
companies on the list. The annual list is published by the Corporate
Responsibility Officer (CRO) Magazine.

    CRO's 100 Best Corporate Citizens List is the only such list based on 100%
publicly-available information and ranks Russell 1000 companies on their
performance in seven key areas: Environment, Climate Change, Human Rights,
Philanthropy, Employee Relations, Financial and Governance.

    "Some believe the current economic climate dictates corporate citizenship
efforts be put on hold. At IBM we believe just the opposite. A strong
commitment to corporate citizenship strengthens our brand and increases
shareholder value," said Stanley S. Litow, vice president of Corporate
Citizenship and Corporate Affairs at IBM. "Improved environmental
performance, intelligent community partnerships and investments make us
competitive. They are not separate; they are an integral part of business
strategy."

    IBM's 2007-2008 Corporate Responsibility Report was issued in November
reflecting how social and business strategies are connected and
integrated and includes performance and results in the areas of
governance, supply chain, environmental performance, employment policies
and practices, client solutions and community engagements.

    "The performance of IBM reflects its newly-energized corporate
responsibility, transparency and public disclosure efforts that build on
consistently high levels of corporate citizenship practice, as it has made
the List for nearly all of the past 10 years," said Jay Whitehead,
publisher, CRO.

&lt;p&gt;March 6 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities lowered its
second-quarter and fiscal 2009 earnings and revenue estimates
for Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on a deepening macro-economic downturn.
Analyst Mark Moskowitz also cut his outlook for Mac and iPhone
unit shipments in the second quarter, saying inputs from
industry contacts suggest that Mac and iPhone volumes have been
trending below expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Apple shares fell almost 6 percent in early trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In prior recessions, the consumer had been fairly
resilient, but mounting job losses, shrinking home values, and
tight credit stand to make the current recession quite more
challenging," Moskowitz wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moskowitz said he estimates Apple derives 70 to 75 percent
of its revenue from the consumer vertical, due to which the
next few quarters stand to get "bumpy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He cut his second-quarter earnings estimate for Apple by 1
cent to $1.01 a share, and revenue estimate to $7.62 billion
from $7.72 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moskowitz cut his estimate for Mac unit shipments in the
second quarter to 2.19 million from 2.39 million, and iPhone
unit shipments estimate to 3.4 million from 3.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst also lowered his fiscal 2009 earnings estimate
for Apple to $4.73 a share from $4.82, and revenue estimate to
$32.98 billion from $33.97 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Notwithstanding the current macro pains, we believe the
company's content-driven product portfolio is capable of a
multi-year revenue outperformance relative to its peers,"
Moskowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He cut his price target on the stock to $100 from $102, but
maintained his "overweight" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company fell $4.97 to $83.87 in early morning
trade on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC turned negative and fell
to a 6-year intraday low, weighed by declines in large-cap
technology companies including Apple and Qualcomm (QCOM.O).

&lt;p&gt;March 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs removed Amgen Inc
(AMGN.O) from its Americas conviction buy list saying that the
risk premium for healthcare stocks had risen and that Amgen was
more exposed to negative sentiment than its peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs cut its price target on Amgen to $62 from $70
and said the implied upside of 31 percent was less compelling
than the other stocks on the conviction buy list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said the risk premium of healthcare stocks
had risen on concerns about healthcare reform but said Amgen's
fundamentals were intact and maintained its "buy" rating on the
biotechnology company's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it expected legislation on follow-on
biologics to gain momentum but that the exclusivity period
would likely be more than the five years for traditional
pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the patent expiration of Epogen and Enbrel in 2012
and white blood cell booster, Neupogen, in 2013 is not new, the
brokerage said it expects that Amgen may be more exposed to
negative sentiments than its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amgen shares were down $1.10 at $46.10 in morning trade on
Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Macy's Inc (M.N)
to its America's conviction buy list from "neutral" and said
the company has "greater earnings deliverability," driven by
cost savings from its centralization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Macy's shares rose as much as 13 percent in early trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, Macy's unveiled a plan to integrate its
business divisions into one unit. The plan aims at centralizing
its buying and merchandise planning primarily in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Adrianne Shapira said centralization efforts have
been well executed and present $400 million in annual cost
savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe this cost savings lever should help blunt
top-line and margin pressures - a key advantage that its peers
do not have," Shapira said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Macy's is a market share gainer in the consolidating
department store sector, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Macy's management has taken meaningful steps, including
cutting its capital expenditures and dividend, to alleviate
balance sheet concerns, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As same-store sales declines moderate, shares are expected
to rise, Shapira wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised its price target on the department
store chain by 25 cents to $8.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the Cincinnati-based company rose 87 cents to
$7.45, before shedding some of the gains to trade up 54 cents
at $7.12 later in the morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;CALI, Colombia (Reuters) - Colombian soccer champions America de Cali are first to admit cocaine dollars had a hand in their sporting heyday. But after years of paying the price, they're trying to wipe the slate clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "Red Devils" became mired in financial troubles after their drug lord patrons in the Cali Cartel were jailed in 1995, ending a windfall of ill-gotten wealth that helped the club assemble one of South America's priciest lineups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Cali's popular mayor is leading a campaign to have the team removed from a U.S. government anti-drugs blacklist that has prevented them from having a local bank account or even getting sponsors for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The situation's more and more unbearable," said the club's weary-looking president, Carlos Puente, in the America Sporting Corporation's modest headquarters in downtown Cali.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Undeniably, drug traffickers had some economic influence here but it wasn't just in this club, it was in any number of Colombian teams ... Traditionally this sport hasn't had the cleanest management," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina, an America fan, wants to relaunch the debt-laden club as a new, legal company, and at the same time show his city has turned over a new leaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s and early 90s, the steamy city was flush with drug money that bankrolled everything from property developments to a cosmetic surgery boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cali has undergone a face-lift since cartel kingpins Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez were locked up. The promotional possibilities of a successful soccer team are not lost on officials at city hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The mayor wants to show this is a new Cali," said project leader Jaime Gutierrez, who at 25 represents a new generation of officials seeking to chart a different course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to break with the past and say to the people, 'Don't bad-mouth your city, don't destroy your city, don't leave your city'," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cali's drive to improve its image fits well with President Alvaro Uribe's efforts to lure foreign investors and tourists to Colombia by cracking down on leftist rebels, armed gangs and drug traffickers in the world's top cocaine producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUDGETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombian soccer and drug trafficking used to go hand-in-hand and violence has sometimes spilled onto the pitch, with referees and players being bribed and even murdered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1993, drug boss Pablo Escobar was buried with an Atletico Nacional flag draped over his coffin. The following year, defender Andres Escobar was shot dead after scoring an own goal that knocked Colombia out of the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in few clubs were the murky links between the drugs cartels and sport as strong as at America. Stories abound of match-fixing, money-laundering and players being rewarded with lavish parties and prostitutes courtesy of the Cartel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One former player sparked controversy in 1997 by dedicating a winning goal to "those who've been deprived of their liberty, especially Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, America draw crowds of up to 18,000 and their first national championship win in six years in December has given impetus to the mayor's campaign. One of Colombia's best-known clubs, they claim hundreds of thousands of fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Ospina hopes to find up to 4,000 shareholders willing to put up a million pesos each, or around $400, to relaunch the club as Nueva (New) America de Cali later this year. Investors will be checked for criminal links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation cannot come too soon for coach Diego Umana, who is credited with guiding the young, mostly home-grown team to last year's championship on one of the league's lowest budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the players, Umana gets paid with wads of cash from the turnstile receipts. During a recent hospital check-up, he realized his health insurance had not been paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had to pay it myself. Sometimes a player takes one of their kids, and they don't have any coverage," said Umana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The club deserved to be put on (the U.S. blacklist), but that's in the past. Times have changed," he said, sitting next to the pool at the Cali hotel where the team were resting before a Libertadores Cup clash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PUNISHMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While league rivals have lucrative sponsorship deals and play exhibition games in the United States, America has relied on sell promising young players and gate receipts, which have been robbed on at least one occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sponsorship deals have been low-key and short-lived. Most bigger companies are not interested because of the economic sanctions against the club, fearing they too could get into trouble with U.S. authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The club even had to set up their own factory to make the players' uniforms. America's managers and fans say it is time for such punishment to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the wind of change blowing through the club, two years from now we'll be setting the standard for the whole of South America," Puente said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Washington will ultimately decide whether the mayor's plans will be enough to get the club off the blacklist kept by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ospina will also have to win over Colombia's National Narcotics Board, or DNE, which has a stake in the club seized from people suspected of links to drug traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its share has increased since several more members of the Rodriguez family were arrested on money-laundering charges last month, although the arrests may help ease concerns about the clan's lingering influence at America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Cali, there is optimism for America's future among die-hard fans like Estella Castellanos, 64, who went to her first Red Devils game 58 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thanks to this process everything's going to turn out right for America," said Castellanos, who plans to become a shareholder by paying in monthly installments from her pension.

&lt;p&gt;March 6 (Reuters) - JP Morgan upgraded Family Dollar Stores
Inc (FDO.N) a notch to "neutral" on Friday, a day after the
discount retailer posted comparable sales much above analyst
estimates, and also raised its price target on the stock by $10
to $29.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which removed the stock from its focus list,
said "it is clear to us that being underweight, the stock in
this macro backdrop is fighting an uphill battle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, analysts led by Charles Grom said they continued
to prefer "overweight"-rated Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O) and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) for those investors looking for
retailers with exposure to the lower-income arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Family Dollar is among those who cater to lower-income
shoppers, many of whom make less than $30,000 a year and have
been hit hard by the year-long U.S. recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, the company, which sells most of its
merchandise for below $10, reported a 6.4 percent rise in
second-quarter same-store sales, which was above estimates for
a 3.6 percent gain, on strong sales of consumables like laundry
detergent or soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As with almost every other retailer in our space, apparel
remained soft... but with consumables penetration representing
over 66 percent of the mix (and growing), we believe that
Family Dollar is well suited to weather the storm," the analyst
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Grom said more consumables in the company's
product mix is negatively hurting margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Family Dollar closed at $30.66 Thursday on the
New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co, the world's largest soft drinks maker, said on Friday it will invest $2 billion in new plant and distribution infrastructure in the next three years in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company would also speed up development to ensure products suit local taste, it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $2 billion investment comes in addition to the $2.4 billion already committed to Huiyuan Juice Group, a company spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asset prices have come down amid the global financial crisis, which triggered concerns that the Coca-Cola's takeover bid for Huiyuan may not go through. Huiyuan's share price, which edged up 0.66 percent on Friday, was traded a quarter below Coca-Cola's offer of HK$12.2 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Huiyuan Juice, the country's top juice maker, said earlier this week it was not aware of any changes in Coca-Cola's bid for the company and said the U.S. company would be obliged to make the offer if pre-conditions were met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the bid is successful, it would be the largest acquisition of a Chinese firm by a foreign rival. The deal is pending Chinese government approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our commitment and confidence in China never wavers," Muhtar Kent, president and CEO of Coca-Cola, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's largest innovation and technology center in Asia was opened in Shanghai on Friday. The $90 million center was part of a three-year investment plan in China, it added.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Coca-Cola FEMSA Well-Positioned

We are keeping our Buy recommendation on Coca-Cola FEMSA SA de CV (NYSE: KOF).
The company posted positive operating results for the 4th quarter of 2008,
mainly considering the difficult economic situation. 

Moreover, the results in the Mercosur and Latincentro division were particularly
impressive. The recent acquisitions will enhance company's top-line growth
despite the difficult economic environment throughout the world. 

Weatherford to Start Paying Off

Weatherford International Ltd (NYSE: WFT) is a leading manufacturer and provider
of equipment and services used in drilling, completion, and production of oil
and natural gas wells. The company reorganized its operations along geographical
lines, creating the 4 new segments of North America, Latin America, Europe/West
Africa/CIS, and Middle East/North Africa/Asia. 

Weatherford's 4th-quarter 2008 earnings, though modestly lower than our
estimates, were above the year-earlier levels. Looking forward, a positive
outlook for its integrated project management expertise, an improved cost
structure in North America, and an expected double-digit growth in international
business will help the company to weather current downturn. 

Better Times Ahead for Durect

Durect Corp (NASDAQ: DRRX) has had a rocky past few months. The stock was hit
harder than we expected in December 2008 when the FDA rejected the application
on Remoxy. From our standpoint, the rejection of the NDA was not a surprise, but
the reaction for Durect stock was. 

Nevertheless, we think the FDA's issues -- most likely around the labeling, the
abuse ability and the risk management program -- should only delay final
approval by a year. We think that Remoxy will be on the market and generating
royalties for Durect by the middle of 2010. 

The 2nd big sell-off in the stock came in early March 2009 when Durect announced
that Transdur development partner, Endo Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ENDP), was
returning U.S. and Canadian rights to the product to Durect. The news came as a
big shock to us considering the duo just recently met with the FDA for an
"end-of-phase II" meeting and outlined a path to approval with a phase III
program. 

Jones Lang Best in Tough Market

Chicago-based Jones Lang LaSalle Inc (NYSE: JLL) is a leading full-service real
estate firm that provides corporate, financial, and investment management
services. The company caters to corporations and other real estate owners,
users, and investors worldwide. 

JLL reported net income of $1.17 per share in 4Q08 compared to $3.16 in 4Q07.
Full year earnings were $2.44 per share vs. $7.64 in 2007. Excluding
nonrecurring charges, full year earnings were $3.71 per share. The company's
Americas region performed well in the quarter while Asia and Europe lagged.
Transaction and leasing volumes declined in 2008, and this year will not be much
better.

&lt;p&gt; (Add details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, March 6 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), the
world's largest soft drinks maker, said on Friday it will invest
$2 billion in new plant and distribution infrastructure in the
next three years in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company would also speed up development to ensure
products suit local taste, it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $2 billion investment comes in addition to the $2.4
billion already committed to Huiyuan Juice Group (1886.HK), a
company spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asset prices have come down amid the global financial crisis,
which triggered concerns that the Coca-Cola's takeover bid for
Huiyuan may not go through. Huiyuan's share price, which edged up
0.66 percent on Friday, was traded a quarter below Coca-Cola's
offer of HK$12.2 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Huiyuan Juice, the country's top juice maker, said
earlier this week it was not aware of any changes in Coca-Cola's
bid for the company and said the U.S. company would be obliged to
make the offer if pre-conditions were met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the bid is successful, it would be the largest acquisition
of a Chinese firm by a foreign rival. The deal is pending Chinese
government approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our commitment and confidence in China never wavers," Muhtar
Kent, president and CEO of Coca-Cola, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's largest innovation and technology centre in
Asia was opened in Shanghai on Friday. The $90 million centre was
part of a three-year investment plan in China, it added.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is developing a feature in its new operating system that allows users to turn off Internet Explorer and other key Microsoft programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new feature is a major step for the world's largest software company, which has been accused by competitors and regulators of forcing consumers to run its own software, squeezing rivals' offerings out of the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In addition to the features that were already available to turn on or off in Windows Vista, we've added the following features to the list in Windows 7," said a Microsoft blog published on Friday, listing Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player and a host of other Microsoft programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publicly available blog (here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;turning-windows-features-on-or-off.aspx) was written by Jack May o, a manager in the team developing Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system, which will replace the unpopular Vista early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new design will make it easier for users to remove any traces of Internet Explorer from their desktop, although the software will remain installed on the computer, and allow them to run other browsers more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month Google Inc, which recently launched its own Chrome browser, joined the Mozilla foundation, producer of the Firefox Web browser, and Norway's Opera, in protesting Microsoft's dominance in the browser market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, European regulators brought formal charges against Microsoft for abusing its dominant market position by bundling its Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows operating system, which is used in 95 percent of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, Microsoft has fallen afoul of both U.S. and European antitrust regulators for bundling key programs with its operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Clarence Fernandez.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *Disney to cut carbon emissions from fuels by half by 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *Disney aims to cut some emissions to zero, not date cited
 (Adds comments, annual audits, share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co said on
Monday that it planned to cut carbon emissions from fuels by
half by 2012, and ultimately to achieve net zero direct
greenhouse gas emissions at its office and retail complexes,
theme parks and cruise lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney (DIS.N) also set a long-term goal to cut to zero the
amount of waste it sends to landfills -- which totaled nearly
300,000 tons in 2006, much of it from construction, through
diverting some to recycling centers, composting and buying more
post-consumer recycled materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company pledged to reduce water use as well as
emissions and waste associated with the manufacture, transport,
use and disposal of Disney products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beth Stevens, senior vice president of environmental
affairs, said Disney has "not put a definite time horizon" on
taking emissions to zero and may have to rely in part on
technology that is still under development to reach that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We set those (goals) because they were very aspirational,"
Stevens said. "We thought it was important ... to communicate a
sense of commitment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The environmental plan was released a day ahead of Disney's
annual shareholder meeting, in its "corporate responsibility"
report. The entertainment conglomerate is joining a growing
number of U.S. corporations that have pledged to improve carbon
and ecological footprints by a certain date, or have already
done so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Current scientific conclusions indicate that urgent
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are required to avert
accelerated climate change," the report said. "A successful
response to these challenges demands fundamental changes in the
way society, including businesses, use natural resources, and
Disney is no exception."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney worked with Conservation International on emissions
reduction targets, and plans to have a third party monitor its
progress through annual audits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a good effort on transparency and disclosure,"
Rev. David Schilling, program director for the Interfaith
Center on Corporate Responsibility. But he noted that the
report lacks some benchmarks and measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are giving the message, 'Stay tuned, this is where we
are starting,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  By 2013, Disney plans to reduce electricity consumption by
10 percent compared with its 2006 baseline at existing assets,
and to develop a plan to "aggressively" pursue renewable
electricity sources, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To get to zero net direct emissions, Disney plans to find
efficiencies to cut emissions and to replace high-carbon fuels
with low-carbon alternatives, then use "high-quality offsets"
for what is left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney also plans to buy clean electricity from utilities
and invest in clean electricity projects, in addition to taking
steps to conserve, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company set 2013 as its goal for cutting solid waste to
landfills by half of its 2006 baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares fell 24 cents, or 1.52 percent, to $15.59 on
the New York Stock Exchange.

will be a member of the corporation`s Management Committee. 

Throughout his career, Mr. Swiger has held a variety of technical and managerial
positions in production, operations, engineering, planning and gas and power
marketing. He joined Mobil Corporation in 1978 and after several assignments in
Louisiana, London, New York, Fairfax and Calgary, he transferred to Aberdeen as

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is trading modestly higher this afternoon
following some positive comments from a Credit Suisse analyst. The brokerage
firm analyst believes the economic crisis will strengthen KO's long-term
earnings potential, and may help rival PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) take share from
weaker competitors in certain international markets. Analyst C. Laboy upgraded
KO to "outperform" from "neutral," and said the company has strong local
operations in key markets outside the U.S., and its earnings visibility is
superior to most companies. 

In a note to clients, Laboy commented, "We also believe that the underlying
health of the Coke system will improve through this crisis while others erode."
Also, Latin American bottlers are in prime financial condition and making
extraordinary investments in the company. Laboy also increased his price target
for KO from $47 to $48.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co said on Monday that it planned to cut carbon emissions from fuels by half by 2012, and ultimately to achieve net zero direct greenhouse gas emissions at its office and retail complexes, theme parks and cruise lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney also set a long-term goal to cut to zero the nearly 300,000 tons of waste it sends to landfills, much of it from construction, through diverting some to recycling centers, composting and buying more post-consumer recycled materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company pledged to reduce water use as well as emissions and waste associated with the manufacture, transport, use and disposal of Disney products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The environmental plan was released a day ahead of the company's annual shareholder meeting in its "corporate responsibility" report. The entertainment conglomerate is joining a growing number of U.S. corporations that have pledged to improve carbon and ecological footprints by a certain date, or have already done so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Current scientific conclusions indicate that urgent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are required to avert accelerated climate change," the report said.

&lt;p&gt;Complaints to Be Filed in Ecuador and United States
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Amazonian leaders today blasted James Craig, an American public relations
official with Chevron affiliated with the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency,
for undermining a long-running environmental trial in Ecuador where the oil
giant faces a $27 billion liability for dumping toxic waste into the rainforest.


"Chevron is using James Craig as a hit man to sabotage a trial in Ecuador
because it expects to lose and be on the hook for billions of dollars," said
Luis Yanza, a representative for the dozens of communities and indigenous groups
that brought the lawsuit. 

"James Craig`s behavior is unethical and shows a profound disregard for the
law," added Yanza, a recent winner of the Goldman Environmental Award,
considered the "Nobel" prize of the environmental movement. 

Yanza said his group, the Amazon Defense Coalition, would file a complaint
against Chevron and Craig before the Better Business Bureau and applicable
professional associations in the U.S. and Ecuador. The lawsuit accuses Texaco
(now Chevron) of dumping more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into Amazon
waterways, leading to an outbreak of cancer and other oil-related health
problems. 

Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, was the exclusive operator of large oil
concession in Ecuador`s rainforest from 1964 to 1990. In addition to the
dumping, the company abandoned more than 900 toxic waste pits gouged out of the
jungle floor which are still leaching toxic sludge into soils, streams and
groundwater, according to scientific evidence in the case. 

A former reporter, Craig was hired several months ago by Chevron`s legal
department as a spokesman after it became clear that the company`s Ecuadorian
counsel was refusing to defend Chevron in the press. Craig recently purchased
several large advertisements in a leading Ecuadorian newspaper accusing the
trial court of "fraud" for proceeding with the lawsuit, despite the fact Chevron
had previously asked a U.S. federal judge to transfer the case to Ecuador by
arguing its courts were fair and adequate. 

The advertisements attack the Ecuadorian judge, the court-appointed scientific
expert who conducted the damages assessment, and lawyers for the plaintiffs.
They appeared under Craig`s name in El Comercio, considered the leading
newspaper in Ecuador, and were paid for by Norlop Thompson, a local affiliate of
J. Walter Thompson (known as JWT). Chevron`s logo is at the top of the
advertisements. 

Steven Donziger, an American legal advisor to the plaintiffs, said Craig bought
the advertising as part of Chevron`s campaign to intimidate the court and
"smear" the reputation of the court-appointed expert who supervised the damages
assessment. Buying advertisements to influence the outcome of a trial or to
intimidate court personnel is prohibited in the U.S. and might subject lawyers
to court sanctions, Donziger said. 

The court expert targeted by the advertisements, Professor Richard Cabrera, was
used by Chevron as an expert in a previous phase of the case. Only when the
judge later appointed Cabrera to determine damages did Chevron find him
unacceptable because it signaled the trial would soon end, said Donziger. 

"Chevron is not accustomed to losing lawsuits to the world`s downtrodden so they
are adopting increasingly desperate litigation tactics that never would be
allowed in a U.S. court," said Donziger. "This is a modern-day version of
Texaco`s decades-long pattern in Ecuador of deceiving indigenous groups and
abusing the court system." 

"Craig`s job is to steamroll the court but it is backfiring because it looks so
transparently foolish," added Donziger. 

Donziger said Craig`s strategy should be known by Chevron shareholders because
it is intended to hide a significant financial liability. Two Chevron lawyers
and seven former government officials are under criminal indictment in Ecuador
for lying about the results of a purported clean-up, a fact the company has not
disclosed in its public filings. 

Although the environmental case was first filed in U.S. federal court in New
York in 1993, Chevron was able to transfer the case to Ecuador in 2002 by
submitting ten expert affidavits praising the courts there as fair. Once the
evidence in the Ecuador trial started to point to Chevron`s culpability, the oil
giant began to attack the trial process as unfair. 

According to the court expert, all 94 of Chevron`s former production sites in
Ecuador are extensively contaminated with toxins, including carcinogens such as
Chromium IV. Most of the scientific evidence he relied on was provided by
Chevron. 

Craig is not the only Chevron consultant to come under fire recently. Douglas
Southgate, a professor at Ohio State University hired by Chevron to defend its
actions in Ecuador, is affiliated with a think tank that denies global warming
is linked to human activity. One of Chevron`s leading scientific advisors on the
case is Ralph Marquez, a former lobbyist for the chemical industry in Texas. 

"Chevron is trying to undermine the ability of rainforest residents to exercise
their legal rights," said Yanza. "It`s sad to see a well-known American oil
company behave this way when America as a country seems to be moving in a new
direction."

 (Recasts; adds analyst comments, details; updates share
movement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Savio D'Souza&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGALORE, March 9 (Reuters) - MannKind Corp (MNKD.O) said
it agreed to buy Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) insulin plant in Germany
and a manufacturing license for $33 million, giving it the
right to make its own insulin and a bargaining chip when it
starts partnership talks for its inhaled-insulin product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The actual facility is not the most important thing. The
key point here is that the company now has two things - an
inventory of insulin and a license to manufacture insulin for
pulmonary delivery," said Jason Butler, an analyst with Rodman
 Renshaw LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MannKind has now secured a supply of insulin for the
marketing of its ultra-rapid-acting inhaled-insulin product,
Afresa -- which met its main late-stage goal in December -- and
that will likely lower the cost of producing the finished
product, Butler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The assured supply of insulin would also be a point of
strength as partnership negotiations for Afresa progress later
this year, Butler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides the facility at Industriepark Hoechst, Frankfurt,
MannKind would also buy assets related to bulk insulin
production, relevant real property rights and production
equipment, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BARGAIN PRICE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal requires that MannKind get approval from the
operator of the facility as well as Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA),
which holds the right of first refusal on the sale of the real
property rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if it does not get the required approvals, the company
still walks away with bulk insulin, the license to manufacture
bulk insulin and certain removable equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butler said the deal, worth $3 million in cash and an
option to issue $30 million worth of stock, was at a "bargain
price" as it would help gross margins since the cost of
manufacturing insulin would be less than contract buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In today's environment, where cash is the most important
thing, they are only laying out $3 million. The price would be
lesser than $33 million if the approvals are not obtained,"
said Butler, who has a "market outperform" rating and a $7.00
price target on the MannKind stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a regulatory filing, Valencia, California-based MannKind
said it plans to retain about 80 of the 148 employees at the
facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plant has been fully validated as a manufacturing
facility for U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved insulin
products, which was an added benefit if the company decided to
produce Afresa there, Butler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late last month, the company extended its submission date
for the New Drug Application for Afresa by about three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of MannKind were trading up 6 percent, or 14 cents,
at $2.31 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq. They had touched a high
of $2.48 earlier in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer was down 10 cents at $12.62 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

The Walt Disney Company today announced a landmark set of strategic

taking ambitious steps to help preserve our planet for future generations," said
Disney Senior Executive Vice President and CFO Thomas O. Staggs.

such a challenging time in the global economy," said Peter Seligmann, Chairman
and CEO of Conservation International. "Disney`s vision underscores the
continued interest in the environment among people worldwide and the growing
recognition that environmental leadership can help revitalize the economy."
Conservation International provided advice to Disney on its new goals and
targets. 

The 2008 Corporate Responsibility Report represents the latest phase in Disney`s
longstanding heritage of corporate social responsibility and reflects a

&lt;p&gt; (Adds more analyst comments, background, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 9 (Reuters) - Barclays Capital cut its price targets
on Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and said it
expects the former investment-banking giants to post losses for
December, mostly due to asset markdowns, investment losses and
"very subdued" core earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 4 percent while those of
Morgan Stanley fell more than 5 percent Monday morning on the
New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, shares of both companies recouped some of their
early losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Roger Freeman estimated that Morgan Stanley lost 40
cents a share in December and Goldman Sachs $1.80 a share for
the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both companies changed their fiscal year end to Dec. 31
from Nov. 30, and will report results for December separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank-holding
companies regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve in September,
after Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK failed, Merrill Lynch agreed
to be bought and the financial markets spun out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freeman cut his share-price target on Goldman Sachs by 26
percent to $100, and on Morgan Stanley by 6 percent to $30. He
maintained an "equal-weight" rating on both companies.
[ID:nWNAB1604]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst expects both firms to turn profitable in the
first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With the improving mix of businesses after incorporating
the Smith Barney JV, we believe Morgan Stanley's earnings
stream is looking increasingly stable," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In January, Citigroup (C.N) agreed to merge its Smith
Barney brokerage with Morgan Stanley's wealth-management unit,
in which Morgan Stanley will initially own 51 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman Sachs were trading down 7 cents at $75.58
while those of Morgan Stanley were down 20 cents at $16.98
Monday afternoon.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is developing a feature in its new operating system that allows users to turn off Internet Explorer and other key Microsoft programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new feature is a major step for the world's largest software company, which has been accused by competitors and regulators of forcing consumers to run its own software, squeezing rivals' offerings out of the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In addition to the features that were already available to turn on or off in Windows Vista, we've added the following features to the list in Windows 7," said a Microsoft blog published on Friday, listing Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player and a host of other Microsoft programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publicly available blog (here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;turning-windows-features-on-or-off.aspx) was written by Jack May o, a manager in the team developing Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system, which will replace the unpopular Vista early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new design will make it easier for users to remove any traces of Internet Explorer from their desktop, although the software will remain installed on the computer, and allow them to run other browsers more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month Google Inc, which recently launched its own Chrome browser, joined the Mozilla foundation, producer of the Firefox Web browser, and Norway's Opera, in protesting Microsoft's dominance in the browser market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, European regulators brought formal charges against Microsoft for abusing its dominant market position by bundling its Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows operating system, which is used in 95 percent of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, Microsoft has fallen afoul of both U.S. and European antitrust regulators for bundling key programs with its operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Clarence Fernandez.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it expects GE
Capital, the finance arm of U.S. conglomerate General Electric
Co (GE.N), to be near breakeven in 2009 and a stress test to
result in a capital deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; However, last week, GE Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin
said he expects GE Capital to be profitable this quarter and
for the full-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sherin also said that the unit has no short-term liquidity
issues, and speculation about its ability to maintain
sufficient capital was "overdone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GE said it would disclose the results of a recent stress
test of its finance business when it reports first-quarter
results in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Losses from GE Capital could approach 7 percent to 8
percent of its total assets through 2010, Goldman Sachs analyst
Richard Ramsden said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At year-end 2008, 53 percent of GECS loans are outside the
US, where losses will likely accelerate through 2009," said the
analyst, who nearly halved his price target on the stock to $7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramsden said Eastern Europe, where GE Capital has $27
billion of assets, remains an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst lowered his 2009 and 2010 profit estimates for
the world's largest maker of jet engines and
electricity-producing turbines, citing macro pressures on the
industrial and financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lowered his earnings-per-share estimates to 92 cents
from $1.20 for 2009, and to 70 cents from $1.20 for 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were up 4.5 percent at $7.38 in
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;DOHA (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is in constant dialogue with Baghdad to create the investment climate that would allow it to become a significant player in Iraq's energy sector, Exxon's chief executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest publicly traded company is in the race for contracts to work on Iraq's biggest oilfields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq, which sits on the world's third-largest oil reserves, needs billions of dollars of foreign investment to overhaul its oil sector and boost output after years of sanctions and war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope Iraq creates the conditions that will allow a company like Exxon Mobil to be a participant in a significant way," Chief Executive Rex Tillerson told Reuters in an interview ahead of an energy conference in Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the dialogue we are having with them to make them understand what conditions will be necessary for us... to take risk with our capital and have the opportunity to be successful over the long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq is drawing up the contract terms for a bidding round for six giant fields, which together hold more than a third of its reserves. The country has sweetened the terms for deals on offer but international oil firms remain concerned they will be taking on huge risk for little reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson pointed to Qatar as an investment model that attracts international oil companies. Exxon is the largest foreign investor in the Gulf Arab state and projects due to start there make up the bulk of the company's global production growth in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has stakes in projects that are set to double Qatar's production capacity of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2009 to 62 million tonnes. Qatar is already the world's largest producer of the gas cooled to liquid form for export.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the huge volume of new production capacity, Qatar as a cheap producer was well placed to adapt to an LNG market suffering as the economic downturn eats into demand, Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today the LNG market is relatively balanced, but I think it is going to be soft. It is going to be a bit challenging in the next year or so," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But Qatar can deliver LNG at a cost of supply below any other LNG source in the world. So their ability to withstand downward pressure on prices is much greater than other sources of LNG."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPENDING, PROJECTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low oil and energy prices had not impacted Exxon's spending plans as the company takes investment decisions with a long-term perspective rather than based on short-term oil price swings, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We stay within a range looking at the future and therefore we don't make investments that require a real high price to be successful," Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't invest outside of the range when it is high, and we don't worry about it when it gets too low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if oil prices were too low for Exxon to continue investment, Tillerson said: "No, I don't think so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said last week it would spend about $29 billion in 2009, the upper end of its five-year annual spending target of $25 billion to $30 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Qatar, LNG processing plant Qatargas train four was already liquefying gas and loading of the first cargo was imminent, Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Britain, the South Hook LNG terminal that Exxon and Qatar Petroleum have built together to receive Qatari gas will start up within a few weeks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Italy, another port that will receive Qatari gas should take its first load of LNG before the end of June, Tillerson said. The Adriatic LNG terminal was under testing, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon was also developing two projects to boost Qatar's domestic gas supply and remained in talks to build a petrochemical plant in the country, Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Simon Webb and Ramthan Hussain)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law Offices Bernard M. Gross, P.C. Filed a Class Action Suit Against General
Electric Company -- GE; Correcting Lead Plaintiff Due Date: Friday, May 8, 2009

PHILADELPHIA, March 9, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Law Offices Bernard M. Gross,
P.C. issued a press release today that a class action lawsuit in the United
States District Court, Southern District of New York, 09cv2084, on behalf
purchasers of common stock of General Electric Company ("GE") (NYSE:GE) between
January 23, 2009 and February 27, 2009, inclusive (the "Class Period"), seeking
to pursue remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The action is
pending before the Honorable Shira Scheindlin.

If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than
May 8, 2009. If you wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning
this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff's counsel,
Deborah R. Gross or Susan R. Gross at 866-561-3600 or 215-561-3600 or via email
at debbie@bernardmgross.com or susang@bernardmgross.com. Any person who
purchased GE common stock during the Class Period may move the Court to serve as
lead plaintiff through counsel of his choice, or may choose to do nothing and
remain an absent class member.

The complaint charges that GE and its Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey Immelt,
violated federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements
regarding GE's common stock dividend in 2009. Specifically, GE, since its
inception in 1899, had paid a dividend on its common stock. As the credit crisis
in the capital markets continued and intensified in 2009, the market began to
seriously question whether GE would be able to maintain its common stock
dividend. After stating on numerous occasions during the Class Period that GE's
common stock dividend was safe, defendants suddenly, on February 27, 2009,
issued a press release stating that they were cutting GE's common stock dividend
by 68% commencing with the third quarter of 2009 and that GE would pay a
dividend of only $0.10 per share, down from $0.341 per share. When defendants
disclosed the truth to the market on February 27, 2009, GE's common stock price
plummeted.

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all persons who purchased the
common stock of GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (NYSE:GE) between January 23, 2009 and
February 27, 2009, inclusive. The plaintiff is represented by Law Offices
Bernard M. Gross P.C. The firm has expertise in prosecuting investor class
actions and extensive experience in actions involving financial fraud.

or rights or interests with respect to these matters,

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
DiCentral Corporation, the first true Software Plus Services model for EDI and
B2B Ecommerce, announced today that Panamax/Furman Sound has implemented
DiIntegrator for Microsoft Dynamics GP. DiIntegrator suite of proprietary

ship notice (856) transactions based on completed shipment or open order
information from the SOP module in Microsoft Dynamics GP. Eliminating the need
to re-key order information improves operational efficiency and reduces errors,
particularly in high-volume distribution environments. 
* Integrated ability to export sales order picking tickets for remote warehouse
management systems and third-party logistics providers: Users will be able to
automatically generate an outbound warehouse shipping order (940) transaction
from the SOP module in Microsoft Dynamics GP, enhancing process control and
accuracy.

&lt;p&gt;Law Offices Bernard M. Gross, P.C. Filed a Class Action Suit Against General
Electric Company -- GE

PHILADELPHIA, March 9, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Law Offices Bernard M. Gross,
P.C. commenced a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court,
Southern District of New York, 09cv2084, on behalf purchasers of common stock of
General Electric Company ("GE") (NYSE:GE) between January 23, 2009 and February
27, 2009, inclusive (the "Class Period"), seeking to pursue remedies under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The action is pending before the Honorable
Shira Scheindlin.

If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than
May 2, 2009. If you wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning
this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff's counsel,
Deborah R. Gross or Susan R. Gross at 866-561-3600 or 215-561-3600 or via email
at debbie@bernardmgross.com or susang@bernardmgross.com. Any person who
purchased GE common stock during the Class Period may move the Court to serve as
lead plaintiff through counsel of his choice, or may choose to do nothing and
remain an absent class member.

The complaint charges that GE and its Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey Immelt,
violated federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements
regarding GE's common stock dividend in 2009. Specifically, GE, since its
inception in 1899, had paid a dividend on its common stock. As the credit crisis
in the capital markets continued and intensified in 2009, the market began to
seriously question whether GE would be able to maintain its common stock
dividend. After stating on numerous occasions during the Class Period that GE's
common stock dividend was safe, defendants suddenly, on February 27, 2009,
issued a press release stating that they were cutting GE's common stock dividend
by 68% commencing with the third quarter of 2009 and that GE would pay a
dividend of only $0.10 per share, down from $0.341 per share. When defendants
disclosed the truth to the market on February 27, 2009, GE's common stock price
plummeted.

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all persons who purchased the
common stock of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) between January 23, 2009 and
February 27, 2009, inclusive. The plaintiff is represented by Law Offices
Bernard M. Gross P.C. The firm has expertise in prosecuting investor class
actions and extensive experience in actions involving financial fraud.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM is unlikely to bid for Satyam Computer Services Ltd as the advantage of expanding in India is outweighed by the legal and financial risks related to Satyam's accounting scandal, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satyam SATY.BO SAY.N won regulatory approval on Friday to sell a majority stake in itself, about two months after founder and Chairman Ramalinga Raju admitted the information technology outsourcer's profits had been inflated for years and its assets falsified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, India's Business Standard newspaper said International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) was the "front-runner" to buy Satyam and had brought in a team of bankers and lawyers from the United States and Europe to India to assess the deal size and risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that IBM had not flown a team to India and was unlikely to be interested in bidding for Satyam. It is unclear whether IBM, which declined to comment, has hired financial advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors of IBM's interest in Satyam have circulated for years, as the two compete on technology outsourcing and computer-related services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying Satyam, India's fourth-largest software exporter, could help IBM expand its geographic presence, but analysts say the Armonk, New York-based company already has a lead in India with customers that include top wireless provider Bharti Airtel (BRTI.BO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to Satyam, IBM -- the world's largest technology services company -- also offers a fuller range of software and services including high-end consulting projects that bring in high margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM already has a brand in India," said Susquehanna Financial Group analyst James Friedman. "I don't know that Satyam is going to help that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if IBM were interested, it would be tough to get a fair assessment of Satyam's valuation, making an acquisition difficult, Friedman added.

Satyam faces a class-action lawsuit from U.S. shareholders that any new owner would have to assume some degree of liability for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Grossman, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, said some Satyam capabilities, such as their partnership with SAP (SAPG.DE) (SAP.N), would hold value for IBM "but you have to balance that against the liabilities that exist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Balancing risk and reward, I don't see an immediate need for IBM to buy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers and analysts also listed Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Computer Sciences Corp (CSC.N) as other U.S. companies that could be interested in Satyam. HP and CSC declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But HP is still digesting its $13.9 billion acquisition of IT services provider Electronic Data Systems, and CSC may not have the financial wherewithal to buy Satyam, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's Larsen  Toubro Ltd (LART.BO), which controls about 12 percent of Satyam, and diversified companies Spice Group and Hinduja Group have expressed interest in Satyam but said they had not decided whether to bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOME ASSETS COMPELLING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satyam provides back office operations to more than 600 global customers, including General Electric Co (GE.N) and Qantas Airways (QAN.AX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two technology bankers suggested IBM might look at buying some Satyam assets rather than a majority stake.

&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, March 9 (Reuters) - The state-run Bangladesh Oil,
Gas and Mineral Corporation or Petrobangla approved an
investment plan of U.S. energy firm Chevron (CVX.N) to explore
natural gas, a senior official said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We have approved the plan to begin exploration activities

will cost about $55 million," said Jalal Ahmed, chairman of the
Petrobangla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm, which alone supplies almost 40 percent of total
gas consumed by the country, will conduct a two-dimensional
survey at block-7 that covers both onshore and offshore areas
including world's largest mangrove forest Sundarbans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The seismic survey is essential for determining gas
reserves," Jalal told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of total daily gas production totalling nearly 1,825
million cubic feet (mmcf), international oil firms supply about
920 mmcf while the rest is produced by domestic firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment plan was approved after a continuing severe
gas crisis halted operations of at least 300 manufacturing
firms in southern Chittagong areas despite investment of more
than $1 billion, officials said.

&lt;p&gt;Investors at Disney's annual meeting grilled Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger on issues ranging from a long-touted plan to bring its signature Disneyland theme park to China to the company's acquisition plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting at the Paramount Theater in Oakland, California -- chosen because directors toured nearby Pixar on Monday -- was a more low-key affair than past events, which usually have a festival atmosphere with live entertainment, life-size cartoon characters and shareholders wearing Disney regalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say shareholders may have rejected the pay proposal partly for fear of rocking the boat. Disney management had called it "too blunt an instrument" for dealing with complex executive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, investors granted management leeway to expand the number of shares that can be granted to a single person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think Disney's problems have anything to do with the management team," argued Caris  Co analyst David Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors may be thinking, "What if the vote goes through and Bob Iger and Tom Staggs throw up their hands and say forget it?" Miller said. "The last thing Disney or any other company that has seen its share price drop 50 percent or more needs is turmoil in management."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timothy Smith of Walden Asset Management, which sponsored the proposal, said support by fellow shareholders -- at 39 percent including abstentions -- was "remarkably strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a huge number of investors who just vote for management on any type of resolution," Smith told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholder Dwight Morgan felt it was up to directors to negotiate executives' contracts.

&lt;p&gt;Check Point IPS solutions secure enterprise networks from newest DNS threats
REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq:CHKP), the worldwide leader in
securing the Internet, today announced that users of Check Point IPS solutions,
SmartDefense Services, the newly introduced IPS Software Blade for Check Point
Security Gateway R70, VPN-1 NGX R60 and above, VSX NGX R65, InterSpect NGX,
IPS-1, and IPS-1 NGX R65, are shielded from two new Domain Name System (DNS)
cache poisoning threats, CVE-2009-0233 and CVE-2009-0234, disclosed today. Check
Point IPS solutions customers gain immediate protection against the exploits. 

Both vulnerabilities take advantage of how Microsoft DNS servers handle caching
of queries and responses. By bombarding a DNS server (large servers that convert
domain names into numeric IP addresses) with specially crafted queries, an
attacker tricks a DNS server into making unnecessary lookups rather than relying
on outstanding queries and cached responses. The unnecessary lookups result in
providing more opportunities for an attacker to insert incorrect responses into
the DNS server`s cache. Instead of visiting an intended website, users can be
redirected to a malicious site. 

Check Point IPS solutions preemptively protect against the two new threats
through a suite of DNS cache poisoning protections available since 2003. These
preemptive protections are further strengthened by immediately available
protections, capable of detecting specific attempts to exploit the newly
announced vulnerabilities. Consequently, SmartDefense Services and IPS Software
Blade solutions stop an attacker from flooding a DNS server with requests and
inserting false, malicious information into a DNS server`s cache. More
information on DNS cache poisoning can be found at:
www.checkpoint.com/defense/advisories/public/dnsvideo/index.html. 

"At the heart of the Internet are DNS servers. We trust DNS servers to direct
our entered URLs to the intended Websites, so any vulnerability affecting the
integrity of DNS servers is of great concern," said Oded Gonda, vice president
of network security products at Check Point. "In less than a year there have
been three major DNS exploits and more are likely to follow. By deploying
preemptive solutions like Check Point`s, businesses gain immediate protection
from threats that could unknowingly route them to malicious sites." 

Check Point IPS solutions provide intrusion prevention capabilities available on
dedicated platforms or integrated into Check Point gateways. Check Point IPS
products are updated by Check Point`s update services, which provide ongoing and
real-time updates and configuration advisories for defenses and security
policies. Check Point protections are developed and distributed by Security
Research and Response Centers located around the globe.

 OAKLAND, Calif., March 10 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
shareholders rejected a proposal that would have given them say
on executive pay packages.

 Investors at Disney's annual meeting grilled Chief Executive
Officer Bob Iger on issues ranging from a long-touted plan to
bring its signature Disneyland theme park to China to the
company's acquisition plans.

 Analysts say shareholders may have rejected the pay proposal
partly for fear of rocking the boat. Disney management had
called it "too blunt an instrument" for dealing with complex
executive compensation.

 Instead, investors granted management leeway to expand the
number of shares that can be granted to a single person.

 "I don't think Disney's problems have anything to do with
the management team," argued Caris  Co analyst David Miller.

Bob Iger and Tom Staggs throw up their hands and say forget it?"
Miller said. "The last thing Disney or any other company that
has seen its share price drop 50 percent or more needs is

 Disney shares jumped 6.5 percent on Tuesday, as the broader
market .DJI rallied 6 percent.

 Multinational corporations from Intel (INTC.O) to Hewlett
Packard (HPQ.N) have broached the possibility of so-called
say-on-pay initiatives that give investors a chance to influence
executive packages, amid growing calls from Kazakhstan to Great
Britain for remuneration curbs. [ID:nL4278068]

 Corporate governance experts say such measures help shore up
investor trust and increase shareholder participation. But other
business analysts argue such structures benefit activist
shareholders who may not have the corporation's best interests
at heart.

 At Disney's annual meeting on Tuesday in Oakland -- chosen
because of its proximity to prized asset Pixar -- shareholders
gave their blessing to two company-sponsored amendments to its
executive compensation plans. The amendments allow Disney to
increase the number of shares available for granting to a single
person.

 SLOW BOAT TO CHINA

 Shareholders also re-elected the company's 12 directors by a
wide margin.

 Apple (AAPL.O) chief executive and Disney director and
shareholder Steve Jobs, now taking a six-month medical leave of
absence, was not present at Tuesday's gathering, despite
widespread Internet reports he had made his first public
appearance since announcing his hiatus.

 Shareholders quizzed Iger about his plans for a theme park
in Shanghai. Disney has signed a framework agreement with local
government to kick off such a project, and said in January it
intended to submit a proper plan for the park. [ID:nN09309290]

 The firm now runs a theme park in Hong Kong that has been
criticised for yielding meager returns.

 "To the extent that the Chinese government will continue to
work on it with us, we will continue to pursue it," Iger said.

 Another issue that shareholders focused on was job cuts.
Iger told them that about 50 people at the firm's Florida park
had accepted voluntary buyouts thus far.

 Disney said in January it sent voluntary buyout offers to
600 executives at its domestic theme park operations.
[ID:nN21494028]

 Investors also voted down a proposal that would have barred
the entertainment company from providing death benefits to the
families of executives who die on the job.

 The shareholder-sponsored "say on pay" proposal received 39
percent of shares cast at the meeting, and the "golden coffin"
proposal on death benefits garnered 27 percent.

 Directors were re-elected with 90 percent support from
shares voted at the meeting, and the compensation plan
amendments received 94 percent.

 About 84 percent of the common shares available for voting
were cast at the meeting in Oakland.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Tuesday it would cut costs to reflect the sharp drop in oil prices, while also increasing production 4 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Kirkland, executive vice president for global upstream and gas, said Chevron was aiming for a 14 percent cut in upstream base business spending, excluding one-off payments, by deferring some projects squeezed by oil prices at $30 to $40 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to get the cost of doing business back down and then those development wells will once again be very economic," he told Chevron's analyst meeting in New York. "It doesn't make sense to sell unless you're going to make money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron expects to drill more than 50 exploratory wells in 2009 and spend $2 billion on exploration, about the same it spent in the last few years, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Chevron aims to produce 2.63 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, up from 2.53 million in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron executives said they were happy with their project pipeline, which will deliver 650,000 boe per day over the next few years as demand recovers from its economy-led slump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive David O'Reilly saw a silver lining in the lower oil prices, with several of the state-run companies that control the majority of the world's oil reserves again seeking partnerships with foreign majors to develop more oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"History tells you that when you get into a lower pricing environment, it opens up opportunities," he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among countries where resource nationalism may have receded is Venezuela, although Chevron would think carefully about investing more, given its current exposure there, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not unreasonable to expect some national oil companies will have funding problems," said Jason Gammel, an analyst at Macquarie Research in New York. "In Brazil, Petrobras could be a strategic partner and Mexico's Pemex could become more open (to partnerships)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE ON THE WAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's net proved reserves stood at 11.2 billion boe at the end of 2008. Among projects starting in 2009, Chevron said Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico had reserves of 400 million to 500 million boe, Tombua-Landana in Angola had 350 million boe, while Frade in Brazil had 200 million to 300 million barrels of oil. For more on upcoming projects, click on ID:nN10531360&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further beyond, Chevron released an anticipated peak capacity for its Jack/St Malo project in the Gulf of Mexico of 120,000 to 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, with a final investment decision likely in 2010. Chevron sees recoverable resources of more than 500 million barrels there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its $1.7 billion Caesar/Tonga Gulf project to the north, Chevron sees peak capacity of 40,000 boe and a 2011 start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at Australia, O'Reilly said the "stars are getting aligned" for Gorgon, a 50 percent-owned liquefied natural gas project it expects to sanction in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company expects overall LNG production to triple to about 300,000 boe per day by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Chevron's refining business, it will continue to streamline its lubricants product line and exit retail markets, it said, while pushing to get feedstock costs down by $1 per barrel and product costs down by 30 cents per barrel by 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly joined a chorus of criticism of U.S. President Barack Obama's proposed budget, which could increase fees and end some long-standing tax breaks given to oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anything that would raise taxes on  domestic exploration and production would be counter-productive." he told reporters after the analyst meeting. "We are an industry that's not running up to Washington looking for bailouts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares of Chevron, the world's fourth-largest oil company by value, rose 6 percent to close at $61.78 amid a U.S. stock market rally. Chevron is down 16 percent in 2009, compared with a 15 percent drop in the Chicago Board Option Exchange's oil index .OIX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall in San Francisco and Joshua Schneyer in New York; editing by Maureen Bavdek and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

economic," he told Chevron's analyst meeting in New York. "It
doesn't make sense to sell unless you're going to make money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron expects to drill more than 50 exploratory wells in
2009 and spend $2 billion on exploration, about the same it
spent in the last few years, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year, Chevron aims to produce 2.63 million barrels of
oil equivalent (boe) per day, up from 2.53 million in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron executives said they were happy with their project
pipeline, which will deliver 650,000 boe per day over the next
few years as demand recovers from its economy-led slump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive David O'Reilly saw a silver lining in the
lower oil prices, with several of the state-run companies that
control the majority of the world's oil reserves again seeking
partnerships with foreign majors to develop more oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "History tells you that when you get into a lower pricing
environment, it opens up opportunities," he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among countries where resource nationalism may have receded
is Venezuela, although Chevron would think carefully about
investing more, given its current exposure there, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's not unreasonable to expect some national oil
companies will have funding problems," said Jason Gammel, an
analyst at Macquarie Research in New York. "In Brazil,
Petrobras could be a strategic partner and Mexico's Pemex could
become more open (to partnerships)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE ON THE WAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's net proved reserves stood at 11.2 billion boe at
the end of 2008. Among projects starting in 2009, Chevron said
Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico had reserves of 400 million to 500
million boe, Tombua-Landana in Angola had 350 million boe,
while Frade in Brazil had 200 million to 300 million barrels of
oil. For more on upcoming projects, click on ID:nN10531360&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further beyond, Chevron released an anticipated peak
capacity for its Jack/St Malo project in the Gulf of Mexico of
120,000 to 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day,
with a final investment decision likely in 2010. Chevron sees
recoverable resources of more than 500 million barrels there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At its $1.7 billion Caesar/Tonga Gulf project to the north,
Chevron sees peak capacity of 40,000 boe and a 2011 start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking at Australia, O'Reilly said the "stars are getting
aligned" for Gorgon, a 50 percent-owned liquefied natural gas
project it expects to sanction in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The San Ramon, California-based company expects overall LNG
production to triple to about 300,000 boe per day by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Chevron's refining business, it will continue to
streamline its lubricants product line and exit retail markets,
it said, while pushing to get feedstock costs down by $1 per
barrel and product costs down by 30 cents per barrel by 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly joined a chorus of criticism of U.S. President
Barack Obama's proposed budget, which could increase fees and
end some long-standing tax breaks given to oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Anything that would raise taxes on on domestic exploration
and production would be counter-productive." he told reporters
after the analyst meeting. "We are an industry that's not
running up to Washington looking for bailouts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shares of Chevron, the world's fourth-largest oil
company by value, rose 6 percent to close at $61.78 amid a U.S.
stock market rally. Chevron is down 16 percent in 2009,
compared with a 15 percent drop in the Chicago Board Option
Exchange's oil index .OIX.

ELKHART, Ind.--(Business Wire)--

Feed The Children is responding to the plight of Michiana residents left jobless

will provide a box of food and personal care items to recipients. The boxes are
designed to help supplement a family for up to one week. The distribution will

"We are extremely grateful to Walther Farms for this generous donation," said

the devastation that these families are feeling. The city of Elkhart and
surrounding cities are facing increasing unemployment that unfortunately keeps
rising. With this delivery, families can walk away from this event with renewed
hope knowing that someone is there to help them weather this storm."

&lt;p&gt;Integration With Microsoft Office SharePoint Server Enhances STARLIMS Workflow
and Collaboration Capabilities

HOLLYWOOD, Fla., March 10, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- STARLIMS Technologies Ltd.
(Nasdaq:LIMS), a leading provider of laboratory information management systems,

also enhances organizational efficiency, and helps harmonize business processes.

"The Microsoft .NET Framework provides the basic platform for our award-winning
LIMS product, and we also rely on Microsoft Windows and SQL Server. As a result,
the integration of SharePoint Server was seamless, and allowed us to maximize

Microsoft products future-proofs our solutions, by ensuring rapid deployment of
future enhancements to Microsoft's dynamic products."

management capabilities of the STARLIMS(r) Scientific Data Management System
(SDMS). STARLIMS SDMS adds unstructured data management capabilities to the
company's flexible LIMS platform.

"Life sciences firms often struggle with the volume of unstructured and
scattered data across internal systems and their extended value chains," said
Michael Naimoli, U.S. life sciences industry solutions director, Microsoft Corp.
"Built upon the Microsoft platform, including SharePoint Server and SQL Server,
STARLIMS SDMS creates a powerful solution for managing unstructured scientific
data together with structured laboratory data. By integrating various types of
content into a single, web-based platform, STARLIMS customers can now streamline
their information management, maximize their availability and utility of
information resources and promote enterprise-wide collaboration."

Close Partnership and Long-term Benefits

According to Friedman, STARLIMS customers are well positioned to benefit from
Microsoft's ongoing investments into its server-based products. The
award-winning STARLIMS V10 web-based system is built on the Microsoft software
platform utilizing Microsoft's most advanced technologies-and STARLIMS's
three-year product roadmap is geared to take advantage of many of the new .NET
Framework capabilities. In addition, STARLIMS is a Microsoft Gold Certified
partner, and enjoys the highest level of technological support and interaction
with Microsoft.

percent of shares cast at the meeting, and the "golden coffin"
proposal garnered 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Directors were reelected with 90 percent support from
shares voted at the meeting, and the compensation plan
amendments received 94 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 84 percent of the common shares available for voting
were cast at the meeting in Oakland, California.

&lt;p&gt;COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Physicians at Thy-Mors hospital in Denmark and IBM have developed patient record software that uses a three-dimensional computer model of the human anatomy to visualize a patient's medical information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new software is expected to give doctors a better overview of a patient's history and save hospitals considerable time spent searching through records systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you just need to know about the heart, you can click and get straight to the record and get the piece of information that you need," Kurt Nielsen, the hospital Director, told Reuters by telephone on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can get a quick overview of the health history of the patient," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software is designed to work with different types of electronic patient records and pulls information from these extensive and sometimes complex systems to display in a user-friendly interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the model of the body, arrows indicate treated areas, and a mouse click on a specific arrow or body part automatically retrieves the pertinent medical information from the record, including past and current medication and diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to use it. In the pilot we tried to use it on real patient record systems, and now we will have a clinical pilot. It can be adapted everywhere where you have electronic patient record systems," Nielsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and business partner Nhumi Technologies, a spin-off from IBM Research, will collaborate in the commercialization of the technology and plan to start marketing the tool in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Scandinavia and in other countries through partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool is also expected to improve doctor-patient dialogue by allowing physicians to illustrate relevant parts of the body in the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This we believe is an added important benefit. We think that some of the time saved by the hospital will be used for better dialogue with patients," said Nhumi Technologies sales director Peter Lundkvist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lundkvist said IBM researchers worked with Thy-Mors staff from May to December last year to understand better understand their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thy-Mors, in West Denmark, was selected last year as a development partner because the hospital was preparing to purchase a new electronic patient record system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gelu Sulugiuc, editing by Will Waterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) attracted a considerable degree of attention
this morning from both analysts and options traders. Ahead of the open, Pali
Capital downgraded the shares to "sell" from "neutral," stating "while Disney
has one of the best secular asset mixes within the media sector, essentially
everything is going wrong at the same time, with the length of pain likely to
extend further than we had previously expected." Pali slashed its 2009 earnings
estimate for DIS to $1.63 from $1.82, and cut its 2010 expectations to $1.45
from $2.04 per share. 

The downgrade arrived just hours ahead of today's DIS shareholders meeting,
where investors will vote on a proposal that will give them a nonbinding,
advisory vote on the pay packages given to Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger and
other top executives. Hye-Won Choi, head of corporate governance issues for
TIAA-Cref, which owns about 14.6 million DIS shares, told the Los Angeles Times,
"With the advisory vote, we want to provide the company with feedback on whether
the board did a good job in explaining the basis for their compensation
decisions."

         director of Talent Communities, Microsoft, will present
         "New Trends in Talent Acquisition: Developing Talent Communities,"
         detailing how he guided Microsoft through the process of
         defining and deploying its talent community. He will discuss the
         tools and technologies utilized to launch the talent community;
         the multi-year phased approach toward building a talent community;
         the results that Microsoft has achieved to date; and what the
         long-range benefits of building your own community might be.

         Tim Kutzer, manager, Talent Acquisition at Best Buy Co., Inc.,
         will present "Best Buy's Career Site 2.0," describing how, in
         six weeks, Jobs2Web helped Best Buy re-imagine its career site,
         making it Web 2.0 compatible. He will discuss what changes were
         made, including new searchable terms relevant to the job candidate
         and improvement to the user's overall experience; how it enabled
         Best Buy to attract millions of direct job seekers and how
         Web 2.0 changes the entire interactive recruiting game for
         major employers.

&lt;p&gt;COPENHAGEN, March 10 (Reuters) - Physicians at Thy-Mors
hospital in Denmark and IBM have developed patient record
software that uses a three-dimensional computer model of the
human anatomy to visualize a patient's medical information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The new software is expected to give doctors a better
overview of a patient's history and save hospitals considerable
time spent searching through records systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you just need to know about the heart, you can click and
get straight to the record and get the piece of information that
you need," Kurt Nielsen, the hospital Director, told Reuters by
telephone on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You can get a quick overview of the health history of the
patient," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software is designed to work with different types of
electronic patient records and pulls information from these
extensive and sometimes complex systems to display in a
user-friendly interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the model of the body, arrows indicate treated areas, and
a mouse click on a specific arrow or body part automatically
retrieves the pertinent medical information from the record,
including past and current medication and diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're going to use it. In the pilot we tried to use it on
real patient record systems, and now we will have a clinical
pilot. It can be adapted everywhere where you have electronic
patient record systems," Nielsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM and business partner Nhumi Technologies, a spin-off from
IBM Research, will collaborate in the commercialisation of the
technology and plan to start marketing the tool in the
Netherlands, Switzerland and Scandinavia and in other countries
through partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tool is also expected to improve doctor-patient dialogue
by allowing physicians to illustrate relevant parts of the body
in the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This we believe is an added important benefit. We think
that some of the time saved by the hospital will be used for
better dialogue with patients," said Nhumi Technologies sales
director Peter Lundkvist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lundkvist said IBM researchers worked with Thy-Mors staff
from May to December last year to understand better understand
their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thy-Mors, in West Denmark, was selected last year as a
development partner because the hospital was preparing to
purchase a new electronic patient record system.

&lt;p&gt;  COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, Mar 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
An IBM (NYSE: IBM) technology innovation for intelligent electronic
patient records, using a 3D model of the human body has proved both
practical and valuable in a first test at a Danish Hospital. Using an
"avatar" or map of the human body, medical staff at the Thy-Mors Hospital
are now able to obtain an up-to-date overview of each patient's record at
a glance.

    View video:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5Zk-sJAOxk=channel_page

    The software, which provides a medical information hub, was created by
scientists at IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory in collaboration with
experts from IBM Denmark and is a forward-thinking step towards more
user-friendly and smarter healthcare.

    Using a 3D-representation of the human anatomy, the avatar helps medical
staff easily navigate an electronic patient file. Doctors can rotate the
avatar and zoom in and out to generate the level of detail needed. With
the tool, they can also choose between different views, for example
enabling inspection of the organs or the circulatory, muscular and
nervous systems. Arrows indicate the areas of the body for which medical
data is available. By selecting one of these arrows, medical staff have
all pertinent information at the click of a mouse.

    With nearly 11,000 in-patient beds and more than 65,000 outpatient visits
per year, the doctors and nurses at Thy-Mors Hospital in northern Denmark
have busy schedules. When Dr. Hardy Christoffersen, head of the hospital's
surgical outpatient clinic, sees a patient, he has 15 minutes for an
interview, examination and diagnosis, including decisions about what kind
of additional treatment may be required. To help ensure accuracy, Dr.
Christoffersen must also take into consideration the patient's overall
condition, including previous ailments and current health status.

    Until now, Dr. Christoffersen and the nursing staff have used the
hospital's own electronic health records system. The broad adoption of
electronic patient records in Denmark has been a major step in ensuring
high-quality treatment in Danish hospitals. However, today's electronic
medical record systems are challenged by the increased complexity of
medical data and standards and are not always user-friendly. In an effort
to further improve patient care, The Northern Region of Denmark, which
owns Thy-Mors Hospital, partnered with IBM on a joint research pilot -- a
so-called first-of-a-kind project -- in 2008. After initial work was
completed, a pilot solution was tested with a small group of doctors.

    "The IBM tool gives me a fantastic, graphic view of the patient's status.
I can see much more information than just what the patient tells me is
bothering him or her that day -- information for which I would otherwise
have to spend considerable time searching through our current records
system," reports Dr. Christoffersen. "With this medical information hub, I
have all the information I need at my fingertips."

    The test also showed additional benefits of the visualization: it helped
doctors to spot information indirectly related to current health problems
but still relevant to the treatment. The technology is also expected to
improve doctor-patient dialogue by showing relevant parts of the body on
the avatar in an easy-to-understand manner.

    Kurt Nielsen, Director of Thy-Mors Hospital, is also satisfied with the
pilot: "It means our doctors can work more efficiently," he says. "This
improves patient care."

    Nielsen regards the software prototype from IBM as an important step
toward the future of e-health. "The IBM solution helps support our
ambition to be a paperless hospital. Also, future generations of doctors
who have grown up with computers will have an even more natural approach
to the use of such electronic health tools."

    Dr. Andre Elisseeff from IBM Business Partner Nhumi Technologies GmbH is
one of the inventors of the tool. Says Dr. Elisseeff, "We put forward an
innovative use of IT in healthcare. By combining medical data with a
visual representation, we have tried to simplify access to electronic
health information for healthcare professionals as much as possible,
which will benefit all patients."

    IBM researchers worked with healthcare staff to understand their needs,
and make the solution user-friendly. Dr. Elisseeff and his colleagues
developed software that is capable of learning and performing
sophisticated analytics, thereby adding intelligence to the tool. For
example, an internet search for "heart trouble" will show all records
that contain the words "heart trouble." In a semantic search for "heart
trouble" with the tool, the search words are placed in context, and the
search results include terms such as "right ventricle," "radiating pain
in left arm," and "ECG." The results are shown graphically on the 3D
avatar figure.

    IBM and Business Partner Nhumi Technologies will collaborate in the
commercialization of the technology and plan to work together to further
develop innovative healthcare solutions.

&lt;p&gt;Major Investments in Upstream and Downstream Are Shaping the Company for Growth,
Financial Strength
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) is well positioned to deal with difficult market
conditions given its strong balance sheet, numerous new growth projects coming
onstream and a disciplined approach to cost management, executives said today at
the company`s annual meeting with financial analysts in New York. 

"We are continuing to execute our key strategies," Dave O`Reilly, chairman and
CEO, told the meeting. "We`re moving legacy projects to development, we`re
moving resources to reserves, and we`re continuing to deliver our
industry-leading exploration program. In the downstream, we`re continuing our
program to improve reliability and feedstock flexibility, and we are sharply
focused on reducing costs." 

O`Reilly said the company is well positioned for these challenging market
conditions because of its strong balance sheet. He reaffirmed the company`s
long-held strategies and emphasized the advantages the company earned through
consistent execution. 

"For the longer term, we believe global energy demand will rise as economic
growth resumes. We have more exposure to some of the top growth regions in the
world," O`Reilly explained. "Shorter term, our portfolio is relatively less
exposed to sectors that are most sensitive to an economic downturn." 

George Kirkland, executive vice president of Upstream and Gas, outlined the
strong 2008 performance of the upstream and natural gas business, with record
earnings, nine major capital projects completed and strong competitive
performance in the key areas of earnings per barrel, cost structure and return
on capital employed. 

Kirkland also provided details on how the industry-leading queue of Chevron`s
major capital projects will deliver significant growth and provide flexibility
in the current economic environment. "Over the next two years, we expect new
project startups and continued ramp-ups to contribute production of 650,000
barrels per day," he said. "In addition, the depth of our portfolio provides us
with the flexibility to optimize project timing to take advantage of lower
expected capital costs." 

In discussing future growth, Kirkland focused on Chevron`s liquefied natural gas
(LNG) portfolio, particularly Gorgon and Wheatstone in Australia, as well as the
crude oil opportunities in the Lower Tertiary trend in the deepwater U.S. Gulf
of Mexico. "We`ve made substantial progress on both Gorgon and Wheatstone in the
past 12 months. We expect Gorgon to be sanctioned during the second half of
2009, and Wheatstone is advancing toward front-end engineering and design later
this year," Kirkland said. 

Kirkland also revealed new details about development plans for Chevron`s high
profile Jack and St. Malo discoveries in the Lower Tertiary trend. He said the
company has begun front-end engineering and design for a production facility
that will have a capacity of between 120,000 and 150,000 barrels of
oil-equivalent per day. The facility will co-develop the Jack Field and the
nearby St. Malo Field, which have combined recoverable resources in excess of
500 million barrels. 

Mike Wirth, executive vice president of Global Downstream, outlined development
activities at four key refineries to improve reliability and profitability. He
provided additional details about ongoing efforts to streamline the company`s
refined products marketing. 

"We`re investing to further strengthen our superior refining assets," Wirth
said. "We are sharply focused on reducing costs and absolutely committed to
sustaining our utilization improvements." 

The refinery investments include reliability, feedstock flexibility, yield
improvement and energy efficiency projects at the company`s refineries in
California, Mississippi and South Korea. On the marketing side of the business,
Wirth said the company will continue to streamline its lubricant product line
and exit certain retail markets to reduce costs and improve returns. 

Pat Yarrington, chief financial officer, outlined the company`s financial
priorities. "We plan to sustain and grow our dividend and to maintain our
financial strength and flexibility throughout the commodity price cycle," she
said. She emphasized the company`s strong track record of balancing current
performance with future earnings growth. 

Presentations delivered by O`Reilly, Kirkland, Wirth and Yarrington are
available on Chevron.com on the investor page.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Mar 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Titus Labs, a leading provider of email and document classification
software, today announced the release of a new family of products for the
Microsoft Office SharePoint Environment. The three products - Titus Labs
PDF Control for SharePoint, Titus Labs Document Marking for SharePoint
and Titus Labs Office Converter for SharePoint - offer customers enhanced
classification and security solutions for the Microsoft SharePoint
platform.

    A growing number of customers have deployed Microsoft SharePoint as a
critical platform for document and records management. In a 2007 survey
conducted by AIIM, over 60% of the respondents indicated they planned to
use SharePoint for document management. As critical documents and records
are moved to SharePoint, there is a growing need for classification and
increased security.

    "Our customers are deploying SharePoint to handle their most critical
document and records management requirements," said Curt Kolcun, Vice
President, Microsoft US Public Sector. "Information classification is an
important step in the complete lifecycle of document and record
management. Titus Labs' experience in information classification and
document security is important for enterprise organizations that rely on
SharePoint in mission-critical environments."

    A key challenge faced by organizations using SharePoint is that employees
often forget to add classification markings to documents, or that they
already have thousands of existing documents in SharePoint. Titus Labs
Document Marking for SharePoint is designed to overcome these issues by
automatically adding labels to Office documents as they are added to the
SharePoint library. Furthermore, administrators can simply assign a label
policy to documents in an existing document library. The new SharePoint
product offerings serve to enhance existing SharePoint implementations by
adding a new layer of document security and driving user awareness of how
information should be handled.

    Titus Labs is introducing the following products:

    - Titus Labs Document Marking for SharePoint.- Automatically applies
classification labels and watermarks to existing and new Microsoft Office
documents in order to raise the awareness of sensitive information and
achieve compliance.

    - Titus Labs PDF Control for SharePoint - Automatically generates PDF
versions of Office documents to facilitate sharing of information and to
produce a document format appropriate for archiving.

    - Titus Labs Document Converter for SharePoint - Automatically converts
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents in SharePoint to Office 2007,
enabling standardization on a single file format and minimizing
compatibility issues.

    "As a provider of information classification solutions for the Microsoft
Office platform over the past five years we have seen the large and
growing acceptance of Microsoft SharePoint as a critical platform for
managing information assets," said Charlie Pulfer, VP Product Management,
Titus Labs. "Customers have a clear need for additional tools for
classification and enhanced document security. Our new family of products
for the SharePoint platform is designed to meet and exceed on these
requirements."

    About Titus Labs

    Titus Labs is the leading provider of email and document classification
software solutions that help organizations: apply a business value to
data, raise awareness to the sensitivity of information and prevent
inadvertent disclosure. Titus Labs Message Classification and Document

&lt;p&gt;Deal Extends Visa`s Prepaid Reload Network to 40,000 MoneyGram Locations,
Bringing Greater Convenience to Financially Underserved Consumers
MINNEAPOLIS &amp; SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
MoneyGram International (NYSE: MGI), a leading provider of global payment
services, and Visa Inc., (NYSE: V) today announced plans to introduce Visa
ReadyLink - Visa`s prepaid load network - in MoneyGram`s 40,000 agent locations
across the United States, providing financially underserved consumers with more
convenient options to add funds to their Visa reloadable prepaid cards. 

By becoming a Visa ReadyLink participant, MoneyGram enables consumers with any
Visa ReadyLink-enabled prepaid card to add funds - in real-time - anywhere
MoneyGram Money Transfer and ExpressPayment are offered. MoneyGram joins more
than 8,000 participating Visa ReadyLink locations, further extending the
convenience and security of reload services to Visa prepaid cardholders in more
convenient, everyday shopping locations.

are "financially underserved," without access to a banking relationship or
access to a payment card. These consumers receive approximately $1 trillion in
annual income, pay more than $1 billion in check cashing fees a year, and rely
heavily on cash for everyday transactions. 

"By making Visa ReadyLink available in MoneyGram`s locations, we`re able to
offer greater access and convenience to Visa prepaid cardholders seeking a
better alternative to a cash-and-carry lifestyle," said Elizabeth Buse, global
head of products, Visa Inc. "Prepaid is a key priority for Visa and a vital part
of our long-term growth strategy. That's why we continue to invest in building
upon what we believe is the industry's most flexible and robust prepaid product
suite and infrastructure." 

"Our relationship with Visa strengthens our ability to provide consumers with

cardholders with more convenient locations to add funds to their cards."

&lt;p&gt;VMware Provides Ideal Environment for Exchange with Extreme Scalability,
Superior Performance and Resiliency, Cost-Effective Centralized Management
PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW), the global leader in virtualization solutions from the
desktop to the datacenter, today announced that its industry-leading
virtualization and management suite, VMware Infrastructure 3, continues to
enhance its status as one of the premier platforms for running Microsoft
Exchange, with the Interfaith Medical Center of New York City, medical device
manufacturer NuVasive, Ohio Mutual Insurance Group, the University of Plymouth
in the U.K., Marvell Technology Group Ltd., and the Rochester General Hospital
system joining an ever-growing list of organizations that have turned to VMware
to optimize their Exchange environments. 

Exchange customers are migrating to the VMware platform as virtualization
becomes a core component of mainstream IT environments, and IT organizations
seek to deliver their applications as dynamic services, while cutting costs.
Microsoft Exchange is a commonly virtualized application and is supported by
Microsoft as part of the Microsoft Server Virtualization Validation Program
(SVVP). VMware ESX was the first hypervisor to be certified under the program,
providing VMware customers with access to support services directly from
Microsoft. 

"We are going to be implementing Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Office
Communications Server 2007," said Joseph Sorrenti, assistant vice president for
infrastructure at Interfaith Medical Center. "VMware did an excellent job in
getting its platform certified with Microsoft. Interfaith has implemented a
virtualization-first policy, and we`re confident that VMware is the best
infrastructure on which to run our most crucial applications." 

50,000 Mailboxes at U.K. University

One example of a large Microsoft Exchange deployment on VMware is at the
University of Plymouth in the U.K. The university has virtualized 50,000
Exchange 2007 mailboxes on VMware Infrastructure, giving the university a more
manageable and flexible Exchange environment, while taking advantage of VMware`s
unique high-availability tools, such as VMware HA and VMotion technologies. 

"We couldn`t be happier with the uptime and performance of our Exchange
implementation on the VMware platform," said Adrian Jane, infrastructure and
operations manager at the University of Plymouth. "The VMware platform is ideal
for mission-critical applications like Exchange Server 2007. VMware
Infrastructure is a proven and highly stable product. And when your
mission-critical applications are running on VMware solutions, they may help
fully protect them. You may also have rapid recovery if any issues arise. So for
us, it was the only choice for our virtualized environment." 

Based on their overall IT infrastructure, the university estimates it is saving
roughly $90,000 annually on utility costs and reducing CO2 emissions by 170 tons
per year by using the VMware platform. The number of server racks needed has
also been reduced from 32 to two. 

VMware Choice Backed by Successful Exchange Deployment on VMware

After considering other competitor products, Marvell Technology Group Ltd.
selected the VMware platform as the foundation for its virtual infrastructure,
based on 1) VMware`s proven track record of success in production datacenters,
and 2) its ability to meet all existing virtualization requirements. As an
example of their trust of VMware solutions, Marvell deployed a brand new
Exchange 2007 infrastructure on the VMware infrastructure, equipped with VMware
tools like VMware HA and VMware DRS. Marvell is currently in the process of
migrating all 6,000 mailboxes to this new infrastructure. 

"Microsoft Exchange is a critical application for us," said Rick Chang,
associate vice president of IT Infrastructure at Marvell Semiconductor. "Service
availability is essential to our business operation. VMware provides robust
feature sets with built-in automation, high-availability and manageability. The
decision is easy for us, we picked a solution that can give us high-availability
of the virtualized environment and the ability to recover quickly should
something happen." 

Exchange Virtualization for Healthcare

Another large Exchange deployment on the VMware platform is at Rochester General
Hospital, which has a distributed environment in upstate New York. Rochester`s
IT organization recently virtualized its 5,000-mailbox Exchange environment to
improve control, manageability and uptime. 

"We virtualized all our Exchange servers in our VMware environment and had no
issues whatsoever," said Tom Gibaud, manager of information technology at
Rochester General Hospital. "Simply put, VMware Infrastructure 3 helps us better
manage our computing environment. For example, if we notice that there is a
memory error on a server, it is very easy for us to utilize the VMotion
functionality to move that box somewhere else, replace the memory chip, and then
VMotion it back. Try doing that with a datacenter full of physical servers!" 

Saving Money, Speeding Deployment, Ensuring Availability

NuVasive recently upgraded from Exchange 2003 running on a conventional physical
infrastructure to Exchange 2007 running on the VMware platform. The upgrade
involved about 500 mailboxes on four Intel-based blade servers. The entire
upgrade to Exchange 2007 and the migration to a virtualized environment were
completed in a month. 

Exchange is one of several critical applications that NuVasive has virtualized
on the VMware platform, which has already saved the company about $1.1 million
dollars in capital and operational costs including hardware, cabling, rack
space, power and administration. In NuVasive`s case, provisioning time has been
cut from days and sometimes weeks for physical boxes to 20 minutes for a virtual
machine. Application uptime is 99.99 percent. 

Archiving Email in a Virtualized Environment

The Ohio Mutual Insurance Group (OMIG) is another VMware customer that is
running its entire Exchange environment on the VMware platform, which includes
approximately 200 mailboxes. OMIG uses Exchange in conjunction with a third
party application, Symantec Enterprise Vault, which provides email archiving. 

"We were pleasantly surprised how the VMware platform handled distributed
resources and provides high availability," said Mark Coe, manager of IT
infrastructure and Operations at OMIG. "Those are very important capabilities
for the virtualization of email systems and all enterprise applications. We now
rely on VMware virtualization for the vast majority of our day-to-day
operations."

&lt;p&gt;Successful Testing Results Demonstrate Interoperability With IBM Enterprise
Servers and Storage
SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Hitachi Data Systems Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi, Ltd.
(NYSE:HIT) and the only provider of Services Oriented Storage Solutions, today
announced that the Hitachi Universal Storage Platform (USP) V and VM are now
certified with IBM`s Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex (GDPS) system
solution. 

"Hitachi consistently strives to support the latest mainframe environments in
order to provide our customers and partners with additional resources for their
mission-critical applications," said Roberto Basilio, vice president, Storage
Platforms Product Management, Hitachi Data Systems. "By completing the
qualification testing, we continue to grow our partnership with IBM, in addition
to reducing cost, complexity and risk for our end-users. The qualification
testing is a rigorous process and a testament to the superiority of the Hitachi
USP V and VM." 

"Today`s announcement of the testing completion is a significant result for
customers when evaluating storage solutions to effectively consolidate and
manage the optimized storage solutions on mainframe environments," said Shuji
Sugimoto, general manager, Storage Systems Development, Disk Array Systems
Division, Hitachi, Ltd. "With the increasing prevalence of heterogeneous storage
environments, true interoperability is more important than ever. We are pleased
to continue our collaboration with IBM to provide our mutual customers reliable
disk storage systems and reduce complexity." 

Interoperability with IBM servers is a mandatory requirement for mainframe
users. Many of the world`s largest organizations in the financial services,
telecommunications and other key industries rely on IBM mainframe systems to run
mission-critical applications. 

Compatibility and interoperability certification with IBM`s GDPS system now
allows customers to mix Hitachi storage and IBM storage in the mainframe
environment to deliver the performance, reliability and availability they expect
for the most demanding applications. Additionally, interoperability support from
Hitachi offers customers an end-to-end solution designed to improve their
mainframe environments. Hitachi`s approach enables customers to deliver
centrally managed storage services such as business continuity, hierarchical
storage management, data migration and enhanced disaster recovery solutions, as
opposed to utilizing multiple isolated islands of storage to perform similar
functions. 

The testing of Hitachi's Enterprise System Connection (ESCON), Fiber Connection
(FICON) and Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) connectivity for select configurations
of IBM GDPS was also included. 

As a result of successful completion of compatibility and interoperability
testing, a Letter of Qualification was issued by IBM and is posted on its
website at: http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/advantages/gdps/qualification.html.

&lt;p&gt;  SUGAR LAND, TX, Mar 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Researched by Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land, Texas) -- At the
recent ExxonMobil 2009 Analyst Meeting held in New York, New York,
ExxonMobil Corporation's (NYSE:XOM) (Irving, Texas) Chairman and CEO, Rex
Tillerson, announced that in contrast to many other major companies in
the oil and gas sector, ExxonMobil would actually be increasing its
investment expenditure in 2009. Describing the past 12 months as a "year
of extremes" in which crude prices rose to more than $140 per barrel,
only to later fall below $40 per barrel, Tillerson said the company will
continue focusing on long-term investment in spite of temporary market
declines.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

MSSR Poised to Endure Recession

As the market declined and the restaurant sector dived Friday, shares of
McCormick &amp; Schmick's Seafood Restaurants (NASDAQ: MSSR) gained 17% despite
reporting dismal earnings and a dark outlook Thursday night. Investors are
apparently reassured that McCormick can weather the deepening recession with its
tight cost control, strong balance sheet and positive free cash flow. 

Excluding roughly $5.15 in one-time impairment charges, EPS from continuing
operations fell 33% to $0.16 in 4Q08. We were expecting $0.14. Guidance calls
for EPS to fall 56% to $0.20 in 2009 from $0.45 in 2008. 

Microchip Tech Outlook Cautious

Microchip Technology`s (NASDAQ: MCHP) Q3 results and Q4 guidance clearly
demonstrates a steep decline in revenues, and year-over-year comparison going
forward indicate a bleak outlook. 

Despite all the actions taken by the management, the company saw a significant
increase in inventory during Q3. This is because the actions undertaken by the
management were somewhat negated by the distributors and customers continuing to
reduce inventories in response to the business falling off dramatically. 

As of December 31, 2008, the company reported inventories of $136.5 million, up
from $126.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Deferred income on
shipments to distributors were $98.4 million, down by $5.1 million from the
balance as on September 30, 2008 while days of inventory in the distribution
channel increased from 35 days to 41 days. 

Exxon Bucks the Trend

At its annual analyst day in New York yesterday, Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM)
offered a business-as-usual outlook for 2009 and beyond, in line with its status
as the conservative benchmark in the oil patch. Management stated that the
company's operating and strategic plans remain unaffected by the credit market
squeeze and sharp commodity-price drop. 

But that's no surprise -- after all, this is Exxon we are talking about. The
company is as good a credit as Uncle Sam, with a AAA rating and more cash than
debt on its balance sheet. As of the end of 2008, it had $32 billion in cash and
around $7 billion in debt. 

AutoZone Staying Range-Bound

AutoZone Inc (NYSE: AZO) is a leading retailer of automotive parts and
accessories. 

The company has significant cash flow and plans to expand its square footage
growth. AutoZone has maintained a mid-single-digit square footage growth rate by
opening new stores every year. 

Falling gas prices are helping the company to improve same-store sales. However,
category management efforts and supply chain initiatives undertaken by the
company are likely to be offset by higher staffing costs. Thus, we maintain our
Hold recommendation on AutoZone, with a 6-month target price of $160.00. 

Marsh &amp; McLennan Making Do

Marsh &amp; McLennan's (NYSE: MMC) 4Q08 adjusted operating income from continuing
operations came in at $192 million, or $0.37 per share, 5 pennies ahead of our
estimates. Strong margin improvement in the Risk and Insurance Services coupled
with improved client retention was impressive during the quarter despite
interest rate declines and the strengthening of the US dollar. 

Also, the company experienced decent expense reduction as a result of its
well-executed restructuring initiatives. The results for coming quarters should
somewhat benefit from improved pricing, which will be largely offset by recent
strength of the US dollar and reduced revenues from the consulting business, due
to ongoing weakness in economy.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co said on Monday that it planned to cut carbon emissions from fuels by half by 2012, and ultimately to achieve net zero direct greenhouse gas emissions at its office and retail complexes, theme parks and cruise lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney also set a long-term goal to cut to zero the amount of waste it sends to landfills -- which totaled nearly 300,000 tons in 2006, much of it from construction, through diverting some to recycling centers, composting and buying more post-consumer recycled materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company pledged to reduce water use as well as emissions and waste associated with the manufacture, transport, use and disposal of Disney products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beth Stevens, senior vice president of environmental affairs, said Disney has "not put a definite time horizon" on taking emissions to zero and may have to rely in part on technology that is still under development to reach that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We set those (goals) because they were very aspirational," Stevens said. "We thought it was important ... to communicate a sense of commitment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The environmental plan was released a day ahead of Disney's annual shareholder meeting, in its "corporate responsibility" report. The entertainment conglomerate is joining a growing number of U.S. corporations that have pledged to improve carbon and ecological footprints by a certain date, or have already done so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Current scientific conclusions indicate that urgent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are required to avert accelerated climate change," the report said. "A successful response to these challenges demands fundamental changes in the way society, including businesses, use natural resources, and Disney is no exception."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney worked with Conservation International on emissions reduction targets, and plans to have a third party monitor its progress through annual audits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a good effort on transparency and disclosure," Rev. David Schilling, program director for the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. But he noted that the report lacks some benchmarks and measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are giving the message, 'Stay tuned, this is where we are starting,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2013, Disney plans to reduce electricity consumption by 10 percent compared with its 2006 baseline at existing assets, and to develop a plan to "aggressively" pursue renewable electricity sources, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get to zero net direct emissions, Disney plans to find efficiencies to cut emissions and to replace high-carbon fuels with low-carbon alternatives, then use "high-quality offsets" for what is left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney also plans to buy clean electricity from utilities and invest in clean electricity projects, in addition to taking steps to conserve, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company set 2013 as its goal for cutting solid waste to landfills by half of its 2006 baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares fell 24 cents, or 1.52 percent, to $15.59 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Walt Disney Company's (Disney)
$500 million 10-year 5.5% senior unsecured note offering. 

Disney's ratings and Stable Outlook continue to reflect the company's leading
market positions in core businesses, unique brand franchises, and strong cash
flows. Credit concerns center on the cyclical volatility of its theme parks and
resorts, and studio and broadcast network businesses. 

The cyclical challenges facing the media &amp; entertainment industry relate to both
the existing weak macro-economic environment as well as the general volatility
that accompanies hit-driven businesses. Fitch believes that Disney is less
exposed to some of the advertising-based cyclical challenges facing other media
&amp; entertainment companies given its small reliance on local advertising. As
such, Fitch expects most of Disney's weakness over the next 1-2 years to be
driven by cyclical factors. 

Fitch believes Disney's Media Networks segment could face a difficult 2009 as
national advertising could be down over 10% at its ABC and ESPN franchises as
the difficult environment is exacerbated by a weak ratings season to-date,
resulting in more advertising inventory needed to be dedicated to make-goods.
Standard increases in cable carriage fees, as well as cost cuts at the TV studio
should offset some of the advertising weakness. 

While the current macro-economic environment will pressure the Parks and Resorts
segment, Fitch believes the company's focus on its lower cost value hotel
packages could make the downturn less severe. The 4-for-7 hotel offer should
result in material declines in its hotel revenues which represent approximately
20% of domestic segment revenue. The special offer, however, should result in
less severe downturns for the remaining 80% of domestic segment revenue
(admissions, food, beverage, merchandise, etc.). Fitch is currently estimating
results for the domestic parks and resorts segment through 2010 to finish
slightly better than 2002 and 2003 figures. 

As has been the case for several years, Disney's Filmed Entertainment segment
faces difficult comparisons from a theatrical and home entertainment standpoint.
Fitch expects the segments' revenues could be down materially in 2009 generally
because of its release schedule. As a long-term secular issue, Fitch believes
cash flows from Disney's home entertainment business may prove more resilient
than the rest of the industry. Industry DVD sales have matured and are currently
experiencing declines that Fitch believes are secular in nature, as Fitch
expects a permanent downward shift in consumer DVD purchases as well as
increasing issues related to digital piracy. Specifically related to Disney,
Fitch believes the company may be able to outperform the industry based on the
expectation that family entertainment DVD sales will continue to be a low-cost
portion of household budgets, as well as the expectation for less piracy issues
in this genre. 

Despite the difficult environment, and the expectations for relatively weak
performance over the next 12-18 months, Fitch expects Disney's consolidated net
leverage ratio to remain below 2 times (x) through this downturn, and for its
net leverage ratio excluding net non-recourse debt and ESPN minority interests
to remain below 1.5x. Stresses to the company's operations required to impair
financial flexibility are consistent with an 'A' rating, and Fitch believes that
even in the midst of a difficult economy, potential rating pressure is less
likely to be driven by operating performance than by discretionary actions on
the part of management. There is no room in the current ratings for management
to resume a material share repurchase program in this environment. 

The company's liquidity is strong with $3.8 billion of cash and $1.8 billion
available under its $4.5 billion revolvers (after deducting for $2.7 billion of
commercial paper outstanding) at Dec. 31, 2008. The company' maturity schedule
is manageable with approximately $800 million of medium term notes coming due in
each of the next four years.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings places 11 classes of JP Morgan Commercial Mortgage Securities
Corp. pass-through certificates, series 2003-PM1 on Rating Watch Negative as
follows: 

--$27.5 million class D 'AAA'; 

--$13 million class E 'AA+'; 

--$15.9 million class F 'AA-'; 

--$13 million class G 'A'; 

--$18.8 million class H 'BBB+'; 

--$15.9 million class J 'BBB-'; 

--$7.2 million class K 'BB+'; 

--$8.7 million class L 'BB'; 

--$7.2 million class M 'B+'; 

--$4.3 million class N 'B-'; 

--$2.9 million class P 'CCC'. 

The Rating Watch Negative placements on classes D through P are due to the
transfer of the second largest loan (5.6%), Palm Beach Mall, to special
servicing on March 10, 2009, as well as continued concern and potential losses
from the four other specially serviced loans (1.9%) in the trust. The Palm Beach
Mall loan is secured by a 702,427 square foot (sf) regional mall located in West
Palm Beach, FL. 

The mall underwent a $40 million renovation in 2000 that added 309,053 sf of net
rentable area to the center. Performance declined abruptly late last year when
Dillard's closed their store in October 2008. In January 2009, Macy's announced
their store closure due to poor sales performance. Although Dillard's and Macy's
are not part of the loan collateral, their closures are expected to have a
negative impact on foot traffic throughout the mall. Inline occupancy has also
declined from issuance, which has affected the borrower's ability to service the
debt. 

As of September 2008, the mall was 69% occupied with a debt service coverage
ratio of 0.74 times (x), down from 1.40x at year-end 2007. The mall was 91.6%
occupied at issuance. 

Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Watch status of these classes as more

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Wednesday he sees "modest signs" of an economic recovery and endorsed a plan to create a U.S. systemic risk regulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dimon, speaking at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce economic conference, also supports mark-to-market accounting, but banks may have applied the fair value rule "to a ridiculous point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mark-to-market accounting rule, which requires assets to be valued at market prices, is defended by investor advocates and some lawmakers as giving a clear picture of the assets held on banks' books. But the banking industry, which has been forced to write down billions of dollars' worth of hard-to-value assets in illiquid markets, has pleaded for a suspension or modification of the rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon endorsed the idea of creating a U.S. systemic risk regulator, a plan proposed by U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. Frank plans a broad overhaul of U.S. financial regulation this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Dodd, chairman of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, said on Wednesday he hopes to have comprehensive reform legislation to address the regulation of the financial services industry by the summer, instead of a series of proposals being considered in the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are modest signs of recovery and healing out there," Dimon told the chamber, adding the market just saw the two most active bond months ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks, reeling from the U.S. financial crisis as the economy remains mired in a recession, have seen their stock prices tumble. Some have blamed short-sellers for pushing down stock prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several months ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily implemented a ban on short selling aimed at halting the drop of financial services stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said short-selling and the lapse in the so-called "uptick rule" contributed to the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said on Wednesday the agency could act in April to reinstate the uptick rule, which allowed short sales only when the last sale price was higher than the previous price. It was abolished by the SEC in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to reporters after his speech, Dimon said he opposes the nationalization of U.S. banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think any banks should be nationalized. It doesn't work. It's a mistake," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said nationalization means different things to different people, but some banks may need some government help and they should remain as private as possible, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said if a bank is in really poor shape the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp has the responsibility to deal with it. "That's what the FDIC is for," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDIC, which insures up to $250,000 per depositor, takes control of failed banks in a process in which sometimes a buyer is found or the agency takes control of the failed bank's assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a wide-ranging speech, Dimon also criticized the Basel II international banking accord, saying the capital adequacy plan "allowed too much leverage by banks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon addressed the government stress tests, which U.S. banks with at least $100 billion in assets are undergoing in order to determine how they would withstand even more severe economic conditions. Regulators want to know how much capital or other aid they might need in the event of those economic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon believes banks will survive the tests, which could help "create a lot of credibility within the system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is among many institutions that received capital injections from the government, but like other bank CEOs, Dimon wants to return government money as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks, unhappy with government's executive compensation restrictions, are seeking to return the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criticized for failing to lend to consumers and businesses, banks that received government aid argue they are lending. Dimon reaffirmed banks are lending due to the government's capital injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said banks should try "not to overreact" to the restrictions the government is placing on banks receiving federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Karey Wutkowski and John Poirier; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Mar 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) was named a 2009 CRN Channel Champion at an awards
ceremony in New Orleans, LA on March 10 at the XChange Solution Provider
conference. The CRN Channel Champions study measures overall Solution
Provider perceptions of vendor products and services. The survey is the
largest and broadest-based technology integrator market study in the
industry. The result is a premier resource used by VARs and technology
integrators throughout the industry to evaluate vendors and their
programs.


IBM was recognized as the overall winner in the following
categories:


Collaboration Software

Midrange Servers


IBM also won in these sub-categories: 

Data &amp; Information Management

Middleware

Network Security Software

Storage Management Software / Data Protection Software

Systems and Network Management Software

    
The survey rated more than 100 vendors in 24 key product and service
categories. The categories included: Client Security Software;
Collaboration Software; Data &amp; Information Management; Enterprise
Networking Hardware; Flat Panel Displays 19"-30"; High Capacity Hard
Drives (300GB+); Middleware; Midrange Servers; Multifunction Printers;
Network Security; Appliances; Network Security Software; Network Storage;
Notebooks/Mobile Computers; Power Protection and Management;
Server/Application Virtualization; SMB Business Software Suites; SMB
Networking Hardware; SMB Wireless LANs; SMB External Storage; SMB Volume
Servers; Storage Management Software/Data Protection Software; Systems and
Network Management Software; Unified Communications/Voice-over-IP
Technology; and Workgroup Color Printers.

    The CRN Channel Champions survey was conducted between January 2009 and
February 2009. Solution Providers were chosen at random from CRN's
subscriber list and were pre-qualified to ensure that they worked in the
category, were familiar with the products and had a significant
relationship with the vendor(s) being rated. Many respondents were
qualified to rate more than one vendor. CRN specified that VARs and
technology integrators rate only those vendors with whom they had either a
strategic partner type of business relationship, when possible. Vendors
rated in each category were chosen on the basis of market share data
provided by major research firms. In the case where market share data was
not available, vendors were chosen by CRN senior editorial staff
recommendations. VARs and technology integrators were asked to rate the
relative importance of the individual evaluation criteria. To derive the
overall score for each vendor, the raw satisfaction scores were weighted
according to the relative importance of the evaluation criteria.

    "IBM is committed to driving solutions with our Business Partners that
help customers cut costs, drive efficiency and productivity, preserve
capital and create competitive advantage," said Rich Hume, general
manager of IBM Global Business Partners. "We are dedicated to becoming
the partner of choice and are honored that the Business Partner community
has chosen IBM as a leader in these award categories."

    "Solution Providers have come to rely on the CRN Channel Champions study
as a way to evaluate the leading technology vendors in the Channel today.
We congratulate the winners for delivering high-quality solutions that
satisfy business partners," said Robert C. DeMarzo, senior vice president
and editorial director, Everything Channel.

&lt;p&gt;March 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Avon Products
Inc (AVP.N) to "sell" from "neutral" and said the world's
largest direct seller of cosmetics is likely to be hit harder
by the economic downturn than its peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "From a geographic footprint perspective, the company has
the most exposure to emerging markets," analyst Andrew Sawyer
wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would particularly highlight the anticipated shock in
Eastern Europe and a big margin hit from transactional currency
moves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst, who cut his price target on the stock by $2 to
$16, expects profit in Eastern Europe to decline 40 percent to
45 percent in 2009. The region accounted for 23 percent of
Avon's profit last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Latin America has held up well so far, but there is
potential for slowing results alongside further currency
devaluations in markets like Venezuela, Sawyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman cut its 2009 estimates on the company by 5 cents to
$1.50 a share, reflecting marginally weaker expectations from
Europe and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The quality of earnings is likely to remain soft with the
company extending the restructuring program begun in late 2005
through 2011," Sawyer added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were trading up 10 cents at $16.22
Wednesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Archana Shankar in Bangalore; Editing by Anne

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama should recognize traditional uses of the coca leaf because not all production becomes cocaine, Bolivian President Evo Morales said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morales, a former coca farmer, also called on participants at a United Nations drug policy meeting in Vienna to lift a ban on coca for some uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My top aim (in coming here) is to defend coca, to fight for coca," Morales told a news conference through a German translator. Bolivia is the world's No. 3 cocaine producer after Colombia and Peru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca, the raw ingredient of cocaine, is used by millions of people in Bolivia and neighboring Peru to fight altitude sickness and stave off hunger. In its natural form, the leaf is also used in teas, in cooking and for religious ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope for support from President Obama for the decriminalization of coca," Morales said, adding that Bolivia is committed to the fight against cocaine and other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The new U.S. president has similarities to me," Morales said, adding that he hoped Obama would help his years-long coca crusade because of what they have in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before, nobody believed that an Indian could be president and nobody thought that a black man could be president of the United States," Morales said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales, who has banned U.S. anti-drug agents from working in Bolivia, has said his country can fight cocaine trafficking on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He ordered the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to stop its work in Bolivia in November after accusing the agency of spying and conspiring to overthrow him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. State Department report in February said Bolivian cocaine production increased rapidly last year due to greater cultivation and more efficient manufacturing methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said Bolivia had failed to live up to obligations under international agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N.'s crime agency chief said on Wednesday a 10-year anti-drug drive had partially backfired by making drug cartels so wealthy they can bribe their way through West Africa and Central America, and undermining security and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jon Boyle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Morgan Stanley
(MS.N) to "buy," saying the company was well positioned to
outperform peers, and downgraded American Express Co (AXP.N) to
"sell" on continued earnings challenges, while recommending the
two as a conviction-list pair trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of Morgan Stanley rose as much as 14 percent in
early morning trade Wednesday, while those of American Express
fell 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Capital market activity is a relative bright spot in
conversations, while consumer credit appears to be
deteriorating by the day," analysts, including Richard Ramsden,
wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman analysts also upgraded U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) to
"neutral" from "sell" as they expect the bank's recent dividend
cut to quickly rebuild its tangible common equity ratio --
which measures a bank's financial strength. [ID:nWNAB2839]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts also raised their 2009 and 2010 profit estimates
for Morgan Stanley, and said their first-quarter earnings
estimate of 40 cents a share assumes $2.3 billion in
write-downs for the company based on the performance of credit
indices since the start of December last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman analysts, who previously rated Morgan Stanley stock
"neutral," said the company is well positioned to outperform
peers due to its high capital position, reasonable valuation
levels and leverage to improve in capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Express, however, faces continued earnings
headwinds which may force the company to break even in 2009,
excluding settlement payments from Visa Inc (V.N) and
Mastercard Inc (MA.N), the analysts said. Still, American
Express has a stronger capital position than an average bank on
any metric and the risk of a dilutive capital raise was hard to
see for now, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman analysts said they maintained their cautious view
on U.S. banks as credit deterioration accelerates and
government intervention hits valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of American Express were down 23 cents at $11.94
while those of Morgan Stanley were up $2.27 at $23.11 in
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. US Bancorp shares
were up more than 11 percent at $12.69.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron`s Legal Strategy Backfires During Ecuador Court Inspections
COCA, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
As part of a last-ditch effort to delay a final decision in the world`s largest
environmental trial, additional soil testing demanded by Chevron backfired
Tuesday when waste pits in Ecuador`s Amazon jungle that the company claimed to
have "cleaned" a decade ago revealed large amounts of oil clearly visible to the
naked eye. 

The final series of tests of Chevron oil production sites, scheduled to be
completed by the end of March, will clear the way for a court decision on a $27
billion damages claim against the company, said Julio Prieto, a lawyer for the
30,000 Amazon residents who have sued the oil giant over what experts believe is
the worst oil-related contamination on the planet. 

In what has become a common delay tactic in the epic 15-year legal battle,
Chevron lawyer Adolfo Callejas had demanded for months that he be allowed to
take soil samples at eight additional oil production sites even though the
evidentiary phase of the case had been all but completed two years ago. The
court scheduled the tests for Tuesday, but Callejas requested a postponement of
the very tests he had called for just minutes before they were to be conducted
even though court officials and technical experts had traveled under armed guard
for hours to reach the sites deep in the jungle. 

The court denied the motion and ordered the tests to proceed at well sites Auca
17 and 19, leading to a dramatic and embarrassing moment for Chevron. 

With Callejas and several colleagues watching, a court-appointed technical
expert, Marcelo Munoz, lifted soil samples from waste pits that Texaco
reportedly had "remediated". Oil sludge was clearly visible to the naked eye in
waste pits that Texaco had certified to Ecuador`s government as "cleaned" in the
mid 1990s. 

Since 2004, the court has inspected 94 former Chevron oil production facilities
in the rainforest and found extensive toxic contamination at 100% of the sites,
according to a 4,000-page report by a court-appointed expert and a team of 14
independent scientists released last year. That report found the oil giant could
be liable for up to $27 billion in damages for creating what experts believe is
the worst oil-related catastrophe on the planet, covering an area the size of
Rhode Island. 

The lawsuit seeks damages for the dumping of more than 18 billion gallons of
toxic waste into Amazon waterways and the clean-up of 916 waste pits gouged out
of the jungle floor. The pollution occurred between 1964 to 1992, when Texaco
operated a large oil concession in the area, but the expert found it is still
leaching toxins into soils and groundwater in an area where tens of thousands of
people live. 

Chevron bought Texaco in 2001 and will bear any liability in the case, which was
initially filed in 1993 in federal court in New York. 

"The inspections today were a double defeat for Chevron," said Prieto.
"Chevron`s attempt to delay backfired and we now have even more evidence of how
Texaco polluted the rainforest." 

Chevron consistently has tried to use the inspections as a ploy to delay the
trial proceedings. When it appeared several weeks ago that the judge might rule
on the damages claim, Chevron`s lawyers rushed to schedule the eight
inspections. Once they were scheduled, Chevron`s lawyers tried several times to
postpone them, including the attempt yesterday by Callejas. 

Chevron had initially requested the eight inspections in 2003 and was holding
them in reserve to delay any court decision on the damages claim, said Prieto.
The plaintiffs believe the eight inspections are producing redundant evidence
and violate their due process rights, he added. 

The trial in Ecuador began in 2003 after a U.S. federal judge in New York, Jed
Rakoff, granted a request from Chevron that the case be transferred to the South
American country because the courts there were fair and a more adequate forum.
When evidence in the Ecuador trial started to point to Chevron`s culpability,
the company began to attack the very courts that it previously praised and
promised the indigenous groups they would face a "lifetime of litigation," in
the words of Chevron General Counsel Charles James. 

Chevron also has refused to pay $64,000 in Ecuador court costs for "blind" soil
samples it had requested. Chevron realizes the "blind" samples corroborate the
presence of high levels of toxins in the soil as determined by the court expert
and thinks it can get them suppressed by not paying for them, said Pablo
Fajardo, another lawyer for the plaintiffs. 

Once the inspections are completed at the end of March, the judge will be in a
position to rule on the case later in the year, said Fajardo.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Microsoft no comment, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, March 11 (Reuters) - The European Commission has
extended a deadline for Microsoft (MSFT.O) to reply to charges
that the U.S. software giant stymied rivals by bundling its
Internet Explorer Web browser with Windows systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The extension to April 21 was given after the company asked
for more time, Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission, which monitors competition in the 27-nation
European Union, sent a so-called "statement of objections" to
Microsoft on Jan. 15, saying the company had infringed EU rules
by abusing its dominant position. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By tying Internet Explorer to Windows, Microsoft shielded
its Web browser from head-to-head competition with other
browsers, undermining product innovation and reducing customer
choice, the Commission had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It had given the company eight weeks to reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and the EU have wrangled over antitrust issues for
years. The Commission fined it a record 899 million euros
($1.2 billion) in February last year for discouraging software
competition, the largest penalty ever imposed on a company at
the time.

&lt;p&gt;White Plains Company Contends Proposal Will Cost County Millions, Cites Bank`s
Plans to Spend More than $200 MM on New Jets and Hangar Enhancements
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
In what it sees as a one-David-vs.-two-Goliaths battle, Avitat Westchester is
challenging a proposal by Westchester County Executive Andrew Spano to give its
lease for one of the largest hangars at Westchester County Airport in White
Plains, New York to JPMorgan Chase. 

Avitat CEO Michael Dolphin, who told the County Board of Legislators last week
that Mr. Spano`s proposal could cost Westchester upwards of $100 million in
reduced fees and potential damages if Avitat prevails in litigation against the
County concerning the hangar, is now seeking public and business sector support
at a hearing scheduled for Monday, March 23, at the Michaelian Office building
in White Plains. 

According to Mr. Dolphin, the RFP process for the hangar`s lease renewal that is
to take effect in March of next year, was flawed, violated longstanding County
practices and was a retaliatory action against Avitat for complaining about
illegal practices at the airport. 

Mr. Dolphin has also expressed concern that regulatory and/or public reactions
to a TARP-assisted financial institution that cut its dividend by 87% and
eliminated 14,000 jobs spending more than $200 million on new jets and hangar
renovations could require Westchester to find a new lessee during the 30-year
term of the lease. Additionally, the loss of its lease will force Avitat, which
has been a lessee at the airport since 1993, to reduce its 60-person staff by
50%.

Mr. Dolphin also notes that JPMorgan Chase leases space at another hanger on the
airport, where it already is housing an existing fleet of planes.

grant the hangar lease to JPMorgan Chase can be seen by visiting

&lt;p&gt;Global Retail CIO Survey Finds 50% of Retailers Will Maintain IT Budgets While
26% Expect to Increase IT Spending in 2010
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Aldata Solution, Inc., a leading provider of software solutions for the retail
industry, today released findings from the first annual global retail CIO
survey, jointly sponsored with IBM. Despite difficult economic conditions, the
survey found that more than half of the retailers interviewed (51%) expect their
IT budget as a percent of sales to stay the same for next year, while 26%
believe their IT budget will actually increase, due to projects already
underway. The survey of retail CIOs and IT directors in both the United States
and Europe was undertaken in Q4 2008 by retail industry research specialists
Martec International. 

The Aldata/IBM Retail CIO Survey indicates that most retailers are looking to
use IT investment to squeeze greater returns out of assets they already own,
such as inventory and space. IT investment is planned for systems that help
improve stock management and availability, increase sales from new channels and
improve promotional effectiveness. The survey also revealed that retailers are
far less likely to consider investing in areas that do not deliver short-term
ROI. 

"This survey was carried out at the end of 2008 when retailers were feeling the
full force of the recession, which makes the results all the more encouraging,"
said Allan Davies, CMO, Aldata. "It is quite clear that CIOs are not losing
their nerve, and that retailers continue to see IT investment not as a luxury,
but as a means of reducing cost and improving business performance over a
comparatively short time period. This certainly fits with our experience over
the last few quarters. There is little appetite to rip and replace entire
systems, but a real focus on putting in solutions in specific areas such as
automatic replenishment, where the gains can be felt in months, rather than
years." 

Replenishment

Globally, the survey showed that 87% of retailers either have, or plan to have
automatic replenishment applications within the next three years. The results
were particularly striking in EMEA, where the figure was 97%, with almost half
of the respondents either in the process of implementing upgrades or planning
new systems. Thirty percent of retailers considered automatic replenishment as
the most important replenishment optimization and stock management application,
followed by demand forecasting (27%). 

Logistics &amp; Distribution

In terms of logistics and distribution applications, the top application was
real-time warehouse management, with 84% of U.S. respondents already using such
systems and a further 11% planning upgrades. Mobile applications also featured
strongly, the data again showing U.S. retailers further advanced than their EMEA
counterparts. While in EMEA, 62% of retailers surveyed have already implemented
mobile applications, with a further 29% planning to upgrade or implement new
systems, 100% of U.S. retailers surveyed are already using mobile applications
in logistics and distribution, with 16% planning to upgrade over the next three
years. 

IT &amp; Data Architecture

Enterprise Master Data Management (MDM) was shown to be the most important
application in this area, scored as such by 36% of respondents. This is the only
instance in the survey where an application that is not the most widely
implemented - only 28% of the sample have already implemented MDM - was the top
priority for most retailers with 48% of retailers either planning to upgrade or
implement MDM within the next three years. 

For the global retail CIO survey, senior level IT executives were interviewed
between September 2008 and January 2009, from North America and Europe, Middle
East and Africa (EMEA). Retailers interviewed had sales exceeding $100 million
for non-food category management retailers and $250 million for food retailers.
The sales of the companies interviewed totaled $265 billion and represents 5% of
the North American and EMEA retail market. The total number of stores for all
retailers interviewed was more than 40,000.

&lt;p&gt;March 11 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Big

trends at the retailer are beginning to show resilience and
expects it to benefit from controlled expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

free cash flow and attainable yearly outlook, said the analyst
who raised his price target on the stock to $23 from $17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe Big Lots remains the best positioned retailer
we cover to take advantage of the soft consumer backdrop, and
the company continues to see more deals today than at any point
in recent history," Grom said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Big Lots, which specializes in sales of excess
inventory, posted quarterly profit that fell, but still managed
to beat analysts' expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company had closed at $18.58 Tuesday on the

offering, IBM Proventia Endpoint Secure Control (ESC), that is designed
to enable enterprises to escape from the constraints of vendor lock-in
and to enhance endpoint security, compliance and operations at a lower
cost. This new endpoint security offering is delivered by IBM Internet
Security Systems (IBM ISS) leveraging IBM's depth in security experience
and technology from BigFix, Inc. for endpoint security management.

    The IBM ISS solution delivers endpoint security management designed to
address two major problems in the industry today: the escalating cost of
security and the growing complexity of endpoint security management.
Companies today face a dilemma, they either have to choose between
managing dozens of point security products separately to meet their needs
or lock into one vendor who doesn't. The single vendor suites in the
marketplace today are often a result of multiple security acquisitions
that haven't been adequately integrated so that customers still need to
manage separate point products. Further, the strategy that locks-in
clients to one provider allows vendors to remain complacent instead of
innovating to provide the strongest security on the market. Both
scenarios can mean rising operational and licensing costs for customers,
and fall short when it comes to providing best-of-breed security. The IBM
Proventia Endpoint Secure Control offering balances customer needs with a
single security management interface and flexible choice of some of the
best security solutions in the marketplace to address those needs.

    In addition, according to the 2008 IBM X-Force Annual Trend and Risk
report released in early February, client-side vulnerabilities are at an
all time high and end-users are key targets to fall prey to attacks. In
fact, the report indicates that the number of new malicious Web sites in
the fourth quarter of 2008 alone surpassed the number seen in the
entirety of 2007 by 50 percent. Seemingly innocent applications such as
document readers and editors experienced a 162 percent increase in
vulnerabilities, while vulnerabilities in often used multimedia
applications increased by 127 percent. As employees unknowingly access
these malicious web sites and applications through their corporate
machines, endpoint security is critical. With IBM Proventia ESC, IBM ISS
will leverage the endpoint offering to help deliver 'ahead of the threat'
X-Force security content.

    IBM Proventia Endpoint Secure Control combines many of the key areas of
security endpoint management -- including intrusion prevention systems
(IPS), firewall and network access control; data protection such as device
control, data loss prevention and endpoint encryption; security
configuration, and compliance management; as well as IT security
operations such as security patch management, and deployment/removal of
security tools -- that frees enterprises to choose best-of-breed point
security products from an array of vendors and manage them as a
consolidated solution. The end result can be superior security with
increased ease-of-use at a lower overall cost. Moreover, as information
security threats and customer requirements evolve, the product is
designed to easily integrate new security capabilities.

    "The killer application in endpoint security is management," said Dan
Powers, vice president of business development at IBM Internet Security
Systems. "Historically, enterprises have had to make tradeoffs between
consolidated security management and best-of-breed technology for endpoint
security. With IBM Proventia Endpoint Secure Control, enterprises can
benefit from best-of-breed security technology and consolidated management
of the security products at the endpoint for the first time. This solution
illustrates IBM's commitment to lead the next wave of innovation in the
industry while helping to reduce the cost and complexity of security for
our customers."

    IBM Proventia ESC breaks new ground by encouraging vendors to open their
solutions to work together, thus radically simplifying the complex
endpoint security marketplace. The new tool will complement IBM Tivoli's
operational desktop management offerings with robust endpoint operational
security solutions, allowing customers the ability to address end point
security. IBM Proventia ESC will also provide key endpoint security audit
data to IBM Tivoli Security Information and Event Manager (TSIEM), further
strengthening TSIEM's enterprise-wide compliance reporting capabilities.

    "We're excited to work with IBM to provide open endpoint security
management," said Dave Robbins, BigFix Chairman and CEO. "Customers want
escape from reactive, one-tool-per-threat security to consolidated
approaches that help reduce costs and strengthen defenses."

    IBM Proventia Endpoint Secure Control will be available in the spring of
2009. At that time IBM will provide current IBM Proventia Desktop clients
an upgrade path to the new offering.

&lt;p&gt;Award-Winning Black Rock Studio Creating Innovative New Action-Racing Game Where
Speed Meets Strategy in a City Rigged for Destruction
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Racing to the finish line takes on added excitement when competitors trigger
destruction on the track to take out their opponents. Disney Interactive Studios
today announced Split/Second, an intense action racing game set within the world
of a hyper-competitive reality television show. Competitors vie to be the first
across the finish line in a made-for-TV city built for destruction, with the
ultimate goal of becoming the season champion. Developed by Black Rock Studio,
Split/Second is scheduled to be released in early 2010 for the Xbox 360 video
game and entertainment system from Microsoft, PLAYSTATION3 computer
entertainment system and Windows-based PC. 

Competitors in Split/Second don`t just collide with other vehicles to knock them
from the track -- they can also trigger explosive events that drastically alter
the dynamics of the race. Players must use strategy and pinpoint timing to
derail opponents, tactically alter the track or create entirely new routes. 

"Split/Second elevates action racing to a new level by enabling players to
strategically take out their opponents by dynamically altering the course in
real time," said Craig Relyea, senior vice president of global marketing, Disney
Interactive Studios. "Split/Second further showcases Black Rock Studio`s ability
to innovate and deliver a compelling experience that has wide appeal beyond the
traditional racing genre." 

"We`re creating huge memorable moments on par with the biggest blockbuster
action films," said Nick Baynes, game director, Black Rock Studio. "Action
racing has captured the imagination of video game fans worldwide and we`re going
to redefine that experience with Split/Second." 

Black Rock Studio is the development studio behind the critically acclaimed 2008
action sports game, PURE. PURE won numerous awards, including the Game Critics
Award for Best Racing Game of E3 2008, and was named among the top 10 video
games of 2008 by Entertainment Weekly. Formerly Climax Racing, Black Rock Studio
is a development studio of Disney Interactive Studios and is based in Brighton,
England.

&lt;p&gt;ENOVIA coupled with Microsoft Dynamics AX and SQL to Optimize Akva`s Worldwide
Business Processes. Return on Investment Expected within 12 Month
PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Dassault Syst&#232;mes (DS) (Paris:DSY) (NASDAQ:DASTY) , a world leader in 3D and
Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions, today announced that Norway`s
global aquaculture enterprise, Akva Group, will integrate Dassault Syst&#232;mes
ENOVIA solution with its existing Microsoft Dynamics AX solution. Akva designs,
manufactures and services aquaculture systems for land and water based fish
farms around the world. The ENOVIA technology will enable Akva Group to
synchronize collaborative business practices, business management and expansion
across its worldwide facilities. 

Implemented by Technia, Dassault Syst&#232;mes` Norwegian business partner, Akva will
deploy several ENOVIA products including Designer, Engineering and Program
Centrals to manage key business processes, including materials compliance and
global IP management. These PLM functionalities in conjunction with Akva`s
installed mechanical design system, SolidWorks, and the Group`s Microsoft
Dynamics AX ERP system will operate on a Microsoft SQL Server. 

Akva Group Chief Operating Officer, Jone Gjerde said, "ENOVIA PLM provides an
enterprise wide collaboration platform for our global business and R+D resource,
allowing developers from all over the world to work together within a single
unified repository for IP retention, change management, quality and release
processes. Newly acquired businesses will speedily accord with Akva compliance
standards following the introduction of ENOVIA methodologies." 

Mr. Gjerde who previously experienced implementing Global PLM at ABB, added,
"Dassault Syst&#232;mes ENOVIA was selected by Akva because of its advanced
functionality, speedy `out of the box` configuration, installation and
implementation procedures. We expect its very competitive pricing to produce
financial payback within 12 months." 

In a bid to sustain world demand for healthy low fat protein without depleting
wild fish stocks, and indeed aiding their recovery, fish farms are becoming ever
larger and more productive. Akva is the fish-farmers` one-stop-shop for
everything from advanced biomass calculators and Doppler feed sensors, to huge
sea lion proof enclosures, ships equipped to clean nets and bring food, and the
software and electronics that secure maximum yield. 

Mr. Gjerde concluded, "The benefit to Akva of ENOVIA PLM, coupled with Microsoft
ERP technology is that it facilitates seamless unification and synchronicity
with common business standards across our expanding global enterprise. This
positions Akva to capitalize on the increasing demand for aquaculture and fish
farms while being extremely efficiently organized and informed."

&lt;p&gt;* Sutent study stopped after delayed progression seen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Patients taking placebos allowed to switch to Sutent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer shrs rise almost 10 percent, helped by drug study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A rare form of pancreatic cancer that has afflicted Apple Inc CEO Steve Jobs responded so well to Pfizer Inc's drug, Sutent, that a study was stopped early so all patients could take the pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independent safety board monitoring the late-stage study recommended halting it after concluding that Sutent delayed progression of the cancer compared with people taking a placebo along with standard treatment, Pfizer said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who took Sutent in the trial will be allowed to continue doing so, and those who were given placebos will now have the option of taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients in the study had advanced pancreatic islet cell tumors, also known as neuroendocrine cancer. It occurs in specialized cells of the pancreas that secrete a variety of hormones, including insulin and enzymes involved in digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other types of pancreatic cancer occur in ducts of the pancreas -- small tubes that transport digestive enzymes produced in the pancreas to the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This form of pancreatic cancer involves only about 5 percent of all pancreatic cancer cases, and grows and spreads more slowly" than other types of pancreatic cancer, said Mace Rothenberg, a senior Pfizer research executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When surgery to remove the cancer is not possible, or when cancer returns after surgery, Rothenberg said life expectancy is only several years, and patients can experience difficult symptoms, such as life-threatening high levels of insulin and stomach ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sutent is currently approved for treating advanced kidney cancer as well as gastrointestinal tract tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOBS HAD SURGERY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jobs, who co-founded Apple Computer and turned it into a consumer juggernaut after returning as chief executive a decade ago, underwent surgery in 2004 to remove an islet cell tumor from his pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Jobs said he would take a five-month medical leave because his health problems were more complex than originally thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tech innovator acknowledged that he had been losing weight throughout 2008 and said his doctors determined a hormone imbalance had been depriving him of vital proteins. That triggered speculation that his cancer had returned and was upsetting hormones involved in digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BLOCKBUSTER IN THE MAKING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sutent, which had fourth-quarter sales of $220 million, is also undergoing late-stage studies against cancers of the breast, lungs, colon, prostate and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herman Saftlas, an analyst with Standard  Poor's, predicted on Thursday that Sutent would generate annual sales of $1.5 billion by 2013, up from his earlier view of $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer has had a lackluster history of drug development, but got some good news today," said Saftlas, adding that the trial results bolstered company shares in an already strong rally for the broad stock market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's stock was up 9.7 percent to $14.03 in afternoon trading, outpacing a 4.6 percent rise in the American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Gunna Dickson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Thursday said it had lined up 29 additional lenders, beyond five previously secured, to provide all $22.5 billion in loans for its planned $68 billion purchase of U.S. rival Wyeth WYE.N.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks featured in this
week`s analysis include Citigroup (NYSE: C), American International Group (NYSE:
AIG), General Electric (NYSE: GE), Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: GS) and
WestAmerica Bancorp (Nasdaq: WABC). 

Zacks Industry Rank Analysis is written by Charles Rotblut, CFA, Senior Market
Analyst for Zacks.com. 

This week: Wait to Buy Financial Stocks

After yesterday's rally in the financial stocks, you might be wondering if it's
finally time to buy. The short answer is "not yet". The long answer is more
complicated. 

News of an internal memo from Citigroup's (NYSE: C) CEO, Vikram Pandit, sparked
the rally. Pandit proclaimed that the company was both "profitable" so far this
year and that it was "the strongest capitalized large U.S. bank". 

Adding fuel to the fire was the proposal by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to
overhaul banking regulations. Traders were also hopeful that a change to
mark-to-market rules would be made and the uptick rule would be reinstated. 

Financials Are Full of False Hope

Though this sounds like good news, the truth is that we've been there, done
that. 

Pandit's comments might sound optimistic, but they are really just a broken
record. 

CEO Alan Schwartz said Bear Stearns would not have any more write-downs 2 months
before his firm failed. Lehman Brothers' CEO, Dick Fuld, was defiant until the
end. John Thain pounded the desk on Merrill Lynch before being forced into a
shotgun merger. 

Even the markets are skeptical about Citigroup. Yesterday's 40% jump didn't even
push the stock above $1.50, or about the price for a bottle of water. And even
with this morning's additional gain, it still costs more to ride the train from
my office in downtown Chicago to Wrigley Field than it does to buy a share of C.


Still Waiting On Federal Salvation

The Fed and the Treasury Department continue to evolve their policies. Unfilled
key positions at the Treasury Department are certainly not helping, but Bernanke
continues to shift his strategy as well. 

The reluctance to delve fully into nationalization remains a sticking point,
even though U.S. taxpayers are taking a huge risk on C, American International
Group (NYSE: AIG) and many other firms. 

Mark-to-market accounting is another sticking point, particularly in terms of
how to change it. A House Financial Services Subcommittee will discuss the
matter on Thursday. 

Then there is the uptick rule, which bars traders from short-selling a stock
unless the most recent trade is higher than the previous. Some blame the removal
of this rule for causing stocks to plunge. As if that rule was responsible for
the gross mismanagement of financial firms, the imprudent lending strategies or
the willingness of some people to buy homes they couldn't possibly afford. 

Capitalism works by punishing those who make mistakes. If a CEO does not want
his stock shorted, there is a simple solution - do a better job of running your
company. 

What's On Those Balance Sheets?

The biggest issue, however, continues to be that banks don't know what is on
their balance sheets. A year after the financial firms supposedly threw in
everything but the kitchen sink (anybody remember some of the statements made in
response to 2007 fourth-quarter earnings?), they still don't know how many
kitchen sinks they own. 

Credit cards are only adding to the problems. Though not as big a problem as
mortgages, the recession will cause credit card default rates to rise. New fees
and higher interest rates are only compounding matters. 

This is why Financials has one of the worst ranks of any sector. Earnings
estimates continue to be cut across the board as brokerage analysts realize over
and over again that they have underestimated just how badly banks and other
financial firms are struggling. (During the past 4 weeks, 6 full-year profit
projections have been cut for every forecast that has been raised.) 

Technical Analysis Doesn't Work Either

Perhaps the biggest short-term risk to the financial stocks, however, is that
they have become very difficult to trade. Fundamental analysis doesn't work
because their balance sheets are a mess and earnings estimates keep getting
slashed. 

Technical analysis is not helpful either. Financial stocks, particularly banking
stocks, are trading off of speculation about how close they are to failing
and/or being nationalized. For some stocks, the current share price reflects
nothing more than an option call on the company's survival as a stand-alone
entity. (This was getting to be the case with General Electric (NYSE: GE)
because of problems with its financial arm.) 

Even day trading does not work well, given the potential for sharp, intraday
reversals. 

Suggestions for Investors

If the only thing you did since 2007 was pay attention to the Zacks Rank, you
would have avoided the wreckage in the financial sector. In fact, you went a
step further and shorted the sector (or individual stocks directly), you would
have profited handsomely. 

As someone who has been very bearish towards financial stocks, I acknowledge
there is a point when attitudes need to change. Though the downside risk for a
stock at any point in time is 100% (a stock can always fall to $0), it's
difficult to say how much downside is truly left in the financial sector. Those
that have been short should consider how much additional profit they think they
can really make. 

On the other hand, I'm not convinced it is time to buy financial stocks either.
Sentiment and shifting policy decisions make it impossible to determine how
these stocks will trade from day to day. 

Last week, our equity research analysts recommended that investors consider
waiting for signs of stabilization in the credit and stock markets. At that
point, use dollar cost averaging to build positions in potential winners such as
Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: GS) and WestAmerica Bancorp (Nasdaq: WABC). 

Doing so might result in the loss of some upside, but given that downside risks
still remain, this strategy could help you sleep at night.

the U.S. is ready to assume a leadership position in solving one of the most
serious challenges facing our planet today. By turning out the lights, the
people of New York City will be casting a vote in support of the future of the

&lt;p&gt;* Sutent study stopped after delayed progression seen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+ Patients taking placebos allowed to switch to Sutent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A study of Pfizer Inc's Sutent was halted early after the medicine delayed progression of a rare form of pancreatic cancer affecting tens of thousands of people globally, including Apple Inc CEO Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independent safety board monitoring the late-stage study recommended halting it after concluding that patients on Sutent stayed free of disease progression for longer than those on placebo plus best supportive care, Pfizer said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the clearly favorable trend, patients who took Sutent in the trial will be allowed to continue doing so, and those who were given placebos will now have the option of taking the drug instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients in the study had advanced pancreatic islet cell tumors, also known as neuroendocrine cancer. It occurs in specialized cells of the pancreas that secrete a variety of hormones, including insulin and enzymes involved in digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other types of pancreatic cancer occur in ducts of the pancreas -- small tubes that transport digestive enzymes produced in the pancreas to the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This form of pancreatic cancer involves only about 5 percent of all pancreatic cancer cases, and grows and spreads more slowly" than other types of pancreatic cancer, said Mace Rothenberg, a senior Pfizer research executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when surgery to remove the cancer is not possible, or when cancer returns after surgery, Rothenberg said life expectancy is only several years, and patients can experience difficult symptoms, such as life-threatening high levels of insulin and stomach ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sutent, which had fourth-quarter sales of $220 million, is currently approved for treating advanced kidney cancer as well as gastrointestinal tract tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is also testing the medicine in late-stage studies against cancers of the breast, lungs, colon, prostate and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer were up 5.2 percent to $13.45 in morning trading, amid a 2.9 percent rise in the American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Gunna Dickson)&lt;/p&gt;

Job Skills Training Program to Assist Unemployed Apparel Workers</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
As a result of a recent grant from Microsoft Corporation,the educational
non-profit organization Fashion Business Inc. has launched a free job skills
training program targeting unemployed apparel workers. The Microsoft/ Fashion
Business Inc. Job Skills Training Program is specifically designed to help
unemployed job seekers update their industry related computer skills and
increase their chances of securing full time employment. 

The program, designed by apparel industry experts, uses real world exercises to
demonstrate how Microsoft products and other software systems are most
effectively used in the world of corporate apparel.

Classroom participants range from recent fashion school graduates unable to find
full time employment to business owners who have had to close shop due to the
recent economic downturn. Other attendees are industry veterans whose positions
were recently eliminated, which prompted them to update their skills to become
more competitive job candidates. 

"With Microsoft's support we are able to help displaced workers take advantage
of these slow and challenging times, helping them to come out stronger on the
other side," says FBI Executive Director Frances Harder. "People are excited
about being able to re-group and strengthen their skills without any additional

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Mar 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that analyst firm, Gartner, has named IBM
a leader in its February 2009 report, "Magic Quadrant for Data Center
Outsourcing Services, Western Europe."

    IBM has made strategic investments to develop a portfolio of repeatable,
automated services solutions that enables the company to deliver business
value rapidly and reliably to clients across a range of industries. In
tandem, IBM has built a massive global delivery network which incorporates
over 80 strategic centers around the world and serves thousands of
clients. IBM's global delivery capabilities are a key differentiator as
they allow the company to deliver services seamlessly by harnessing IBM's
infrastructure, processes, tools and skilled resources. The global
delivery centers are a key component of IBM's strategy as a globally
integrated enterprise, allowing outsourcing clients to capitalize on a
global talent pool to drive profitable growth.

    "IBM has transformed its services model globally, and we believe Gartner's
assessment of our outsourcing services leadership in Western Europe
underscores the success of IBM's global business model," said Maureen
Sweeny, IBM general manager, Strategic Outsourcing in Europe. "IBM's
multi-country delivery model, technical excellence and Research and
Development arm make us particularly strong during the economic downturn
in terms of helping clients transform their business, drive innovation and
reduce IT infrastructure cost and risk."

    The report's overall evaluation is based on companies' ability to execute
(services offered and capabilities; overall viability; sales execution and
pricing; market responsiveness and track record; and customer experience)
and completeness of vision (market understanding; sales strategy; offering
strategy; business model; innovation; and geographic strategy). Gartner
defines Western Europe as Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the U.K.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
A major national research study has highlighted the extreme lack of affection
held by US consumers for leading financial corporations. The Milestones survey
reveals that more than half of the 22 brands examined from the financial sector
were ranked by consumers in the lowest 100 out of 653 brands, with many ending
rock bottom. Only credit card companies, notably Visa, were ranked significantly
higher amongst financial brands. 

Milestones is a collaboration between market research agencies Kadence, Brand
Care and So What Research. It was conducted online amongst 5,500 educated and
affluent consumers aged 18-54 during the crucial pre-Holidays shopping period in
December 2008. This coincided with heavy media coverage of the credit crunch and
corresponding decline in consumer confidence. 

The survey reveals the worst-rated financial brands are AIG (ranked 651st out of
653 brands), Citi (604th), Liberty Mutual (591st), Bank of America (569th) and
Chase (487th). The two most notable exceptions are Visa and MasterCard, which
ranked 79th and 242nd respectively. Taking into consideration overall awareness
levels of each brand along with consumer affection, the rankings change to push
Visa into 34th position with MasterCard 122nd. American Express also made the
top half of this separate list in 241st position. 

Owen Jenkins, CEO of Boston-based Kadence Business Research, comments: "Given
what has happened within the financial sector over the past year, it is no
surprise that affection for financial brands is so low. Consumers are clearly
aware of the plights of the most troubled financial corporations and have an
understandable mistrust of most of the rest. The big surprise is that there are
a few isolated brands in the same market that are more highly regarded even at a
time of global recession. 

"People still love credit cards despite the credit crunch! One possible reason
for this is that consumers relied on credit cards to help them through their
Holiday spending. It will be interesting to see how their affection towards
brands like Visa, MasterCard and American Express changes as the recession bites
deeper and the bills mount up." 

Detailed analysis of financial brands is just one aspect of the whole, much
larger survey of more than 650 leading US brands. Milestones shows a strong link
between the affection consumers hold for a brand and its stock performance. The
findings reveal valuable insights into which brands may have the best
positioning to withstand the current economic downturn and the exact mix of
personality traits that make some brands do well while others suffer*. 

The full report will give brand marketers across all sectors powerful
intelligence on which to base strategic marketing decisions. In addition,
investment analysts will benefit from a range of insights into consumer
preferences that link closely to the brand-owning company`s stock price.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Mar 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Amid concerns that the economic downturn could impact their career plans,
eight in 10 U.S. college students see a growing need for more IT
professionals as technology advances, according to a survey by IBM (NYSE:
IBM) and the Marist Institute for Public Opinion.

    The survey of more than 1,600 college students reveals that more than 50
percent are seeking to improve their own technology skills before they
graduate. Eight in 10 expect to encounter new technology that they will
need to learn, adapt to and master once they enter the workforce.

    The findings come at a time when nearly one million technology-related
jobs are expected to emerge as a result of President Obama's $787 billion
"American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009."

    The U.S. government has made a call to action to modernize the nation's
technology infrastructure. This includes digitizing healthcare records,
adopting energy efficient practices and expanding broadband networks. As a
result, companies will look to hire more software developers, IT
consultants and managers who possess both the technology and business
skills necessary to support these investments.

    While students see an increased need for IT skills, 60 percent surveyed --
part of the generation which has grown up with the Internet and social
networking tools -- said personal use and experience have formed their
technology skills, leading many to yearn for more formal training in this
area.

    "The United States is preparing to lead the way in the development of
smart technology systems to address some of the world's most pressing
issues," said Jim Corgel, General Manager, ISV and Developer Relations,
IBM. "Businesses and academia must work together to prepare students for
these new opportunities."


 Additional survey findings include:

    

    
College students are pervasive users of technology today: 99 percent own
a cell phone, 93 percent own a laptop, 97 percent have a profile on a
social networking site. 

    
Three-quarters of college students are inspired by computers and
technology and seven in 10 view technology as "the future." 

    
Among the skill areas students said they needed to improve, technology,
writing and marketing ranked in the top three. 

    
Business and Academia Responds

    The survey underscores IBM's ongoing efforts to help academia identify job
market-critical skills, and then adapt and advance their curriculum to
better prepare students for the workplace.

    Since 2004, IBM's Academic Initiative program has reached more than 2.5
million university students with software and hardware courses. IBM
partners with more than 9,000 academics at 4,600 colleges and universities
worldwide.

    For example, in California, San Jose State University is now integrating
key technology topics into its core courses in the College of Business.

    "Increasingly, we're moving towards smarter infrastructures that promise
to fundamentally change the way we live and work," said Professor Stephen
Kwan, Professor of Management Information Systems at San Jose State
University's College of Business. "There has never been a better
opportunity to ensure we are arming our students with the smart skills for
the jobs of the future. We need to develop curriculum that meets the
evolving needs of our students and their employers."

    "We hear from companies all the time that need students with a diverse
technology skillset. This diversity creates greater opportunity for
students, and a better prepared workforce for employers," added Karen
Hayes, Industry Liaison at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. "We
are interested in working with IBM to understand the needs and
opportunities ahead."

    Companies in the emerging green tech and clean tech spaces also cite the
need for employees with specialized skillsets to help build out smarter
energy grids and wireless sensors.

    "We are facing a very unique situation with the emergence of a digital
grid and smart buildings," notes Peter Van Deventer, President &amp; CEO of
SynapSense Corporation. SynapSense, based near Sacramento, California, is
a leading provider of wireless instrumentation solutions for
energy-efficient data centers, and is poised to benefit from stimulus
funding for smart grid projects.

    "What we will see is an emerging blend of skills that cross over between
the facility and the technology infrastructure itself. And this means we
will need a workforce with a balanced set of skills," he said.

    Survey Methodology

    An online survey was conducted by the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion of 1,613 college-enrolled undergraduates nationwide. The objective
of the survey was to assess American college students' perceptions of
their education, skillsets, career goals and technology.

    The survey was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2008, from November 4th
through November 17th, 2008. It has a margin of error of +/- 2.5 percent.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today that a phase 3 clinical trial of Sutent (sunitinib
malate) has been stopped early after the drug showed significant benefit in
patients with advanced pancreatic islet cell tumors, also known as pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors. 

An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended halting the trial
after concluding that Sutent demonstrated greater progression-free survival
compared to placebo plus best supportive care in patients with pancreatic islet
cell tumors. 

"We are delighted by these findings which demonstrate that Sutent provides a
benefit for patients with advanced, well-differentiated pancreatic islet cell
tumors - a rare cancer with limited treatment options," said Dr. Mace
Rothenberg, senior vice president of medical development and clinical affairs
for Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit. "These and previously reported phase 2 data
contribute to the growing body of evidence indicating activity with sunitinib in
patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors." 

Pfizer has notified clinical trial investigators involved in the trial and
regulatory agencies of the DMC recommendations. All patients in the trial will
have the option to continue taking Sutent or be switched from placebo to Sutent.
The full data set from this trial is being analyzed and more details will be
presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. 

This phase III trial of sunitinib in patients with advanced pancreatic islet
cell tumors was initiated based on the results of a earlier phase II trial
published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology(July 2008). 

In contrast to exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma, pancreatic islet cell tumors
are rare, indolent tumors of the endocrine pancreas with an incidence of 5-10
per million worldwide annually. Pancreatic islet cell tumors include
insulinomas, glucagonomas and gastrinomas. Current treatment options are
limited. 

Sutent is currently approved for both advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and
second-line gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), based on efficacy and safety
data from large, randomized Phase 3 clinical trials. Sutent has played an
important role in reshaping the treatment landscape for these two
difficult-to-treat cancers. To date, more than 38,000 patients globally have
been treated with Sutent in the clinical setting and trials. 

This is the second phase III Sutent trial Pfizer has stopped early on the
recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee due to benefit. In
January 2005, a phase III trial in GIST was unblinded early when a planned
interim analysis showed significantly longer time to tumor progression with
Sutent compared to placebo. 

Sunitinib Clinical Research Program

Pfizer is pursuing a broad development program for sunitinib malate and is
studying its role in the potential treatment of various solid tumors including
advanced breast cancer, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, advanced colorectal
cancer, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced hormone-refractory
prostate cancer in Phase 3 trials. 

Healthcare professionals who are interested in learning more about sunitinib
trials that are open for enrollment can visit the SUN program web site at
www.suntrials.com. Patients with questions should contact their treating
physician or obtain additional information through Pfizer, by calling
1-800-TRY-FIRST (1-800-879-4377). 

About SUTENT&#174; (sunitinib malate)

SUTENT is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced
RCC and GIST after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate. 

SUTENT works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important SUTENT targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. SUTENT also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important SUTENT&#174; (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on SUTENT. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with SUTENT. 

The most common adverse reactions in advanced RCC and GIST clinical trials were
fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia,
abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin
discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt;  ATLANTA, GA, Mar 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Southface Energy Institute, the Southeast's non-profit leader in the
promotion of sustainable homes, workplaces and communities, has awarded
The Coca-Cola Company its Argon Award for 2009 -- an honor that
recognizes leadership in sustainability. The Coca-Cola Company accepted
its award last night at Southface's tenth annual Visionary Dinner amid a
galaxy of Atlanta luminaries and business leaders.

    Said Muhtar Kent, president and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, "At The
Coca-Cola Company, we have seen through our own experiences -- time and
again -- that our business in any market is only as healthy and
sustainable as the community in which we operate. Sustainability is not a
one-off project or initiative. It has to be a movement; a way of life; a
way of thinking about the world. Receiving the prestigious Argon Award
from Southface reinforces and reaffirms our continued commitment to
environmental sustainability."

    Southface presents the Argon Award annually to a Georgia-based business
leader or institution in recognition of a significant commitment to
environmental stewardship. The Visionary Dinner at which the Argon Award
is presented is hosted by Southface and the Metro Atlanta Chamber. Ray
Anderson of Interface, Inc. received the inaugural Argon Award in 2000,
and Sam A. Williams, President of the Metro Atlanta Chamber accepted the
award in 2005.

    Explained  Dennis Creech, Executive Director of Southface, "With the
recent surge of interest in sustainable business practices, it is
encouraging to see corporate leaders like The Coca-Cola Company set a
global example through its climate change policies as well as its
commitment to recycling, waste reduction and responsible management of
water resources. We are proud to recognize their important contribution
to a greener, more sustainable world."

    In addition to the Argon Award presentation, Southface's Visionary Dinner
brought leaders from the business and environmental communities together
to 'savor the sustainable table' -- a beautifully presented wine-paired
feast of locally grown, sustainably produced foods prepared by a roster of
outstanding local chefs. Whole Foods Market served as the event's title
sponsor.

    Bracken Hendricks of the Center for American Progress in Washington D.C.
delivered the evening's green jobs-focused keynote speech titled,
'Building the Green Economy.'

&lt;p&gt;VELIZY, France &amp; MUNICH &amp; ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Regulatory News: 

IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Dassault Syst&#232;mes (DS) (Paris:DSY) (NASDAQ:DASTY) (Euronext
Paris: #13065, DSY.PA) today announced BMW's use of a single digital software
environment for the design of all BMW engines across its fuel and diesel-powered
cars, motorcycles, and its newest line of eco-friendly, hybrid cars including
the industry`s first hydrogen-powered vehicle. 

With the use of CATIA software, a 3D virtual design platform, engineers can
consolidate design environments and create a single reference model for the
design of all future BMW engines. IBM and Dassault Syst&#232;mes PLM experts have
helped the automaker to harmonize and consolidate all design initiatives into a
single digital infrastructure that provides the latest technologies to aid in
the software simulation, calculation and testing of new engine models. 

As industrial sector companies intensify efforts to deliver increased value to
customers, they are using smart technology to help launch a new class of
products. For example, working with IBM and Dassault Systemes, BMW has developed
a series of software design initiatives aimed at equipping new cars with
fuel-saving technologies. From designing smaller engines to increasing piston
and cylinder performance for better ignition and fuel performance, product
lifecycle management software continues to play a key role in the intelligent
design of new products. 

In the past, aerodynamicists, physicists, and product engineers relied on CAD
geometry and manual changes to create new design models. With CATIA, product
designers can create multiple engineering applications that significantly
enhance a manufacturer`s ability to digitally share master versions of an engine
or a gear-box design. The use of one digital reference model that can be updated
and shared instantly across the globe helps BMW respond quickly to consumer
changes prior to signing off on production and shipment plans. 

"BMW is in a leadership position to speed up change in the auto industry. With
this digital design infrastructure, the company can quickly respond to consumer
changes and production demand by having immediate access to global design plans
and making those updates digitally so they are instantly shared across global
manufacturing sites and with partners in the supply chain," said Steve Mills,
senior vice president and group executive, IBM Software. 

Using CATIA software, BMW has shipped 22 new cars with engines that produce less
than 140 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometer, an achievement that meets
the goals set by Kyoto Protocol participants in 1992 as part of an international
treaty on climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally. 

"We are convinced that the extended deployment of our 3D PLM software across all
BMW divisions will deliver quick results for BMW and its customers," said Bruno
Latchague, executive vice president, Dassault Syst&#232;mes. "BMW can now streamline
all its design and product development activities on a single platform that is
easy to share with its suppliers. This reflects an important move in times where
return on investment is more critical than ever."

&lt;p&gt;V&#201;LIZY-VILLACOUBLAY, France--(Business Wire)--
Regulatory News: 

IBM (NYSE : IBM) et Dassault Syst&#232;mes (DS) (Paris:DSY) (NASDAQ:DASTY) (Euronext
Paris : #13065, DSY.PA) annoncent que le constructeur automobile BMW va utiliser
une solution logicielle unique pour la conception m&#233;canique de tous les moteurs
qui seront utilis&#233;s pour ses v&#233;hicules &#224; essence et diesel, ses motos, et pour
sa toute nouvelle gamme de voitures hybrides &#233;co-&#233;nerg&#233;tiques, notamment le
premier v&#233;hicule du march&#233; fonctionnant &#224; l`hydrog&#232;ne. 

&#192; l`aide du logiciel CATIA, solution de conception virtuelle en 3D, les
ing&#233;nieurs peuvent consolider les environnements de conception et cr&#233;er un
mod&#232;le de r&#233;f&#233;rence unique pour concevoir tous les moteurs BMW de demain. Les
experts PLM d`IBM et de Dassault Syst&#232;mes aident le constructeur &#224; harmoniser et
&#224; consolider toutes les initiatives de conception m&#233;canique au sein d`une unique
infrastructure num&#233;rique disposant des technologies les plus r&#233;centes, pour
faciliter la simulation, le calcul et les essais des nouveaux mod&#232;les de
moteurs. 

Alors qu`elles intensifient leurs efforts pour apporter une valeur ajout&#233;e
accrue &#224; leurs clients, les entreprises du secteur s`appuient sur des
technologies intelligentes pour cr&#233;er de nouvelles gammes de produits. &#192; titre
d`exemple, en collaboration avec IBM et Dassault Syst&#232;mes, BMW a d&#233;velopp&#233; une
s&#233;rie d`initiatives de conception logicielle visant &#224; doter ses nouveaux
v&#233;hicules de technologies d`&#233;conomie de carburant. Qu`il s`agisse de concevoir
des moteurs plus petits ou d`augmenter les performances des pistons et des
cylindres pour am&#233;liorer les r&#233;sultats &#224; l`allumage, ou r&#233;duire la consommation
de carburant, les logiciels de gestion du cycle de vie des produits jouent un
r&#244;le de plus en plus important dans la conception intelligente de nouveaux
produits. 

Dans le pass&#233;, les a&#233;rodynamiciens, les physiciens et les ing&#233;nieurs produits
s`appuyaient sur la CAO g&#233;om&#233;trique et les modifications manuelles pour cr&#233;er de
nouveaux mod&#232;les de conception. Avec CATIA, les concepteurs de produits peuvent
cr&#233;er plusieurs applications d`ing&#233;nierie pour am&#233;liorer de fa&#231;on significative
la capacit&#233; des fabricants &#224; partager sous forme num&#233;rique la version &#171; de
r&#233;f&#233;rence &#187; du design d`un moteur ou d`une bo&#238;te de vitesse. L`utilisation d`un
nouveau mod&#232;le de r&#233;f&#233;rence pouvant &#234;tre actualis&#233; et partag&#233; instantan&#233;ment aux
quatre coins du monde, permet &#224; BMW de r&#233;pondre rapidement aux nouvelles
attentes des consommateurs avant de valider ses projets de production et de
livraison. L`utilisation de ces techniques num&#233;riques permet de diviser par deux
les d&#233;lais de conception et de livraison des nouveaux v&#233;hicules. 

&#171; BMW occupe une position de choix pour acc&#233;l&#233;rer l`&#233;volution de l`industrie
automobile. Avec cette infrastructure de conception num&#233;rique, le constructeur
peut r&#233;agir rapidement aux souhaits de consommateurs et satisfaire les demandes
de production, gr&#226;ce &#224; un acc&#232;s imm&#233;diat aux plans de conception dans leur
ensemble et &#224; la capacit&#233; d`effectuer ces modifications sous forme num&#233;rique,
facilitant ainsi leur partage entre les diff&#233;rents sites de fabrication du monde
entier, mais aussi avec les partenaires de la cha&#238;ne logistique &#187;, d&#233;clare Steve
Mills, Senior Vice-President et Group Executive, IBM Software. 

Gr&#226;ce &#224; CATIA, BMW a livr&#233; 22 nouveaux v&#233;hicules dont le moteur produit moins de
140 grammes de CO2 au kilom&#232;tre, un r&#233;sultat conforme aux objectifs sp&#233;cifi&#233;s
par le Protocole de Kyoto en 1992 dans le cadre d`un trait&#233; international
portant sur les changements climatiques et la r&#233;duction des &#233;missions de gaz &#224;
effet de serre &#224; travers le monde. 

&#171; Nous sommes convaincus que le d&#233;ploiement &#233;tendu de notre solution PLM 3D au
sein des diff&#233;rentes divisions de BMW assurera rapidement des r&#233;sultats concrets
au constructeur et &#224; ses clients &#187;, d&#233;clare Bruno Latchague, Directeur G&#233;n&#233;ral
Adjoint de Dassault Syst&#232;mes. &#171; BMW peut &#224; pr&#233;sent rationaliser toutes ses
activit&#233;s de conception et de d&#233;veloppement produits, en s`appuyant sur une
seule plate-forme qui peut &#234;tre facilement partag&#233;e avec ses fournisseurs. Il
s`agit d`une am&#233;lioration majeure &#224; l`heure o&#249; le retour sur investissements est

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases details on a group of stocks that are currently members of
the exclusive Zacks #5 Rank List - Stocks to Sell Now. These stocks are
currently rated as a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell): Loews Corp. (NYSE: L) and
Scientific Games Corp. (NASDAQ: SGMS). Further, Zacks announced #4 Rankings
(Sell) on two other widely held stocks: Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) and Molson
Coors Brewing Co. (NYSE: TAP). To see the full Zacks #5 Rank List - Stocks to
Sell Now visit: http://at.zacks.com/?id=92

Since inception in 1988, the S 500 has outperformed the Zacks #5 Rank List -
Stocks to Sell Now by 80% annually (+2% versus +10%). While the rest of Wall
Street continued to tout stocks during the market declines of the last few
years, Zacks told investors which stocks to sell or avoid. 

Here is a synopsis of why L and SGMS have a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) and
should most likely be sold or avoided for the next one to three months. Note
that a #5 Strong Sell rating is applied to 5% of all the stocks in the Zacks
Rank universe: 

Loews Corp. (NYSE: L) reported its second consecutive quarterly loss, hurt by
poor performance of its natural gas reserves and wider investment losses at its
commercial insurance unit. The company`s second-quarter net loss of $958
million, or $2.20 a share, compares with a year-ago profit of $512 million, or
72 cents. All three major credit ratings agencies downgraded Loews` main ratings
after the results. 

Scientific Games Corp. (NASDAQ: SGMS) swung to a loss in the fourth quarter,
partly on large impairment charges and severance costs. The company`s quarterly
net loss of $65.8 million, or 71 cents a share, compares with a year-ago profit
of $16.4 million, or 17 cents. Excluding items, its earnings of $16.5 million,
or 18 cents a share, still fell short of analyst expectations. 

Here is a synopsis of why DIS and TAP have a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) and should
also most likely be sold or avoided for the next one to three months. Note that
a #4 Sell rating is applied to 15% of all the stocks ranked by Zacks; 

Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) blamed lower DVD sales and weak advertising sales at
its broadcast and cable television networks for a 32% slump in first-quarter
profit. Its quarterly net income of $845 million, or 45 cents a share, also
missed the consensus estimate of 52 cents. The average forecast on Disney`s
full-year profit has shed 5 cents a share to $1.78 in the last month. 

Molson Coors Brewing Co. (NYSE: TAP) reported fourth-quarter profit that missed
market expectations on slowing beer sales, higher packaging costs and a stronger
dollar. The company`s operating income fell 49% to $90.7 million, or 49 cents
per share. Before items, it earned 57 cents per share, while analysts were
looking for 71 cents. 

Truly taking advantage of the Zacks Rank requires the understanding of how it
works. The free special report; "Zacks Rank Guide: Harnessing the Power of
Earnings Estimate Revisions" is available to provide this insightful background.

About the Zacks Rank 

Since 1988, the Zacks Rank has proven that "Earnings estimate revisions are the
most powerful force impacting stock prices." Since inception in 1988, #1 Rank
Stocks have generated an average annual return of +28%. During the 2000-2002
bear market, Zacks #1 Rank stocks gained +43.8%, while the S 500 tumbled
-37.6%. Also note that the Zacks Rank system has just as many Strong Sell
recommendations (Rank #5) as Strong Buy recommendations (Rank #1). Since 1988,
Zacks Rank #5 stocks have underperformed the S 500 by 80% annually (+2% versus
+10%). Thus, the Zacks Rank system allows investors to truly manage portfolio
trading effectively.

&lt;p&gt;"The theme song continues; investors continue to favor specific commodity exposure rather than the broad asset class," the U.S. bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beta specialty funds are driving most of the inflows, largely into exchange-traded products," J.P. Morgan said in a note to investors seen by Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta relates to returns on investment that are according to market expectations. Exchange-traded products, or ETPs, include securities of commodities like gold and oil that trade on an exchange just like stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan said gold was the main beneficiary of this year's inflows into commodities, attracting $9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investments in oil and energy-linked funds came in next, with $3.4 billion, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agriculture-linked ETPs generated more modest positive inflows of $461 million year-to-date, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades, assigns Distressed Recovery ratings and revises Rating
Outlooks on the following classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp., series 2005-CIBC12 as follows: 

--$43.3 million class B to 'AA-' from 'AA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$19 million class C to 'A' from 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$32.5 million class D to 'A-' from 'A'; Outlook Stable; 

--$27.1 million class E to 'BBB' from 'A-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$24.4 million class F to 'BBB-' from 'BBB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$24.4 million class G to 'BB' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$29.8 million class H to 'B' from 'BB'; Outlook Negative; 

--$8.1 million class J to 'CCC/DR1' from 'BB-'; 

--$8.1 million class K to 'CC/DR3' from 'B'; 

--$8.1 million class L to 'C/DR6' from 'B-'; 

--$5.4 million class M to 'C/DR6' from 'CCC/DR1'; 

--$8.1 million class N to 'C/DR6' from 'CC/DR4'. 

In addition, Fitch affirms the following classes: 

--$152.4 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$163.6 million class A-3A1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$122.9 million class A-3A2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$200 million class A-3B at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$649.3 million class A-4 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$137.4 million class A-SB at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$216.7 million class A-M at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$162.5 million class A-J at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$50 million class UHP at 'B-'; Outlook Stable. 

The $5.4 million class P remains at 'C/DR6'. The $27.1 million class NR is not
rated by Fitch. Class A-1 has paid in full. 

The downgrades and assignment of the Distressed Recovery (DR) ratings reflect
the loss expectations on the seven specially serviced loans (3.2%). Four loans
(1.6%) have transferred to special servicing since Fitch's last rating action in
November 2008. The Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of any rating
changes over the next one to two years. 

Currently, Fitch has identified 24 Loans of Concern (9.5%), including the seven
specially serviced assets. Four additional loans (2.2%) have been identified as
Loans of Concern since Fitch's last rating action. 

The largest specially serviced asset (0.7%) is a 34,938 square foot (sf) retail
property in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. The asset has been real estate owned
(REO) since August 2008. The property has suffered from a deteriorating retail
environment stemming from a reduction in vacation travel. The most recent
appraisal value indicates significant losses upon disposition. 

The second largest specially serviced loan (0.7%) is secured by a 129,689 sf
office building located in Scottsdale, AZ. The loan transferred to special
servicing in November 2008 when its sole tenant notified the borrower that it
intended to vacate at the end of its lease in December 2008. The property is
currently 100% vacant. The special servicer is exploring workout options. 

The third largest specially serviced loan (0.4%) is collateralized by an 89,080
sf suburban office building in New London, CT that transferred in February 2007.
The servicer is working to stabilize the asset and is pursuing a judicial
foreclosure. 

The fourth largest specially serviced asset (0.4%) is an REO office property
located in Buffalo, NY, that transferred in September 2007 due to monetary
default. The special servicer is working to stabilize the asset before marketing
it for sale. 

Two loans, 4250 North Fairfax Drive (2.2%), and 450 Roxbury Drive (1.2%)
maintain investment grade shadow-ratings. Watertower Place at Celebration has
paid in full. 

The largest shadow rated loan, 4250 North Fairfax Drive, is an office property
located in Arlington, VA, that reported third quarter 2008 occupancy of 97%, in
line with issuance occupancy of 98.6% and an increase in NOI of 15% since
issuance. The second loan, 450 Roxbury Drive, is a medical office property in
Los Angeles, CA. Occupancy as of third quarter 2008 was 100%, an increase from
the issuance occupancy of 88.4%. 

None of the non-defeased loans in the pool are scheduled to mature in 2009 and
10 non-defeased loans (8.3%) are scheduled to mature in 2010. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) has clearly held up better than its peers
in the financial/banking sector, logging a year-to-date gain of 15%, compared to
the Select Sector SPDR Financial's (NYSE: XLF) decline of nearly 35% for the
same time frame. The company has also resisted taking part in this week's trend
of proclaiming profits for the start of 2009. Unlike Bank of America, Citigroup,
and JPMorgan Chase, mum's apparently the word at Goldman, so far. The only big
news for GS this week was yesterday's announcement that the company sold $5
billion in FDIC-guaranteed notes under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
in a 4-part sale. 

The lack of headline news hasn't slowed option bears, as more than 58,000
bearishly oriented put contracts have changed hands so far today. The activity
more than doubles the stock's average daily put volume, and has placed GS on our
Intraday Volume Explosion List. This negativity is old hat for the security,
though, as its Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 1.40 indicates
that puts easily outnumber calls among near-term options. This ratio also ranks
above 85% of all those taken in the past year.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), Sun Microsystems Inc (NASDAQ: JAVA), and Dendreon
Corp (NASDAQ: DNDN) saw call buying on Thursday. 

Microsoft tops the list with more than 43,000 calls bought. What makes the
action somewhat peculiar is this came amid the downbeat comments and lackluster
price action that Joe Hargett noted. We saw some optimism last week and I said
the following - "The stock is showing a short-term oversold condition but the
former support near 18 now looms as overhead resistance. I would expect any
bounce to be met with selling pressure there." A check of the current chart
shows the equity is in the process bouncing out of the oversold condition but
hasn't yet cleared resistance. Overall, the intermediate-term downtrend is still
place.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - John Chrin, a veteran
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) investment banker who worked on the
bank's takeover of Bear Stearns and Wells Fargo  Co's (WFC.N)
purchase of Wachovia Corp, is leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chrin, an investment banker for 21 years, is taking up a
position at his alma mater, Lehigh University in Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania, according to an internal bank memo from Tim Main,
the head of JPMorgan's financial institutions group. Reuters
obtained a copy of the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chrin will join the College of Business and Economics as
the global financial services executive-in-residence as well as
a fellow in the college's Financial Services Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chrin, a marathon runner, will leave JPMorgan in June after
spending 16 years there, Main wrote in the memo dated March
12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chrin was one of the key advisers involved in bank deals
that transformed the U.S. financial institutions landscape over
a matter of months last year as the credit crisis deepened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides the Bear Stearns and Wachovia takeovers, Chrin also
worked on JPMorgan's purchase of Washington Mutual Inc's
WAMUQ.PK banking operations and PNC Financial Services Group
Inc's (PNC.N) deal for National City Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chrin has strong ties to Lehigh. He met his wife at the
university and his son attends the school.

&lt;p&gt;  EAST FISHKILL, NY, Mar 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) has announced that it has reached a significant milestone
as the microprocessor supplier for Nintendo Co., Ltd., by completing the
shipment of 50 million processors for the Wii(TM) game system, which has
tremendous worldwide sales momentum.

    IBM first began supplying the processors that serve as the digital
heartbeat for Nintendo's Wii in 2006, as part of a multi-year, custom
microprocessor design and production agreement. The chips are manufactured
at IBM's advanced chip fabrication facility in East Fishkill, N.Y. IBM's
worldwide supply chain supported consistent, dependable module deliveries
and met strong consumer demand for the Wii console, including through

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Mar 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it is working with Brigham and Women's
Hospital of Boston on a research project to create an online "radiology
theatre" where teams of medical experts can simultaneously discuss and
review patients' medical test data using a Web browser.

    IBM has created a secure Web site that allows select medical experts at
Brigham and Women's Hospital to "make rounds" on a patient -- no matter
where the doctors are located. Data such as CT scans, MRIs, EKGs and other
medical tests can be posted on the Web site and analyzed by the team. Each
medical expert can talk and be seen through live streaming audio/video
through their standard web connection, and have the ability to whiteboard
over the Web page as well as input information to the patient's record.

    A group of doctors can log into a secure Web site at the same time to
review and analyze a patient's recent battery of tests. For instance, a
radiologist could use her mouse to circle an area on the CT scan of a lung
that needs a closer look. Then using the mouse she could zoom into that
scan to enlarge the view for all to see. An expert on lung cancer could
use his mouse to show how the spot had changed from the last scan. And
then, a pathologist could talk about patient treatments based on spots of
that size depending on age and prior health history, paging through
clinical data accessible on the site.

    The theatre allows all these experts to discuss, tag and share information
simultaneously, rather than paging through stacks of papers, calling
physicians to discuss scan results and then charting the results. This
collaborative consultation brings together the personal data, the experts
and the clinical data in one physical, visual theatre.

    According to Dr. Francine Jacobson, thoracic radiologist at Brigham and
Women's and assistant professor, Department of Radiology, Harvard Medical
School, "The medical community is at a crossroads. We realize the
effectiveness of individualized medicine but the increasing volume of data
stored in multiple electronic medical record systems makes it
progressively harder to correctly select the information required for
each patient care episode as well as share that information with other
physicians or care providers. We need a better way to record information,
organize it, access the stored patient data and then collaborate. We see
the Radiology Theatre as an electronic metaphor of how to deal with the
explosion of information."

    What also stands out in the Radiology Theatre is that the software only
requires a standard Web browser. There's nothing to download and it's
built with open Web standards. That means a doctor can be at any location
using a laptop, mobile device, or other desktop to collaborate with
colleagues and confer on results.

    IBM is demonstrating this technology at an IBM Research open house on the
Smarter Web in San Francisco this week.

    "Our focus in building the Radiology Theatre was to connect existing
visual and clinical information so experts at Brigham and Women's
Hospital could make faster, better decisions together," said Rod Smith,
vice president, IBM emerging technologies. "Using the browser as a
platform, IBM is exploring a new wave of smarter Web applications to
address the most pressing societal and business issues."

    Dr. Jacobson is currently using the Radiology Theatre to review together
the visual and non-visual data gathered in the "Risk Factors for Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)" project funded by the Flight
Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI). Grouped viewing of CT data,
pulmonary function tests, second hand smoke exposure, nutrition, and other
risk factors provides a novel method for searching for subtle correlations
between non-pathologic CT findings and risk factors for COPD.

    The Radiology Theatre has the potential for tapping experts from all over
the world to consult on cases. Multi-discipline and potentially
multi-institutional data could be brought together in the theatre. Using
telepresence provides 'just-like-being-there' live virtual meetings with
sight, sound and interactive Web experiences. The theatre has the
capability to be used as an educational archive of medical cases for
teaching conferences. The theatre can act as an electronic whiteboard of
information for experts to comment on or update.

    Blue Spruce: The Technical Foundation

    IBM researchers have combined different Web components -- data mashups,
high-definition video, audio and graphics -- all on the same browser page.
Called Blue Spruce, this technology allows multiple users to "cobrowse" or
interact with these components in real-time and see each others' changes.
All of the components are live and all participants can cause change that
will be propagated in a secure manner.

    Behind the scenes, the Radiology Theatre Web site is hosted by an IBM
secure software server, which provides the conference management,
application synchronization and subscription to push services. IBM built
the Radiology Theatre using the WebKit Open Source Browser Engine and
IBM's Blue Spruce prototype code. Right now the server runs on Linux or
the MacOS X operating systems. The browser can be Safari or Internet
Explorer. The application uses the following open standards: HTML,
JavaScript, CSS, Ajax, XMPP and H.264. Because the application follows
OpenAjax metadata specification, the Radiology Theatre can utilize any
Web widget.

    Security and healthcare privacy

    The Radiology Theatre was designed to be utilized in a secure environment.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM) as Bull of the Day and
General Motors Corporation (NYSE: GM) as Bear of the Day. In addition, the
analysts at Zacks Equity Research discuss the latest on Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN),
Cost Plus (Nasdaq: CPWM) and BRE Properties, Inc. (NYSE: BRE). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

As a result of its large non-US revenue base, IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM) has
been better insulated from recent weakness in the U.S. economy than many of its
peers. 

IBM`s Q408 results indicate its strong position in emerging markets, which
should continue to help drive growth. Moreover, the company has focused on
driving its bottom line through cost-cutting efforts. 

The company`s long term prospects look brighter as it maintains a strong
position in the software and services market. We maintain our Buy rating on IBM
shares and raise our target price to $120.00. 

Bear of the Day

General Motors Corporation (NYSE: GM) is one of the largest automobile
manufacturers in the world. We believe that the company should file for
bankruptcy to rid itself of Unions and pension &amp; health care issues, besides
separating dealerships from the rest of the company. 

Any government aid should force the company to only make 35MPG+ vehicles.
Management should be purged and outsiders brought in. Tariffs and quotas should
be implemented for imported vehicles from overseas. Consumers should be allowed
to deduct their automotive interest. 

Lastly, global alliances should be forged among producers in North America,
Europe and Asia. From an equity holder`s perspective, we rate the shares a Sell
with a six-month target price of $0.00. 

Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

The Geography of the Recession

What do Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming have in
common? Low population densities and agricultural-based economies to be sure --
but what else? 

How about California, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode
Island and South Carolina? Not much at first blush. 

The answers are, the first group has unemployment rates under 5%, while the
second group has unemployment rates above 9%. However, there are very real
regional differences in the impact so far. Perhaps noteworthy by their absence
from the list of the worst unemployment rates are two of the "rust belt" states,
Ohio and Pennsylvania. 

I`m not sure there are any publicly traded stocks that have consumer demand in
the Dakotas as being a significant driver for their sales. However, this does
give you a point of reference of places to avoid. For example, Retailers with a
heavy exposure to California such as Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) and Cost Plus
(Nasdaq: CPWM) would seem particularly vulnerable. The same is true of Real
Estate Companies with heavy exposure to California like BRE Properties, Inc.
(NYSE: BRE).

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
A new global survey of 950 women living with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in
nine countries (the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Belgium, Poland, the United
States, Argentina, Egypt and Mexico) found that despite the negative impact of
their disease, a majority still enjoy life and desire public attention that
recognizes their unique experiences. Based on the survey results, the
international committee of experts overseeing the survey advocate tailored
education programs to raise awareness of the needs of women with MBC. Results
from this survey, which was conducted by Harris Interactive&#174; and sponsored by
Pfizer Oncology, were presented today at the 11th International Conference on
Primary Therapy of Early Breast Cancer in St. Gallen, Switzerland. 

Among the reported findings from the BRIDGE Survey (Bridging Gaps, Expanding
Outreach - Metastatic Breast Cancer Patient Survey), one in two women (53
percent) believe MBC receives too little public attention, and more than two in
five women (44 percent) report being afraid to talk openly about their
experiences. Nearly seven in 10 women (67 percent) desire increased public
awareness of MBC, such as increased media attention of people living with MBC
(53 percent) and recognition of public figures with MBC (49 percent). 

"In many countries, the public face of breast cancer has largely been focused on
early stage disease, which has led to a deficiency of resources and attention
for those who develop metastatic breast cancer," said Professor Lesley
Fallowfield, director, Cancer Research UK Psychosocial Oncology Group,
University of Sussex, UK, and BRIDGE steering committee member. "BRIDGE sheds
light on the dire need for more public dialogue about metastatic breast cancer
in an effort to make women feel more included among the broader breast cancer
community." 

There are an estimated 1.3 million new cases of breast cancer each year. Breast
cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide, with an
estimated 465,000 annual deaths. In developed countries, nearly 30 percent of
women with early stage breast cancer will eventually develop metastatic (Stage
IV) breast cancer - cancer that has spread beyond the breast to other parts of
the body, including the bones, lungs, liver and brain. In developing countries,
the majority of women with breast cancer are diagnosed with advanced stage or
metastatic disease. Unlike early stage breast cancer, there are no curative
therapies for MBC and patients undergo continuous treatment to control the
spread of their disease and symptoms. 

Notably, while the majority (67 percent) of survey respondents recognize that
MBC has negatively impacted most parts of their lives, most (66 percent) also
say they are still able to enjoy life and 50 percent consider themselves to be a
cancer "survivor". 

"The BRIDGE survey emphasizes the strength of the human spirit. With optimal
support and resources, many women are able to live their lives well with
metastatic disease for longer periods of time," said Musa Mayer, M.S., M.F.A.,
author, patient advocate and founder of AdvancedBC.org, and BRIDGE survey
steering committee member. "This survey is an important first step in
identifying the needs of this neglected patient population. It provides impetus
for stakeholders worldwide to ensure that these women receive the best support
and care." 

The survey also indicated the important role information plays in helping women
cope with MBC, with updates on new research and treatment options the most
desired. However, while 75 percent of respondents proactively seek out
information on their own to learn about MBC, over two in five women (45 percent)
encounter difficulties locating information and one in two (51 percent) report
that available information does not meet their needs. 

"Despite its prevalence, women with metastatic breast cancer often experience
feelings of isolation, as available information and attention from society range
from being scant to sufficient, depending on country and cultural
characteristics," said Musa Mayer. 

Members of the BRIDGE steering committee recommend that the survey results be
used to improve collaboration among MBC stakeholders and enhance breast cancer
initiatives worldwide, including but not limited to the creation of up-to-date
and easily accessible information on MBC, and the development of education
programs that promote public awareness of the disease. As the survey revealed
women`s experiences with MBC vary by country, efforts to help women must be
tailored to be culturally relevant where appropriate. 

About the BRIDGE Survey

The BRIDGE Survey is a new, wide-reaching global assessment of the needs,
experiences and attitudes of women living with MBC in multiple countries. This
survey was conducted by Harris Interactive&#174; on behalf of Pfizer Oncology and led
by an international steering committee comprised of seven breast cancer thought
leaders and advocates dedicated to addressing the unmet needs of the MBC
community. The survey was conducted between September 16, 2008 and February 18,
2009 among 950 women with MBC age 18 and over in the United States, Europe,
Latin America and Africa. The interviews were conducted using a combination of
telephone, mail or in-person methods. More information on the methodology is
available. For additional information about the BRIDGE Survey, please visit

development and contextualization of the survey, include:

States; 
* Lesley Fallowfield, Bsc., DPhil., FMedSci., director, Cancer Research U.K.,

Pfizer Oncology is committed to helping fulfill unmet educational and support
needs for MBC patients worldwide and has embarked on a number of initiatives,
including the sponsorship of an MBC Advocacy Working Group, a cooperative of
patient advocates from seven countries, which recently issued a Consensus Report
urging breast cancer stakeholders to improve collaboration and implement
strategies to address unmet needs of women with MBC. This report was published
in the December 2008 issue of the journal, Community Oncology. 

About Metastatic Breast Cancer

Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is the most advanced stage of breast cancer
(Stage IV) and occurs when cancer has spread beyond the breast to distant parts
of the body. Compared to early stage breast cancer, the prognosis for Stage IV
breast cancer is poor, with the majority of breast cancer-related deaths
resulting from complications of metastatic disease. While the life expectancy
for patients with MBC is approximately two to three years, length of survival
has continually increased since the 1990s due to advancements in diagnosis and
treatment. Because metastatic breast cancer remains essentially incurable,
current goals of therapy are focused on relieving symptoms, delaying tumor
progression, improving quality of life, and prolonging survival.

&lt;p&gt;Tirade Marks End of Difficult Week of Setbacks for Chevron In $27 Billion Case
COCA, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
After a frustrating week of setbacks in an environmental trial in Ecuador`s
rainforest, two Chevron lawyers exploded in anger at representatives of the
victims after a technical expert demonstrated for the third time in a week that
oil was visible at a well site that the company claimed to have "remediated" a
decade ago, said lawyers for the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Chevron. 

Chevron lead lawyer Adolfo Callejas, who was a lawyer for Texaco in Ecuador over
the three decades that the company admitted to dumping billions of gallons of
toxic waste into the country`s Amazon basin, on Thursday unleashed a tirade of
personal insults at plaintiff`s lawyers Pablo Fajardo and Julio Prieto during a
judicial inspection at a site called Auca Sur, deep in the Amazon jungle, said
Fajardo and Prieto. 

Callejas repeatedly called Fajardo and Prieto "gallinas" (which translates
literally as "hens") - a highly insulting and emasculating term in Ecuador
culture. He also likened their legal arguments to the cackling sounds hens make,
said Fajardo and Prieto. 

They also said, another Chevron lawyer, Alberto Racines, seemed to threaten
Prieto by asking that they settle their differences in a rumble after the Auca
Sur court hearing. Prieto, 27, is 5`8" and 150 pounds while Racines, in his late
40s, is a large and strongly-built man well over six feet. 

"Callejas is frustrated because his life`s work as a lawyer for Texaco in
Ecuador is going up in flames as the company`s defense falls apart," said
Prieto. "Racines has threatened me on multiple occasions during the trial." 

The tirade and apparent threat marked the end of a difficult week for Chevron in
the long-running trial, where a final decision on a $27 billion damages claim is
expected later this year. The company has told U.S. regulators that it expects
"a significant adverse judgment" in the case while telling Ecuador`s indigenous
leaders to expect a "lifetime of litigation" if they persist in pressing their
claims. 

Both Fajardo, 37, and Prieto are Ecuadorian lawyers who have won international
renown for their long battle to hold Chevron accountable for what experts
believe is the worst oil-related disaster on the planet. Texaco admitted to
dumping more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways, and
abandoning hundreds of waste pits gouged out of the jungle floor, when it
operated an oil concession in Ecuador from 1964 to 1990. 

Chevron bought Texaco in 2001 and will bear any liability in the case, where
soil and water damage cover an area roughly the size of Rhode Island. Callejas,
who hails from a prominent Ecuador family that traces its lineage to the Spanish
conquest, has served as Chevron`s lead counsel in the trial since it began in
2003. 

For several months, the plaintiffs have accused Chevron of violating various
court edicts as part of a strategy to delay the trial indefinitely. Early in the
week, Callejas was openly rebuked by the trial judge for seeking a last-minute
postponement of a series of judicial inspections that for months Chevron had
insisted take place, even though the evidentiary phase of the trial was all but
completed last year. 

As the four inspections initially requested and then opposed by Chevron went
forward last week, Callejas became increasingly embarrassed with the results. On
Tuesday, at two separate Chevron well sites deep in the rainforest that the
company claimed to have remediated, oil was clearly visible in the soil --
setting the stage for the tirade on Thursday. 

At the Aucua Sur site, the court-appointed technical expert, Marcelo Munoz, for
the third time in a week lifted soil samples that contained shiny, visible oil
sludge. The sight was almost too much to bear for Callejas, who lashed out at
Fajardo and Prieto with his "hen" comment. 

After trial judge Juan Nunez cautioned Callejas to treat his younger adversaries
with respect, he seemed to calm down. But tempers flared yet again when Racines
told Prieto that "this is personal and we will see later how it ends." 

The "remediation" of the waste pits, the basis of Chevron`s defense at trial,
has now become almost completely discredited in the eyes of scientists and
independent court experts. Even before the inspections this week, 45 out of 54
waste pits purportedly "remediated" by Texaco and examined in the trial
contained extensive levels of toxins, according to the independent court expert
who worked with a team of 14 scientists to review the more than 62,000 chemical
sampling results submitted as evidence. 

Several of the "remediated" sites have levels of toxins thousands of times
higher than permissible norms in the U.S. and Ecuador, according to the court
expert. Texaco claimed it had spent $40 million on the remediation, a paltry
amount compared to the cost of a comprehensive clean-up, according to the court
expert. 

Callejas angered Amazonian residents in an earlier phase of the trial when he
insisted that oil does not cause cancer, contradicting decades of scientific
research. He also said candy bar wrappers contain more lead than oil and that
the Amazon rainforest was "an industrial production" zone rather than a delicate
ecosystem. 

The trial in Ecuador began in 2003 after a U.S. federal judge in New York
granted a request from Chevron that the case be transferred there because the
courts there were a more adequate forum. When evidence in the Ecuador trial
started to point to Chevron`s culpability, the company began to attack the very
courts that it previously praised as fair. 

If accepted, the $27 billion damages award could be the largest ever for an
environmental case.

&lt;p&gt;March 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is
asking investors in its $15 billion private equity fund for
approval to shift much of its remaining uninvested money into
distressed debt, the Financial Times reported on its website

we believe the ability to achieve private equity-like returns
at an even more senior position in the capital structure
provides a significant opportunity for the fund," the paper
cited the bank as telling investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of the $9 billion remaining in the fund, Goldman plans to
allocate $4.5 billion to stressed and distressed investments
and increase open market purchases of both debt and equity
securities from 10 to 25 percent of total commitments, the
paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another $1.5 billion will go to firms that Goldman already
owns in part to help them buy their own debt, the paper said,
adding that only $3 billion will go to buy-outs, originally the
only mission of the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has invested $2 billion in the fund, including an
additional $500 million injected recently, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent months, many private equity firms have quietly
shifted their focus to buying debt at a discount as they are
unable to pay for acquisitions with cheap flexible debt as they
could during the boom years, according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman could not be immediately reached for comment by
Reuters.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/HONG KONG, March 17 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co.

to reach initial bullish predictions with the key Chinese tourist
market now bogged down by a worldwide credit crunch and a
decelerating economy that is discouraging travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said it would fire about 30 Hong Kong-based employees
dubbed "Imagineers" that had helped conceptualise and plan the
expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some jobs might also go at Disney's home-turf of Burbank,
California, as a result of the work stoppage, a source familiar
with the situation told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
Disney had already been funding creative efforts -- designing and

Imagineers who have been working on the design of Hong Kong
Disneyland's expansion will not be conducive to the discussions
and are puzzled by the company's decision," a spokesperson for
the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Opened in 2005, Hong Kong Disneyland has been criticised for
being far too small to attract repeat visitors despite its
proximity to mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Despite this setback, The Walt Disney Company remains
confident and committed to the long-term success of Hong Kong
Disneyland," Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An expansion could cost as much as HK$3 billion ($387

[ID:nSHA340943].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong residents and lawmakers, for their part, have
queried the financial viability of pumping more public money into
the struggling park, on top of the hundreds of millions of
dollars already loaned to the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has borrowed more than $1 billion for the project,
including HK$6.1 billion it owed the city's government, due to be

&lt;p&gt;Die Coca-Cola Company und Atlantic Records bringen einige der angesagtesten
Namen der Musikbranche zusammen, um den Soundtrack zu &#8222;Happiness Factory 3"
aufzunehmen
ATLANTA, USA--(Business Wire)--
Die Coca-Cola Company und Atlantic Records der Warner Music Group haben sich
zusammengetan, um einen neuen Song unter Mitwirkung der angesagtesten Acts der
Rock-, Pop- und Hip-Hop-Szene aufzunehmen und zu ver&#246;ffentlichen. 

Der Titel kommt heute heraus, begleitet den dritten Werbespot von Coca-Cola aus
der Happiness-Factory-Reihe und beinhaltet die aus f&#252;nf Noten bestehende
Melodie, die durch die Werbung bekannt wurde. Unter dem Titel &#8222;Open Happiness"
vereint die Single die K&#252;nstler Cee-Lo Green, Patrick Stump von Fall Out Boy,
Brendon Urie von Panic at the Disco, Travis McCoy von den Gym Class Heroes sowie
die gefeierte, Grammy-nominierte S&#228;ngerin Janelle Monae. Der Song spiegelt den
Geist von positivem Denken, Optimismus und Spa&#223; wider, der mit der weltweit
einheitlichen Marketingkampagne &#8222;Open Happiness" f&#252;r die Marke Coca-Cola
ausgedr&#252;ckt wird. 

Zwei Starproduzenten, Butch Walker (der den Titel zusammen mit Cee-Lo Green
geschrieben hat) und Polow Da Don, haben das musikalische Gemeinschaftsprojekt
produziert. Die preisgekr&#246;nten Produzenten haben es sich zum Ziel gesetzt, die
Bereiche des Rock und Hip-Hop zu mischen und so einen topaktuellen Sound zu
erschaffen, der die Open-Happiness-Kampagne zum Leben erweckt. 

Die Spitzenproduzenten zeichnen f&#252;r einige der beliebtesten Musiktitel der
letzten Jahre verantwortlich, und haben mit K&#252;nstlern wie Usher, Kelis, Pink,
Fergie, den Pussycat Dolls, Avril Lavigne und Katy Perry gearbeitet. 

&#8222;Das Hinzuf&#252;gen eines musikalischen Bereiches zu unserem beliebten
Happiness-Factory-Franchise ist die nat&#252;rliche Weiterentwicklung bei der
Entstehung eines wahrlich medien&#252;bergreifenden Gutes", sagte Umut Ozaydinli, der
weltweit zust&#228;ndige Leiter des Musikmarketings der Coca-Cola Company. &#8222;Die
Arbeit mit etablierten K&#252;nstlern wie Cee-Lo Green und Patrick Stump von Fall Out
Boy sowie aufstrebenden K&#252;nstlern wie Janelle Monae f&#252;hrt zu einer wahrlich
einzigartigen Mischung von Musikgenres. In unserer neuen Kampagne geht es darum,
Menschen dazu aufzufordern, ein wenig Gl&#252;ck zu teilen und die einfachen Freuden
des Lebens zu genie&#223;en. Wir glauben, dass wir durch die Verwendung von Musik in
der Lage sind, diese Botschaft zu unterstreichen und es den Menschen zu
erleichtern miteinander Kontakt aufzunehmen und Spa&#223; mit der Kampagne zu haben."


&#8222;Coca-Cola ist weltweit eine Marke mit riesigem Kultcharakter und mit einer
reichen Geschichte von Qualit&#228;t und Integrit&#228;t", sagte Camille Hackney, Senior
Vice President des Bereichs Brand Partnership and Commercial Licensing von
Atlantic Records. &#8222;Bei Atlantic streben wir danach, K&#252;nstlerkarrieren zu
schaffen, deren Musik weltweite Resonanz findet. Die Paarung der K&#252;nstler bei
diesem Song f&#252;r Coca-Cola ist eine perfekte Kombination, und wir glauben, dass
er weltweit extrem erfolgreich sein wird." 

Musik wird ein zentraler Teil der Open-Happiness-Kampagne sein. Der Titel wird
als Soundtrack zum neuen TV-Werbespot der Happiness-Factory-Reihe erscheinen und
dar&#252;ber hinaus als Werbemittel au&#223;erhalb der traditionellen Ma&#223;nahmen verwendet.
Zudem wird ein Teil der Single-Verk&#228;ufe &#252;ber die &#8222;Live Positively"-Plattform des
Unternehmens f&#252;r gemeinn&#252;tzige Zwecke gespendet. 

Travis McCoy von den Gym Class Heroes f&#252;gte hinzu: &#8222;Ich glaube, es ist ein
wirklich guter Schachzug von Coke, sowohl zu aufstrebenden als auch zu
etablierten K&#252;nstlern zu greifen - damit geht jeder als Gewinner aus dem Projekt
hervor. Wir als K&#252;nstler k&#246;nnen mit Leuten zusammenarbeiten, zu denen wir
aufblicken, und Coca-Cola bekommt einen frischen, neuen Song, von dem ich
glaube, dass er beim Publikum wirklich gut ankommen wird." 

Cee-Lo Green f&#252;gte hinzu: &#8222;Ich glaube, was die Idee zun&#228;chst interessant
gestaltete, war das Interesse von Coca-Cola an mir - das war reizvoll. Der
Musikmarkt kann sehr unbest&#228;ndig und nachtragend sein, und wenn man
Langlebigkeit will, wenn man zur Legende werden will, wen k&#246;nnte man dann besser
um Rat fragen, als Coca-Cola?" 

Die Ver&#246;ffentlichung der Single wird von einer umfangreichen weltweiten
Offensive begleitet. Dazu geh&#246;ren folgende Aktionen:

* Die Weltpremiere des Titels auf MySpace verschafft den Konsumenten auf der
ganzen Welt ab 16. M&#228;rz unter www.myspace.com/openhappiness erstmals Zugang zu
diesem einzigartigen Gemeinschaftsprojekt. 
* Der Titel wird bei iTunes als exklusives Paket zusammen mit einem
Making-of-Video erh&#228;ltlich sein. 
* Auf 200 Millionen Coca-Cola-Packungen alleine in Gro&#223;britannien und Frankreich
wird die Single &#8222;Open Happiness" genannt werden. 
* Ein Musikvideo des Titels mit den K&#252;nstlern unter der Regie des preisgekr&#246;nten
Regisseurs Alan Ferguson wird im Mai weltweit seine Premiere feiern. 
* Der Titel wird in die Marketingbem&#252;hungen der Marke Coca-Cola im Radio und
online eingebunden werden, womit auch die 3,2 Millionen Coke-Fans bei Facebook
angesprochen werden. 
* Die weltber&#252;hmten Coca-Cola-Zeichen am Piccadilly Circus in London und am
Times Square in New York werden f&#252;r die Werbung f&#252;r die Single &#8222;Open Happiness"
genutzt.

&#8222;Open Happiness" baut auf die preisgekr&#246;nte Kampagne &#8222;Coke Side of Life" auf und
dient als Plattform f&#252;r ein weltweit &#252;bergreifendes Marketing der Marke
Coca-Cola. Die Kampagne wurde mit Printanzeigen, Plakaten und TV-Werbung im
Januar zuerst in den USA gestartet. Die absolut durchg&#228;ngige Kampagne -
einschlie&#223;lich neuer Verkaufsstellen, Werbeaktionen, Plakaten und Printanzeigen,
digitaler bzw. Musikkomponenten und mehr - wird im ersten Halbjahr 2009 die
M&#228;rkte auf der ganzen Welt erreichen.

Dos productores superestrellas, Butch Walker (que escribi&#243; el tema junto con
Cee-Lo Green) y Polow Da Don produjeron la colaboraci&#243;n musical. Estos
productores premiados han comenzado a mezclar sus mundos de rock y hip-hop y a

felicidad es una evoluci&#243;n natural para realmente convertirla en una propiedad
integral en los medios", afirm&#243; Umut Ozaydinli, gerente mundial de marketing
musical de The Coca-Cola Company. "Trabajar con artistas de renombre, como
Cee-Lo Green y Patrick Stump de Fall Out Boy, y con artistas con mucho futuro,
como Janelle Monae, realmente re&#250;ne una combinaci&#243;n &#250;nica de g&#233;neros musicales.
Nuestra nueva campa&#241;a habla de invitar a las personas a compartir un poco de
felicidad y a disfrutar los placeres simples de la vida. Creemos que, a trav&#233;s
de la utilizaci&#243;n de la m&#250;sica, podemos realzar este mensaje y ayudar a las
personas a conectarse y a divertirse con la campa&#241;a".

Travis McCoy, de Gym Class Heroes, coment&#243;: "Pienso que el hecho de que
Coca-Cola extienda una mano a los artistas con futuro y reconocidos es una
decisi&#243;n realmente buena: todos resultan ganadores. Nosotros, como artistas,
tenemos la oportunidad de colaborar con personas que admiramos, y Coca-Cola
consigue una canci&#243;n fresca y nueva que creo que las personas van a estar
realmente dispuestas a escuchar". 

Cee-Lo Green agreg&#243;: "Supongo que lo que fue interesante acerca de la idea al
comienzo fue el inter&#233;s de Coca-Cola en m&#237;: eso fue tentador. El mercado de la
m&#250;sica puede ser muy inconstante e implacable y si quiere una vida larga y una
leyenda, &#191;qui&#233;n mejor para pedirle un consejo que Coca-Cola?".

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) must allow shareholders to vote on measures that would tie executive bonuses to the bank's long-term stock performance, U.S. regulators have ruled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AFL-CIO Reserve Fund, a union investment fund, had sought a shareholder vote to add the measures to JPMorgan's bylaws. The bank tried to prevent a vote from happening, citing logistical difficulties the move would create for shares already issued, but the SEC said in a letter dated March 9 that the vote should go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund is proposing that the bank's most senior executives keep 75 percent of their shares for two years after leaving the company. The fund is also proposing that JPMorgan's board of directors should prohibit these executives from hedging their shares to offset losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had wanted to reject the proposal in part because it may require the bank to impose restrictions on transferring shares already issued and because it has already made changes to executive bonuses, the bank said in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the SEC said the fund's proposal could be rewritten to make it clear it applies to compensation paid in the future, and if it is rewritten it cannot be excluded from proxy materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AFL-CIO fund is an investment fund for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. It has 2,515 shares in JPMorgan, according to a letter it sent to the bank in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payouts for executives have come under scrutiny as financial stocks have slumped since the start of the credit crunch more than 18 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has already said he will not receive a bonus for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in JPMorgan have fallen almost 25 percent since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the
world's largest drugmaker, set price guidance for its five-part
debt sale on Monday, said IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The issue is expected to launch and sell on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale will likely consist of two-year floating-rate
notes with price guidance of about 200 basis points more than
the three-month London interbank offered rate, and three-year
notes with price guidance set at about 310 basis points more
than comparable U.S. Treasuries, said IFR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal will also include a six-year tranche with guidance
set in the area of 345 basis points over Treasuries, 10-year
notes expected to price in the area of 330 basis points over
Treasuries, and 30-year bonds with guidance set at about 350
basis points more than Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP
Morgan are the joint lead managers of the deal. Pfizer is
raising money to help fund its purchase of Wyeth WYE.N.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and OAKLAND, CA, Mar 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Kaiser Permanente today announced they have entered
into a strategic agreement designed to ensure the continued leadership of
Kaiser Permanente's information technology (IT) capabilities, which
support the high-quality heath care delivered to the organization's 8.6
million members nationwide. The seven-year agreement was signed on March
13, 2009.

    As part of the agreement, IBM will leverage its global technology
capabilities to manage Kaiser Permanente's data center operations,
including computer systems, storage systems and associated software.
Kaiser Permanente will continue to manage applications, including the
organization's industry-leading electronic health record, Kaiser
Permanente HealthConnect(TM).

    "Kaiser Permanente has led the health care industry in developing and
using groundbreaking technology that connects the patient and physician
in ways that enhance the quality of care and make health care more
efficient," said Phil Fasano, chief information officer for Kaiser
Permanente. "This agreement, grown out of our long-standing strategic
relationship with IBM, will allow us to build on our leadership in health
care technology, staying focused on the safety, satisfaction and privacy
of our members and patients and ensuring that our physicians and
clinicians continue to deliver real-time, personalized health care."

    "IBM sees information-based medicine helping propel health care from its
currently unconnected local and regional sectors into a borderless
industry that spans the globe," said Chris Nicoletti, IBM vice president,
Healthcare and Life Sciences Industry. "IBM is pleased to work closely
with Kaiser Permanente's industry-leading IT organization in efforts to
make health care more interconnected, more instrumented and more
intelligent. We are delighted to expand our long standing relationship by
providing IT services that enable real-time health care."

    Each day, 14,000 physicians and thousands of other caregivers access KP
HealthConnect and related IT systems to support care and service delivery.
Additionally, 2.7 million members use My Health Manager on kp.org to
access their online personal health record and other services, including
secure email and prescription refills. The IBM strategic agreement will
help ensure that these systems are available for use when and wherever
they are needed.

    As a result of the agreement, about 700 positions in Kaiser Permanente's
data center operations will be eliminated. Some of the affected employees
will be eligible for employment with IBM.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Mar 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
A new independent report out of technology industry analyst firm
Forrester Research, Inc., assigns the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Web site
(www.ibm.com) for small- and mid-size businesses four and a half out of
five stars.

    In the February 23 report, ibm.com tied for the highest rating received
among 30 technology companies reviewed.

    Forrester examined three sites including IBM's mid-size business portal
(http://www-304.ibm.com/jct03004c/businesscenter/smb/us/en/), the
small-business portal
(http://www-304.ibm.com/jct03004c/businesscenter/smb/us/en/smallbusiness)
and the new IBM Smart Market site (http://www.ibm.com/smartmarket/us/en/),
which is organized by solution area.

    "IBM remains deeply committed to the SMB space and making it easier for
our customers to find and use information via the Web," said Leslie
Reiser, manager of Interactive Marketing for IBM's General Business
group. "In addition to our long standing mid-sized business and small
business portals, the new Smart Market provides an easy way for small-
and mid-size organizations to find, buy and manage all of the
applications they need to run a smarter business."

    The Forrester report, compiled by Tim Harmon, Peter Burris and Zachary
Reiss-Davis, is titled, "A New SMB Market Phoenix Is Rising." It includes
evaluations of Web sites based on 12 criteria, including content,
navigation, links, and usability.

    The report states that "relative to large enterprises, smaller businesses
shed fewer jobs in a recession and start hiring earlier as recessions
abate." It also found that the small businesses that help catalyze the
recovery this time around will be started by tech-savvy professionals who
start their businesses with technology investments and a Millennial
workforce that has grown up on mobile phones and social networks.

    Based on this, the report concludes that "Tech vendors that want to win in
the new SMB space must provide sites with dedicated SMB solution sections
-- or, better still, micro sites specific to the SMB audience."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - A floating rate note has
been added to a bond sale by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron says 11,500 barrels per day of oil shut in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Oil leakage in four communities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds Chevron statement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Austin Ekeinde&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, March 16 (Reuters) - An attack by
suspected Nigerian militants on a Chevron (CVX.N) oil pipeline
in the Niger Delta on Friday shut down around 11,500 barrels per
day of output, the U.S. energy firm said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) said the attack on its 16-inch
Makaraba-Utonana pipeline at around 0115 (0015 GMT) on Friday
had forced it to shut in 11,500 bpd from its Makaraba Platform
in Delta state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colonel Rabe Abubakar, spokesman for the military taskforce
in the western Niger Delta, said the attack had resulted in
leakage into four communities in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company is currently assessing the situation and the
incident has been reported to relevant government agencies,"
CNL, which operates a joint venture with Nigerian state oil firm
NNPC, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Abubakar said the attackers were believed to have defected
from the camp of Government Tompolo, a militant leader based in
Delta state who had suspended attacks on oil sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The group had threatened to continue with their attacks on
installations and facilities unless they receive gratification
from the multinationals," Abubakar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This threat will not be allowed to continue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attacks on pipelines and industry installations are common
in the Niger Delta, home to Africa's biggest oil and gas
industry. The unrest has shut down more than a fifth of Nigerian
oil output over the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some attacks are carried out by militants who say they are
fighting for a fairer share of the natural wealth, others by
criminal gangs engaged in a multi-million-dollar trade in stolen
oil. The crude is transported on barges to tankers waiting off
Nigeria's coast before being mixed in with legitimate cargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Security experts say groups of local community youths,
frustrated by poverty and a lack of job opportunities, also
sabotage pipelines in the hope of winning repair contracts.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company`s U.S. operations have earned the Gas Processors
Association (GPA) 2009 Company Safety Award and the President`s Award for Safety
Improvement. Some 500 employees at the company`s gas processing facilities
received the honors for outstanding safety performance during more than a
million work hours. 

Gas Processors Association President Bob Dunn presented the awards at the 88th
annual GPA Convention in San Antonio, Texas. "These safety awards are among the
most important recognition we provide at this convention each year, because
safety is a primary focus within all of our member companies," said Dunn,
announcing the recipients. "The gas processing industry is one of the safest in
the world." 

The President`s Safety Award recognizes continuous improvement in safety
performance measured by a reduction of 25 percent or more in recordable incident
rates over the past three years. 

This marks the third time in four years that ExxonMobil`s U.S. Production
organization has earned the Company Safety Award from GPA. 

"The company has always set very high standards for safety performance," said
Randy Cleveland, ExxonMobil U.S. Production Manager. "The achievement by our
employees at gas processing facilities demonstrates their commitment to
excellence in pursuing our vision that nobody gets hurt." 

ExxonMobil is one of the largest oil and gas producers and reserves holders in
the United States. The U.S. portfolio is geographically diverse with significant
positions in all major producing regions, including the Gulf Coast and the Gulf
of Mexico, the Mid-Continent and Rockies, onshore and offshore California, and
Alaska.

&lt;p&gt;March 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its rating on
Goodrich Corp GR.N and downgraded Spirit Aerosystems Inc
(SPR.N), saying investors should go long on aerospace stocks
with significant aftermarket exposure and short those with
original equipment (OE) exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised Goodrich to "buy" from "neutral" and
cut Spirit to "sell" from "neutral," while reiterating its
"sell" on plane maker Boeing Co (BA.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goodrich has the most favorable mix of business with 36
percent of revenue from aftermarket, while Spirit gets 95
percent of its revenue from OE, analyst Noah Poponak said in a
note to clients dated March 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aftermarket revenue is driven by traffic growth, which
should grow in 2010 and 2011, while OE revenue is driven by
Boeing and EADS's EAD.PA Airbus production, Poponak added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst also cut his delivery estimates for Boeing by
10 percent for 2010 and 2011, given the bleak economic outlook,
and to better align his forecast for margin and revenue
declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our historical analysis shows that aftermarket-exposed
companies have outperformed in this part of the cycle," he
noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goodrich could be potentially attractive to other larger
aerospace companies, Poponak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst expects earnings to trough in 2010 for Goodrich
, and 2011 for Spirit and Boeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boeing shares rose 2 percent to $33.96, while Spirit shares
fell 7 percent to $9.31. Goodrich shares rose 5 percent in
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Combined Companies Have Staff and East/West Coast Operations Centers to Support
Largest Customers; Unveil New Managed Active Directory Service


SEATTLE &amp; CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Azaleos&#174; Corporation, the managed Microsoft Exchange services company, and M3
Technology Group (M3TG) today announced they have merged their businesses to
become the market`s leading provider of remotely managed Microsoft Exchange and
related services. The combined companies, which will operate under the Azaleos
brand, now have the technical support resources as well as East and West coast
network operations centers necessary to support even the largest organizations.
The new company`s customers include Chiquita, Alcon, Wendy`s/Arby`s, and
Extended Stay. Azaleos also announced the immediate availability of ADXchange, a
new monitoring and management service for Active Directory. 

Leading research firms estimate the worldwide remote infrastructure services
market at $20 billion at the close of 2008, and forecast it could grow to
approximately $40 billion by the end of 2012. Additionally, they estimate that
by 2012, 70% of all North American companies will have remote infrastructure
service contracts. 

The new company, which will be headed by the current Azaleos management team and
retain most of the service, support, and professional services employees from
both organizations, has the highest concentration of Exchange and Unified
Communications expertise outside of Microsoft. Customers will now be supported
by two network operations centers in the United States, one in Seattle and one
in Charlotte. The combined companies will also continue to work with their
existing reseller partners led by IBM Professional Services. 

"The merger of Azaleos and M3 Technology Group is a seamless technology and
business marriage for both companies that establishes us as the clear market
leader in the managed Exchange market," said Phil Van Etten, Chief Executive
Officer of Azaleos. "Together we have the size, scale, and bi-coastal operations
to service organizations from the mid-market all the way up to the largest
enterprises." 

"As soon as we began our initial business conversations, we knew this was a
natural fit for both companies," said Tony Prince, CEO and president of M3
Technology Group. "The combined companies have the resources, expertise, and
skilled personnel to capitalize on the very large market opportunity that exists
for an on-premise and remotely managed alternative to hosted Exchange e-mail
services." 

ADXchange - Remotely Managed Active Directory

Companies depend on Active Directory (AD) as their primary tool to manage the
identities and relationships that make up network environments. Its proper
functioning is critical to the network and the many applications, such as
Exchange, relying on it. The first immediate by-product of the Azaleos and M3TG
merger is a new remotely managed service for on-premise Active Directory called
ADXchange. AD administration, including directory consolidation, identity
management and DNS configuration, is a manual, time consuming, and ongoing
process. With ADXchange, an organization`s Active Directory infrastructure is
managed remotely by experts in the Azaleos network operations center. To prevent
downtime and free up internal IT resources for line of business technology
initiatives ADXchange provides continuous monitoring, management, and patching
of Active Directory. 

Most Comprehensive Suite of Managed Exchange Services

The combination of Azaleos and M3TG enables organizations to source from one
supplier the most complete and reliable set of remotely managed services for
Exchange, Blackberry Enterprise Server, and now also Active Directory. These
include:

* ViewXchange, real-time monitoring and reporting for Exchange and its
associated IT infrastructure 
* ManageXchange, 24X7 remote command and control for on-premise Exchange
environments 
* MobileXchange, turnkey management and monitoring for the Blackberry Enterprise
Server
* ProtectXchange, cloud-based anti-virus/anti-spam service 
* RestoreXchange, dual-site disaster recovery for both dial tone and mail
storage restoration 
* ArchiveXchange, automatic e-mail archiving and storage for Exchange server

Availability

The Azaleos ADXchange service is available immediately from Azaleos and its
business partners. All Azaleos services can be purchased with All-In-One
financing options that wrap hardware, Azaleos OneStop managed services, and any
deployment and migration services into a single monthly subscription. Financing
packages are available from ePlus, NetApp and Microsoft Financing. Customers who
choose the Microsoft program are also eligible for a special "no payments for 6
months" offer available through June 30, 2009.

&lt;p&gt;PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria (Reuters) - An attack by suspected Nigerian militants on a Chevron (CVX.N) oil pipeline in the Niger Delta on Friday shut down around 10,000 barrels per day of output, a company source said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pipeline running from the Abiteye flow station near Warri in Delta state was attacked in the early hours of Friday morning, according to Colonel Rabe Abubakar, spokesman for the military taskforce in the western Niger Delta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the strike had resulted in leakage into four communities in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was an incident last week ... The amount of shut-in production is around 10,000 barrels per day," a source at Chevron told Reuters, asking not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abubakar said the attackers were believed to have defected from the camp of militant leader Government Tompolo, who is based in Delta state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The group had threatened to continue with their attacks on installations and facilities unless they receive gratification from the multinationals," Abubakar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This threat will not be allowed to continue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attacks on pipelines and industry installations are common in the Niger Delta, home to Africa's biggest oil and gas industry. The unrest has shut down more than a fifth of Nigerian oil output over the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some attacks are carried out by militants who say they are fighting for a fairer share of the natural wealth, others by criminal gangs engaged in a multi-million-dollar trade in stolen oil. The crude is transported on barges to tankers waiting off Nigeria's coast before being mixed in with legitimate cargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security experts say groups of local community youths, frustrated by poverty and a lack of job opportunities, also sabotage pipelines in the hope of winning repair contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For full Reuters Africa coverage and to have your say on the top issues, visit: af.reuters.com/ )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Randy Fabi in Abuja; Writing by Nick Tattersall; editing by James Jukwey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA, USA--(Business Wire)--
Wie die Coca-Cola Company heute mitteilte, wird das Unternehmen im Verlauf der
kommenden sechs Jahre seiner Initiative RAIN (Replenish Africa Initiative) 30
Mio. US-Dollar zur Verf&#252;gung stellen, um afrikanischen Gemeinden in
verschiedenen Regionen des Kontinents Zugang zu sauberem Trinkwasser zu
erm&#246;glichen. Das RAIN-Projekt, implementiert von der Coca-Cola Africa
Foundation, wird f&#252;r mindestens zwei Millionen Afrikaner sauberes Wasser und
Abwassersysteme bereitstellen. 

"Afrikas Wasserkrise bedroht die Gesundheit seiner Bev&#246;lkerung und damit auch
seine Aussichten auf Wirtschaftswachstum", erkl&#228;rt Muhtar Kent, Pr&#228;sident und
CEO der Coca-Cola Company. "F&#252;r ihre Entwicklung brauchen die Regionen Menschen
in guter k&#246;rperlicher Verfassung, und unser Unternehmen ben&#246;tigt gesunde,
prosperierende Regionen f&#252;r nachhaltiges Wachstum. Die Unterst&#252;tzung
afrikanischer Gemeinden bei der L&#246;sung der Wasserversorgungsprobleme genie&#223;t
eine hohe Priorit&#228;t bei der Coca-Cola Company und ihren Abf&#252;llpartnern. In
diesem Bereich sind positive und bleibende Resultate m&#246;glich." 

Der Weltgesundheitsorganisation zufolge verf&#252;gen mehr als 300 Millionen
Afrikaner &#252;ber keinen Zugang zu sicherem Trinkwasser. Millionen von ihnen
sterben j&#228;hrlich an vermeidbaren Erkrankungen aufgrund von verseuchtem Wasser.
Fast die H&#228;lfte der afrikanischen Bev&#246;lkerung leidet an Krankheiten, die auf
verunreinigtes Trinkwasser und unzureichende sanit&#228;re Einrichtungen
zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren sind. 

F&#252;r den Zeitraum von 2004 bis 2015 wird mit dem Anstieg der Zahl der Menschen,
die ohne Zugang zu sauberem Trinkwasser im subsaharischen Afrika leben, um
weitere 47 Millionen gerechnet. Afrika wird die Millennium-Entwicklungsziele der
Vereinten Nationen - Zugang zu sauberem Trinkwasser f&#252;r 111 Millionen und
Abwassersysteme f&#252;r 289 Millionen Menschen - voraussichtlich verfehlen. 

"Eine einzelne Organisation kann die Probleme Afrikas nicht im Alleingang l&#246;sen,
aber gemeinsam als Zivilgesellschaft, Nichtregierungsorganisationen und
Regierungsorgane k&#246;nnen wir das Leben der Menschen in den Gemeinden entscheidend
verbessern", erkl&#228;rt William Asiko, Pr&#228;sident der Coca-Cola Africa Foundation.
Die Coca-Cola Africa Foundation unterh&#228;lt derzeit 19 Wasserprojekte in
afrikanischen L&#228;ndern - Angola, &#196;gypten, Elfenbeink&#252;ste, Ghana, Kenia, Malawi,
Mali, Marokko, Mosambik, Niger, Nigeria, Ruanda, Sambia, Senegal, S&#252;dafrika,
Tansania, Tunesien und Uganda -, die mehr als 300.000 Menschen erreichen. 

Alle diese Wasserprojekte werden in Zusammenarbeit mit den Gemeinden vor Ort
jedes Landes verwirklicht. Die Projekte sind dar&#252;ber hinaus Teil des Vorhabens
der Coca-Cola Company, den Gemeinden und der Natur die gleiche Menge an Wasser
zur&#252;ckzugeben, die f&#252;r alle Getr&#228;nke sowie deren Herstellung verbraucht wird.
Die Strategie des Unternehmens zur Umsetzung dieses Ziels besteht aus drei
Komponenten:

* Reduzieren - Verbesserung der Wassereffizienz um 20 Prozent bis 2012 gegen&#252;ber
dem Vergleichsjahr 2004. 
* Recycling - R&#252;ckf&#252;hrung des Wassers, das die Coca-Cola Company w&#228;hrend des
Herstellungsprozesses verbraucht, in einem Zustand, der Wasserflora und -fauna
schont und die Verwendung f&#252;r landwirtschaftliche Zwecke erm&#246;glicht, bis Ende
2010. 
* Ausgleichen - Ausdehnung des Engagements des Unternehmens f&#252;r nat&#252;rliche
Wasserscheiden um den Wasserverbrauch im Rahmen der Getr&#228;nkeherstellung
auszugleichen.

"Der Zugang zu sauberem Wasser ist noch immer ein Luxusgut, das in weiten Teilen
des Kontinents nicht verf&#252;gbar ist", so Asiko weiter. "RAIN erm&#246;glicht uns die
Erf&#252;llung unserer Umweltziele und schafft konkrete Verbesserungen der
Gesundheitsbedingungen, die f&#252;r Wachstum und wirtschaftlichen Erfolg unserer
Gemeinden und unseres Unternehmens entscheidend sind." 

&#220;ber The Coca-Cola Company

In dem Bewusstsein, dass die Aktivit&#228;ten eines Unternehmens nur so nachhaltig
sein k&#246;nnen wie die Regionen, in denen es aktiv ist, hat die Coca-Cola Company
im Jahr 2001 die Coca-Cola Africa Foundation ins Leben gerufen, um ihre
Entwicklungsinitiativen auf dem afrikanischen Kontinent umzusetzen. Mit der
Implementierung von mehr als 130 Programmen in 32 L&#228;ndern Afrikas erreichte die
Foundation seit ihrer Gr&#252;ndung &#252;ber 1.000.000 Menschen. 

Das Ziel der Foundation besteht in der Entwicklung gesunder und prosperierender
Gemeinden durch Investitionen in priorit&#228;re Bereiche wie Wasserversorgung,
Unternehmensgr&#252;ndung und Gesundheit. Die Vision der Coca-Cola Africa Foundation
liegt in der Schaffung eines stabilen Fundaments f&#252;r langfristig angelegtes,
soziales und wirtschaftliches Wachstum, das einen Beitrag zur planm&#228;&#223;igen
Erf&#252;llung der Millenniumsziele der Vereinten Nationen leistet. Die Coca-Cola
Africa Foundation verf&#252;gt &#252;ber Programme in einigen der entlegendsten Regionen
Afrikas und war bereits an verschiedenen humanit&#228;ren Eins&#228;tzen auf dem gesamten
Kontinent beteiligt. Die Programme der Coca-Cola Africa Foundation sollen
dar&#252;ber hinaus Mitarbeiter der Coca-Cola Company zur finanziellen oder
praktischen Unterst&#252;tzung der Aktivit&#228;ten anregen, indem diese Ihr Fachwissen
und ihre Zeit zur Verf&#252;gung stellen. N&#228;here Informationen &#252;ber die Coca-Cola

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company anunci&#243; hoy que ha asignado USD 30 millones durante los
pr&#243;ximos seis a&#241;o para garantizar a todas las comunidades africanas el acceso a
agua potable apta para el consumo a trav&#233;s de la Iniciativa de Reabastecimiento
de &#193;frica (RAIN, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s). Implementada por la Fundaci&#243;n
Coca-Cola de &#193;frica, en 2015 la RAIN proporcionar&#225; agua limpia y servicios
sanitarios a al menos 2 millones de africanos. 

"La crisis de agua en &#193;frica representa una amenaza para la salud de la
poblaci&#243;n y, por lo tanto, sus perspectivas de crecimiento econ&#243;mico", dijo
Muhtar Kent, Presidente y Director General de The Coca-Cola Company. "Las
comunidades necesitan gente fuerte y sana para prosperar y nuestro negocio
necesita comunidades fuertes y sanas para crecer y ser sostenible. Ayudar a las
comunidades africanas a tratar de resolver los problemas de agua es una
prioridad importante de nuestra Empresa y nuestros socios embotelladores, y
asimismo es un &#225;rea donde podemos tener un impacto positivo y duradero". 

Seg&#250;n la Organizaci&#243;n Mundial de la Salud, m&#225;s de 300 millones de africanos
carecen de acceso a agua potable y millones de ellos mueren cada a&#241;o a causa de
enfermedades que se transmiten a trav&#233;s del agua y que se pueden evitar. Hasta
la mitad de la poblaci&#243;n de la regi&#243;n en alg&#250;n momento sufri&#243; alguna enfermedad
relacionada con agua potable no apta para el consumo y malos servicios
sanitarios. 

Entre 2004 y 2015, se espera que la cantidad de gente sin acceso a agua apta
para el consumo en &#193;frica subsahariana aumente a 47 millones de personas. Se
espera que &#193;frica pierda la meta de los Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio de
las Naciones Unidas para el acceso a agua potable por 111 millones de personas y
la meta de servicios sanitarios por 289 millones. 

"Ninguna organizaci&#243;n puede resolver los problemas de desarrollo de &#193;frica, pero
junto con sociedades c&#237;vicas, organizaciones gubernamentales y no
gubernamentales podemos lograr un cambio positivo en las vidas de la gente que
forma parte de nuestras comunidades", dijo William Asiko, Presidente de la
Fundaci&#243;n Coca-Cola de &#193;frica. En la actualidad, la Fundaci&#243;n Coca-Cola de
&#193;frica tiene proyectos de agua que llegan a m&#225;s de 300.000 personas en 19 pa&#237;ses
africanos: Angola, Egipto, Etiopia, Ghana, Costa de Marfil, Kenia, Mali, Malawi,
Marruecos, Mozambique, N&#237;ger, Nigeria, Ruanda, Senegal, Sud&#225;frica, Tanzania,
T&#250;nez, Uganda y Zambia. 

Estos proyectos de agua se implementan en colaboraci&#243;n con las comunidades
locales de cada uno de los pa&#237;ses. Tambi&#233;n colaboran con el objetivo de
administraci&#243;n de agua al que aspira The Coca-Cola Company, que consiste en
devolver a las comunidades y a la naturaleza una cantidad de agua equivalente a
la que usamos en todas nuestras bebidas y su elaboraci&#243;n. La estrategia de la
Empresa para lograr este objetivo consta de tres componentes:

* Reducir: Para 2012 se mejorar&#225; el rendimiento del agua en un 20 por ciento, en
comparaci&#243;n con el a&#241;o b&#225;sico de 2004. 
* Reciclar: Se devolver&#225; al medio ambiente toda el agua que la Empresa usa en
los procesos de fabricaci&#243;n a un nivel que soporte la vida acu&#225;tica y la
agricultura hacia fines de 2010. 
* Reabastecer: Se expandir&#225; el apoyo de la Empresa a las cuencas saludables y
los programas de agua comunitaria sostenibles, a fin de lograr un equilibrio del
agua que se usa para las bebidas terminadas.

"El acceso a agua limpia sigue siendo un lujo, no un hecho, en muchas partes del
continente", dijo Asiko. "RAIN nos ayuda a cumplir con nuestros objetivos
ambientales y al mismo tiempo nos ofrece beneficios de salud que permitir&#225;n a
nuestras comunidades y negocios crecer y prosperar".

nous pouvons laisser un impact positif et durable. &#187; 

Selon l'Organisation mondiale de la sant&#233;, plus de 300 millions d'Africains
n'ont pas acc&#232;s &#224; l'eau potable et des millions d'entre eux meurent chaque ann&#233;e
des suites de maladies d'origine hydrique qui auraient pu &#234;tre &#233;vit&#233;es. La
moiti&#233; de la population de la r&#233;gion, &#224; tout moment donn&#233;, souffre de maladies
li&#233;es au manque d'eau potable et d'hygi&#232;ne. 

Entre 2004 et 2015, le nombre de personnes vivant sans acc&#232;s &#224; l'eau potable en
Afrique sub-saharienne devrait augmenter de 47 millions de personnes. L'Afrique
aura du mal &#224; atteindre l'objectif du d&#233;veloppement pour le mill&#233;naire des
Nations Unies en mati&#232;re d'acc&#232;s &#224; l'eau potable par l11 millions de personnes
et &#224; des conditions sanitaires acceptables par 289 millions de personnes. 

&#171; Aucune organisation ne peut r&#233;soudre les probl&#232;mes de d&#233;veloppement de
l'Afrique mais en collaboration avec la soci&#233;t&#233; civile, les organisations non
gouvernementales et les gouvernements, nous pouvons am&#233;liorer la vie des
personnes qui forment nos communaut&#233;s, &#187; explique William Asiko, pr&#233;sident de la
Fondation Coca-Cola pour l'Afrique. La fondation g&#232;re actuellement des projets
sur l'eau dans 19 pays africains : Afrique du Sud, Angola, C&#244;te d'Ivoire,
&#201;gypte, &#201;thiopie, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Malawi, Maroc, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria,
Ouganda, Rwanda, S&#233;n&#233;gal, Tanzanie, Tunisie et Zambie, touchant plus de 300 000
personnes. 

Ces projets sur l'eau sont tous mis en place dans le cadre de partenariats avec
les communaut&#233;s locales de chaque pays. Ils contribuent aussi &#224; l'objectif
ambitieux de responsabilit&#233; de l'eau, dont s'est fix&#233; The Coca-Cola Company,
consistant &#224; retourner aux communaut&#233;s et &#224; la nature une quantit&#233; d'eau
&#233;quivalente &#224; ce qu'elle utilise dans toutes ses boissons et leur production. La
strat&#233;gie de la soci&#233;t&#233; pour atteindre cet objectif pr&#233;sente trois volets :

* R&#233;duction - Am&#233;liorer l'efficacit&#233; hydrique de 20 pour cent d'ici 2012, par
rapport &#224; 2004, l'ann&#233;e de base. 
* Recyclage - Restituer &#224; l'environnement toute l'eau que la soci&#233;t&#233; utilise
dans ses processus de fabrication, &#224; un niveau suffisant pour prendre en charge
la vie aquatique et l'agriculture d'ici la fin de 2010. 
* R&#233;approvisionnement - &#201;largir la prise en charge par la soci&#233;t&#233;de bassins
hydrographiques sains et de programmes d'approvisionnement durable en eau aux
collectivit&#233;s pour compenser l'eau utilis&#233;e dans ses boissons finies.

&#171; L'acc&#232;s &#224; l'eau potable reste un v&#233;ritable luxe dans de grandes parties du
continent, &#187; d&#233;clare M. Asiko. &#171; L'initiative RAIN nous aide &#224; la fois &#224;
atteindre nos objectifs environnementaux et &#224; offrir des avantages sanitaires
qui permettront &#224; nos communaut&#233;s et &#224; notre entreprise de cro&#238;tre et de
prosp&#233;rer. &#187;

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company anunciou hoje que se comprometeu com US$30 milh&#245;es durante
os pr&#243;ximos seis anos para fornecer acesso &#224; &#225;gua pot&#225;vel segura a comunidades
por toda a &#193;frica atrav&#233;s de sua iniciativa Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN,
Iniciativa Reabastecer &#193;frica). Implementada pela The Coca-Cola Africa
Foundation, a RAIN vai fornecer &#225;gua limpa e saneamento a pelo menos 2 milh&#245;es
de africanos at&#233; 2015. 

"A crise h&#237;drica em &#193;frica amea&#231;a a sa&#250;de da popula&#231;&#227;o e, desta forma, suas
perspectivas de crescimento econ&#244;mico", disse Muhtar Kent, presidente e diretor
executivo da The Coca-Cola Company. "As comunidades precisam de pessoas fortes e
saud&#225;veis para prosperar, e a nossa empresa precisa que comunidades fortes e
saud&#225;veis cres&#231;am e sejam sustent&#225;veis. Ajudar as comunidades africanas a tentar
resolver seus desafios h&#237;dricos &#233; uma prioridade importante para a nossa empresa
e para nossos parceiros engarrafadores e &#233; uma &#225;rea onde podemos ter um impacto
positivo e duradouro." 

De acordo com a Organiza&#231;&#227;o Mundial de Sa&#250;de, mais de 300 milh&#245;es de africanos
n&#227;o t&#234;m acesso &#224; &#225;gua pot&#225;vel, e milh&#245;es morrem a cada ano devido a doen&#231;as
trat&#225;veis transportadas pela &#225;gua. Em qualquer tempo at&#233; metade da popula&#231;&#227;o da
regi&#227;o sofre de doen&#231;as relacionadas com &#225;gua pot&#225;vel insegura e parco
saneamento. 

Entre 2004 e 2015, est&#225; estimado que o n&#250;mero de pessoas vivendo sem acesso &#224;
&#225;gua pot&#225;vel segura na &#193;frica Sub-Saara aumente em 47 milh&#245;es de pessoas. A
estimativa &#233; que a &#193;frica n&#227;o consiga cumprir a meta dos Objetivos de
Desenvolvimento do Mil&#234;nio das Na&#231;&#245;es Unidas de acesso &#224; &#225;gua pot&#225;vel limpa por
111 milh&#245;es de pessoas e a meta de saneamento por 289 milh&#245;es. 

"Nenhuma organiza&#231;&#227;o sozinha pode resolver os desafios de desenvolvimento da
&#193;frica, mas em conjunto com a sociedade c&#237;vica, organiza&#231;&#245;es n&#227;o-governamentais
e o governo podemos fazer uma diferen&#231;a positiva nas vidas das pessoas que fazem
parte das nossas comunidades", disse William Asiko, presidente da The Coca-Cola
Africa Foundation. Atualmente a The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation possui projetos
h&#237;dricos em 19 pa&#237;ses africanos - Angola, Egito, Eti&#243;pia, Gana, Costa do Marfim,

&#193;frica do Sul, Tanz&#226;nia, Tun&#237;sia, Uganda e Z&#226;mbia - alcan&#231;ando mais de 300.000
pessoas. 

Estes projetos h&#237;dricos s&#227;o todos implementados em parceria com as comunidades
locais em cada pa&#237;s. Tamb&#233;m contribuem para a meta de intend&#234;ncia h&#237;drica
aspirada pela The Coca-Cola Company de devolver para as comunidades e para a
natureza uma quantidade de &#225;gua equivalente &#224; que usamos em todas as nossas
bebidas e respectiva produ&#231;&#227;o. A estrat&#233;gia da empresa para alcan&#231;ar esta meta &#233;
composta por tr&#234;s componentes:

* Reduzir - Melhorar a efici&#234;ncia da &#225;gua em 20% at&#233; 2012, comparado com 2004
como linha de base. 
* Reciclar - Devolver toda a &#225;gua que a empresa usa para os processos de
produ&#231;&#227;o ao ambiente em um n&#237;vel que suporte a vida aqu&#225;tica e a agricultura at&#233;
o final de 2010. 
* Reabastecer - Expandir o suporte da empresaa bacias hidrogr&#225;ficas saud&#225;veis e
programas h&#237;dricos comunit&#225;rios sustent&#225;veis para equilibrar a &#225;gua usada em
suas bebidas acabadas.

"Ter acesso &#224; &#225;gua limpa ainda &#233; um luxo, e n&#227;o uma premissa, em grandes partes
do continente", disse Asiko. "A RAIN nos ajuda a cumprir nossas metas
ambientais, e ao mesmo tempo tamb&#233;m fornece benef&#237;cios de sa&#250;de que v&#227;o permitir
que as nossas comunidades e nossa empresa cres&#231;am e prosperem."

&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company announced today that it has committed US $30MM over the
next six years to provide access to safe drinking water to communities
throughout Africa through its Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN). Implemented by
The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation, RAIN will provide at least 2 million Africans
with clean water and sanitation by 2015. 

"Africa`s water crisis threatens the health of its population and, therefore,
its prospects for economic growth," said Muhtar Kent, President and CEO of The
Coca-Cola Company. "Communities need strong, healthy people to thrive, and our
business needs strong, healthy communities to grow and be sustainable. Helping
African communities tackle their water challenges is an important priority for
our Company and our bottling partners and is an area where we can make a
positive and lasting impact." 

According to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million Africans lack
access to safe drinking water, and millions of them die each year from
preventable waterborne illnesses. Up to half of the region`s population at any
one time suffers from diseases related to unsafe drinking water and poor
sanitation. 

Between 2004 and 2015, the number of people living without access to safe water
in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to increase by 47 million people. Africa is
expected to miss the United Nations` Millennium Development Goals target for
access to clean drinking water by 111 million people and the sanitation target
by 289 million. 

"No single organization can resolve Africa`s development challenges, but
together with civic society, nongovernmental organizations and government we can
make a positive difference in the lives of the people who make up our
communities," said William Asiko, President of The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation.
The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation currently has water projects in 19 African
countries - Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Cote d` Ivoire, Kenya, Mali, Malawi,
Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania,
Tunisia, Uganda and Zambia - reaching over 300,000 people. 

These water projects are all implemented in partnership with local communities
in each country. They also contribute to The Coca-Cola Company`s aspirational
water stewardship goal of returning to communities and to nature an amount of
water equivalent to what we use in all of our beverages and their production.
The Company`s strategy for achieving that goal has three components:

* Reduce - Improving water efficiency by 20 percent by 2012, compared to a
baseline year 2004. 
* Recycle - Returning all water the Company uses for manufacturing processes to
the environment at a level that supports aquatic life and agriculture by the end
of 2010. 
* Replenish - Expanding the Company`s supportof healthy watersheds and
sustainable community water programs to balance the water used in its finished
beverages.

"Having access to clean water still remains a luxury, not a given, in large
parts of the continent," Asiko said. "RAIN helps us both fulfill our
environmental goals while also providing health benefits that will allow our
communities and our business to grow and prosper."

The paper had also said it was evaluating making an individual bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bidders for a 51 percent stake in the outsourcing firm must submit detailed expressions of interest by Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing by John Mair)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group(AIG.N) funneled over $90 billion of taxpayer bailout funds to various U.S. and European banks, but the biggest beneficiary was politically connected Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suspicions of potential conflicts of interest and favoritism have been fueled by $12.9 billion AIG paid to Goldman Sachs -- where then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson had previously worked as chief executive -- in the months after the insurer was rescued by the government last September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, for its part, has insisted it did not need the bailout money because it was "always fully collateralized and hedged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long Wall Street's largest investment bank before it recently became a bank holding company, Goldman answered a series of questions from Reuters about the bailout funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can say that our notional exposure to AIG is a fraction of what it was at the time of the September bailout," Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked why Goldman Sachs took $12.9 billion of taxpayer money if it was collateralized and hedged on its AIG positions, DuVally said it was because AIG was not allowed to fail, so Goldman did not get money from hedges that would have paid out if the insurer had collapsed. And, he said, under the terms of its contracts with AIG, Goldman was entitled to collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuVally also said the bank does extensive due diligence on all its counterparties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much Goldman and other counterparties received from AIG has been just one of several flashpoints over the taxpayer rescue of what was once the world's largest insurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG has also infuriated politicians -- including U.S. President Barack Obama -- with its plan to pay $165 million in bonuses to employees at the unit at the heart of its problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the payments to counterparties like Goldman Sachs dwarfed the bonuses, and some experts contend that these companies should have been made to share some of the losses resulting from the giant insurance firm's near collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People see that the guys that ruined AIG are getting paid more money, and that creates outrage," said Porter Stansberry, managing director of Stansberry  Associates Investment Research. "If you want to be outraged, be outraged that the counterparties got paid out full value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was not the only large bank with exposure to AIG. The list of counterparties that AIG disclosed on Sunday included others that got large sums. Goldman was followed by Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) with $11.9 billion, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) with $11.8 billion and Barclays PLC (BARC.L) with $8.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the AIG disclosures are still incomplete in that they do not include payments to the banks since December 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are looking at a small piece of it right here. So what is the total exposure? That's the question. And then the issue is, well, if that was wiped out what would it do to Goldman's capital?" said Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is obvious that firms underestimated the counterparty risk. That was their mistake," Harvey said. "Yet they are getting bailouts of U.S. taxpayer money. Why should we pay for their mistake?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an editorial on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal pointed to Goldman's claim that "all of its AIG bets were adequately hedged and that it needed no 'bailout.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why take $13 billion then? This needless cover-up is one reason Americans are getting angrier as they wonder if Washington is lying to them about these bailouts," the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout has stirred resentment not just in the U.S. Congress, but on Wall Street, where investors have speculated that Goldman and its connections helped it get a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, many former Goldman executives have moved into government. Paulson left Goldman in 2006 as chief executive. The chairman of the New York Federal Reserve is former Goldman Chairman Steve Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The person that should be subpoenaed is Hank Paulson. How do you go from running Goldman Sachs in '05 and '06 and making all of these bets with AIG's financial products unit and then end up in the government guaranteeing those bets and not have a conflict of interest?" Stansberry asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuVally said Goldman Sachs was not party to any discussions about the bailout of AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paritosh Bansal; Additional reporting by Lilla Zuill and Kevin Drawbaugh; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For more MA news and our DealZone blog, go to www.reuters.com/deals)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) got the largest chunk of U.S. taxpayer money that found
its way to companies that were on the other end of certain
transactions with American International Group Inc (AIG.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Rep. Paul Kanjorski, whose House Subcommittee on Capital
Markets and Insurance will quiz AIG Chief Executive Edward
Liddy, said last weekend the counterparties and bonuses paid to
AIG employees will topics for investigation at a hearing on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A day ahead of the hearing, Reuters posed 10 questions to
Goldman about these issues. The following are the questions and
the answers from Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUESTION: If Goldman Sachs was collateralized and hedged on
its AIG positions, why did it take $12.9 billion of taxpayer
money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANSWER: "Goldman Sachs has maintained that its exposure to
AIG was collateralized and hedged. The majority of Goldman
Sachs' CDS (credit default swap) exposure to AIG Financial
Group was collateralized. That means that Goldman Sachs had
collateral. To the extent it wasn't collateralized, Goldman
Sachs hedged its exposure via the credit default swaps market.
If the government had allowed AIG to fail, Goldman Sachs would
have received its collateral. A credit event would be
triggered, and Goldman Sachs would receive a payout from the
credit default swap insurance that it had. This is from other
counterparties."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separating out the money Goldman received due to AIG's
securities lending obligations, DuVally said: "AIG was not
allowed to fail. So there was no payout from the hedges.
Additionally after the bailout there was some additional
deterioration in AIG's position. Under the terms of the
contracts that Goldman Sachs had with AIG, it was entitled to
collateral. We were always fully collateralized and hedged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUESTION: Did then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson or
his aides discuss Goldman's exposure to AIG with Goldman Chief
Executive Lloyd Blankfein or any other executive or director of
the bank?  Also, if they did, what was the substance of the
conversations, and did Goldman Sachs take any position on
whether AIG should be saved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANSWER: "Goldman Sachs was not party to any discussions
about the bailout of AIG."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUESTION: Did Goldman do any due diligence on AIG before
buying credit default swaps (CDS) from it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANSWER: "We do extensive due diligence on all our
counterparties."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUESTION: From what other institutions did Goldman buy CDSs
to insure its collateralized debt obligations or other
securities?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANSWER: "We do not disclose counterparty information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUESTION: How did Goldman account for the counterparty risk
in its dealings with AIG?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANSWER: "We made sure our positions with AIG were
collateralized and hedged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUESTION: Did Goldman have more exposure to AIG through
CDSs than that disclosed by AIG on Sunday? If yes, how much
is/was that exposure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANSWER: "The disclosures by AIG encompass all the
collateral received by Goldman Sachs on its credit default swap
positions with AIG financial products for the period from
September through the end of the year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUESTION: Why did Goldman decide to close its securities
lending transactions with AIG?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANSWER: "AIG could not return the cash it owed to Goldman
Sachs under the terms of the transaction. It was the terms of
the agreement. Note that Goldman Sachs had the ability all
along if AIG could not honor its transaction to sell those
securities into the market. Note that those securities which
still had value went back to the government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUESTION: Was the value of the securities returned to AIG
less than the cash received from AIG?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANSWER: "They were equivalent. Under the terms of the
agreement if the securities Goldman Sachs borrowed had declined
in value, Goldman Sachs had the right to request that part of
the cash collateral it posted to AIG be returned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUESTION: Has Goldman Sachs received more money from AIG to
satisfy counterparty obligations since the end of 2008, and
what did it receive before Sept. 16?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANSWER: "We are not disclosing the amount of collateral we
received from AIG before the government bailout nor after the
end of 2008. We can say that our notional exposure to AIG is a
fraction of what it was at the time of the September bailout.
And as has been the case, our exposure remains collateralized
and hedged."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades and assigns Rating outlooks to the following classes of
J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC), series
2005-LDP1, commercial mortgage pass-through certificates: 

--$32.4 million class H to 'BB+' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$10.8 million class J to 'BB' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$14.4 million class K to 'B+' from 'BB'; Outlook Negative; 

--$10.8 million class L to 'B' from 'BB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$7.2 million class M to 'B-' from 'B+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$7.2 million class N to 'B-' from 'B'; Outlook Negative; 

--$10.8 million class P to 'CCC/DR1' from 'B-/DR1'. 

In addition, Fitch has affirmed and assigned outlooks to the following classes: 

--$3.1 million class A-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$316.5 million class A-1A at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$994.5 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$157.5 million class A-3 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$601.5 million class A-4 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$119.9 million class A-SB at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$94.3 million class A-J at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$100 million class A-JFL at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

--$54 million class D at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; 

--$28.8 million class E at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$46.8 million class F at 'BBB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$28.8 million class G at 'BBB'; Outlook Negative. 

The $16.7 million class NR is not rated by Fitch. 

The downgrades are the result of an increase in specially serviced loans and
Fitch expected losses. Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of any
rating changes over the next one to two years. As of the February 2009
distribution report, the pool's aggregate certificate balance was reduced to
4.5% to $2.45 billion from $2.88 billion at issuance. Twenty loans (9.7%) are
currently defeased. 

Currently, Fitch has identified 28 Loans of Concern (7.1%), including the seven
specially serviced loans (1.1%). 

The largest specially serviced loan (0.4%) is a 313 unit multifamily property in
Houston, TX. The property is 60 days + delinquent. The borrower continues to
work on stabilizing the property and has settled outstanding litigation from
previous management. As of June 2008, the servicer reported occupancy was 79%
with a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 0.75 times (x). 

The second largest specially serviced loan (0.2%) is secured by a 14,822 square
foot (sf) retail property in Glendale, AZ. The loan transferred to the special
servicer due to imminent default due to tenant vacancy. 

The third (0.1%) and fourth (0.1%) largest specially serviced loans are secured
by a 82,788 sf office property and a 122,645 sf industrial property in
Indianapolis and Portage, IN. The loans have the same sponsor, DBSI Inc. and
were transferred to the special servicer in December 2008. The sponsor and
master lease for the properties have declared bankruptcy and are subject to a
class action law suit from the Tenants In Common Investors. As of June 2008, the
servicer reported occupancy were 100% for both properties. 

Fitch reviewed the most recent servicer provided operating statement analysis
reports for the two shadow rated loans, Woodbridge Center (7.6%) and Harbor
Court (1.0%). 

The Woodbridge Center loan is secured by a regional mall located in Woodbridge,
NJ. As of September 2008, occupancy at Woodbridge Center has improved to 99%
from 95% at issuance. One of the major tenants, Fortunoff representing 9% of the
net rentable area (NRA) of the mall and 27% NRA of the collateral declared
bankruptcy; however, accounts for less than 5% of the gross potential rent.
There are no co-tenancy clauses related to the Fortunoff space. The loan is
scheduled to mature in June 2009 and there are no contract extensions. The
sponsor of the loan is General Growth Properties and has an interest rate of
4.24%. The loan no longer maintains an investment grade shadow rating due to
increased expenses and the upcoming maturity. 

The Harbor Court loan is secured by a ground lease on a parcel of land in
Honolulu, HI and expires in 2074. A 201,256 sf office/mixed-use building is
constructed on the site. The loan is scheduled to mature in May 2014 and
maintains an investment grade shadow rating. 

In 2009, six non defeased loans (10.5%) are scheduled to mature and have a
weighted average coupon rate of 4.43% and a servicer reported DSCR of 1.94. In
2010, 21 non defeased loans (15.6%) are scheduled to mature and have a weighted
average coupon rate of 4.67% and a servicer reported DSCR of 2.21.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA' rating to Pfizer Inc.'s (Pfizer) proposed
public issuance of $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes, comprising five
tranches. 

The debt offering comprises two-year floating-rate notes, three-year fixed-rate
notes, six-year fixed-rate notes, 10-year fixed-rate notes, and 30-year
fixed-rate notes. Proceeds from the senior unsecured debt are expected to be
used for general corporate purposes and to partially finance the acquisition of
Wyeth. Fitch has also placed Pfizer's new notes on Rating Watch Negative, along
with the company's other outstanding debt as highlighted below. 

--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'AA'; 

--Senior unsecured debt 'AA'; 

--Bank loan 'AA'; 

--Short-term IDR 'F1+'; 

--Commercial paper 'F1+'. 

Fitch originally placed Pfizer on Rating Watch Negative on Jan. 26, 2009. 

Pfizer's credit profile will be pressured by the incremental debt used to
complete the Wyeth transaction. Fitch will utilize the new information
pertaining to the tenure of the new debt and clarification of Pfizer's plans to
address the higher leverage in the intermediate term to finalize the rating
level. Preliminary calculations using proforma financials, excluding synergies,
puts total debt leverage around 1.75 times (x) and net debt leverage at 0.80x at
closing, which is expected in the third or fourth quarter. 

Pfizer stated that annual synergies totaling around $4 billion would be targeted
for three years after the completion of the transaction. Additionally, Pfizer
will halve its dividend to $0.16 per share, saving over $4 billion of cash
annually. Wyeth's product portfolio, strongly centered on biologics and
vaccines, does not significantly overlap Pfizer's offerings, increasing the
probability of anti-trust clearance of the acquisition. Areas of potential
anti-trust concern are the animal health businesses and developmental projects
focused on central nervous disorders, specifically Alzheimer's disease.

rivals like Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) and Canon (7751.T), said its
printers and supplies will be distributed through chains such as
Staples (SPLS.O), Office Depot ODP.N and OfficeMax OMX.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan comes as Lexmark works to build sales to
high-volume users, who print many pages, use lots of ink and
toner and often also sign up for printing services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company in January posted an 82 percent decline in
quarterly profit. It expects a revenue decline in the mid- to
high-teens percentage range during the first quarter, as the
recession hurts computer-related purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Lexmark also signed a patent cross-licensing deal
with Microsoft (MSFT.O), covering a broad range of products,
including Lexmark printers and multifunction products, and
Microsoft software products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Lexmark rose 33 cents, or about 2 percent to $16.69
in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
Microsoft shares on Nasdaq rose about 1.9 percent to $16.55.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings places the following classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial
Mortgage Securities Trust 2006-LDP9 on Rating Watch Negative: 

--$50 million class D at 'A'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$16.7 million class D-S 'A'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$40.9 million class E 'A-'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$13.7 million class E-S 'A-'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$40.9 million class F 'BBB+'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$13.7 million class F-S 'BBB+'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$36.4 million class G 'BBB'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$12.1 million class G-S 'BBB'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$45.5 million class H 'BBB-'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$15.2 million class H-S 'BBB-'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$18.2 million class J 'BB+'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$18.2 million class K 'BB'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$12.1 million class L 'BB-'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$12.1 million class M 'B+'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$6.1 million class N 'B'; Rating Watch Negative; 

--$12.1 million class P 'B-'; Rating Watch Negative. 

Fitch also revises the Rating Outlooks on the following two classes: 

--$22.8 million class C 'AA-' to Outlook Negative from Stable; 

--$7.6 million class C-S 'AA-' to Outlook Negative from Stable. 

The Rating Watch Negative placements on classes D through P are due to the
transfer of the Lincoln Village Shopping Center loan, 0.58%, to special
servicing on March 13, 2009, as well as continued concern and potential losses
from the six other specially serviced loans (0.88%) in the trust. 

Lincoln Village Shopping Center is an 86,910 square foot (sf) retail property in
Lincoln, CA. The property has experienced an increase in overall operating
expenses resulting to a decline in net cash flow. As of Sept. 30, 2008, the debt
service coverage ratio (DSCR) as well as occupancy were, 1.12 times (x) and 95%,
respectively. For the same period, the rent roll reflects 43 tenants, the
largest occupying 4,652 sf. 

Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Watch status of these classes as more
information on the potential workout and valuation of the assets becomes
available. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and

&lt;p&gt;Vista Now on 1 in 5 Desktops 
PARK CITY, Utah--(Business Wire)--
Janco and the IT Productivity Center have just released their March 2009 Browser
and Operating System Market Share White Paper. Janco reports Microsoft`s IE
browser market share has stabilized at 72.23% versus 69.72% in March 2008 and
78.69% in March 2007; Firefox maintains its number two browser position and is
used by almost 17.18% of all users; Google, with its Desktop and Chrome
offerings, has just under 3% of the market; and acceptance of Vista continues to
be below Microsoft's expectation. 

Victor Janulaitis, the CEO of Janco, said, "The  major browser findings of the
study are: Microsoft's Internet Explorer`s market share has stabilized, Firefox
a strong number 2, and Google`s Chrome is a non-event." The White Paper has a
detailed historical analysis of browser market share since 1997. The findings
are supported by data that is provided both graphically and in spreadsheet
format. 

On the Operating System front, Microsoft's Vista is installed on just under 1 in
5 desktops (19.53%) after 27 months since Vista's first release (RC1).
Janulaitis added, "Vista proves that large companies like Microsoft can and do
make huge blunders in technology. Microsoft can no longer count on moving users
to new products like Vista as quickly as they want." 

A summary of Janco`s white paper can be found on the Janco`s web site
(http://www.e-janco.com/browser.php) and the IT Productivity Center`s web site
(http://www.itproductivity.org/browser.php). 

Janco has collected consistent data on browser activity since September 1997.
The data is captured from commercial sites that focus on business-to-business
activity. The full white paper with Excel spreadsheets is available for $249.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Mar 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that American Occupational Network (AON)
and HyGen Pharmaceuticals are improving patient care by digitizing health
records and streamlining their business operations using cloud-based
software from IBM Business Partners MedTrak Systems and The System House.

    By accessing technology that handles various tasks -- from electronic
health records (EHRs) to on-line appointment scheduling -- as a service
through the Internet instead of developing, purchasing and maintaining
technology on-site, San Diego-based AON has been able to update its
clinical processes and increase key efficiencies to improve patient care.
For example, by digitizing health records and other processes, the company
has reduced medical transcription costs by 80 percent and now can provide
faster and more accurate billing to individuals and insurance companies,
reducing the average time to create a bill from 7 days to less than 24
hours.

    In the United States, the new American Recovery and Reinvestment Act will
infuse $19 billion into healthcare IT and calls for the utilization of an
EHR for each person by 2014. While EHRs help deliver smarter healthcare
systems with real-time access to critical patient health information, only
an estimated 38 percent of U.S. physicians used partial or full EHRs in
2008.

    As many healthcare providers struggle to manage the high costs of
providing quality patient care, this low EHR utilization rate can be
attributed to providers also being challenged with investing time and
resources into information technology to improve their operations. This
challenge makes acquiring technology as a cloud-based service compelling
in the healthcare industry.

    "IBM is committed to working with our many business partners, alliances
and clients to apply emerging technologies such as cloud computing to
today's healthcare challenges as we help build smarter worldwide
healthcare systems together," said Dan Pelino, general manager, IBM
Healthcare &amp; Life Sciences Industry. "IBM provides the technical
training, infrastructure and hosting services that enable our Business
Partners to deliver cloud-based software to those healthcare providers
and businesses that would rather focus on their own core competencies
than build a team of IT technical experts."

    MedTrak Systems, Inc., of North Muskegon, Michigan, uses IBM hosting
services and IBM DB2 database software to deliver its software as a
cloud-based service to healthcare providers of all sizes. This IBM
Business Partner's Internet-based software helps its users improve
overall care for patients while increasing business efficiency and
reducing operating costs with one system that manages patient
registration, scheduling, EHRs, clinical workflow, billing and
collections.

    AON recently converted its clinical billing software and adopted
additional capabilities, including EHRs, registering and scheduling with
MedTrak software for its five occupational health clinics in Southern
California. AON needed a solution to help compete against the larger
national occupational medicine chains, yet it lacked the technical
infrastructure, IT skills and budget for increased staffing expenses.

    "By acquiring these new capabilities as a service, AON has become much
more efficient and able to provide a better patient experience without
up-front IT infrastructure costs or a need for additional staff for
on-going IT maintenance," said Larisa West, director of administration,
American Occupational Network. "With MedTrak, we've been able to
streamline our clinical processes, and to have added these capabilities
and staff them on-premises, we otherwise would have needed to add two or
three technical staff members per clinic."

    MedTrak also provides its software as a cloud-based service to educational
institutions to help build the skills of future health professionals.
Davenport University has trained hundreds of medical students on MedTrak
software by simulating real-world health system medical workflows, EHRs
and billing.

    HyGen Pharmaceuticals Streamlines Operations with Cloud-Based Services

    IBM Business Partner The Systems House, Inc. of Clifton, New Jersey, has
experienced an industry shift with more clients opting to acquire its
supply chain software as a service. Its Master Distribution System (MDS)
software, tailored to the needs of healthcare supply distributors, can be
managed either by a client on its own premises or as a service, hosted
remotely on IBM AIX software and IBM System p servers. Of The Systems
House's new customers in 2008, more than 75 percent opted to use their
software with the cloud-based services delivery model.

    "Healthcare supply distributors play a critical role in the industry and
are not immune to the challenges of reducing the cost of care for
patients," said David Fertig, vice president, technical services, The
Systems House. "With IBM technology and support, we've been able to
deliver MDS as an affordable service, helping distributors to better
manage their costs, become more efficient and meet the level of service
their customers demand."

    HyGen Pharmaceuticals, a national wholesale distributor of generic
prescription pharmaceutical products based in Bellevue, Washington, needed
to implement a new IT infrastructure to better manage its business
operations and address increased regulatory and reporting issues while
building a foundation for solid business growth.

    The company was using several different software systems and wanted to
create an integrated view of all its business information. The company
chose MDS delivered as a service because of the unlimited growth
capability and the quick start-up and implementation it offered.

    With increased business control and an instant view of all operational
activity, HyGen now can catch invoices going out below minimum margins,
decrease inventory levels on products that no longer sell, and provide
customers with documentation when they attempt to return items that were
not purchased from the company. Utilizing lot and serial tracking, HyGen
also can create e-pedigree documentation for "track and trace" on drugs
throughout the supply chain.

    All of these functions allow the company to focus on growing its business
through new opportunities instead of dealing with the daily operational
and technology issues associated with running a small-to-medium business.

    MedTrak Systems and The Systems House are part of IBM's Software as a
Service (SaaS) Specialty program -- comprised of over 200 Independent
Software Vendors (ISVs) using an IBM infrastructure to support their
cloud-based software services offerings.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
Twisted Pair Solutions (www.twistpair.com), a pioneer in unified communications
software built to open standards, today announced that Microsoft Corporation
will deploy WAVE software technology in its Global Security Operations Centers
(GSOC) in the United States, Europe and India. WAVE software will help Microsoft
build mission-critical redundancy in to its global security operations by
enabling communications interoperability between the different two-radio systems
currently in use around the world, as well as provide dispatch console positions
for GSOC operators. 

Microsoft GSOCs are responsible for all aspects of security in their facilities
across the region. Security operations involve the management of a multitude of
systems, ranging from building access readers and intrusion sensors, to elevator
phones and panic alarms. Like the security operations for many large, multi-site
organizations, Microsoft depends in part on two-way radios systems for its GSOC
voice communications and these radio systems are typically different from region
to region. These radio systems also have sometimes been maintained as silos in
the IT or facilities department with no back end integration with user databases
and no advanced collaboration capabilities that are now common with solutions
such as Sharepoint and Office Communications Server. 

In order to add greater redundancy to its worldwide GSOC operations, Microsoft
intends to provide communications interoperability between the different radio
systems deployed around the world and WAVE software has been chosen to provide
this unique capability. Once WAVE is operational by mid-2009, each of
Microsoft`s three GSOCs will have the ability to assume full control of
another`s security operations for whatever reason, with full communications
interoperability between radio systems. Microsoft will also be able to leverage
advanced Unified Communications and collaboration capabilities with a fully
integrated console solution. 

"Twisted Pair`s WAVE technology provides a powerful way for us to achieve
greater redundancy for our global security operations and does so through very
close integration with our own Microsoft Unified Communications solutions like
Active Directory, Office Communications Server and Sharepoint," said Dermott
Barry, Managing Director for Worldwide Public Safety at Microsoft. "By allowing
two-way radios, cell phones, Stentophones and VOIP communication systems to
seamlessly work together, WAVE adds a full suite of new collaborative
capabilities to our Global Security Operations Centers." 

"Because of this deployment, Microsoft is able to deliver powerful radio to IT
integration with their off-the-shelf collaboration systems that help extend the
life of radio networks by making them interoperable and adding new
capabilities," added Tom Guthrie, President and CEO of Twisted Pair Solutions.
"Justifying the purchase of a whole new radio system in this economic climate is
nearly impossible." 

Widely deployed by private, public and mission-critical organizations across the
globe, WAVE is the industry`s only pure software-based solution for integrating
two-way radio networks into a wider unified communications environment.
Leveraging IP networks as a unifying medium, WAVE connects workers who are using
disparate and oftentimes incompatible communications technologies, including
two-way radios, personal computers, cell phones and IP phones, into a single,
interoperable and easily manageable communications system. The latest version,
WAVE 4.5, supports Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), a compliance requirement
for U.S. military and federal agencies, as well as offering an enhanced user
interface and increased compatibility with Microsoft applications and platforms
such as Windows Vista, Microsoft Windows Server 2008, Microsoft Office
Communications Server and Sharepoint Server. 

Twisted Pair has also announced that it is adding WAVE support for Trident
PassPort trunked networks and MOTOTRBO radio systems, as well as FSI for P25.
Twisted Pair is a licensed developer of MOTOTRBO. 

About Twisted Pair Solutions, Inc.

Twisted Pair Solution's award-winning WAVE software technology enables partners
and customers to build and operate secure, highly scalable communications
solutions in the world's most demanding environments. Recognizing that the best
approach to solving the complexities of communications interoperability is to
use standards-based software to unify diverse communications technologies, WAVE
is trusted when communications is absolutely indispensable. Twisted Pair
Solutions is headquartered in Seattle, Washington, USA with offices in the
United Kingdom and Australia. Visit us at www.twistpair.com.

&lt;p&gt;ADDIS ABABA, March 17 (Reuters) - Ethiopia this week ran out
of Coca-Cola after its local bottler said it no longer had
enough foreign currency to buy bottle tops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The East African Bottling Share Company -- who have
exclusive rights to bottle the drink in Ethiopia -- said they
were forced to temporarily close their two plants in the Horn of
Africa nation and send their 1,000 workers on compulsory leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company sent its ... workers on forced annual leave
with full pay and the fate of the firm will be decided at a
meeting of the board ... next week," it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola (KO.N) franchises its bottling worldwide to local
companies and local legislation often makes it difficult for
them to intervene in such situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hotels and bars in capital Addis Ababa ran out of the drink
late last week and began offering rival brand Pepsi to
customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bottle-top shortages have hit other companies in the poor
country that has struggled to find foreign currency during the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Producers of Harar beer and Hakim Stout also cut production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Local bottle-top manufacturers have been unable to keep up
with demand from bottling companies who can no longer afford to
source the tops abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is also struggling to buy the concentrate needed
to make the drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Street children have been collecting the tops from the
streets of capital Addis Ababa and selling them back to
companies to recycle. They are being paid around 20 U.S. cent
for a kg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saudi-Ethiopian oil tycoon Sheikh Al-Amoudi, last week named
by Forbes as the 43rd richest man in the world, distributes

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA and ARMONK, NY, Mar 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Researchers at the University of California, San Diego today announced
plans for a new campus center dedicated to invent the next generation of
virtual worlds, multiple player online games, and high fidelity digital
cinema, using one of the world's most sophisticated computer servers --
the IBM System z mainframe.

    IBM (NYSE: IBM) provided a Shared University Research (SUR) award to help
the university jump-start its new Center for Next-Generation Digital
Media on the UC San Diego campus. In addition to multiple peripherals and
additional support, the IBM award consists of the company's newest System
z10 Enterprise Class server with the Cell Broadband Engine (Cell/B.E.).

    "Students will have access to IBM's newest hybrid computing system with
blazingly fast and powerful capabilities. UCSD students can now tap into
security features and 'specialty engines' designed to handle a new
generation of virtual world applications, where massive numbers of
simultaneous users can share a single environment," said Bernie Meyerson,
IBM Fellow and vice president of Systems and Technology Group.

    "We want to facilitate the invention of the next generation of digital
media," said Sheldon Brown, a visual arts professor at UC San Diego. "By
significantly increasing the experiential richness of virtual worlds, we
think they will become a proving ground for creating and interconnecting
digital media of all forms, starting with games and cinema. As virtual
worlds and digital cinema develop more visual sophistication and cultural
literacy about how we use them, they will start to intersect and will
become much richer and more complex."

    Initially, Brown and his team in UCSD's Experimental Game Lab will use the
IBM System z server to develop and operate a virtual world based on
Brown's museum installation "Scalable City," extending it to be
experienced by potentially thousands of simultaneous users worldwide 24
hours a day and seven days a week. Users could potentially experience a
more visually and behaviorally complex virtual world than current efforts
as seen in Second Life, The Sims or other massively multiplayer online
role-playing games, such as World of Warcraft.

    To date, a lack of computing power has limited what users can see in
virtual worlds, which may have thousands of users and hundreds of
thousands of objects. When users have moved to different parts of the
virtual world, they moved to different computer server nodes in the
computing cluster, which resulted in making the experience of the total
world very fragmented.

    According to Brown, IBM System z mainframes offer just what the virtual
worlds of tomorrow will need. The system's high volume processing
capabilities combined with the dense computing power of IBM's
Cell/Broadband Engine multiprocessor technology puts real-time interaction
in a virtual world within reach for users.

    "The IBM mainframe can look like a couple hundred computers in a cluster,
or look like one giant computer. We can optimize tradeoffs between storage
and processing, which we can use to change the shape and nature of the
virtual world experience," Brown explained.

    While IBM mainframes can enhance the real-time nature and verisimilitude
of virtual worlds, the experience of users will always be limited, in
part, by the 'client' side -- the personal computers with which users
enter those virtual worlds. To that end, the UC San Diego researchers are
already experimenting with multi-core processors for client-side
computing, including the Intel chip code-named Larrabee, which won't be
commercially available until early 2010, along with the IBM Cell
processor. With partners at three other universities, Brown has also won
a planning grant from the National Science Foundation for an
industry-university collaborative research center on hybrid multi-core
computing.

    "With so many processors being crammed on a chip, the home computer now
starts to look like four or eight or 16 or 32 computers within the box,"
said Brown. "They are more powerful but they also have to finish their
computation 60 times a second in order to provide real-time experiences in
the virtual world. We cannot tell a person to wait around while we wait
for the result."

    Brown's team will also continue to explore new approaches to networking
using very high bandwidth data backbones. With Peking University, they are
currently studying techniques to share virtual-world serving between San
Diego and Beijing.

    UCSD hopes that would now encourage other partners to participate in the
newly announced Center for Next-Generation Digital Media at UC San Diego.
"In a radical way, we have to envisage what the next generation of digital
media will look like," said Brown. "How do significant breakthroughs in
computing and infrastructure really change the landscape for what these
digital media forms are going to be? The two emerging forms are virtual
worlds and digital cinema. We can view each of these as separate entities,
or as merged, interrelated entities."

    Initially, the center will focus on new production platforms for digital
cinema, building on existing relationships with Hollywood studios and
additional support for the new center from the Center for Research in
Computing and the Arts (CRCA), the California Institute for
Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2), and the San Diego
Supercomputer Center (SDSC). The IBM mainframe computer is being hosted by
SDSC, connecting directly to Calit2's digital cinema facilities with
dedicated fiber optics and very high bandwidth connections to the Internet
and global fiber-optic networks.

    "Massively multi-user virtual worlds are increasingly important as media
and social environments," said Calit2 director Larry Smarr, a pioneer in
supercomputing and high-bandwidth optical networking. "Calit2 has made a
major commitment to digital cinema through our CineGrid project, and we
believe this center can significantly further state-of-the-art practices
in digital media of all kinds."

    Added SDSC director Fran Berman: "The boundaries have blurred between
technology and the arts, and the synergistic environment represented by
the Scalable City project represents the paradigm shift that is beginning
to emerge. SDSC is excited to be hosting the machine and partnering in
this important project."

    "I'm using this virtual world as a platform for developing very high
fidelity digital cinema," concluded Brown. "The virtual world can become a
way to prototype cinema making -- working through camera shots, scenery,
and even actors through avatars. Cinema production can be done faster and
with more flexibility."

&lt;p&gt;LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - JPMorgan Asset Management is seeing some recovery in risk appetite in money market funds that benefited hugely from a flight to safety last year, but sees future swings coming slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Risk appetite returns in stages. It leaves on a horse but comes back on foot," said Kathleen Hughes, head of global liquidity EMEA at JPMorgan Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the Reuters Fund Summit in Luxembourg on Tuesday that her firm's money market funds had seen a 125 percent increase in investment flows between summer 2007 and the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It outstripped the industry's 29 percent growth, she said, and included some $85 billion alone in 2008's fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of this was due to investors fleeing falling equity markets and other assets being hit by what is being dubbed "The Great Recession."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hughes said there were now some signs that investors were moving away from the most conservative areas. Within her money markets funds, for example, demand for short-dated U.S. Treasuries and other government-guaranteed paper had fallen off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Treasury fund is nearly half the size that it was," Hughes said. "You might be able to take that as a sign."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand for such investments -- very short-term guaranteed paper, not to confused with longer-dated bonds -- had been so great that JPMorgan Asset Management actually closed its Treasury money market segment to new investment for a while. There was too much demand for too little supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were being hoarded," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the segment has now been reopened as demand dropped off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Treasury fund hit its peak the same time that Libor (did)," she said, referring to the London Interbank Offered Rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That rate, which reflects among other things banks' trust in each other to repay short-term loans, shot higher last year but has since dropped well back as central banks have cut interest rates and pumped money into the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly it was a difficult situation when trust had completely broken down and banks had stopped lending to each other," Hughes said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that it was a healthy trend that Libor had now come down, "But you never want to forget about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(To read Reuters Global Investing Blog click here; for the MacroScope Blog click on blogs.reuters.com/macroscope; for Hedge Fund Hub click on blogs.reuters.com/hedgehub)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is asking investors in its $15 billion private equity fund for approval to shift much of its remaining uninvested money into distressed debt, the Financial Times reported on its website late on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Given the dislocation we are facing in the credit markets, we believe the ability to achieve private equity-like returns at an even more senior position in the capital structure provides a significant opportunity for the fund," the paper cited the bank as telling investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the $9 billion remaining in the fund, Goldman plans to allocate $4.5 billion to stressed and distressed investments and increase open market purchases of both debt and equity securities from 10 to 25 percent of total commitments, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another $1.5 billion will go to firms that Goldman already owns in part to help them buy their own debt, the paper said, adding that only $3 billion will go to buy-outs, originally the only mission of the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has invested $2 billion in the fund, including an additional $500 million injected recently, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months, many private equity firms have quietly shifted their focus to buying debt at a discount as they are unable to pay for acquisitions with cheap flexible debt as they could during the boom years, according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ajay Kamalakaran in Bangalore, Editing by Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Investment bank Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) plans to spend part of its $20.3 billion private
equity fund on acquiring distressed debt, a source familiar with
the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Of the $9 billion yet to be invested, Goldman plans to put
$4.5 billion into stressed and distressed investments, and
increase purchases of debt and equity securities to 25 percent
of total commitments from 10 percent, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity firms have started to look for alternative
ways of spending their investors' money, including buying
company debt trading at steep discounts, as the traditional
leveraged buy-out market has ground to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leon Black, founder of U.S. firm Apollo Management
[APOLO.UL], said last month he would focus his $14.8 billion
fund on credit-oriented investments for the next 18 months in
the absence of traditional buyout deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity buyers can either hold the investment to
maturity in the hope achieving private-equity-like net returns
in the region of 20 percent, or try and take control of
companies when they breach banking covenants.

ECI Finds Molson Coors, Coca-Cola, Intel &amp; Rio Tinto Are Forming Community Partnerships to Ensure Secure Water Supply</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;Nearly Half of the World's People Will Be Living in Areas of Acute Water
Shortage by 2030, the United Nations Has Warned 
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
A guide to water footprinting, ethics and supply security published by Ethical
Corporation Institute (ECI) discovered that some corporations are committed to
working with communities to maintain a safe and secure water supply. 

ECI has noticed increased worldwide concern about water and how corporations are
using or abusing it. Protesters at the World Water Forum, Istanbul accused the
forum of being nothing more than a platform for water privatization, and shouted
"water for life, not for profit," Reuters television showed. There is also a
Residents March Against Water Privatization planned for March 22 in Los Angeles.


In a new research report, The must-have guide to water ethics, footprinting,
programmes and supply security, the ECI analyses water strategies of big firms
who are leading the way in water management. These include firms such Rio Tinto,
SAB Miller, Coca-Cola, Intel and Molson Coors. 

ECI`s report shows big companies are taking water security seriously. Kristina
Ringwood the Principal Advisor, Environment, Rio Tinto, interviewed in this
report, notes: "We needed to make better decisions, going beyond net present
value to account for environmental and social values of water." 

Rio Tinto`s water stewardship programme is already showing a return: "based on
our track record, we are getting new access to water" says Kristina Ringwood.

&lt;p&gt;  TOKYO, Mar 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and researchers from the Chiba Cancer Center Research
Institute and Chiba University in Japan are launching a new World
Community Grid project to discover a drug treatment for neuroblastoma,
the most common cause of death in children with solid tumors. Cancer is a
leading cause of death in children.

    The cause of neuroblastoma is unknown, but most physicians believe that it
is an accidental cell growth that occurs during normal development of the
sympathetic ganglia and adrenal glands. It occurs most often the first two
years of a child's life, and has a high risk for disease relapse with
survival rates less than 40 percent.

    The rapid advancement of genetic research at Chiba Cancer Center Research
Institute holds great promise for treating neuroblastoma. The new Help
Fight Childhood Cancer project uses the idle computational power from
volunteers' computers to identify which of the three million potential
drug candidates prohibit growth of three proteins believed to be key in
the progression of the cancer. This project could help build smarter
health systems by delivering better drug treatments that could empower
individuals to customize or target their therapies and treatment plans.

    "Our promising research will be further advanced by the free computing
power we will use from World Community Grid," said Dr. Akira Nakagawara,
the principal investigator at the Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute.
"It would take us about 100 years using our own computing resources to
make progress, but with access to one of the world's largest virtual
supercomputers, we estimate to complete this project in 2 years, and begin
laboratory trials."

    Dr. Nakagawara recently earned the Princess Takamatsu Cancer Research Fund
Prize 2008 for his neuroblastoma research. In his work, he discovered that
one protein, TrkB, is expressed at high levels in aggressive
neuroblastomas, and enhances the tumor cell's growth. World Community Grid
will conduct complex chemistry simulations of the drug candidates to see
which ones bond to TrkB, ALK and SCxx, so that those can be tested further
in the laboratory. All results will be made available to the general
scientific community to advance the field of cancer biology and drug
discovery.

    "We have the potential to find a drug treatment for one of the most common
childhood cancers in our lifetime, and it's the volunteers who sign up to
allow their computers to be used coupled with innovative grid technology
that can make the difference," said Stanley S. Litow, Vice President, IBM,
Corporate Citizenship and Corporate Affairs and President of the IBM
International Foundation. "World Community Grid has been an innovative
resource for researchers who have promising projects yet lack the funding
and availability to the world's largest supercomputers."

    "Signing up with World Community Grid is an easy and free way to join
almost a million devices around the world being used to help researchers
join the fight against cancer. We need everyone's help to win the war
against pediatric cancer and joining World Community Grid is making a
difference," said Melissa Helms, co-founder of the Pediatric Cancer
Foundation. "The fact that the results of the research being conducted
must be shared may help create a collaborative effort among scientists
worldwide."

    World Community Grid is the largest public humanitarian grid in existence
with more than 430,000 members who represent more than 200 countries and
links to more than 1.2 million computers. It has recently provided 250
million results, that's just under 2 results every second. It is the
volunteers that help make the difference because as each one shares their
computer time, scientists are able to conduct their research faster.
For
example,


--  Nutritious Rice for the World has already returned 12 million
transactions and 11,000 years of compute time.
--  AfricanClimate@Home just completed its data collection and research
analysis will now begin.
--  Help Defeat Cancer proved its more accurate technique for identifying
cancer and received a $2.5 million grant from NIH to further deploy its
system.
--  FightAIDS@Home has identified over 40 potential drug candidates and is
proceeding with laboratory work on these.
--  Discovering Dengue Drugs Together has identified potential antiviral
compounds and is continuing with laboratory work on those.

    
To become of member of World Community Grid and donate unused computer
time, individuals register on www.worldcommunitygrid.org and install a
free, small, secure software program onto their computers. When computers
are idle, data is requested from World Community Grid's server. These
computers then perform the computations, and send the results back to the
server, prompting it for a new piece of work. A screen saver will tell
individuals when their computers are being used.

&lt;p&gt;HARROGATE, England--(Business Wire)--
Arrow Enterprise Computing Solutions' DNS Arrow group has been chosen as the

to deliver savings on power consumption, infrastructure and operational costs.
DNS Arrow has continually been a leading distributor for IBM and we are pleased
to work with them as the first U.K. distributor," said Greg Scorziello, director
of XIV business, IBM, Northeast Europe. 

DNS Arrow has been working closely with IBM throughout the early adoption scheme
for XIV. It is the first distributor to have a demonstration unit that will help
resellers and their customers see the simplicity of the XIV and its immediate
benefits. 

"XIV is an outstanding product and DNS Arrow has been working closely with IBM
to ensure that the product gets off to a flying start," said Lindsay Nichol,
divisional director for IBM solutions at DNS Arrow U.K. "We have everything in
place to deliver quality, efficiency and added value right from the beginning."

enterprise-class solutions and services focused on data storage, network
security, enterprise software, virtualisation and access infrastructure. DNS
Arrow supports resellers from initial consultation, planning and design through
engineering to implementation so they can deliver greater value and increase
their customers' competitive edge.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, March 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is
set to publicly launch Internet Explorer 8 early on Thursday,
the latest version of its market-dominating web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The application, an integral part of Microsoft's eagerly
awaited Windows 7 operating system, can be downloaded from
Microsoft's Website from 9 a.m. Pacific time, free for people
using licensed Microsoft operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IE8, as it is commonly referred to, has been in public beta
testing for about a year, but Thursday's launch marks its full
public rollout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's largest software company, said IE8
will run with Windows Vista, its latest operating system, and
also Windows XP, the previous version which some users still
prefer over Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The application replaces IE7, which has a lock on the
browser market. According to a recent survey by IT consultants
Janco Associates Inc, Internet explorer has a 72.2 percent
market share, ahead of the Mozilla Foundation's Firefox browser
with 17.2 percent. Google Inc's (GOOG.O) new Chrome browser has
only 2.8 percent of the market, while Apple Inc's (AAPL.O)
Safari has less than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has run afoul of U.S. and European antitrust
regulators for bundling its browser with its operating system,
which competitors say is an attempt to drive them out of the
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Google joined Mozilla and Norway's Opera in
protesting Microsoft's dominance in the browser market. In
January, European regulators brought formal charges against
Microsoft for abusing its dominant market position by bundling
its Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows operating
system, which is used in 95 percent of the world's personal
computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has already announced that users of Windows 7 --
expected later this year or early next year -- will be able to
turn key programs like Internet Explorer off, making it easier
to use other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New features in IE8 include right-clicking on addresses or
other web features to go straight to a map or put into a blog
or other Website, which Microsoft calls an "accelerator". Users
will also be able to put in keywords in the address bar to
recall sites visited related to that word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new browser also has enhanced security protection, for
example warning users if they are about to download something
from a site known to be a source of malicious software, or
"malware".

Many were nervous about losing jobs at a time the United States is going through its worst economic contraction in over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The feeling is mixed, right?

I'm sure there's something else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors too have questioned Sun's worth. The firm has seen its stock sink more than 70 percent in the past year alone. That downward spiral belied the firm's meteoric ascent of the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun began life in 1982. One year later, it signed a $40 million contract with manufacturers.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems Inc, sources with knowledge of the matter said, a move that could bolster the technology giant against rivals in the high-end computer server and software markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp is offering to pay at least $6.5 billion in cash, The Wall Street Journal reported, with the total deal value at about $8 billion, including $1.4 billion of cash on Sun's balance sheet, or $10-$11 per share. That would be more than double Sun's Tuesday's close of $4.97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun shares jumped 79 percent to $8.89, while IBM shares fell 1 percent to $91.95. Both companies declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they reach a deal, it would be IBM's largest acquisition and bolster its offering of computer hardware, software and services. Sun also brings in clients from the telecommunications and financial services industry, although sales to both sectors have been battered by the banking crisis and competition with HP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts saw the move as part of a consolidation trend, as Hewlett-Packard Co, IBM and Cisco Systems Inc jostle for control of corporate data centers and compete to supply the high-end computers that power complex corporate transactions and networks, as well as software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My feeling is that the good players with good technology and products will eventually get taken out by the bigger guys who have the means to do it and understand that it's easier to buy them than to mimic them through internal development," said Zach Rosenstock, analyst at Wayne Hummer Wealth Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun has long been cited as a takeover target for IBM, HP, Dell Inc or Cisco, which introduced a comprehensive set of data center products earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's move, as well as Cisco's announcement, could signal a new wave of partnerships in the data center market as companies strive to provide more comprehensive products and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have cited data equipment maker Brocade Communications Systems Inc, infrastructure software maker Citrix Systems Inc and niche network optimization companies, such as Blue Coat Systems Inc and Riverbed Technology Inc, as possible acquisition targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's largest acquisition to date is its $5 billion purchase of Canadian software maker Cognos in 2008. IBM had nearly $13 billion in cash at the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HARDWARE, SOFTWARE FIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun, which rose to prominence in the 1990s, has been searching for a buyer in recent months, according to bankers. While Sun never fully recovered from the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s, when demand for servers cratered, IBM by contrast has grown thanks to its shift to software and services from an increasingly commoditized hardware business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said the challenge of valuing Sun's intertwined software, hardware and services businesses could put off potential buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many said that Sun would be a good buy for IBM as it could position the company to spring back strongly once the economy recovers, even if it the acquisition means a temporary hit to gross margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are buying in the heart of a downturn. That's generally smart thing," said SP Equity analyst Tom Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from bolstering market share in data centers, seen as a key area of growth as Internet traffic and energy costs rise, IBM and Sun would certainly up the ante in rivalry with HP and leave Dell in a weaker position, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM was the top server supplier in the fourth quarter, with a market share of 36.3 percent, according to market researcher IDC. HP has 29.0 percent, followed by Dell with 10.6 percent, Sun with 9.3 percent, and Fujitsu Ltd with 4.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These five vendors all posted declines in fourth-quarter server revenue, hurt by pullbacks in corporate spending. The Wall Street Journal said HP had declined to buy Sun, citing a person briefed on the matter. HP declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said IBM and Sun both had spent several years reinventing themselves by shifting their focus from hardware to software and services. Sun has been expanding production of Linux-based computers, although that endeavor failed to revive its stock price and the company has been shedding up to 6,000 jobs, or 18 percent of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this merger is announced, it will require careful, extensive review by antitrust authorities because of the wide range of tech products both companies now produce.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon received about $19.7 million in total compensation for 2008, down from about $34 million in 2007, the company revealed in materials filed with U.S. regulators ahead of its annual shareholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay and perks for bank executives has come under increasing scrutiny since the U.S. government first injected capital into banks in October and several shareholder proposals included in the materials focused on the issue of compensation for executives at JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's total compensation included a salary of $1 million, unchanged from 2007 and stock and options that had been awarded in previous years valued at about $18.2 million, according to the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some pay consultants and governance experts tabulate executive pay differently, noting the summary total reported to the SEC may be imperfect because it counts options and stock awarded in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon received no new stock or option awards in 2008 and he not receive a cash bonus. JPMorgan received $25 billion in government funds late last year and Dimon, along with other bank executives that testified before Congress in February, said he would not receive a bonus because of the government's cash injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other benefits recorded in the filing, Dimon's use of aircraft was valued at almost $54,000 and his use of cars at $89,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also urged the rejection of eight shareholder proposals on matters such as executive compensation, including bonuses, credit card lending practices and procedures for electing directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank will hold its annual meeting May 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by Carol Bishopric and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inlet Products Power Optimized Experience for Online Video Consumers
RALEIGH, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Inlet Technologies, a leader in advanced encoding solutions for new media,
announced today full support for Microsoft Internet Information Services 7.0
(IIS7) Smooth Streaming technology. Both live events and video on demand content
benefit from the quality and scalability advantages of Smooth Streaming, and
Inlet Technologies is the first encoding technology provider to announce support
of this new platform. Microsoft Corp. and Inlet will demonstrate live Smooth
Streaming in action this week at the MIX09 conference put on by Microsoft. 

Smooth Streaming is Microsoft`s new HTTP-based adaptive streaming platform, an
advanced media delivery method that switches seamlessly between multiple
streams, depending on the available bandwidth and PC performance at any given
moment. The best possible quality video stream is automatically delivered to the
end user without stuttering, dropped frames or buffering. While the Smooth
Streaming process itself is completely invisible to the end user, it results in
a much improved user experience. It also offers broadcasters the ability to
offer true HD (720p+) streams to clients who have sufficient bandwidth without
alienating those with lower speed connections. 

Inlet is the first encoding solutions provider to announce support for Smooth
Streaming for live streaming and video on demand applications. These solutions
are ideal for a wide variety of media companies wanting to stream a range of
high quality content, including sports, news, and special events. Both Inlet`s
SpinnakerTM family of live streaming appliances and ArmadaTM automated VoD
management system have built-in support for Smooth Streaming. 

"Microsoft is dedicated to improving all aspects of online video, for both
consumers and media companies, but we can`t do it alone. We work closely with
industry leading partners such as Inlet to help make Smooth Streaming a truly
open platform and to make it as easy as possible for media companies to migrate
to it," explained Steve Sklepowich, group product manager for Silverlight at
Microsoft. 

"We are excited to have yet another `first` under our belt, with this support
for Microsoft Smooth Streaming," said Neal Page, Inlet Technologies CEO. "Inlet
is committed to improving all aspects of the online video business by applying
advanced technology solutions to real-world applications. Smooth Streaming is a
significant leap forward, and presents a compelling opportunity to help media
companies improve the quality of online video for all of their customers."

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Mar 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Demonstrating the strength of their corporate brands, the top two spots
on CoreBrand's 2008 Corporate Branding Index (http://tinyurl.com/dc94mu)
have remained unchanged since 2004, with The Coca-Cola Company, first,
and Johnson &amp; Johnson, second.

    Harley-Davidson moved up one place to 3rd replacing Hershey Foods, which
is now in 4th. Campbell Soup moved up one spot to 5th place replacing
Hallmark, which is now 6th. UPS remained unchanged in 7th.
Colgate-Palmolive moved up one spot to 8th, replacing FedEx which is now
in 9th place.

    "The current economic crisis is not a brand crisis. Corporate brands
remain strong in the face of the downturn," said James Gregory, CEO,
CoreBrand (www.CoreBrand.com). "However, some strong brands are being run
over by the economy because brands are not stronger than the underlying
financials of a corporation (e.g. GE has a relatively strong brand but
has significant financial exposure so the brand is hurting)."

    Kudos to Kellogg's!

    Of the top ten, only Kellogg Company (10th place) has shown significant
growth rising from 15th in 2007 and from 21st place in 2005.

    In 12th place, and moving up quickly, is BMW, which held 16th place in
2007 and 28th in 2005. Other big winners in the Brand Power Rankings are
Bayer, which moved into 17th place from 27th in 2007 and 45th in 2005.
St. Jude Medical has moved up steadily to 28th in 2008 from 59th place in
2005, although it is unclear what is driving St. Jude's growing brand
power.

    Visa and MasterCard have both moved up steadily since 2005. Visa is now
23rd up from 36th in 2007 and 44th in 2005. MasterCard is 31st up from
44th in 2007 and 57th in 2005. "This is an interesting horserace as both
companies gallop toward the top of the list," said CoreBrand's Gregory.
Interestingly, American Express, which is never one to rest on its
laurels, is in 11th place this year up from 13th in 2007 and 16th in 2005.

    Toiletries and cosmetics companies continue to see improvements. Revlon
has rallied steadily from 61st place in 2005 to 33rd in 2008. L'Oreal has
progressed steadily from 89th place in 2005 to 52nd in 2008. Likewise,
Estee Lauder has shown big gains moving up from 60th in 2005 to 34th in
2008.

    Starbucks had a notable loss as it dropped from 10th place in 2007 to 14th
place in 2008. This isn't a major surprise since its latest publicity has
focused on store closings and competitive pressures.

    PepsiCo has also been dropping at an alarming rate from 4th place in 2005
to 11th place in 2007 to 18th place in 2008. Let's hope its new corporate
identity program will generate some fizz in its corporate brand.

    General Electric is losing steam dropping from 12th place in 2005 to 17th
place in 2007 to 24th place in 2008. It is clear that GE's significant
Olympic campaign didn't help to bolster its corporate brand. This is proof
that the brand cannot offset financial turmoil.

    Other major losers are Procter &amp; Gamble, which has dropped steadily from
31st place in 2005 to 39th place in 2008. General Motors has also dropped
steadily from 30th place in 2005 to 41st place in 2008.

    Apparel was a mixed bag. While Levi Strauss has dropped significantly and
steadily from 20th place in 2005 to 38th place in 2007 to 49th place in
2008, Fruit of the Loom moved up from 83rd place in 2005 to 43rd in 2008.
Tommy Hilfiger improved from 88th place in 2005 to 65th in 2008.

    Microsoft was the headliner in last year's Brand Power Rankings. It should
be noted that over the past year Microsoft has made a significant effort
to bolster its corporate brand. One can argue that the campaign was poorly
focused, but the end result is that Microsoft has checked the bleeding of
its brand and has actually improved somewhat. In 2005 Microsoft ranked
26th place, dropped 28 spots to 59th place in 2007, and then in 2008
improved to 54th place. The challenge of reclaiming a corporate brand
that is plummeting like a rock cannot be overstated.

    Apple, which was mentioned last year in my Fox Business broadcast as the
nemesis of Microsoft because of Apple's tremendously effective "I'm a Mac,
I'm a PC" campaign, continues to grow its corporate brand. Apple's
corporate brand is now in 91st place; this is up from 119th place in 2007
and 128th in 2005.


 "Last year there were many articles discussing how
Apple should have been ranked as one of the top brands, but our Brand
Power Ranking didn't place the technology giant in the top 100," said
Gregory. "Everyone should be reminded that our study focuses on corporate
brands, not product brands. While Apple brand zealots rate it with very
high favorability, there are many more who don't feel as strongly about
the Apple corporate brand. Nevertheless, Apple is doing very well indeed."

    Methodology

    The Corporate Branding Index(R), a quantitative research study among
business decision makers in the USA, has been conducted continuously since
1990 with 1,200 companies across 49 industries. Over 12,000 surveys are
completed annually. CoreBrand's Brand Power rankings are based upon the
"familiarity" and "favorability" of these business decision makers toward
the corporate reputation of these companies.

    This report is not a consumer popularity poll but rather a study of how
corporate brands influence the attitudes of business leaders to do
business with each other, to attract investors, partners, B2B customers,
and ultimately the impact they have on market capitalization.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings places 23 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp., series 2007-LDP10, commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates, on Rating Watch Negative as follows: 

--$200.7 million class A-J 'AAA'; 

--$145.8 million class A-JS 'AAA'; 

--$100 million class A-JFL 'AAA'; 

--$71.8 million class B 'AA'; 

--$34.8 million class B-S 'AA'; 

--$26.9 million class C 'AA-'; 

--$13.1 million class C-S 'AA-'; 

--$49.4 million class D 'A'; 

--$23.9 million class D-S 'A'; 

--$40.4 million class E 'A-'; 

--$19.6 million class E-S 'A-'; 

--$44.9 million class F 'BBB+'; 

--$21.8 million class F-S 'BBB+'; 

--$44.9 million class G 'BBB-'; 

--$21.8 million class G-S 'BBB-'; 

--$40.4 million class H 'BB'; 

--$19.6 million class H-S 'BB'; 

--$20 million class J 'BB-'; 

--$20 million class K 'B'; 

--$13.3 million class L 'B-'; 

--$6.7 million class M 'B-'; 

--$6.7 million class N 'CCC/DR1'; 

--$13.3 million class P 'CCC/DR1'. 

The Rating Watch Negative placements on classes A-J through P are due to the
transfer of the seventh largest loan (2.6%), Solana, to special servicing in
March 2009, as well as recent transfers to special servicing of two additional
loans (1.5%). Fitch has also revised loss expectations for one loan (0.9%) that
was specially serviced at last review. In total, there are ten loans in special
servicing (6.7%). 

Solana is secured by a 1.9 million square foot (sf) mixed-use property located
in Westlake, TX. The property contains office, retail, and hotel components. The
loan transferred to special servicing when the sponsor requested payment relief.
As of June 2008, the servicer reported a debt service coverage ratio of 1.88
times (x) and occupancy of 98%. The loan is divided into two pari passu pieces
with the A-2 portion securitized in this transaction and the $220 million A-1
portion securitized in the BACM 2007-1 transaction. 

Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Watch status of these classes as more
information on the potential workout and valuation of the assets becomes
available.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - IBM is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems Inc for at least $6.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported, in a deal that could bolster their computer server products against rivals such as Hewlett-Packard Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would translate into a premium of about 100 percent over Sun's Nasdaq closing price Tuesday of $4.97 a share, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun, which was not immediately available for comment, has long been cited as a takeover target for International Business Machines Corp, HP, Dell Inc or Cisco Systems Inc, which this week unveiled its plan to start making blade servers that power corporate computer networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bankers and analysts have also said the challenge of valuing Sun's intertwined software, hardware and services businesses could put off potential buyers. The company has never fully recovered from the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, when demand for its high-end servers cratered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes sense in an industry consolidation view, but looking at Sun's performance over the last couple of years, it's not one of my top picks for IBM to buy," said Jyske Bank analyst Robert Jakobsen, speaking from Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having said that, there's clearly a huge synergy combining these two companies," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will lessen the competitive pressure within the data center," he said, adding, "The market hasn't been kind to Sun Microsystems in the last 12 months. So it's not an expensive acquisition in my view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IBM spokesman in Bangalore declined to comment. The U.S. representatives of the company, which had nearly $13 billion in cash at the end of 2008, were not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt shares of Sun rose 54 percent after The Wall Street Journal's online report, which said the company had approached a number of large tech companies in the hopes of being acquired. HP declined the offer, the paper said, citing a person briefed on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper said a deal with IBM could happen as early as this week, but that talks could also fall apart. If IBM buys Sun, it would be the company's largest acquisition since it bought Canadian software maker Cognos for about $5 billion in January 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLOBAL IT SPENDING CUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM was the world's largest maker of servers in the fourth quarter, with a market share of 36.3 percent, according to market researcher IDC. HP came next with 29.0 percent, followed by Dell, 10.6 percent; Sun, 9.3 percent; and Fujitsu, 4.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top five server vendors all posted declines in their fourth-quarter server revenue, hurt by pullbacks in corporate spending on technology due to the weak global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco's new foray into the server market could trigger a wave of mergers and acquisitions, analysts have said, citing data equipment maker Brocade Communications Systems Inc, infrastructure software maker Citrix Systems Inc and niche network optimization companies, such as Blue Coat Systems Inc and Riverbed Technology Inc, as possible targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about the fact that IBM wants to become a one-stop shop for all IT related offerings, whether it is hardware, software services or solutions," Avinash Vashistha, chief executive at IT consultancy Tholons Inc, said of IBM's reported interest in Sun. "They have been executing this strategy for the last few years and with the Sun deal, they will only accelerate that move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun, whose name stands for Stanford University Network, rose to prominence in the 1990s when start-ups flocked to its high-end computers, which run on its Solaris operating system and have been widely used in the financial services industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Internet bubble burst in 2000-01, funding for start-ups dried up along with much of the demand for Sun's computers. Sun tried to reinvent itself by acquiring companies and expanding production of Linux-based computers, which tend to be cheaper. But that failed to revive its stock price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun stock is down 71 percent in the last 52 weeks, a far cry from an all-time high of $258.75 that it touched during the dot-com boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company -- which is shedding up to 6,000 jobs, or 18 percent of its workforce -- reported a net loss of $209 million for its second quarter ended December 28, compared with year-earlier net profit of $260 million. Revenue fell 11 percent to $3.22 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said technology companies were looking to acquisitions as organic growth was difficult given the poor economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plus, valuations are also very cheap now," said Tarun Sisodia, a technology sector analyst with Indian brokerage Anand Rathi Financial Services. "It's a good time to pick up the companies that can contribute to your growth in these difficult times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ajay Kamalakaran and Sumeet Chatterjee; Writing by Tiffany Wu and Hans Peters; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vancity Visa Sends Environmentally Friendly Message with ecoEnvelopesTM
VANCOUVER--(Business Wire)--
Vancity Visa* is "greening" some of its mail with a pilot program that uses
reusable ecoEnvelopes, a first in Canada. ecoEnvelopes are two-way envelopes
that enable mailers to use one reusable envelope instead of two traditional
envelopes, eliminating the need for business reply envelopes. The pilot is for
Vancity Visa`s business reply envelopes and the goal is to replace all of its
envelopes with ecoEnvelopes over time. 

This new initiative supports Vancity Visa`s environmental commitment. In 2007
alone, 37 million business reply mail items were used in Canada. The new
ecoEnvelopes eliminate these business reply envelopes in mailings, making a
significant contribution to reducing the number of envelopes that are discarded
each year. 

"We have an ongoing commitment to our members and to the environment and
continue to look for new and creative ways to help both. The piloting of this
new ecoEnvelope is just another small way we are doing our part," said Richard
Robins, Director, Marketing &amp; Business Development for Visa Card Products,
Vancity and Citizens Bank of Canada. 

To use, Vancity members open the envelope by tearing along a tab on the back
flap. Addressees can then simply turn around the business reply insert so that
the reply address and postal permit appear in the envelope window. A wider flap
enables the envelope to be sealed once again, eliminating the need to use a
second envelope. 

TBWA\Vancouver, the advertising agency for Vancity Visa, first heard of
ecoEnvelopes from Hawton Ink, a Vancouver printer. TBWA\Vancouver worked with
Vancity Visa to adapt the ecoEnvelope to Canadian standards, and worked closely
with Canada Post to obtain certification for the envelopes and achieve the
appropriate Canadian postal requirements. 

The ecoEnvelope was invented in the United States by ecoEnvelopes. Vancity
manufactured and printed the ecoEnvelopes in B.C. using recycled post-consumer
content and biodegradable vegetable-based inks. The window is made from a new
generation of polystyrene engineered to degrade in common disposal environments.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Partner Health Language Are Facilitating Collaboration Through Use
of a Common User Interface (CUI) to Standardize Solutions That Enhance Patient
Care and Safety
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia--(Business Wire)--
Microsoft Corp and the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society
(HIMSS) announced the launch of the Microsoft Health Users Group (MS-HUG) in
Asia-Pacific, providing regional healthcare organizations and technology
partners with access to an online forum to facilitate the development of
healthcare solutions. 

The MS-HUG forum is a venue for influencers and developers of healthcare
technology solutions to collaborate and contribute to aspects of solutions built
on Microsoft software platforms. It allows the healthcare technology community
to discover new uses for existing technology, provide development support,
network with peers, and to discuss needs and desires arising from the current
use of healthcare IT. It is currently accessible to healthcare organisations and
technology partners in North America, Europe, Middle-East and Africa (EMEA). 

"Extending Microsoft HUG to the APAC healthcare community provides an expanded
forum for collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and experience across a
growing ecosystem of health organisations and technology partners," says Gabe
Rijpma, Health Industry Director at Microsoft Asia Pacific. "Collaboration
enables the ecosystem to better demonstrate how technology can help solve
healthcare challenges in the region and improve health costs, quality, and
access for citizens." The forum is designed to allow technology partners to gain
insight into healthcare specific requirements, improve their ability to target
technology innovation, help health organisations improve service delivery, and
achieve a stronger return on technology investments. "This is brought about by
sharing knowledge with others in the MS-HUG community who have overcome similar
challenges," Rijpma says. 

After several successful years of collaboration, MS-HUG`s diverse membership has
grown to include more than 5,000 members and 31 corporate supporters across
North America, Europe, Middle-East and Africa (EMEA). This community is united
by a shared interest in implementing vendor- and user-developed software based
on Microsoft technology to improve healthcare quality and efficiency, while
reducing complexity and cost. 

Steven Yeo, Vice President, and Executive Director for HIMSS Asia Pacific,
offered his view on MS-HUG`s contribution to healthcare in APAC: "MS-HUG enables
us to further promote our mission to lead change in the healthcare information
and management systems field through knowledge sharing, advocacy, collaboration,
innovation, and community affiliation. Our goal is to drive better patient care,
and this is another step in that direction." 

Collaborating to improve health care through technology

The launch of MS-HUG in Asia-Pacific supports Microsoft`s vision of improving
healthcare outcomes for citizens. "Our priority is to enable better and further
collaboration between technology and people to break down the information
barriers that exist between the disparate IT environments across the healthcare
and pharmaceutical industries," says Rijpma. "Through solution accelerators that
enable interoperability in key areas such as secure messaging, clinical
information worker and clinical data manipulation, we can enable solutions that
are otherwise not available to existing healthcare IT environments. 

"One of our most prominent projects for healthcare globally is the Microsoft
Common User Interface (CUI): a set of components that developers can use to
create healthcare applications. Recently we have released several new components
including a terminology component incorporating `Standardised Nomenclature of
Medicine` (SNOMED) services. This project serves as an example of how
Microsoft`s philosophy of knowledge-driven health can combine with the expertise
of our partner, in this case Health Language, to produce positive outcomes,"
said Werner van Huffel, Industry Technology Strategist for Healthcare, Microsoft
Asia Pacific. 

HealthLanguage, a US-based health IT applications developer, shares Microsoft`s
vision. Speaking at the launch of MS-HUG, Marc Horowitz, Senior Vice-President,
Health Language Inc., said: "The diverse nature of health care requires partners
to collaborate effectively to respond to the various needs of professionals
involved. By offering healthcare professionals the ability to simply, quickly,
and accurately enter and access clinical information, this combination of
technologies supports both companies' shared goal of providing easy-to-use,
standardized solutions that enhance patient care and safety." 

The Microsoft HUG APAC community, hosted within the existing Microsoft HUG site
(http://www.mshug.org), will give members access to a resource that connects
solutions, experts and peers to a wider sphere of influence and education.
Members receive the following benefits:

* Access to the latest solutions and technology from leading minds at Microsoft
and independent industry experts 
* A forum for voicing opinions, learning from peers and helping shape the future
of healthcare IT 
* Opportunities to network with professionals who can enhance careers 
* Online interaction to help professionals connect with others

With the launch of the APAC community, Microsoft and HIMSS believe they will be
able to strengthen their commitment to serve the healthcare industry through a
shared strategic vision - to provide industry leadership, drive appropriate
standards, and develop associated requirements in support of healthcare
solutions.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, March 18 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola's (KO.N) said on
Wednesday it will not proceed with a planned $2.4 billion
acquisition of top juice maker Huiyuan Juice (1886.HK) after the
Chinese government declined to approval for the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We are disappointed, but we also respect the MOC's
decision," said Muhtar Kent, president and chief executive
officer of Coca-Cola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition by Coca-Cola would have been the largest
ever takeover of a Chinese company by a foreign rival, and is
the latest rebuff for an overseas buyer of a Chinese company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's Ministry of Commerce said on Wednesday the deal
would have been bad for competition and that Coca-Cola's changes
to the deal were insufficient to allay its concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola is holding a long-term view of the China market
and will now focus on growing its existing brands and continuing
to innovate with new brands, Kent said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Alison Leung; editing by Elaine Hardcastle)

were little changed on Wednesday as a report that IBM (IBM.N)
was in talks to buy computer maker Sun Microsystems JAVA.O
offset caution before the Federal Reserve's policy decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun Micro shares jumped more than 60 percent to $8.02
before the bell after the Wall Street Journal reported that
International Business Machines Corp, a Dow component, could
buy the company for at least $6.5 billion. For details, see
[ID:nBNG479364]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Tech has pretty much outperformed the market. Anytime you

"It's a positive that somebody is finding value, but at the

added 2.50 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A day after the market made another advance following the
12-year lows reached earlier this month, investors were also
fretting about the fallout from the mounting furor over bonuses
paid to executives of embattled insurer American International
Group (AIG.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given that the AIG bonus situation has caused a political
stir, it appears the administration is losing focus on the real
problem which is getting the economy back on track," said
Bakhos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Obama administration has turned up the heat on AIG,
saying the insurer will be forced to repay U.S. taxpayers
before it gets another bailout of $30 billion. Its chief
executive is due to testify before a Congressional panel on
Wednesday. [ID:nN17316873]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the policy front, Wednesday marks the conclusion of the
Federal Reserve's 2-day policy-setting meeting. With the U.S.
central bank having cut interest rates close to zero,
investors' focus will be on whether it would commit itself to
buy long-dated government debt as an additional measure to
revive the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fed's statement on the meeting is due around 2:15 p.m.
(1815 GMT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The economic calendar also includes the release of the
February Consumer Price Index at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stocks surged on Tuesday as an unexpected leap in
housing starts pushed Home Depot and other retailers higher
while bullish comments from a broker on Cisco Systems helped
technology shares rebound.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group(AIG.N) funneled over $90 billion of taxpayer bailout funds to various U.S. and European banks, but the biggest beneficiary was politically connected Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suspicions of potential conflicts of interest and favoritism have been fueled by $12.9 billion AIG paid to Goldman Sachs -- where then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson had previously worked as chief executive -- in the months after the insurer was rescued by the government last September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, for its part, has insisted it did not need the bailout money because it was "always fully collateralized and hedged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long Wall Street's largest investment bank before it recently became a bank holding company, Goldman answered a series of questions from Reuters about the bailout funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can say that our notional exposure to AIG is a fraction of what it was at the time of the September bailout," Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked why Goldman Sachs took $12.9 billion of taxpayer money if it was collateralized and hedged on its AIG positions, DuVally said it was because AIG was not allowed to fail, so Goldman did not get money from hedges that would have paid out if the insurer had collapsed. And, he said, under the terms of its contracts with AIG, Goldman was entitled to collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuVally also said the bank does extensive due diligence on all its counterparties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much Goldman and other counterparties received from AIG has been just one of several flashpoints over the taxpayer rescue of what was once the world's largest insurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG has also infuriated politicians -- including U.S. President Barack Obama -- with its plan to pay $165 million in bonuses to employees at the unit at the heart of its problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the payments to counterparties like Goldman Sachs dwarfed the bonuses, and some experts contend that these companies should have been made to share some of the losses resulting from the giant insurance firm's near collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People see that the guys that ruined AIG are getting paid more money, and that creates outrage," said Porter Stansberry, managing director of Stansberry  Associates Investment Research. "If you want to be outraged, be outraged that the counterparties got paid out full value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was not the only large bank with exposure to AIG. The list of counterparties that AIG disclosed on Sunday included others that got large sums. Goldman was followed by Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) with $11.9 billion, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) with $11.8 billion and Barclays PLC (BARC.L) with $8.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the AIG disclosures are still incomplete in that they do not include payments to the banks since December 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are looking at a small piece of it right here. So what is the total exposure? That's the question. And then the issue is, well, if that was wiped out what would it do to Goldman's capital?" said Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is obvious that firms underestimated the counterparty risk. That was their mistake," Harvey said. "Yet they are getting bailouts of U.S. taxpayer money. Why should we pay for their mistake?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an editorial on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal pointed to Goldman's claim that "all of its AIG bets were adequately hedged and that it needed no 'bailout.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why take $13 billion then? This needless cover-up is one reason Americans are getting angrier as they wonder if Washington is lying to them about these bailouts," the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout has stirred resentment not just in the U.S. Congress, but on Wall Street, where investors have speculated that Goldman and its connections helped it get a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, many former Goldman executives have moved into government. Paulson left Goldman in 2006 as chief executive. The chairman of the New York Federal Reserve is former Goldman Chairman Steve Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The person that should be subpoenaed is Hank Paulson. How do you go from running Goldman Sachs in '05 and '06 and making all of these bets with AIG's financial products unit and then end up in the government guaranteeing those bets and not have a conflict of interest?" Stansberry asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuVally said Goldman Sachs was not party to any discussions about the bailout of AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paritosh Bansal; Additional reporting by Lilla Zuill and Kevin Drawbaugh; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For more MA news and our DealZone blog, go to www.reuters.com/deals)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  OAKVILLE, ON, Mar 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
D-Link Canada, the end-to-end network solutions provider for consumers
and business, today announced that Microsoft(R) Response Point(TM)
Service Pack 2 (SP2) upgrade is now available for download on D-Link(R)
VoiceCenter(R) phone systems.

    VoiceCenter with Response Point is a feature-rich, cost-effective Voice
over IP (VoIP) phone system that is easy to use and manage, and is ideally
suited for small businesses requiring up to 50 phones and phone lines.

    Among the essential features of the Response Point software are
voice-activated dialing and voicemail access, automated receptionist,
built-in auto-provisioning configuration, call-forwarding, call hold,
find me-follow me, 3-way call conferencing, voicemail-to-email forwarding,
voicemail retrieval over the phone and MS Outlook(R) contact integration.

    VoiceCenter, which is fully-compliant with Microsoft's new Response Point
SP2 and available as a free download at
http://www.microsoft.com/responsepoint/sp2, offers users additional
features that they requested. They include:

    Intercom and Paging

    Among the features most requested are one-way paging and two-way intercom.
One-way paging is possible with the press of a button and the user saying
"page (recipient's name)." Paging can be done to an extension that exists
on multiple phones. Similarly, the press of a button and the user saying
"intercom (recipient's name)" will start a two-way conversation between
user and recipient.

    After Hours Receptionist Settings

    VoiceCenter with SP2 users also can specify times when incoming calls
should be routed to the human receptionist. Outside of these times, calls
will be routed to the Automated Receptionist.

    Remote Office Support

    SP2 removes the single subnet network restriction for phones and the
assistant. Remote offices can be secured through a virtual private network
(VPN), making it possible for small businesses to deploy VoiceCenter to
multiple office locations.

    Parked Call Return

    In SP2, any call that has been parked for three minutes will be
automatically returned to the extension that parked it. If there is no
answer, the call is directed to the auto-attendant or receptionist.

    Personal Contacts Can be Called With Specific Services

    With VoiceCenter and SP2, users can specify the type of call -- analog or
VoIP -- to be used for a particular person. For instance, a company might
prefer that all international calls are made using the VoIP lines.

    Call Forwarding Prompt Now Optional

    In some cases, users do not want call forwarding to be announced. With
SP2, each user can specify whether or not the caller hears an announcement
when forwarding calls.

    Improved Audio

    SP2 now incorporates general audio improvements, resulting in better
performance and accuracy.

    Escape from Voicemail Greeting Before Recording Starts

    Before SP2, a caller would have to hang up in order to attempt to talk
with someone else instead of leaving a message. SP2 allows the external
caller to press "O" while listening to a voicemail greeting and be routed
back into the system or operator (if enabled).

    "The addition of the SP2 upgrade further enables small businesses to
easily supplement their existing phone service with Voice over Internet
Protocol (VoIP) services," said Nick Tidd, vice president, NA Channel
Development, and General Manager, Business Solutions &amp; Broadband Sales
Canada. "Since we introduced VoiceCenter, our customers are more
comfortable with the reliability and quality of service offered by VoIP."

    With IP service in place, and using a simple VoIP account setup wizard in
the Response Point Administrator software, a small business can connect
with Internet telephony service providers (ITSPs) to obtain new VoIP phone
numbers in a matter of minutes. Installing traditional analog lines can
take hours, days or weeks.

    The latest edition of Response Point addresses small businesses' need to
maintain a local presence through the use of a local VoIP phone number.
VoIP providers allow businesses to select a local phone number for use in
remote locations, alleviating costs to the business and customers for
long-distance and toll-free numbers.

    A small business can configure Response Point to route known inbound
callers directly to a particular extension or pool of extensions. It can
furnish a main number or individual employee extensions to ensure that
someone is available -- virtually anytime or anywhere -- for important
customers.

    D-Link VoiceCenter 5-phone kits include IP-PBX (DVX-2000MS), IP phone
(DPH-125MS) and PSTN gateway (DVG-3104MS). The D-Link VoiceCenter phone
handsets feature capabilities including auto discovery, and one-touch
access to parking, retrieving, transferring, voice dialing other employees
and voice dialing personal contacts.

    Other features of the D-Link VoiceCenter with Microsoft Response Point SP2
include SIP or PSTN trunking, DID-based inbound call routing to
extensions, click-to-dial, presence status, a dual-tone multi-frequency
(DTMF) and speech-based auto attendant, user directory, nicknames, simple
live operator access, customizable prompts, and call forwarding through
internal lines. It offers personal computer (PC) contact integration with
Microsoft Outlook, Windows Contact/Address Book.

    Pricing and Availability

    VoiceCenter is now available through D-Link's network of value-added
resellers, solution providers, distributors and the company's online
store, www.dlinkshop.ca. Manufacturer's suggested retail prices for the
VoiceCenter system are: $2,699 for the DVX-2000MS-5 (5 phones), $369 for
the DVG-3104MS 4-port PSTN gateway, and $149 for the DPH-125MS IP phone.
SP1 and product details are available for download at

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) will bid for USJ Co Ltd 2142.T this month to take the operator of Japan's Universal Studios theme park private, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which has a history of taking stakes in Japanese companies to turn them around and sell at a profit, is now targeting USJ in a deal that could be worth more than $610 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of USJ, which runs a park based on movies such as Spiderman and Jurassic Park, turned positive after Reuters reported the news and finished up 4.6 percent at 40,700 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osaka-based USJ is about 40 percent-owned by Crane Holdings Ltd, a Goldman-related fund. Crane will join with two other firms to buy the remaining 60 percent, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tender offer could be announced as early as this week, the sources said. The deal could cost more than 60 billion yen ($610 million), given that USJ's current market value is about 82.6 billion yen and assuming a premium of about 10 billion yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for USJ said no such decision has been made. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Tokyo declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going private allows companies to restructure their operations under the guidance of like-minded shareholders and without the constant pressure that comes with being a publicly listed company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USJ listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in March 2007, but has since been hurt by the global economic downturn, which has even blunted Japan's voracious appetite for cartoon characters and other icons of cute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attendance at the park declined 5 percent during the nine months to the end of December from a year earlier, even as USJ stepped up efforts to bring in more visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income totaled 7.4 billion yen on a non-consolidated basis, down nearly 8 percent from a year earlier. Sales came to 53.6 billion yen, a decline of about 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USJ shares have lost more than half their value since hitting a record high of 90,900 yen in May 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Taro Fuse; Writing by David Dolan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
CNOOC Ltd. (NYSE: CEO), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO), Boston Scientific

the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

CNOOC Bolstering Growth

CNOOC Ltd. (NYSE: CEO) is one of the three oil companies in China and one of the
largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies of the
world. It is the only company permitted to conduct exploration and production
activities with international oil and gas companies off China's shore. 

Our continued favorable view of CNOOC Ltd. ADS reflects the company's positive
production-growth profile, exclusivity in the offshore China region and
lucrative LNG investments. We have, however, lowered our 2008 and 2009 earnings
estimates to reflect a lower commodity-price deck and introduced our 2010
earnings per ADS estimate at $7.52. 

Coke a Hold with Stronger Dollar

The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) has strong soft drink brands, leading market
shares and generates solid cash flow. The company's new CEO, Muhtar Kent, will
continue with Isdell's revitalization plan to deal with the challenges of
continually increasing volume. 

Despite global economic weakness, world-wide volume growth continues, driven by
non-carbonated beverages and international markets, along with incremental
marketing spending of $400 million annually. 

Boston Scientific: Healthy Growth

Boston Scientific Corp. (NYSE: BSX) competes in the cardiovascular, endosurgery
and neuromodulation markets. All 3 segments are experiencing strong sales growth
and should remain relatively insulated from the current economic crisis. 

BSX has historically grown through acquisition, which has led to
earnings-quality concerns. Recent positive news on stents will bode well. Trial
results for Abbott Labs' (NYSE: ABT) XIENCE stent, which BSX markets under a
private label, were positive. And, BSX received U.S. approval to market its
TAXUS Liberte and Express2 stents. 

Sanmina Not Rebounding Yet

Sanmina-SCI (NASDAQ: SANM) is currently struggling with industrywide weakness
and challenging end-market demand. After exiting its PC business, Sanmina has
focused on its core business and margin improvement. 

The company is facing weak demand across its entire end-markets, leading to
disappointing Q109 results. Although Sanmina has improved its cost structure,
topline growth is sluggish and we believe the company will struggle in 2009.

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman sees risk of covenant breach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Company says balance sheet risk depends on solar market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares fall 5.3 percent
 (Adds shares, company spokesman)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OSLO, March 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its rating on
shares in Norwegian solar industry group Renewable Energy Corp
(REC.OL) (REC) to "sell" from "neutral" and put it on its
"conviction list" with a 12-month target of 38 crowns, it said
in a March 17 note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The target price was lowered from a previous 60 crowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in REC fell 5.3 percent to 45.00 crowns at 0845 GMT,
against a 0.7 percent rise in the Oslo bourse main index
.OSEBX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe REC is exposed to significant risks," Goldman
Sachs said in its note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those include: "the worsening solar macro environment;
material risk of a delay and limited earnings contribution from
its new silicon facilities; the strong likelihood of breaches to
existing debt covenants; and potential financial outcomes such
as rights issues to stay below covenant levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If they assume that the market will collapse, then it is
not difficult to argue that," REC spokesman Jon Andre Lokke said
about the specter of covenant breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REC warned last month that its first quarter would be weaker
than a year ago, and said it might under certain circumstances
in 2009 and 2010 face a situation where the net debt to EBITDA
ratio was outside the limits set in credit agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have said that where we earlier had considerable
headroom, several factors have led to less headroom (now),"
Lokke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some are negative to the market and some believe volumes
will remain intact, and that is reflected in the different
analysts' views," he added.

&lt;p&gt;March 18 (Reuters) - International Business Machines (IBM.N)

&lt;p&gt; IBM is likely to pay at least $6.5 billion in cash to
acquire Sun, the people told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would translate into a premium of about 100 percent

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) will bid for USJ Co Ltd 2142.T this month to try to take the operator of Japan's Universal Studios theme park private, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which has a history of taking stakes in Japanese companies to turn them around and sell at a profit, is now targeting USJ, which runs a theme park with rides based on Spiderman and Jurassic Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of USJ turned positive after Reuters reported the news and finished up 4.6 percent at 40,700 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osaka-based USJ is about 40 percent-owned by Crane Holdings Ltd, a Goldman-related fund. Crane, together with two other firms, is looking to buy the remaining 60 percent stake, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tender offer could be announced as early as this week, the sources said. The deal could cost more than 60 billion yen ($609.3 million), given that USJ's current market value is about 82.6 billion yen and assuming a premium of about 10 billion yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USJ listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in March 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for USJ said no such decision has been made.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Mediaweek) - NBC Universal will once again partner with Microsoft to support its online delivery of the Winter Olympics in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it did during NBC Universal's much-ballyhooed Web coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Microsoft will provide the video-streaming technology for the Games as well as prominent distribution on its MSN portal.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said it will respond on Friday to what it calls "misperceptions" about its trading relationship with bailed-out insurance company American International Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For weeks, Goldman has been under fire amid disclosures that more than $90 billion of taxpayer funds earmarked for the rescue of AIG, which nearly collapsed under credit derivative losses, were quickly paid out to U.S. and European banks that had purchased credit protection from AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under growing pressure to reveal more about its trading partners, AIG on Sunday detailed how much it paid out to various banks. Goldman was the largest single recipient of AIG bailout funds with $12.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Thursday, Goldman said Chief Financial Officer David Viniar would host a conference call with reporters to "clarify certain misperceptions in the press regarding Goldman Sachs' trading relationship with AIG."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman officials were not immediately available to comment on the press call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics in recent weeks have claimed that Goldman, whose alumni populate the halls of government, benefited unfairly from political connections and favoritism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry Paulson, Treasury Secretary when the initial bailout was arranged last fall, had been chief executive of Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is former Goldman Chairman Steve Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has insisted it did not need any bailout because it was "always fully collateralized and hedged." The bank also says it was not party to any discussions about a government bailout of AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview earlier this week, Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally told Reuters "our notional exposure to AIG is a fraction of what it was at the time of the September bailout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked why Goldman accepted the $12.9 billion, DuVally said that because AIG was rescued by the government, Goldman did not receive money from hedges that would have been paid had the insurer collapsed. Under the terms of its contracts with AIG, Goldman said it was entitled to collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is hardly alone. Other AIG counterparties that indirectly received U.S. funds included France's Societe Generale with $11.9 billion, Deutsche Bank with $11.8 billion and Barclays with $8.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIG's disclosure did not include payments since December 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These payments to banks have sparked outrage in Congress and among investors who complain AIG's trading counterparties were bought out at par value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An IBM takeover of Sun Microsystems Inc would raise the prospect of creating a clear leader in computer servers, but gaining market share might not be what's behind IBM's expensive overtures in hard economic times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun's software portfolio, including Java, MySQL and Solaris, offers IBM a chance to get an edge in nascent open source and "cloud computing" technologies that enable users to easily access applications over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM may be betting that it can do a better job than Sun in taking advantage of such software, and use it to compete effectively against large technology rivals like Cisco Systems Inc and Hewlett-Packard Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said International Business Machines Corp doesn't need help in servers as it was already the world's largest vendor in the fourth quarter, with a market share of over 36 percent, according to market researcher IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have a pretty good and complete line. They don't really need to add Sun. They could let Sun continue to wither and go its own way," said SP Equity Research analyst Tom Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IBM-Sun tie-up would give the combined company more than a 40 percent share of the $53 billion market for servers. Top rival Hewlett-Packard currently has a 29 percent share, followed by Dell Inc, with under 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combined IBM and Sun would significantly change the balance of power in the $17 billion high-end Unix segment of the server market, where IBM and Sun were the top two players in 2008 with shares of 37 percent and 28 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources said on Wednesday that IBM was in talks to buy Sun. The Wall Street Journal said IBM was offering to pay between $10 a share and $11 a share, double Sun's Tuesday closing price of $4.97, or over $6.5 billion. IBM and Sun declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EYES ON SOFTWARE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software and services are already areas on which Armonk, New York-based IBM is focusing already, and they have helped the company maintain healthy margins and solid growth even as a weak economy has dragged down hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said that the company was aiming to position itself for an economic recovery, as well as the next wave of the computing revolution, especially in emerging "virtualization" and "cloud" computing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing and virtualization have become the tech industry's biggest buzzwords to describe systems that allow consumers, developers and businesses to use the Internet to access programs and data at remote computer centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Internet traffic keeps growing on the back of online video use and social networking sites like Facebook, demand has grown for technology that helps save space and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said IBM is likely interested in Sun's Java software platform, as well as in MySQL, an open-source database used to run Websites that Sun acquired in early 2008. Open-source software allows users to access and modify source codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sun has failed to turn profits from its software portfolio, which also includes operating system OpenSolaris and off-site data storage company Q-Layer, analysts said IBM may make better use of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have more resources, more manpower, more expertise in more areas of the computing business all around. So they may be able to fit more pieces of the puzzle and come out with a better solution than Sun had," said SP Equity's Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Jones analyst Andy Miedler also said he believes IBM is interested in expanding its software business, in addition to securing a bigger piece of the pie in the server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sun has been doing a lot in open source software. We think longer term IBM could be expanding there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEXT WAVE OF COMPETITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of talks between IBM and Sun came after Cisco announced it would start selling servers aimed at data centers, by partnering with technology virtualization and storage companies like EMC Corp and VMware Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move will put Cisco in direct competition with IBM and HP, which are vendor partners. The budding rivalry, analysts said, may force them to acquire or ally with smaller firms to bolster their storage, security, and virtualization technologies so they can offer a broader set of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the economies pick up we believe corporations will be trying to improve productivity -- not by hiring or building plants but purchasing tech products; not just hardware, but also software, that enhances productivity," said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co, which owns IBM as well as HP shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts said they hadn't yet made up their mind on whether Sun was worth the hefty premium. Edward Jones' Miedler said IBM may launch massive cost cuts to make it worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How IBM would make this work financially is to significantly cut Sun's research and development and other overhead expenses, which would make IBM able to pay a premium and still potentially make money on the acquisition," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other analysts said IBM may actually want to keep Sun's RD segment. "The batch of RD computer scientists that maybe think a little differently to what IBM has done so far may give more things to mix together in the new generations of products," said SP Equity's Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle, Editing by Tiffany Wu and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The prospect of staid IBM merging with brilliant but troubled Sun Microsystems could spark a bout of antitrust scrutiny in the United States and abroad as customers and suppliers raise concerns about competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The merger would give the combined company 65 percent of the $17 billion Unix server market, according to market researcher IDC. These are the big servers that major companies, the government and others rely on for their most critical operations, according to IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp and Sun Microsystems Inc were the top two players in 2008, with 37 percent and 28 percent of the market, respectively. Hewlett-Packard Co was third, with 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sun and IBM's machines run incompatible versions of the powerful Unix operating system, IBM is likely to persuade developers to write new software for its machines, said IDC analyst Matt Eastwood. As more programs become available for IBM's Unix fleet, businesses might be persuaded to chose those servers over HP's systems, Eastwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You will have IBM so dominant that over time that it would be easier to squeeze HP, just by sheer presence," Eastwood said, adding he expected both the United States and Europe to scrutinize the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and Sun have declined to comment on the deal, but the Wall Street Journal said IBM was offering between $10 and $11 a share, double Sun's closing price of $4.97 on Tuesday, or over $6.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High end storage is another area where IBM and Sun dominate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One business that may come under scrutiny is Sun's StorageTek unit, which provides tape storage for mainframe computers, said Charles King, an analyst with technology research firm Pund-IT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun bought StorageTek in 2005 for about $4 billion, with the result that, together, IBM and Sun control the vast majority of that market, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed Black, head of trade group Computer and Communications Industry Association said members were concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are numerous companies in the industry that are worried about this consolidation, from storage to servers," he said. "Clearly, the withdrawal of a major competitor in those markets means they would have much less choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black also argued that both IBM and Sun were critical to innovation in "cloud computing" -- where a consumer stores information on the web rather than on a desktop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a growing area. That's a big area. It is not an area that you want dominated by a couple of companies," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Chin, who teaches antitrust law at the University of North Carolina, argued that Clinton era regulators had challenged deals on the grounds innovation would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another potentially problematic aspect is that innovation will come from one source rather than two," he added. "Monolithic servers are giving way in the big think of service oriented server architectures to this idea of cloud computing. IBM and Sun are both trying to innovate their way into that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evan Stewart, an antitrust expert with Zuckerman Spaeder LLP, forecast antitrust regulators worldwide would approve the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're (U.S. regulators) going to be thinking about how's IBM going to leverage this into new products that we can't even identify right now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM is a very significant presence there (in China and Japan) and is viewed as a good corporate citizen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In Brussels, the issue is what's the impact that this is going to have on competitors. They're going to be less receptive to it. Are they going to ultimately say no to it? I find that hard to believe," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Lefkowitz, options strategist at brokerage firm Finance Investments in New York, said some options traders are buying puts on the assumption regulators would kill IBM's pursuit of Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is some concern that IBM might have some antitrust problems in attempting to acquire Sun," he said. "If that occurs, Sun Micro could go all the way back down toward $4 a share and these investors will make a killing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Doris Frankel; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal, the biggest such buyout in Japan in a year, was at a 28.5 percent premium to USJ's share price before the offer became public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer numbers at the Osaka theme park, which features rides based on the movies Spiderman and Jurassic Park, have fallen in the midst of the global financial crisis and its shares have halved in value since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new group would upgrade the theme park, including introducing new attractions and characters, the Goldman fund said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the theme park faced tough growth prospects in tough times and as Japan's population ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which holds about 40 percent of USJ through its fund, said private equity firm MBK Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management would take stakes in the privatized company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it would offer 50,000 yen per share to buy the remaining 60 percent of shares and rights by May 21, at a cost of 111.2 billion yen ($1.2 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USJ said in a statement it had agreed to the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a premium of 11,100 yen to the shares' closing price on Tuesday, the last closing price before Reuters reported an imminent tender offer on Wednesday, and just over half its record high price of 90,900 yen in May 2007, just after it listed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the completion of the deal, Goldman said it would own 61.2 percent of USJ, MBK 23.6 percent and Owl Creek would have 15.1 percent. USJ CEO Glenn Gumpel would have a 0.1 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new owners may consider mergers and acquisitions as a way for the company to expand into other leisure businesses and Asia markets outside Japan, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osaka-based USJ listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in March 2007 but the global economic downturn has blunted Japan's usually voracious appetite for cartoon characters and other icons of cute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attendance at the park declined 5 percent during the nine months to the end of December from a year earlier, even as USJ stepped up efforts to bring in more visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the year ending this month, the company expects a net profit of 6 billion yen, down 11.3 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is the biggest buyout in Japan since Advantage Partners' $2.2 billion purchase of Tokyo Star Bank completed in March last year, Thomson Reuters data showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=95.99 Yen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Rodney Joyce)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An IBM takeover of Sun Microsystems Inc would raise the prospect of creating a clear leader in computer servers, but gaining market share might not be what's behind IBM's expensive overtures in hard economic times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun's software portfolio, including Java, MySQL and Solaris, offers IBM a chance to get an edge in nascent open source and "cloud computing" technologies that enable users to easily access applications over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM may be betting that it can do a better job than Sun in taking advantage of such software, and use it to compete effectively against large technology rivals like Cisco Systems Inc and Hewlett-Packard Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said International Business Machines Corp doesn't need help in servers as it was already the world's largest vendor in the fourth quarter, with a market share of over 36 percent, according to market researcher IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have a pretty good and complete line. They don't really need to add Sun. They could let Sun continue to wither and go its own way," said SP Equity Research analyst Tom Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IBM-Sun tie-up would give the combined company more than a 40 percent share of the $53 billion market for servers. Top rival Hewlett-Packard currently has a 29 percent share, followed by Dell Inc, with under 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combined IBM and Sun would significantly change the balance of power in the $17 billion high-end Unix segment of the server market, where IBM and Sun were the top two players in 2008 with shares of 37 percent and 28 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources said on Wednesday that IBM was in talks to buy Sun. The Wall Street Journal said IBM was offering to pay between $10 a share and $11 a share, double Sun's Tuesday closing price of $4.97, or over $6.5 billion. IBM and Sun declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EYES ON SOFTWARE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software and services are already areas on which Armonk, New York-based IBM is focusing already, and they have helped the company maintain healthy margins and solid growth even as a weak economy has dragged down hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said that the company was aiming to position itself for an economic recovery, as well as the next wave of the computing revolution, especially in emerging "virtualization" and "cloud" computing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing and virtualization have become the tech industry's biggest buzzwords to describe systems that allow consumers, developers and businesses to use the Internet to access programs and data at remote computer centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Internet traffic keeps growing on the back of online video use and social networking sites like Facebook, demand has grown for technology that helps save space and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said IBM is likely interested in Sun's Java software platform, as well as in MySQL, an open-source database used to run Websites that Sun acquired in early 2008. Open-source software allows users to access and modify source codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sun has failed to turn profits from its software portfolio, which also includes operating system OpenSolaris and off-site data storage company Q-Layer, analysts said IBM may make better use of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have more resources, more manpower, more expertise in more areas of the computing business all around. So they may be able to fit more pieces of the puzzle and come out with a better solution than Sun had," said SP Equity's Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Jones analyst Andy Miedler also said he believes IBM is interested in expanding its software business, in addition to securing a bigger piece of the pie in the server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sun has been doing a lot in open source software. We think longer term IBM could be expanding there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEXT WAVE OF COMPETITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of talks between IBM and Sun came after Cisco announced it would start selling servers aimed at data centers, by partnering with technology virtualization and storage companies like EMC Corp and VMware Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move will put Cisco in direct competition with IBM and HP, which are vendor partners.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Ritsuko Ando &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters) - An IBM (IBM.N) takeover of Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O would raise the prospect of creating a clear leader in computer servers, but gaining market share might not be what's behind IBM's expensive overtures in hard economic times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sun's software portfolio, including Java, MySQL and Solaris, offers IBM a chance to get an edge in nascent open source and "cloud computing" technologies that enable users to easily access applications over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM may be betting that it can do a better job than Sun in taking advantage of such software, and use it to compete effectively against large technology rivals like Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N).   Analysts said International Business Machines Corp doesn't need help in servers as it was already the world's largest vendor in the fourth quarter, with a market share of over 36 percent, according to market researcher IDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "They have a pretty good and complete line. They don't really need to add Sun. They could let Sun continue to wither and go its own way," said S Equity Research analyst Tom Smith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    An IBM-Sun tie-up would give the combined company more than a 40 percent share of the $53 billion market for servers. Top rival Hewlett-Packard currently has a 29 percent share, followed by Dell Inc DELL.O, with under 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A combined IBM and Sun would significantly change the balance of power in the $17 billion high-end Unix segment of the server market, where IBM and Sun were the top two players in 2008 with shares of 37 percent and 28 percent respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sources said on Wednesday that IBM was in talks to buy Sun. The Wall Street Journal said IBM was offering to pay between $10 a share and $11 a share, double Sun's Tuesday closing price of $4.97, or over $6.5 billion. IBM and Sun declined to comment. [nN19334181] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    EYES ON SOFTWARE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Software and services are already areas on which Armonk, New York-based IBM is focusing already, and they have helped the company maintain healthy margins and solid growth even as a weak economy has dragged down hardware sales. [nN26549635] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts said that the company was aiming to position itself for an economic recovery, as well as the next wave of the computing revolution, especially in emerging "virtualization" and "cloud" computing technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cloud computing and virtualization have become the tech industry's biggest buzzwords to describe systems that allow consumers, developers and businesses to use the Internet to access programs and data at remote computer centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As Internet traffic keeps growing on the back of online video use and social networking sites like Facebook, demand has grown for technology that helps save space and hardware. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts said IBM is likely interested in Sun's Java software platform, as well as in MySQL, an open-source database used to run Websites that Sun acquired in early 2008. Open-source software allows users to access and modify source codes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    While Sun has failed to turn profits from its software portfolio, which also includes operating system OpenSolaris and off-site data storage company Q-Layer, analysts said IBM may make better use of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "They have more resources, more manpower, more expertise in more areas of the computing business all around. So they may be able to fit more pieces of the puzzle and come out with a better solution than Sun had," said S Equity's Smith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Edward Jones analyst Andy Miedler also said he believes IBM is interested in expanding its software business, in addition to securing a bigger piece of the pie in the server market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Sun has been doing a lot in open source software. We think longer term IBM could be expanding there," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEXT WAVE OF COMPETITION &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    News of talks between IBM and Sun came after Cisco announced it would start selling servers aimed at data centers, by partnering with technology virtualization and storage companies like EMC Corp (EMC.N) and VMware Inc (VMW.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The move will put Cisco in direct competition with IBM and HP, which are vendor partners. The budding rivalry, analysts said, may force them to acquire or ally with smaller firms to bolster their storage, security, and virtualization technologies so they can offer a broader set of products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "When the economies pick up we believe corporations will be trying to improve productivity -- not by hiring or building plants but purchasing tech products; not just hardware, but also software, that enhances productivity," said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co, which owns IBM as well as HP shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Most analysts said they hadn't yet made up their mind on whether Sun was worth the hefty premium.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Mar 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Neocase Software, a leading provider of customer service solutions for
shared service centers and customer support operations, announced that
JPD Financial has deployed Neocase as its customer service and business
process management (BPM) platform. JPD Financial is a recognized, global
leader in Vendor Credit Recovery for major Fortune 1000 companies. The
company chose Neocase for its flexibility, configurability and lower
total cost of ownership, as well as for its advanced workflow and
business process management capabilities.

    With the Neocase solution, JPD achieved their goal of implementing a
single solution to manage and optimize its core business processes
consisting of credit recovery, case management, account management, and
invoicing workflows while significantly improving the automation and
tracking of its core processes as well as delivering significantly
enhanced reporting to its clients.

    "Neocase has significantly helped improve the productivity of our credit
recovery staff and we anticipate further gains with the implementation of
self-service options," said John Doyle, CEO of JPD Financial. "Most
importantly, Neocase empowered us to consolidate and integrate several
solutions into one platform. Therefore, it enables our staff to offer far
better and faster credit recovery services to our Fortune 1000 clients,
and in the end, continues to help us achieve our goal of higher customer
satisfaction."

    JPD Financial faced multiple challenges with its outdated legacy systems,
in managing several considerable and different databases within its credit
recovery department for its clients. It was extremely difficult to
automate processes and integrate disparate systems, which hindered
productivity throughout their credit recovery operations, and impacted
the company's growth. In particular, it was difficult to deliver timely
reporting to its Fortune 1000 clients as well as thoroughly keep track of
all credit recovery requests. Additionally, the maintenance of the aging
legacy systems was costly. The lack of a much-needed self-service module
became apparent over time, and will be enabled in the near future.

    After reviewing several vendors and even considering a custom, in-house
solution, JPD selected Neocase, as it was the solution that fulfilled all
necessary functionality requirements with respect to: business process
management, account/contact management, business intelligence, advanced
reporting, knowledgebase integration, and self-service capabilities.
Additionally, Neocase proved to be the best solution to manage JPD
Financial's processes in its entirety, as well as be able to handle the
complexity of those processes for each client.

    With the support of the Neocase Professional Services team, JPD Financial
implemented the Neocase platform (Version 11) in an on-premise
environment, including numerous workflow and case form customizations.
JPD now manages their unique business processes entirely with Neocase and
will continue to refine and improve the system with their in-house staff.
In addition, JPD is in the process of launching a self-service portal
based on Neocase SelfService, empowering its clients to play a more
direct role in the claim process, while enabling JPD's agents to spend
more time on high-value tasks.

    "With the recent implementation at JPD Financial, we continue to
demonstrate that Neocase's platform offers far better functionality,
flexibility and configurability than comparable solutions, as well as
providing these benefits at far lower total costs of ownership," states
Julien Dahan, Chief Executive Officer, Neocase Software. He adds,
"Additionally, JPD took advantage of our strong workflow and business
process management capabilities. This ultimately enabled the company to
automate its core business processes, including, credit recovery, account
management, invoicing, and reporting, and spend less time on manual,
unproductive tasks."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft is set to publicly launch Internet Explorer 8 early on Thursday, the latest version of its market-dominating Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application, an integral part of Microsoft's eagerly awaited Windows 7 operating system, can be downloaded from Microsoft's website from 9 a.m. Pacific time, free for people using licensed Microsoft operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IE8, as it is commonly referred to, has been in public beta testing for about a year, but Thursday's launch marks its full public rollout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software company, said IE8 will run with Windows Vista, its latest operating system, and also Windows XP, the previous version which some users still prefer over Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application replaces IE7, which has a lock on the browser market. According to a recent survey by IT consultants Janco Associates, Internet explorer has a 72.2 percent market share, ahead of the Mozilla Foundation's Firefox browser with 17.2 percent. Google's new Chrome browser has only 2.8 percent of the market, while Apple's Safari has less than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has run afoul of U.S. and European antitrust regulators for bundling its browser with its operating system, which competitors say is an attempt to drive them out of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Google joined Mozilla and Norway's Opera in protesting Microsoft's dominance in the browser market. In January, European regulators brought formal charges against Microsoft for abusing its dominant market position by bundling its Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows operating system, which is used in 95 percent of the world's personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already announced that users of Windows 7 -- expected later this year or early next year -- will be able to turn key programs like Internet Explorer off, making it easier to use other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New features in IE8 include right-clicking on addresses or other Web features to go straight to a map or put into a blog or other website, which Microsoft calls an "accelerator". Users will also be able to put in keywords in the address bar to recall sites visited related to that word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new browser also has enhanced security protection, for example warning users if they are about to download something from a site known to be a source of malicious software, or "malware".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new report by the Ethical Corporation Institute has found that corporate water
strategies generate cost savings and create indirect benefits for many
stakeholders 
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
The Ethical Corporation Institute revealed today that despite the economic
downturn operating a green business still makes financial sense. 

Ethical Corporation Institute's recent report, a "must have" Guide to Water
Ethics Footprinting, Programmes and Supply Security finds that companies acting
proactively on water management have the opportunity to gain first-mover
advantage on the competition. 

Coca-Cola argues in the report that there is a strong business case for engaging
in water efficiency. The company is seeking ways to reuse water used for
manufacturing processes which are directly linked to cost savings. 

Companies were accused at the recent World Water Forum in Istanbul of using
water selfishly and with no regard for the communities within which they
operate. However, in Coca-Cola`s case, many regions of China had severely
damaged water sheds when the company first arrived. By partnering local
community groups and city or state governments to manage and revitalise
watersheds they believe they contributed positively to the local region. 

Piet Klop, water expert at the World Resources Institute advises that
corporations can invest in water efficiencies and sell their excess for
increased revenue. The report looks at how Molson Coors has benefited from this
approach in the US. 

Bart Alexander, VP, Global Alcohol Policy and Corporate Responsibility at Molson
Coors, interviewed for the report explains that "if we don`t utilize all the
water within our water rights portfolio, we can lease or sell the surplus water&#8230;
Hence the benefits can be realized on both sides of the balance sheet".

Programmes and Supply Security is now on general sale. Click here now to

in a $90 million decline in revenue in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Khan, who cut his price target on the stock to $9 from $12,
said no booking fees for air tickets have become somewhat the
industry norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We now find it unlikely that this program will result in
market share gains to offset this decline," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Progress in international markets has also not been seen,
the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Despite significant investment in increasing international
hotel inventory and the acquisition of Venere, we have not seen
any increase in market share in Europe," Khan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expedia agreed to buy Venere, an online travel agency
focusing on hotel reservations, in July last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Expedia, which have lost 62 percent of their
value in the last year, were trading down 7 percent at $7.56
Thursday morning on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;In the Last Five Years, Pfizer`s Patient Assistance Programs (Pfizer Helpful
Answers) Have Helped More Than 5 Million Patients Receive 51 Million Pfizer
Prescriptions
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc announced today that Together Rx Access, a prescription savings
program sponsored by Pfizer along with several other leading pharmaceutical
companies, has expanded the program`s eligibility income levels to help even
more uninsured individuals and families save on the medicines they need to stay
healthy and to manage chronic conditions. Under the new income levels, nearly 90
percent of uninsured Americans will now be eligible for the Together Rx Access
Program. 

Access to medicine is a cornerstone of Pfizer`s commitment to health care
reform. For more than 20 years, Pfizer has been helping patients in need get
access to Pfizer medicines. Today, this assistance is provided through Pfizer
Helpful Answers, the largest and most extensive patient assistance program in
the U.S. Pfizer Helpful Answers helps uninsured Americans, of any age or income,
receive Pfizer medicines for free or at a savings. In 2008 alone, Pfizer
distributed more than 6.5 million Pfizer prescriptions for free or at a savings
to 936,000 patients - including patients helped through Together Rx Access. 

"More individuals and their families are feeling the impact of the economic
crisis through the loss of jobs and healthcare benefits," said Gary Pelletier,
director of Pfizer Helpful Answers. "Pfizer is committed to helping people
access the medicines they need. By expanding the eligibility income levels for
Together Rx Access, Pfizer and all of the member companies are enhancing this
convenient, multi-company savings program to help address the urgent needs of
Americans who require help taking care of their health." 

The enhanced income levels for which individuals are eligible for the Together
Rx Access Program are now:

* $45,000 for a single person (formerly $30,000) 
* $60,000 for a family of two (formerly $40,000) 
* $75,000 for a family of three (formerly $50,000) 
* $90,000 for a family of four (formerly $60,000) 
* $105,000 for a family of five (formerly $70,000)

Over the past 12 months, the unemployment rate in the United States has risen by
3.3 percent,* which by some estimates, may result in more than 3 million
additional Americans without health insurance.&#8224;

"Our member companies have taken this important step to reach even more
individuals who may be struggling right now," said Roba Whiteley, executive
director of Together Rx Access. "Proof of the success of this unique,
multi-manufacturer model is the fact that the Program has more than 1.8 million
cardholders, with thousands more enrolling each week. Those who have used their
Together Rx Access Card have saved over $80 million on their prescription
medicines. The expansion of our eligibility requirements will allow these
numbers to continue to grow." 

In addition to meeting the expanded income levels, individuals must be legal
residents of the United States or Puerto Rico, and have no public or private
prescription coverage, or qualify for Medicare, to be eligible for the Together
Rx Access Card. The card is free to get and free to use. 

Together Rx Access offers potential cardholders a simple enrollment process.

returning it by mail. All enrollment materials, including the Together Rx Access

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats story that ran on Wednesday with no change to headline
or text)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Clare Baldwin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 18 (Reuters) - Its name was once
synonymous with the Internet. It championed networking at a time
most people thought e-mail was revolutionary. It used to be
mentioned in the same breath as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Intel
(INTC.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, Sun Microsystem's JAVA.O biggest coup may well be
selling itself to one of the industry's oldest names at a sky-high
premium, spelling perhaps the end of an era for a loss-making firm
that shed virtually its entire stock value in under a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM (IBM.N) is in talks to buy Sun to bolster its leading hold
on the high-end computer market against rivals such as
Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N), sources and analysts say. Big Blue is
offering to pay over $6.5 billion or double Sun's Tuesday closing
price of $4.97, The Wall Street Journal reported.[ID:nBNG479364]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both companies declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That may not sit well with the troops at Sun, which -- despite
its roller-coaster history -- still inspires fierce loyalty among
its own ranks and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's going to be difficult for us to be IBMers," a
50-year-old software program manager lamented as she crossed its
sprawling Santa Clara campus. "We still have a start-up mentality,
somewhat laid-back... From my perspective, IBM is more blue suits
and bureaucracy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We take names and we kick butt," the 20-year Sun veteran
added as an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Few companies embody the rise and fall of dotcom as much as
Sun, whose name stands for Stanford University Network and whose
campus resembles that of the college, with a palmtree-lined drive
leading up to a grassy courtyard and clocktower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the heady days of 2000-2001, the company -- led by
firebrand co-founder and Harvard-Stanford alumnus Scott McNealy --
took on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McNealy -- who grew Sun from a Silicon Valley start-up to a
globe-spanning firm with 38,000 employees -- took on Microsoft,
calling his rival's proprietary Windows software "a giant
hairball" and touting his own open-software philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lost. Windows went on to dominate the PC platform and
Microsoft eclipsed the firm in both size and market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The popular image of IBM as a mass of navy suits is in stark
contrast to Sun, where the chief executive sports a ponytail.
Analysts differ in their opinions as to whether that cultural
difference goes deeper than looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When I worked at IBM in the '90s, we used to take bets on how
long a Sun executive would last when we hired them away: the
average was nine months," said Rob Enderle, an analyst with the
Enderle Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An IBM human resources executive argued the company was both
diverse and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm wearing a yellow tie, green suit and loafers," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RUNNING THE GAMUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM was once known for its reluctance to fire people, experts
say, and still remains less willing than, say, Sun, which in
November said it would lay off up to 6,000 of its staff, or 15-18
percent of its workforce. [ID:nN14421354]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reactions at Sun's campus, an hour's drive from San Francisco,
ranged from the fearful to the incredulous. Many were nervous
about losing jobs at a time the United States is going through its
worst economic contraction in over 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The feeling is mixed, right? If we get bought, we lose a lot
of people," said a 28 year-old chip designer who had worked for
Sun over the past four years. "If we don't get bought, we'll lose
people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others were skeptical, with management keeping mum so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Fujitsu or Cisco maybe, but not IBM," said a 50-year-old
engineer as he puffed away at a cigarette on the parking lot with
three of his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's so much overlap with IBM, I'm not sure why they would
buy Sun. I'm sure there's something else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors too have questioned Sun's worth. The firm has seen
its stock sink more than 70 percent in the past year alone. That
downward spiral belied the firm's meteoric ascent of the past two
decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun began life in 1982. One year later, it signed a $40
million contract with manufacturers. By 1988, the company had $1
billion in revenue, and joined the ranks of Fortune 500 companies
by the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Java, a software platform that allows applications to run on
any computer, was introduced in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun shares peaked in 2000 at just under $260, but then had
hemorrhaged more than 98 percent of their value before Wednesday's
80 percent surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun's market capitalization was about $3.5 billion, a mere
shadow of its former self, before talk of the negotiations became
public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If the deal does happen, this is an admission that the
company could not make it on its own," BMO Capital Markets' Keith
Bachman wrote on Wednesday.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Texas Instruments: 2 Trends

Texas Instruments (NYSE: TXN), or TI, has been integrating different
functionalities into single devices, encouraging customers to go for the
simpler, more power efficient and smaller form factor products that could
potentially lower the cost of ownership and enable adoption in the smallest of
applications. For TI, this increases the dollar content per device, thus helping
share gains and margin expansion. 

Growth in the communications infrastructure market has been tempered by
consolidations and regulatory pressures. The recession started deepening just as
the infrastructure market was turning around. However, TI remains very strongly
positioned to benefit from the development of the 3G buildout. 

Although the company lost share at Ericsson`s (NASDAQ: ERIC) initial 3G
platform, TI has a win for the next generation product. Management expects this
to translate back into share gain towards the end of fiscal 2009. 

The Motorola (NYSE: MOT) platform will bring additional revenue in 2009.
Therefore, this business will begin to look up by the end of the year. Nearly
half of TI`s revenue is derived from the communications market, and the
long-term prospects of this market are very good. 

Walter Inds Initiated a Buy

We are initiating coverage on Walter Industries, Inc. (NYSE: WLT) with a Buy
recommendation and a target price of $32.00 per share. WLT should realize solid
pricing and margins in 2009 as it produces some of highest quality low-volume
met [metallurgical] coal in the world. 

The company has around half of its met sales tonnage in 2009 priced at $225/Ton
FOB Port. Economic stimulus efforts around the globe should start to take shape
toward the end of 2009, thus creating demand for commodities (e.g. steel and met
coal). 

Keeping a Hold on AIR

AAR Corp. (NYSE: AIR) reported Q3-09 results. Revenues of $338.8 million (we had
forecast $349 million) were down by 10.0%. Operating Income was off by 22.4% as
the Operating Margin declined from 10.1% to 8.7%. Net Income was essentially
flat, but only because the Tax Rate dropped from 35.0% to 27.0%. EPS were also
just about flat at 48&#162; (our estimate was 45&#162;; if the Tax Rate hadn`t dropped,
the EPS would have been 43&#162;). 

Aviation Supply Chain Sales were off by 8.3% to 138.7 million, MRO [maintenance,
repair and operation] Sales rose by 2.9% to $77.0 million and Structures &amp;
Systems Sales rose by 8.7% to $120.0 million.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

IBM-Sun Deal A Desperate Move

The Wall Street Journal is reporting that International Business Machines (NYSE:
IBM) has made a $6.5 billion offer to buy Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ: JAVA)
at a 100% premium over its closing price yesterday, with a potential close this
week. This will be the largest acquisition that IBM has ever made. 

In our opinion, this is a desperate move by both parties. 

There is enough business overlap to attract the attention of the Justice
Department. The purchase price is way too high to make business sense. IBM gains
very little new software except for StarOffice (a Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)
look-alike) and that has not made much of a mark. Java and Solaris are now open
source products. Sun adds little to the service business that IBM has. 

Darden Lifts Restaurant Stocks

The latest financial results from Darden Restaurants (NYSE: DRI) reflect the
durability of strong brands and superior management, even in a recession. 

Darden shares are surging 17% today after the casual dining operator reported
fiscal 3Q09 earnings last night that were not as bad as expected, and
dramatically improved its earnings guidance. EPS from continuing operations slid
2.5% to $0.78 in the quarter ended February 22, 2009, from $0.80 in the year-ago
quarter. 

Community Health Kept Stable

Community Health Systems, Inc. (NYSE: CYH) is the largest publicly traded
hospital management company in the U.S. 

The company recently reported lower-than-expected 4Q08 net income of $59.9M,
compared with a loss of $88.3M 4Q07. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted
4Q08 EPS was $0.59, versus $0.40 in 4Q07. Provision for bad debt was $388.5M or
14.1% of total revenue, which was at the high end of previous guidance, versus
$360.1M or 14.5% of total revenue in 4Q07.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

China Denies Coke Acquisition

Today, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced that it has rejected The
Coca-Cola Company`s (NYSE: KO) proposed acquisition of China Huiyuan Juice Group
Limited, a Hong Kong listed company which owns the Huiyuan juice business
throughout China. Citing the anti-competitive effects of the acquisition, the
decision reflects the enforcement of China`s strengthened anti-monopoly law and
the internal political pressure of the Chinese government related to protecting
indigenous brands from foreign control. 

For The Coca-Cola Company, the strong performance of future key markets, like
China, has mitigated volume concerns in North America. In 2008, unit case volume
in North America declined 1%. Management is extending Coca-Cola`s reach in
emerging markets not only through the introduction of water and juice products,
but also through acquisitions. 

For example, in early 2006 Coca-Cola bought a Serbian water bottler, and in
March 2007 Coca-Cola, in alliance with Greece-based Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling
Company (NYSE: CCH), bought out Multon, which controls approximately 25% of the
Russian juice market. On September 3, 2008, The Coca-Cola Company made a $2.3
billion cash offer to purchase China Huiyuan Juice Group. 

Nat'l Semi: Buying Opportunity

National Semiconductor Corp. (NYSE: NSM) is an OEM of analog and mixed signal
integrated circuits. February quarter revenue fell short of consensus
expectations, although the bottom line exceeded. Forward guidance is for a
revenue decline of -5% to -10% in the seasonally strong 4th quarter. 

Management has refocused R into areas that should drive margins. It has also
initiated a massive restructuring program to further lower the breakeven point.
Although National has been negatively impacted by the recession, the business
continues to exhibit the necessary ingredients for a strong comeback. The
necessary reduction of fab loadings will have a negative impact on near-term
gross margins, but we expect margins to start looking up as restructuring
actions are completed. 

Buy SINA Corp. at These Levels

SINA Corp. (NASDAQ: SINA) is a leading provider of online media and value-added
information services to the global Chinese community. SINA posted strong
financial results for 2008. Both its revenue and EPS once again exceeded the
market consensus. 

However, economic growth in the country had continued to slow owing to global
downturn. SINA provided weak Q1 2009 guidance on account of a drop in
advertising revenue. The company is also facing severe competition in its mobile
business. 

Vodafone's Strong Connection

We maintain our Buy recommendation for Vodafone Group PLC (NYSE: VOD), the
largest revenue generating international wireless carrier. The company's recent
operating results are highlighted by strong growth in overall subscriber count
bolstered by record customer additions in its Indian operation. 

Additionally, solid growth in service revenue from emerging markets (in Asia and
the Middle East) has been accompanied by sequentially improved results across
most of the major European markets. Meanwhile, Vodafone continues to accelerate
3G wireless service deployments and expanding network availability across Asia,
Eastern Europe and Africa, primarily through acquisitions.

&lt;p&gt; * USJ theme park to go private in Goldman-led $1.2 bln buyout&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * MBK Partners, Owl Creek to take stakes in turnaround push&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Taiga Uranaka&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOKYO, March 19 (Reuters) - USJ Co Ltd 2142.T, the operator
of a struggling Universal Studios theme park in Japan, said on
Thursday it was being sold for $1.2 billion to a consortium led
by Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal, the biggest such buyout in Japan in a year, was at
a 28.5 percent premium to USJ's share price before the offer
became public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Customer numbers at the Osaka theme park, which features
rides based on the movies Spiderman and Jurassic Park, have
fallen in the midst of the global financial crisis and its shares
have halved in value since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new group would upgrade the theme park, including
introducing new attractions and characters, the Goldman fund said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the theme park faced tough growth prospects in tough
times and as Japan's population ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which holds about 40 percent of USJ through its
fund, said private equity firm MBK Partners and Owl Creek Asset
Management would take stakes in the privatised company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it would offer 50,000 yen per share to buy the
remaining 60 percent of shares and rights by May 21, at a cost of
111.2 billion yen ($1.2 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; USJ said in a statement it had agreed to the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is a premium of 11,100 yen to the shares' closing price
on Tuesday, the last closing price before Reuters reported an
imminent tender offer on Wednesday, and just over half its record
high price of 90,900 yen in May 2007, just after it listed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the completion of the deal, Goldman said it would own 61.2
percent of USJ, MBK 23.6 percent and Owl Creek would have 15.1
percent. USJ CEO Glenn Gumpel would have a 0.1 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new owners may consider mergers and acquisitions as a way
for the company to expand into other leisure businesses and Asia
markets outside Japan, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Osaka-based USJ listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in March
2007 but the global economic downturn has blunted Japan's usually
voracious appetite for cartoon characters and other icons of
cute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attendance at the park declined 5 percent during the nine
months to the end of December from a year earlier, even as USJ
stepped up efforts to bring in more visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the year ending this month, the company expects a net
profit of 6 billion yen, down 11.3 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is the biggest buyout in Japan since Advantage
Partners' $2.2 billion purchase of Tokyo Star Bank completed in
March last year, Thomson Reuters data showed.

animal-health products, while Wyeth is strong in animal
vaccines, the paper cited D'Amelio as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; D'Amelio added that the companies also overlapped in those
areas, and talks with antitrust authorities were ongoing, the
paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said in January it would buy Wyeth in a deal then
valued at $68 billion.

&lt;p&gt;Two Decades after Environmental Disaster, New Report Shows Arctic Even More
Vulnerable to Oil Spills

WWF Renews Calls for a Time-Out on Offshore Oil Drilling
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Two decades after the Exxon Valdez oil spill devastated a vast stretch of the
Alaskan coast, governments and industry in the Arctic would be unable to
effectively manage a large oil spill, according to a new report by World
Wildlife Fund. As the 20th anniversary of the Exxon Valdez spill approaches on
March 24, WWF renewed its call for a time-out on new offshore oil development in
the Arctic until technologies improve to ensure adequate clean-up of an oil
spill. WWF is also calling on the Obama Administration to permanently protect
Alaska`s fish-rich Bristol Bay from drilling. 

The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska was one of the
world`s worst ecological disasters. A WWF report released today demonstrates how
the Arctic remains ill-prepared should another spill occur. The report, "Lessons
Not Learned," finds that while practices have improved in Prince William Sound,
oil spill response capabilities throughout Arctic region have improved little in
the past 20 years. 

To mark the Exxon Valdez anniversary, WWF will showcase rocks collected from
Prince William Sound beaches that are still coated in oil. Additionally, the
House Natural Resources Committee will hold a hearing on Tuesday examining the
future of offshore oil development in U.S. waters. 

"While new regulations are in place regarding response to oil spill disasters in
the last 20 years, the Arctic itself has changed considerably and is much more
vulnerable today," said Bill Eichbaum, WWF`s vice president for marine and
arctic policy. "Sea ice is disappearing and open water seasons are lasting
longer, creating a frenzy to stake claims on the Arctic`s rich resources -
especially oil and gas development. Oil spills can be devastating to Arctic
marine environments given the current lack of oil spill response capabilities.
We need a `time-out` until protections are in place for this fragile,
extraordinary place." 

WWF, which has the world`s largest Arctic conservation program, also recommends
that the most vulnerable and important areas of the Arctic be deemed permanently
off-limits to oil and gas development. Such "no-go zones" should be based on the
sensitivity and productivity of special priority areas, where oil spill response
would be virtually impossible to clean up or where any spill would cause
irreparable long-term damage. These areas include Bristol Bay in the
southeastern Bering Sea in Alaska, known as "America`s fish basket," where more
than 40 percent of all wild seafood is caught in the United States. Oil and gas
development in the bay is estimated to bring in $7.7 billion over the 25-40 year
lifetime experts predict it would take to extract the resources. By comparison,
the renewable fisheries of the Bristol Bay region are valued at $50-$80 billion
over that same time period. 

"Fishermen`s livelihoods are at stake," said Keith Colburn, a Bristol Bay crab
fisherman featured on Discovery Channel`s Deadliest Catch. "Loss of the Bristol
Bay fisheries would put thousands of fishermen out of work and break down the
engine of a fishery that brings in $2.2 billion to the economy each year. It`s
not worth the risk." 

WWF is urging Arctic countries to conduct comprehensive risk assessments of
industrial activities, such as shipping and petroleum development, along with
climate change-induced impacts on the marine environment. In addition, Arctic
countries should also adopt a region-wide comprehensive agreement for spill
response and launch conservation plans that assess the health, biodiversity and
functioning of Arctic ecosystems. 

"The Exxon Valdez spill has been the best-studied oil spill in history and
scientists have found that even 20 years later, the damage from the spill
continues," said Margaret Williams, managing director of WWF`s Alaska program.
"Fishermen`s livelihoods were destroyed, many wildlife and fish populations
still haven`t recovered and the Alaskan economy lost billions of dollars. We
can`t let that happen again in Alaska`s productive waters."

* President George W. Bush abruptly ended a long-standing executive ban on
off-shore oil leasing in Alaska`s Bristol Bay in January 2007. Lease sales in
Bristol Bay were then scheduled for 2011 despite recommendations by the National
Marine Fisheries Service to exclude Bristol Bay from the nation`s 2007-2012
outer continental shelf leasing program. The Obama Administration has extended
the public comment period on all lease sales until September 2009 but has not
overturned the Bristol Bay sales.

WWF`S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ARCTIC OIL EXPLORATION:

* The most sensitive or important areas of the Arctic must be deemed off-limits
to oil and gas development. Such "no-go zones" and closure limits should be
based on the sensitivity and productivity of special priority areas where a
response gap exists and any spill would cause irreparable long-term damage.
These areas include Bristol Bay in Alaska, known as "America`s fish basket"; the
Lofoten Islands in Norway; and parts of the West Kamchatka shelf in Russia. 
* Arctic states should institute a moratorium on any new offshore oil
development in the Arctic until adequate solutions are implemented to close the
oil spill response gap. 
* Response gap analyses should be performed throughout the Arctic to better
understand the factors contributing to the lack of information and timing about
where local conditions exceed the limits of spill response systems. Response gap
analyses should be integral components of feasibility and assessment studies for
oil operations and part of any contingency planning. Regional and federal
agencies must acknowledge, quantify and close oil spill response gaps before any
oil and gas development proceeds. 
* All Arctic states should conduct comprehensive risk assessments of industrial
activities, such as shipping and petroleum development, along with climate
change-induced impacts on the marine environment. Arctic states should share
information, data and technologies that enhance search and rescue operations and
spill response, including protective measures such as forward operating
stations, rescue tugs, satellite tracking, automatic information systems and
vessel traffic systems. 
* Arctic states should upgrade investments to improve existing technologies and
spill response mechanisms with enhanced involvement of local communities and
stakeholder groups who have a vested interest in spill response outcomes. This
would include upgrading local response capabilities and logistical requirements
in Arctic areas. 
* Arctic states should initiate a comprehensive conservation plan that assesses
the health, biodiversity and functioning of Arctic ecosystems, including impacts
of industrial activities. Adopting a precautionary approach, this plan would use
extensive spatial planning to determine permanently protected areas as well as
guiding decisions about whether, when, where and how industrial activities
should take place.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc did nothing wrong when it accepted payments to close out trades with American International Group, the giant insurer rescued by the U.S. government, Goldman's chief financial officer said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFO David Viniar, in a conference call, answered questions about Goldman's trading relationship with AIG, which was given $180 billion of taxpayer funds in the last four months of 2008 to save it from collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout sparked public outrage amid revelations that $90 billion of those funds were funneled quickly to banks that traded with AIG. Goldman received $12.9 billion in payments and collateral, while most AIG investors were wiped out and the mounting cost of the bailout sparked outrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar told reporters the trades with AIG were "commercial contracts" and the insurer was obligated to make good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't think we did anything wrong," he said. "We had commercial terms. It is our responsibility to our shareholders to make sure that we are protecting ourselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar disclosed that Goldman held $7.5 billion of collateral against $10 billion of AIG exposure when the insurance company was bailed out. The remaining $2.5 billion was hedged in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's AIG exposure originally had a face value of $20 billion before market deterioration set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, Goldman has $6 billion of AIG exposure, offset in part by $4.4 billion in collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said the bank had no material direct exposure to AIG and has no net exposure now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman amassed most of its AIG trading exposure in 2006, he said. Goldman purchased credit protection from AIG to cover potential losses on collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second half of 2007, as mortgage markets tumbled, Viniar said Goldman and AIG disputed the value of these CDOs, held by other Goldman counterparties. Goldman wanted AIG to post more collateral to reflect the falling value of CDOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in July 2007, Goldman began to mark down certain "super senior" AIG risk, and the two companies had some disputes over collateral, he said. Goldman also scaled back its dealings with AIG at the end of that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Goldman asked for more collateral from AIG, the insurer tried to settle its credit default swap contracts at a discount -- both before and after it received its first bailout last September. Goldman refused and ultimately secured everything it was owed by AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collateral calls by Goldman and other trading partners contributed to the insurer's sudden collapse. The initial rescue, and two subsequent AIG bailout efforts, has become a political flashpoint as the public watches billions of taxpayer dollars fly out the door and land in the pockets of big banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Goldman only demanded what it was due, Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's why we enter into these contracts. That's why we have collateral terms in the first place, to make sure that we are protected," he said. "And all we did was call for the collateral that was due to us under the contracts. I don't think there's any guilt whatsoever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar said that while Goldman would not have suffered direct losses from AIG's failure, because it was hedged and collateralized, a collapse would have disrupted the financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics complain that Goldman, whose alumni populate the halls of government, benefits from its connections. Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary when AIG was bailed out, is a former Goldman CEO. The chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Steve Friedman, is a former Goldman chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman says it was not party to any discussions about a government bailout of AIG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lilla Zuill, editing by Matthew Lewis and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) is still in talks to buy Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O and discussions could take several more days as IBM studies various parts of Sun's computer server and software businesses, according to people with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue, called IBM's examination of Sun's assets standard procedure. They added that any deal is unlikely to be reached before next week at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and Sun declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they reach agreement, Sun would be IBM's largest acquisition and bolster its offering of computer hardware, software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of the world's No. 1 and No. 4 makers of server computers, however, could draw antitrust scrutiny from regulators in the United States and abroad, analysts said this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The merged company would hold 65 percent of the $17 billion market for Unix servers, which major companies and governments rely on for critical operations, according to market researcher IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and Sun were the top two players in that market in 2008, with 37 percent and 28 percent respectively. Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) was third, with 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT YET FINAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC, citing a Wall Street Journal report, said earlier on Friday that International Business Machines Corp's due diligence process was holding up the Sun deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is examining the terms of Sun's various technology licenses to check for any conflict with IBM's business, the Journal reported on its website. It said a deal could be worth $6.5 billion to $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts also have questioned whether it was worth IBM paying what would amount to a 100 percent premium for Sun, whose shares had plunged 70 percent in the past year before the talks with IBM were first reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts and bankers told Reuters in November that Sun, which rose to prominence in the 1990s, could be forced to sell itself as it struggles to regain profitability and bring its operating expenses under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company never fully recovered from the dotcom bubble burst in the earlier this decade, when demand for its high-end servers plummeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its ambitions to move into software through acquisitions like database maker MySQL have been slow to produce results and it has failed to fully commercialize the Java software it invented in the early days of the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have said that IBM, with greater manpower and more effective management, may be able to make better use of Sun's assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many also have said that they see a potential deal between the two companies as part of a consolidation trend, as IBM and rivals like HP and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) compete to offer software, services and hardware based on emerging technologies that can power complex corporate transactions and networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun shares closed Friday's session down 6.14 percent at $8.10 on the Nasdaq, giving the company a market value of about $6 billion based on about 745 million shares outstanding as of January 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares closed down 0.16 percent at $92.51 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando, Anupreeta Das and Jim Finkle; Editing by Gary Hill and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

diligence process was holding up the Sun deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM is examining the terms of Sun's various technology
licenses to check for any conflict with IBM's business, the
Journal reported on its website. It said a deal could be worth
$6.5 billion to $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts also have questioned whether it was worth IBM
paying what would amount to a 100 percent premium for Sun,
whose shares had plunged 70 percent in the past year before the
talks with IBM were first reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts and bankers told Reuters in November that Sun,
which rose to prominence in the 1990s, could be forced to sell
itself as it struggles to regain profitability and bring its
operating expenses under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company never fully recovered from the dotcom bubble
burst in the earlier this decade, when demand for its high-end
servers plummeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its ambitions to move into software through acquisitions
like database maker MySQL have been slow to produce results and
it has failed to fully commercialize the Java software it
invented in the early days of the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts have said that IBM, with greater manpower and
more effective management, may be able to make better use of
Sun's assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many also have said that they see a potential deal between
the two companies as part of a consolidation trend, as IBM and
rivals like HP and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) compete to offer
software, services and hardware based on emerging technologies
that can power complex corporate transactions and networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun shares closed Friday's session down 6.14 percent at
$8.10 on the Nasdaq, giving the company a market value of about
$6 billion based on about 745 million shares outstanding as of
January 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares closed down 0.16 percent at $92.51 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The prospect of staid IBM merging with brilliant but troubled Sun Microsystems could spark a bout of antitrust scrutiny in the United States and abroad as customers and suppliers raise concerns about competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The merger would give the combined company 65 percent of the $17 billion Unix server market, according to market researcher IDC. These are the big servers that major companies, the government and others rely on for their most critical operations, according to IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O were the top two players in 2008, with 37 percent and 28 percent of the market, respectively. Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) was third, with 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sun and IBM's machines run incompatible versions of the powerful Unix operating system, IBM is likely to persuade developers to write new software for its machines, said IDC analyst Matt Eastwood. As more programs become available for IBM's Unix fleet, businesses might be persuaded to chose those servers over HP's systems, Eastwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You will have IBM so dominant that over time that it would be easier to squeeze HP, just by sheer presence," Eastwood said, adding he expected both the United States and Europe to scrutinize the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and Sun have declined to comment on the deal, but the Wall Street Journal said IBM was offering between $10 and $11 a share, double Sun's closing price of $4.97 on Tuesday, or over $6.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High end storage is another area where IBM and Sun dominate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One business that may come under scrutiny is Sun's StorageTek unit, which provides tape storage for mainframe computers, said Charles King, an analyst with technology research firm Pund-IT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun bought StorageTek in 2005 for about $4 billion, with the result that, together, IBM and Sun control the vast majority of that market, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed Black, head of trade group Computer and Communications Industry Association said members were concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are numerous companies in the industry that are worried about this consolidation, from storage to servers," he said. "Clearly, the withdrawal of a major competitor in those markets means they would have much less choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black also argued that both IBM and Sun were critical to innovation in "cloud computing" -- where a consumer stores information on the web rather than on a desktop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a growing area. That's a big area. It is not an area that you want dominated by a couple of companies," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Chin, who teaches antitrust law at the University of North Carolina, argued that Clinton era regulators had challenged deals on the grounds innovation would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another potentially problematic aspect is that innovation will come from one source rather than two," he added. "Monolithic servers are giving way in the big think of service oriented server architectures to this idea of cloud computing. IBM and Sun are both trying to innovate their way into that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evan Stewart, an antitrust expert with Zuckerman Spaeder LLP, forecast antitrust regulators worldwide would approve the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're (U.S. regulators) going to be thinking about how's IBM going to leverage this into new products that we can't even identify right now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM is a very significant presence there (in China and Japan) and is viewed as a good corporate citizen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In Brussels, the issue is what's the impact that this is going to have on competitors. They're going to be less receptive to it. Are they going to ultimately say no to it? I find that hard to believe," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Lefkowitz, options strategist at brokerage firm Finance Investments in New York, said some options traders are buying puts on the assumption regulators would kill IBM's pursuit of Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is some concern that IBM might have some antitrust problems in attempting to acquire Sun," he said. "If that occurs, Sun Micro could go all the way back down toward $4 a share and these investors will make a killing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Doris Frankel; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  * Bank had $10 billion AIG exposure, $7.5 billion collateral
  * Goldman currently has zero net exposure
  * Goldman insisted on full payment before, after bailout
 (Adds details from CFO call)

 By Joseph A. Giannone

 NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) did nothing wrong when it accepted payments to close out
trades with American International Group (AIG.N), the giant
insurer rescued by the U.S. government, Goldman's chief
financial officer said on Friday.

 CFO David Viniar, in a conference call, answered questions
about Goldman's trading relationship with AIG, which was given
$180 billion of taxpayer funds in the last four months of 2008
to save it from collapse.

 The bailout sparked public outrage amid revelations that $90
billion of those funds were funneled quickly to banks that
traded with AIG. Goldman received $12.9 billion in payments and
collateral, while most AIG investors were wiped out and the
mounting cost of the bailout sparked outrage.

 Viniar told reporters the trades with AIG were "commercial
contracts" and the insurer was obligated to make good.

 "We don't think we did anything wrong," he said. "We had
commercial terms. It is our responsibility to our shareholders
to make sure that we are protecting ourselves."

 Viniar disclosed that Goldman held $7.5 billion of
collateral against $10 billion of AIG exposure when the
insurance company was bailed out. The remaining $2.5 billion was
hedged in the marketplace.

 Goldman's AIG exposure originally had a face value of $20
billion before market deterioration set in.

 Currently, Goldman has $6 billion of AIG exposure, offset in
part by $4.4 billion in collateral.

 Viniar said the bank had no material direct exposure to AIG
and has no net exposure now.

 Goldman amassed most of its AIG trading exposure in 2006, he
said. Goldman purchased credit protection from AIG to cover
potential losses on collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs.

 In the second half of 2007, as mortgage markets tumbled,
Viniar said Goldman and AIG disputed the value of these CDOs,
held by other Goldman counterparties. Goldman wanted AIG to post
more collateral to reflect the falling value of CDOs.

 Starting in July 2007, Goldman began to mark down certain
"super senior" AIG risk, and the two companies had some disputes
over collateral, he said. Goldman also scaled back its dealings
with AIG at the end of that year.

 As Goldman asked for more collateral from AIG, the insurer
tried to settle its credit default swap contracts at a discount
-- both before and after it received its first bailout last
September. Goldman refused and ultimately secured everything it
was owed by AIG.

 The collateral calls by Goldman and other trading partners
contributed to the insurer's sudden collapse. The initial
rescue, and two subsequent AIG bailout efforts, has become a
political flashpoint as the public watches billions of taxpayer
dollars fly out the door and land in the pockets of big banks.

 Yet Goldman only demanded what it was due, Viniar said.

 "That's why we enter into these contracts. That's why we
have collateral terms in the first place, to make sure that we
are protected," he said. "And all we did was call for the
collateral that was due to us under the contracts. I don't think
there's any guilt whatsoever."

 Viniar said that while Goldman would not have suffered
direct losses from AIG's failure, because it was hedged and
collateralized, a collapse would have disrupted the financial
markets.

 Critics complain that Goldman, whose alumni populate the
halls of government, benefits from its connections. Henry
Paulson, Treasury secretary when AIG was bailed out, is a former
Goldman CEO. The chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, Steve Friedman, is a former Goldman chairman.

 Goldman says it was not party to any discussions about a
government bailout of AIG.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK &amp; DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
There has been limited take up to date of Microsoft`s new Internet Explorer 8
according to research by StatCounter which provides free website traffic
statistics. According to StatCounter Global Stats global usage in the first day
of launch (March 19) was 1.39%. This is just above its previous day`s market
penetration of 1.33%. The new browser has been in public beta testing for about
a year. By 20th March 17:00 GMT IE 8 market share had risen to 1.56%. 

"I suppose the kindest description of user reaction IE 8`s first public outing
would be `underwhelming`," commented Aodhan Cullen, CEO and founder of
StatCounter. 

He contrasted the performance to the launch of Firefox 3 last June. "Firefox 3
managed to convert users from its previous browser. Usage of Firefox 3 more than
doubled from 7.8% at beta testing to 18.9% over a three day period following the
launch (June 16-18)." 

StatCounter is one of the largest website traffic monitoring companies in the
world with over two million members globally. Over 40% are located in the US
with 25% in Europe. Its analysis is based on four billion pageloads per month.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dutch navigation device maker TomTom filed a countersuit against Microsoft Corp, accusing the U.S. company of violating three of its patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed on Monday in the U.S. District Court for the eastern district of Virginia, comes a few weeks after Microsoft filed a complaint against TomTom for violating its patents related to car navigational technology and other computing functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies had failed to reach a patent-licensing agreement after more than a year of talks.

&lt;p&gt;Speakers Consider the Challenges Facing Insurers in South Africa
DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
FINEOS Corporation, a global provider of innovative enterprise software
solutions for insurance and bancassurance, in conjunction with its global
partner, IBM, has concluded a briefing entitled "Tackling Insurance Fraud in
South Africa". The briefing, which took place in Johannesburg, was attended by
representatives from the South African insurance industry. Sunjay Ramessuer, CIO
of the Road Accident Fund (RAF) was also in attendance. Last year, following a
world-wide extensive search and vendor evaluation, the RAF purchased the
enterprise edition of FINEOS Claims. The new solution is being implemented to
significantly improve claims outcomes, where bodily injury or death arises, for
any third party from the use of motor vehicles within the borders of South
Africa. 

Fraud affects all segments of the insurance industry globally whether it`s soft
fraud, where a claimant exaggerates their claim to any excess or deductible, or
hard fraud from collusion by providers and accident victims. Though not peculiar
to South Africa, the figures are nevertheless significant:

* Fraudulent claims are costing the short term insurance industry R3 billion per
annum 
* Short term insurance fraud is around 15% of premium 
* Long term insurance detected fraud amounts to more than R100 million per
annum

The audience was addressed by Michael Jansen, Partner, Financial Services, IBM
Global Business Services, and Fergal Heffernan, Business Development Manager,
FINEOS. The keynote speaker was Peter Goss, who is partner at Pricewaterhouse
Coopers in South Africa and responsible for Corporate Fraud and Governance. Mr
Goss looked at fraud risk assessment and the implications for insurers of fraud
and misconduct from the perspective of:

* Reputational Risk 
* Operational Risk 
* Legal/Compliance Risk 
* Financial and Non-Financial Reporting

Although the challenge facing the insurance industry is serious, the good news
is that technology can go a long way to help combat fraud and enhance overall
claims performance. 

According to Michael Kelly, CEO FINEOS, "As we face into difficult economic
times, insurers everywhere are experiencing and anticipating increases in
fraudulent claims. FINEOS delivers leading-edge specialist fraud detection tools
to help identify, manage and combat fraudulent activity. We believe there are
huge savings to be made if insurers can get this right".

&lt;p&gt;Program Brings Math and Science Career Options to Under-served Middle School
Students
DETROIT--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil, in conjunction with Dr. Bernard Harris and The Harris Foundation,
announced today the schedule for the second year of "The Dream Tour," a program
designed to help middle school students across the country reach their potential
through the power of strong math and science skills. Dr. Harris made this formal
announcement while speaking to 500 students at Brenda M. Scott Middle School in
Detroit. 

"Today`s students are different from my generation in that they`ve had
technology in their hands since birth," said Dr. Harris, a former NASA astronaut
and the first African American to walk in space. 

"My goal is to encourage them to be explorers, discover options outside typical
careers they hear about and help them see the unending opportunities they have
at their fingertips. This dialogue is critical if America is to remain
competitive with the world." 

This year`s tour is expected to draw more than 12,200 students at schools in
Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Miami, Minneapolis/St. Paul,
Mobile, Oakland and Seattle. 

Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil
Corporation, said education is important to the company and to the country. 

"Having a generation of math and science students is critical if our country
wants to continue its technological excellence," said Tillerson. "One way to do
that is through programs like The Dream Tour where we are able to reach and
encourage students who may not otherwise know about exciting careers in science
and technology." 

Dr. Harris started the program last year with ExxonMobil to inspire students and
increase awareness of the need for math and science education in communities
throughout the country. 

The high-energy tour features music, role models, an inspirational video,
demonstrations on life in the space shuttle and a discussion about achieving
dreams by Dr. Harris, who grew up in poverty and found success through
perseverance, hard work and a foundation of science, technology, engineering and
math skills. 

Last year`s tour included stops in Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New
York, Oklahoma City, St. Louis, San Antonio and Washington, D.C. where more than
8,500 students heard Dr. Harris` message. The tour targets inner-city schools
with significant minority populations. 

As another means to reach today`s students, Dr. Harris also announced that he
has begun posting regular updates on social media sites such as Facebook,
YouTube and Twitter.

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, Mar 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announces it has signed an agreement with Lloyd's,
the world's leading specialist insurance market, to trial the new Lloyd's
Exchange messaging service. The new service will trial the electronic
distribution of data between London Insurance Market insurers and
brokers, replacing traditional paper based operations.

    The Lloyd's Exchange is part of a series of initiatives to ensure London
continues to be the market of choice for placing insurance and reinsurance
business. This messaging service will provide a central point of contact
for the market by introducing web based technology that removes the need
for each organization to maintain multiple connections. The service will
use ACORD data standards to ensure a common framework and guidelines for
all communication within the London Market. This will provide a smarter
way of sharing information between insurance organizations and improved
access to third party services.

    "The Lloyd's Exchange demonstrates not only our commitment to accelerating
the pace of reform to improve customer service, cost efficiency and access
to the London market, but also our adoption of ACORD standards for
effective and efficient information exchange," said Sue Langley, Director,
Market Operations and North America, at Lloyd's. "In partnering with IBM,
we have selected a company with a proven track record in providing
messaging hubs as well as supporting successful change in the way markets
and industries operate."

    "This is an important first step for the Exchange and IBM is dedicated to
developing the service to help make operations more efficient and
cost-effective for the London Market," commented Graham Wright, UK
Insurance Leader, IBM Global Business Services. "Our messaging service
caters for all levels of technology sophistication so that the whole
market will be able to participate."

    The new Lloyd's Exchange service exploits IBM's proven capability in
providing standards based electronic messaging exchanges. The service is
based on the imarket electronic trading network for the UK company market
which IBM built and has run since 2003.

    As well as providing its core messaging service, IBM will supplement this
with a range of business and technical services which will be used to
establish, implement and support the new service. In addition, IBM will
provide a Starter Connection Pack to allow companies with no existing
messaging capability to construct, send and receive messages across the
Lloyd's Exchange.

    The service is operational today and will be available for the initial
wave of market participants in the second quarter 2009, with a
progressive roll out across the market in the second half of the year and
into early 2010.

    The contract was signed in February 2009.

    Lloyd's is the world's leading specialist insurance market. Lloyd's
underwriting capacity at 1 January 2008 is GBP 15.95 billion which will be

managed by 46 managing agents and supported by 176 brokers. It is the

surplus lines insurer in the US.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Pfizer to Trim Animal Health Biz

Yesterday, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced that it may have to sell a portion
of its animal health business in order to gain regulatory clearance for its
proposed purchase of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: WYE). On January 26, 2009,
Pfizer announced that it planned to buy Wyeth for about $68 billion. 

The merger would create a company with combined revenue of about $71 million,
according to Pfizer's estimates. We forecast revenue from the combined animal
health businesses would equal about $3.8 billion in 2009 before any
divestitures, making it the largest in the world. Schering-Plough (NYSE: SGP)
had held that title since its purchase of Organon BioSciences in November 2007.
Schering's animal health sales were almost $3 billion in 2008. 

China Mobile a Buy on Stimulus

China Mobile (NYSE: CHL) reported 2008 annual results today along with
encouraging 2009 expectations based on the Government of China's estimated
economic stimulus program of 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion). The company
believes the domestic stimulus plan will stimulate demand for telecommunications
and information services with the active promotion of homegrown innovation. 

From a financial perspective, total 2008 revenue reached RMB $412 billion, up
15.5% from 2007. Net profit to shareholders for full year 2008 increased 29.6%
to RMB 112 billion and the dividend payout ratio was approximately 43%. Total
subscriber count exceeded 457 million with net subscriber additions averaging
over 7.3 million per month. The company plans to maintain its dividend payout
ratio at 43%. We reiterate our Buy rating. 

AIG Execs, Give It Back!

Apparently the contracts that were signed by AIG (NYSE: AIG) with its executives
in its Financial Products unit -- the part of the company that wrote all the
Credit Default Swaps and sank the company and almost sank the world financial
system -- are iron clad. So says Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and AIG CEO Ed
Liddy (installed at only $1 a year after the mess had been made). 

I'm a finance and economics guy, not a lawyer, but it does strike me that there
are probably several grounds on which the contracts are at least ambiguous
enough that the company should have avoided paying them. If a company knows it
is in financial trouble, it cannot strike sweetheart deals with some parties
that transfer the assets of the company to them at the expense of other
interested parties. This is the essence of the idea of fraudulent convenience.

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration aims to support the development of innovative healthcare solutions
in China that are sustainable, socially responsible, and financially viable
NEW YORK &amp; PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc and PlaNet Finance announced today that they will team up to conduct
an in-depth research project on the healthcare needs of the working poor in
China. The study will examine the availability and existing sources of
medicines, patient purchasing patterns, and the level of access to medical
services. The study ultimately aims to help both organizations identify models
that may enhance and expand access to medicines and healthcare services for the
working poor in China. 

The Chinese Ministry of Health recently released the results of its 4th National
Health Survey, an extensive document covering healthcare patterns across the
country. The Pfizer and PlaNet Finance collaboration is designed to solicit
additional information from low-income populations in China to complement
existing and planned government efforts to improve healthcare. 

Pfizer`s mission in China is to meet the diverse medical needs of the country`s
population through a broad portfolio of innovative medicines and partnerships
with local healthcare providers, academics, and government in order to support
the rapid development of the country`s healthcare system. 

"Pfizer`s partnership with PlaNet Finance is aligned with the strategy to expand
our geographic reach across China. I am extremely confident that this
partnership will also achieve the broader aim of identifying unique and workable
solutions for the diverse medical needs of patients in Emerging Markets," stated
Jean-Michel Halfon, President &amp; General Manager of Pfizer`s Emerging Markets
Business Unit. "This is another step forward under our Global Access program,
which is unique in that we are taking a broad, holistic approach to
understanding the various barriers to healthcare access, so that we can
implement solutions that are effective and sustainable." 

For over ten years, and in over 60 countries, PlaNet Finance has been active in
development and financing in the microfinance and microinsurance sectors.
"Healthcare plays a major role in the fight against poverty. PlaNet Finance
understands this challenge and has developed specific programs which link
microfinance to healthcare - leveraging existing microfinance institution (MFI)
infrastructure to implement awareness and prevention campaigns for malaria,
HIV/AIDS, and other diseases. PlaNet Finance has also developed sustainable life
and health insurance solutions for low-income populations through its subsidiary
PlaNet Guarantee dedicated to microinsurance," explained PlaNet Finance
President Jacques Attali. "We are very pleased to team up with Pfizer; this
partnership will enhance our work in meaningful and lasting ways to reach out to
such a vital part of Chinese society to determine their healthcare needs." 

This collaboration with an international non-profit organization, expert in
microfinance and microinsurance, marks another milestone for Pfizer in its goal
to increase access to medicines for more patients in the developing world. The
company reiterated its position to adopt strategies that are commercially viable
and socially responsible. 

Pfizer and PlaNet Finance look forward to sharing the results of this research
with the Chinese government, in order to maximize its impact and reach
throughout the country.

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, March 21 (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] (QP)
and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) will delay by up to 12 months the
development of the $5-billion Barzan gas field joint venture,
primarily to cut costs, London-based MEED magazine reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Contractors who were expecting to bid for the engineering,
procurement and construction part of the project in April
received an official notice on March 16 informing them that QP
had postponed the project," MEED reported without citing a
source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The developers will also use the delay to source gas for the
project from a new structure in Qatar's North field, MEED said,
citing a source familiar with the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are looking at sourcing this gas from a new structure,
although the details have yet to be finalised ... We are
expecting a one-year delay," the source, quoted by MEED, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Alex Dodds, general manager for ExxonMobil Corporation
Qatar, told MEED the project would be executed on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are still working with QP on the concepts, the schedule
and on when that demand (for gas) will materialise ... The
schedule and deadline for the requirement is still there and the
intention is that it will still be met," MEED quoted Dodds as
saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barzan is part of the gas development scheme for the North
field, the world's largest non-associated gas field, and aims to
meet the natural gas requirements of the growing local market
for electricity generation, desalination and industrial
consumption, MEED said.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, March 24 (Reuters) - Dell Inc's DELL.O chief
executive Michael Dell said rumours of IBM (IBM.N) possibly
buying Sun Microsystems JAVA.O were creating an "enormous
opportunity" for Dell because uncertainty over the future of
Sun's Solaris-based servers accelerates a customer migration to
X86-based Linux server, which is Dell's mainstay product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dell, the world's No. 2 PC maker, also said in Tokyo that the
company was exploring the business of smaller screen devices.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays is in talks with Goldman Sachs about a sale of the British bank's iShares unit, a source familiar with the situation said, adding one more name to a growing list of possible bidders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, sources said that private equity groups Hellman  Friedman, Bain Capital and TPG had all shown interest in iShares, the exchange-traded funds provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HF wanted to form a consortium and was eyeing an offer of around $5 billion, while Bain Capital and Goldman were mulling separate offers, the first source said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bids for the business are not due until at least this Thursday, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the Financial Times reported on its website that other trade bidders that are thought to be interested in iShares include Vanguard, the U.S. fund manager specializing in index-tracking funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays, which said last week it may sell the iShares exchange-traded funds provider, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have put the value of iShares -- part of Barclays Global Investors, the San Francisco-based fund management arm -- at around 3 billion pounds ($4.37 billion), more than one-third of Barclays's market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street journal reported on Friday that Barclays was offering to finance the purchase of the unit, lending up to 80 percent of the unit's price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital, the investment bank, is one of the biggest providers of funding for buyouts, but like all banks it has pulled back on providing buyout loans during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be more willing to provide a big loan for a business it knows so well, however, especially if it helps its parent achieve a deal to secure much-needed cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays could use the proceeds of any disposal to cover the cost of joining a government scheme to insure banks against losses on risky assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sale could also remove the need for the bank to sell new shares, or issue them directly to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would enable Barclays to avoid surrendering a stake to the government, in contrast to other British banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Victoria Howley; Writing by Douwe Miedema; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) may sell part of its 4.9 percent stake in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS), the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move could raise $1 billion for Goldman, these people told the WSJ.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - Barclays (BARC.L) is in talks
with Goldman Sachs (GS.N) about a sale of the British bank's
iShares unit, a source familiar with the situation said, adding
one more name to a growing list of possible bidders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This weekend, sources said that private equity groups
Hellman  Friedman, Bain Capital and TPG [TPG.UL] had all shown
interest in iShares, the exchange-traded funds provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HF wanted to form a consortium and was eyeing an offer of
around $5 billion, while Bain Capital and Goldman were mulling
separate offers, the first source said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bids for the business are not due until at least this
Thursday, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, the Financial Times reported on its website
that other trade bidders that are thought to be interested in
iShares include Vanguard, the U.S. fund manager specialising in
index-tracking funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays, which said last week it may sell the iShares
exchange-traded funds provider, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have put the value of iShares -- part of Barclays
Global Investors, the San Francisco-based fund management arm
-- at around 3 billion pounds ($4.37 billion), more than
one-third of Barclays's market capitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street journal reported on Friday that Barclays
was offering to finance the purchase of the unit, lending up to
80 percent of the unit's price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays Capital, the investment bank, is one of the
biggest providers of funding for buyouts, but like all banks it
has pulled back on providing buyout loans during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It might be more willing to provide a big loan for a
business it knows so well, however, especially if it helps its
parent achieve a deal to secure much-needed cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays could use the proceeds of any disposal to cover
the cost of joining a government scheme to insure banks against
losses on risky assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A sale could also remove the need for the bank to sell new
shares, or issue them directly to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would enable Barclays to avoid surrendering a stake to
the government, in contrast to other British banks such as
Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Lloyds Banking Group
(LLOY.L).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Electronic Trading (GSET) announced today several new features of
its US listed options offering, including three new algorithms (Pegging,
Volatility Limit, and Strike), the ability to auto-hedge options orders, and a
more diverse offering of connectivity to broker-neutral trading and pricing
platforms. 

The addition of Pegging, Volatility Limit and Strike brings GSET`s total number
of advanced options trading strategies to seven.

* The Pegging algorithm allows the user to peg all or a portion of an order to
the bid or offer. 
* The Volatility Limit algorithm orders will take the user`s assumptions on
volatility, interest rates and dividends to monitor the market and sweep all
liquidity when marketable. 
* Building on the success of the SIGMA options smart router, Strike offers the
elements of market sweeping, pegging, stealth and discretion all in one
algorithm.

An additional enhancement to the options algorithmic suite is the ability for
customers to auto- hedge their positions. This enables option traders to
automatically execute equity hedges in real time as the option order is filled.
This logic will leverage the available suite of equity algorithms to achieve
immediate execution, while minimizing market impact by interacting with Goldman
Sachs` dark pool, SIGMA X, the largest in the U.S. (Tabb Group, 2008).
Auto-hedging can be applied to any of the existing options algorithms. 

Clients can access Goldman Sachs` electronic options capabilities via REDIPlus&#174;,
the firm`s award-winning Execution Management System, or via a third party,
broker-neutral platform. GSET is investing significantly to make its complete
electronic options offering available via several OMS and EMS providers,
including Derivix, thinkorswim and Bloomberg EMSX. Additionally, GSET completed
integration with Orc Software`s Advanced Execution Platform, Orc Trading. 

JP Xenakis, head of electronic listed options sales at GSET noted, "In this
period of sustained market volatility, clients applying options strategies are
faced with an entirely new set of opportunities and challenges. We`ve seen a
significant increase in client demand to trade options electronically. We
recognized the importance of providing clients with the appropriate algorithmic
strategies and trading tools - and enabling them to access these resources from
the EMS of their choice." 

GSET has offered electronic options trading for nearly 10 years and executes
over 1.2 million US options contracts each day. In addition to the latest
options algorithms, clients can take advantage of SIGMA smart routing, four
additional algorithmic strategies, connectivity to all seven US options
exchanges, and complex order types, including butterflies, straddles, strangles,
and custom strategies. GSET also provides execution of global equity options and
global options on futures. 

Goldman Sachs Execution &amp; Clearing, L.P., through its GSET platform, provides
clients with the necessary execution tools and services to manage the investment
process from start to finish, from pre-trade analysis to post-trade consulting.
Clients access our global offering via REDIPlus and FIX, available for trading
global equities, options, futures, foreign exchange and swaps. Customers can
seek liquidity using our suite of multi-asset algorithms, route to optimal
destinations using SIGMA router and take advantage of one of the largest U.S.
crossing networks, SIGMA X.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA and ARMONK, NY, Mar 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
InSync Software, Inc. today announced it has signed an original equipment
manufacturer agreement with IBM (NYSE: IBM) that will allow the company
to integrate IBM open technology into its own Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) and sensor-driven food safety and asset management
products. InSync will offer IBM's InfoSphere Traceability Server software
as part of its food safety solutions for customers worldwide.

    Food safety is a top-of-mind issue around the world today. In the U.S.
alone, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 76 million
Americans become ill, more than 300,000 are hospitalized, and 5,000 die
each year from food-borne illness. President Obama's budget proposal
included $1 billion for the Food and Drug Administration to spend on
improving food safety, and legislation was recently introduced in the U.S.
Senate to address this issue. Sensor technologies can also play an
important role creating a safer food supply.

    Aimed at companies in the fresh and processed foods, meat and poultry,
construction, and chemical industries, InSync's products use sensor
technologies to locate and track assets and processes, improve
efficiencies, and manage risk. The software integrates and makes sense of
data collected from networks of sensors including Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) or bar code readers, and mobile handheld devices.
The software helps businesses reduce costs by identifying and eliminating
logistical bottlenecks in areas such as shipping and receiving,
warehousing and more. InSync's products can report on an item's location
and its condition in real-time, and automate time consuming and
error-prone manual processes.

    "Our collaboration with IBM allows us to offer our customers a complete
and standards-based smart food traceability solution they can use with
their trading partners," said Ashish Chona, CEO of InSync Software, Inc.
"Using IBM's traceability software, we can reduce complexity for
customers who want to get up and running in quickly and at a cost that
makes sense for their business while ensuring consumer safety, a key
challenge in the market today."

    To enable food producers to share information with trading partners
outside their four walls, InSync is embedding IBM's InfoSphere
Traceability Server into its applications. InfoSphere Traceability Server
is industry-standard software that allows trading partners to track their
products as they move through the global supply chain. The product is
fully compliant with GS1 EPCglobal's Electronic Product Code Information
Services (EPCIS) standard for capturing and sharing information on a
product's location, temperature, and other relevant data. The IBM
software will allow companies to use InSync's software to share
information concerning food origins or other important information with
any trading partner that is also using an EPCIS compliant solution.

    "Our software gives each food item or pallet a unique serial number for
easy traceability at any point in the supply chain," said Christian
Clauss, director of sensor network solutions, IBM. "Together, InSync and
IBM can help food producers use innovative sensor solutions to boost
efficiency while creating a smarter, safer food supply for all of us."

    InfoSphere Traceability Server is used across multiple industries to solve
a variety of challenges. In the food industry, it is used by Metro Group
and Matiq, the information technology subsidiary of Nortura, Norway's
largest food supplier, to improve food safety and freshness.

    InSync's food safety applications, such as GREENTrace, benefit from the
added traceability and data exchange features offered in IBM's InfoSphere
Traceability. Now food producers and manufacturers can share important
product data from GREENTrace with retailers. For partners in the food
ecosystem that are connected to the solution, complete traceability from
field-to-fork and operational optimization is now achievable creating a
more interconnected supply chain.

and sensor technologies to locate and track assets, improve operational
efficiencies, and manage risks. InSync's innovative software combines

manage assets regardless of their location. InSync's solutions provide
customers with advanced levels of process governance and collaboration

&lt;p&gt;  HANOI, VIETNAM, Mar 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has been selected by Gtel Mobile
to build a high performance IT infrastructure, mobile service network and
a range of business solutions to support its commercial launch this year.
In its pursuit to become one of Vietnam's leading mobile service
providers, Gtel Mobile wanted to offer the exciting customer experience,
as well as the latest services and applications that will differentiate
itself from existing players in the Vietnam marketplace.

    Announced last year as the seventh mobile phone service provider in
Vietnam in a joint venture between GTEL and VimpelCom, Gtel Mobile is
looking to IBM for advice and support while preparing for the launch of
services later this year. Vietnam's telecommunications industry is
growing at 20 to 25 percent a year, with more than 50 million mobile
service users.

    Under a multi-million-dollar agreement signed in early March 2009, IBM
will facilitate the implementation of the Global System for Mobile
communications (GSM) network for Gtel Mobile to manage the 24/7 operation
of the company.

    IBM will also provide the technology and associated services to build the
business solutions for Billing, Customer Care and Value Added Services.
This will enable Gtel Mobile to efficiently launch basic mobile services
including call forwarding, call waiting, call holding and voice mail.
After the launch of the basic services, Gtel Mobile plans to deploy a
range of new and high-end services to offer its clients an exciting
experience.

    GTEL is an example of a Smart Communications Service Provider that is
going beyond just providing basic connectivity to enable individuals and
organizations to interact in ways that were possible through innovation
with the flexibility, adaptability and speed to market required to meet
today's market demands.

    "As a new player in the mobile service market, Gtel Mobile wanted to
leverage the latest technology to set up the modern mobile system
available for users in the Vietnam marketplace," said Mr. Alexey Blyumin,
CEO, Gtel Mobile. "The strategic partnership with IBM, which has vast
industry experience and insights, will allow Gtel Mobile to quickly
succeed in Vietnam."

    The collaboration with IBM will give Gtel Mobile a powerful, secure and
agile technology infrastructure, enabling its employees to provide
customers with the services -- conference calling, mobile email, roaming
and wireless application protocols (WAP) -- that are benchmarked against
the international telecommunications industry standards for safety,
stability and delivery efficiency.

    "The depth and breadth of IBM Global Business Consulting Services'
experience and expertise in the telecommunications industry enabled us to
meet GTEL's demand and development orientation with the most appropriate
solutions and services," said Mr. Vo Tan Long, Country General Manager,
IBM Vietnam.

    Gtel Mobile's technology infrastructure, enabled by IBM hardware and
software, is based on industry standards with pre-integrated capabilities,
providing simple management, security and scalability to meet the future
development requirements. IBM Global Technology Services will also provide
Gtel Mobile with technical and maintenance support including site, network
and system implementation and helpdesk services.

&lt;p&gt;Estimated 16,000 Gallons of Oil Remain in Alaskan Waters; Three Recommendations
Made to Reduce Impacts of Offshore Oil Drilling
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Tomorrow marks 20 years since the Exxon Valdez oil spill dumped nearly 11
million gallons of crude oil into Alaskan waters, resulting in the most severe
impacts on the environment of any spill anywhere. The spill eventually
devastated hundreds of miles of coastline, damaged ocean ecosystems and
community resources, and distressed the local economy by closing commercial
fisheries and hampering tourism. Though twenty years have passed, 16,000 gallons
of oil remain in the water from this spill and three animal species still have
not recovered. 

As Congress and the White House continue the national debate on offshore oil
drilling, we still need to learn our lessons from the largest oil spill in U.S.
waters. According to a report by the U.S. Coast Guard, six major and five medium
spills totaling more than nine million gallons resulted from hurricanes Katrina
and Rita. Many of the world's 10,000 oil tankers still do not have safer double
hulls to help prevent catastrophic spills. 

"Nearly a generation later there are still many threats that our addiction to
oil poses to coastal communities, marine wildlife, the economy, and our
ocean-the life support system of our planet. Now is the time to act in order to
make no-regrets choices. We must take three steps to protect our ocean," said
Dennis Takahashi-Kelso, Ocean Conservancy Executive Vice President and former
Alaska commissioner of environmental conservation at the time of the Exxon
Valdez spill. Mr. Takahashi-Kelso boarded the tanker a few hours after the spill
began to enforce clean-up standards and he helped strengthen applicable laws for
the next two years. 

Ocean Conservancy urges three actions to protect our ocean from the impacts of
offshore oil drilling:

* First, we must use faster, cheaper, safer energy options to solve the oil
crisis, cut individual energy bills, and quickly reduce America's dependence on
foreign oil and we must be particularly careful in vulnerable environments like
the Arctic. 
* Second, we need a comprehensive, conservation-centered plan to put order in
the ocean to manage the many competing energy and industrial uses, which are
impairing the sustainability of our ocean and are leading to coastal sprawl,
just as our land has urban sprawl. 
* Third, it is time to create an ocean investment fund that sets aside revenue
generated from ocean industry uses to pay for activities and projects that
maintain and restore marine ecosystem health.

"The Exxon Valdez spill is a prime example of the threats from offshore oil
drilling and transportation of oil to our ocean. We must be particularly careful
in vulnerable environments like the Arctic. In light of the tremendous and rapid
changes to the Arctic and its seas due to global climate change, we need a `time
out` on these activities until we have information we need to protect marine
life and coastal communities. Currently, no capacity is in place to handle
accidents and oil spills in its ice-filled seas, a frequent condition in Arctic
waters," concluded Mr. Takahashi-Kelso.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical`s Exxtral performance polyolefins have been specified for
the front and rear bumpers of the new Renault Laguna Coupe. Exxtral BMU131
performance polyolefin is being used for the front bumper, front grille and
headlight trim, and Exxtral BMU133 polyolefin for the rear bumper. 

"The main challenge in meeting Renault`s specifications was developing a
specialty compound for the front bumper which provides outstanding fit and
finish," said Samuel Deboos, automotive sales manager, Europe, ExxonMobil
Chemical. "Exxtral BMU131 polyolefin met their expectations." 

Exxtral BMU131 polyolefin is a UV-stable grade exhibiting excellent aesthetics
because of its broad processing window that helps to eliminate large-part
injection molding challenges such as "tiger stripes." Requiring no mixing or
blending at the molding presses, these ready-to-inject, fast-cycling grades can
improve productivity and deliver cost-savings. 

Both grades are characterized by a unique impact strength that provides the
essential balance between stiffness and toughness required for bumper
applications. They offer a low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CLTE)
for excellent dimensional stability. 

The Laguna Coupe application is an excellent example of collaboration between
the automotive original equipment manufacturer (Renault), the Tier One supplier
(Plastic Omnium), and the specialty compound supplier (ExxonMobil Chemical) to
meet expectations across the supply chain. 

At Plastic Omnium`s design center in Sainte-Julie near Lyon, France, ExxonMobil
Chemical provided technical assistance to demonstrate the capabilities of the
Exxtral BMU131 and BMU133 polyolefin grades. Exxtral performance polyolefins
have also been specified for bumper applications on the 2006 Renault Espace and
2007 Renault Laguna. 

"ExxonMobil Chemical`s portfolio of Exxtral performance polyolefins is becoming
increasingly popular with automotive designers and processors looking for new
materials that offer opportunities to reduce weight and cost without sacrificing
performance," Deboos said.

and time consuming technology upgrades.

engagement campaign, including mass mailing and telephone outreach designed
to educate borrowers on loan modification options.

fulfillment according to investor and servicer business rules, including:
collection of required documentation, verification of borrower eligibility,
document preparation, and customer care.

enabling borrowers to complete the majority of the loan modification
process through over the Internet.
--  Imaging Services - Closing coordination between servicers and investors
is a critical factor in ensuring success of modification efforts. IBM
images all documents involved in the loan modification process and can
provide an investor portal to enable investors to have visibility
throughout the modification process.

    
"Loan servicing companies and investors face complex operational
challenges in the area of loan modification, as well as increasing
pressures from governments, regulators and unprecedented customer
volume," said Eric Ray, general manager, Financial Services Sector, IBM
Managed Business Process Services. "IBM recognizes these challenges and
has developed a powerful loan modification services tool to help existing
and potential clients operate with maximum efficiency and cost
effectiveness."

    IBM's new loan modification services offering has been designed as a

&lt;p&gt;March 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added BBT Corp (BBT.N)
to its "conviction sell list," citing high exposure to
residential construction and expectation of further reserve
building due to economic deterioration in the Southeast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; BBT's nonperforming assets (NPA) continue to accelerate
and its residential construction, which is well above average
exposure, will remain a major concern, Goldman Sachs said in a
note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect a 'perfect storm' for NPA formation in the first
half of 2009 with both deteriorating house prices and rising
unemployment leading to the fastest rate of NPA formation since
the start of the crisis," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also cut its price target on the Southeast
regional bank by $3 to $14 and lowered its 2009 earnings view
to $1.10 from $1.25 on the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman added that BBT has been the least aggressive in
writing off legacy construction loans as it has taken
charge-offs equal to 22 percent of its seriously delinquent and
non-performing construction loans compared with 34 percent for
peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it is cautious on banks, as the group will not
bottom, until the rate of growth of non-performing assets
decelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of BBT rose 62 cents, or about 4 percent, to $17.95
in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Mar 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
According to a major new global IBM (NYSE: IBM) study released today,
media companies are falling behind in meeting the growing expectations of
digital savvy consumers and the advertisers looking to reach them. Based
on surveys of 2,800 consumers across six countries and extensive
one-on-one interviews with advertising industry professionals around the
globe, the study indicates a growing rift between advertisers and content
owners, media distributors and agencies.

    Advertisers are aggressively shifting their spend to even more
interactive, measurable formats, as providers struggle to move "beyond
advertising" to new forms of communication that combine the ROI
characteristics of direct marketing with the brand characteristics of
traditional advertising.

    To compete in this new era of advertising, media companies and content
suppliers will have to fundamentally change the way they deliver
information to their audiences. Given the explosive growth in online and
digital media formats, and the decline in traditional advertising (such as
print, TV and radio), the study suggests that companies are placing their
growth strategies at risk if they cannot evolve into more of a marketing
services model as they identify and adopt the next generation of digital
formats.

    "To succeed -- especially in the current economic environment -- media
companies will need to develop a new set of capabilities to support the
industry's evolving demands which include micro targeting, real-time ROI
measurement and cross-platform integration," said Saul Berman, IBM Global
Leader for Strategy and Change Consulting Services, and co-author of the
new study. "Now is the time for companies to move quickly to become more
effective with their assets and build for the future."

    The study titled "Beyond Advertising: Choosing a Strategic Path to the
Digital Consumer" was developed by IBM Global Business Services' Media and
Entertainment practice and the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV). The
results indicate that four important trends are emerging: consumer
adoption of new distribution formats, a shift in advertising spend,
digital migration of platforms and the emergence of new capabilities due
to moves by new entrants and existing players.

    Influence of the Digital Savvy Consumer

    Consumers are accelerating their adoption of digital content services such
as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook with varying levels of engagement.
Between 2007 and 2008, the adoption of social networking tools soared to
60 percent from 33 percent; online/portable music services more than
doubled to 46 percent from 22 percent; mobile internet data plans nearly
tripled to 41 percent from 15 percent; and access to mobile music and
video quadrupled to 35 percent from seven percent.

    The study indicates that mass marketing faces many challenges as the
audience becomes increasingly harder to target and fund from an integrated
marketing perspective. Reaching diverse segments will require niche
offerings and contextual search capabilities that are tailored for new
platforms, new offerings and by geographic market.

    "Media, entertainment and advertising agencies must realize consumers are
open to sharing information under the right conditions," said Bill
Battino, Managing Partner, Global Communications Sector, IBM Global
Business Services, and co-author of the study. "Our research shows
consumers are willing to trade knowledge about their usage and
preferences for content and associated targeted marketing offers.
Companies that excel in permission-based advertising will take share of
marketing dollars."

    Shift in Advertising Spending

    Over the last decade, advertisers followed their audience and shifted to
more interactive, measurable formats such as the Internet and mobile --
which are expected to gain 20 percent share of overall spend, even in this
economy. The study indicates that 63 percent of global Chief Marketing
Officers expect to increase interactive/online marketing spend while 65
percent expect to decrease traditional advertising.

    This shift will come at the expense of traditional marketing as
advertisers follow their audience's migration to new channels. Digital
online formats will enable advertisers the ability to more effectively
measure and analyze campaign results to prove the value of their spend.

    Shift to "Brands-Actional" Advertising

    The continued migration to digital platforms blurs the distinction between
advertising and marketing and allows advertisers to pursue two format
objectives simultaneously. In the past, platforms were aligned with either
transaction or brand objectives. For example, phone, direct mail and
promotions could address transaction objectives like targeting, ROI,
measurement and response. In contrast, platforms like TV, print, outdoor
and radio made it easier to address brand objectives. New digital formats
-- such as social media, online video, mobile, gaming, branded
entertainment and advanced TV -- can be used to simultaneously address
both transaction and brand requirements: a move to what the study calls
"brands-actional" advertising. As a result, advertisers that previously
focused on delivering either ROI-driven marketing or brand-oriented
advertising to the market can now cater to both sets of objectives.

    Suppliers Can't Meet Demand

    According to the study, today's suppliers (agencies, content networks and
distributors) are not ready to meet the demands of the digital consumer
and advertiser. Eighty percent of advertising industry participants
interviewed for the study expect the industry to be at least five years
away from being able to deliver true cross-platform advertising
(including sales, delivery, measurement and analysis).

    The study emphasizes that advertisers must deliver consumer-centric
marketing -- which involves combining more granular targeting and
measurement with cross-platform integration -- in order to be successful
and meet the growing digital demands of consumers. Granularity is the
basis for ROI driven advertising -- which implies the ability to
micro-target and interact with desired consumers while measuring response
and impact. Integration enables the delivery of messaging to consumers in
compelling, innovative ways across platforms, and tightly coupled with the
emotionality, sensitivity, pace and genre of the content within which it
is placed.

     IBM Survey Methodology

    To continue tracking both end-user consumer behavior and leading industry
expert opinions about advertising, the IBM Institute for Business Value
used two primary forms of research: an online consumer survey and
one-on-one interviews with industry professionals. The online survey was
conducted during the third quarter of 2008, generating 2,800 responses
from six countries: Australia, Germany, India, Japan, the UK and the U.S.
The respondent group was split 50/50 male/female, proportionately reaching
demographic and economic groups age 13 years and over.

    To assess industry strategies, over 70 one-on-one sessions were conducted
with global participants across the advertising value chain, representing
the following types of organizations: Content owners, Media distributors,
Agencies, Advertisers, Research organizations/analysts, Advertising
enablers, Information providers, media networks and advertising.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * To add four new offices in China within 12 months &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Clients to focus on internal adjustment &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Eyes tapping into infrastructure sector &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Michael Wei &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    BEIJING, March 23 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) expects its China business consulting unit to almost double in size within a year to cater for increasing demands from local firms despite the economic slowdown, a senior executive said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In order to be close to clients the number of offices of the IBM Global Business Services (GBS) unit will grow to 10 from six now within the next 12 months, said Marc Chapman, the general manager of GBS, Greater China Group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe it's vital to be close to your clients," Chapman told Reuters in an interview.    The GBS arm will open the four additional offices having established its Nanjing and Shenzhen branches earlier this year, Chapman said. IBM's business consulting arm now serves more than 100 clients in China, with over half of them Chinese firms, including telecoms equipment maker Huawei [HWT.UL] and state-owned resource firm China Minmetals Corporation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Facing a slowdown in the broad economy, some Chinese firms are now refocusing on managing their existing business instead of expanding, aiming to emerge stronger when the market turns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Chapman said many of GBS's clients are telling him: "Hey, we'll pause; we won't build so much this year. But we'll integrate everything we have and get more out of it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In 2008 revenues generated from the GBS segment were $19.6 billion, roughly 19 percent of total revenue of the Armonk, New York-headquartered firm. Chapman did not give a comparable figure for the region he is in charge of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    With governments across the world spending money to stimulate economies more investments will be made in infrastructure and GBS will actively seek opportunites in the sector in China, Chapman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Beijing unveiled late last year a sweeping 4-trillion yuan stimulus package of spending over the next two years, with a large portion of the funds targeting infrastructure projects such as railways and roads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are very supportive of finding areas where we can really provide support, add value to either the government or companies," Chapman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He cited its business with Guangzhou Metro as an example. The subway operator has selected IBM to provide a system to manage all of the firm's assets with a target of doubling its passenger volume to 4 million per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Michelle Chen; Editing by Greg Mahlich) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((michael.wei@thomsonreuters.com; +86 1381 177 7665; Reuters Messaging: michael.wei.reuters.com@reuters.net)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((If you have a query or comment on this story, send an email to news.feedback.asia@thomsonreuters.com))   Keywords: IBM/CHINA  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS, March 23 (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) has completed the long-contested sale of its Nigerian
fuel marketing businesses, part of efforts to shrink its
marketing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company said in an announcement late on Friday it had
sold Chevron Nigeria Holdings Ltd to Corlay Global SA, a
Panamanian firm owned by an Africa-based consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Nigeria Holdings owns 60 percent of Chevron Oil
Nigeria Plc CHEV.LG, formerly Texaco Plc, which is listed in
Lagos and which owns downstream marketing assets in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's divestment from the downstream sector of Africa's
top oil producer has been controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Nigerian court ordered Chevron's local unit to suspend
sale plans last August after a challenge by local firm Zenon
Petroleum and Gas Ltd, which also held a stake in the gasoline
retailer said it feared a sale to what it called an "incompetent
bidder" would be against the interests of other shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron subsequently announced in September that it had
agreed to sell several of its West African fuels marketers to
Corlay in what it said was an effort to align its marketing
operations with its refinery assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria's senior oil workers' union also initially contested
the sale, saying outstanding labour issues needed to be resolved
before any divestment could go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said in a statement its upstream operations in
Nigeria, the world's eighth biggest crude oil exporter, were not
affected by the sale.

Ltd. to General Electric Company</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;LIMERICK, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Teleflex Incorporated ("Teleflex") has completed the previously announced sale
of its 51 percent share of Airfoil Technologies International - Singapore Pte.
Ltd., a joint venture between General Electric Company ("GE") and Teleflex, to
GE. 

The divested business was part of the Teleflex Aerospace Segment and had annual
revenues of approximately $250 million comprised of both repair and replacement
component revenues. The cash transaction was valued at $300 million and is
expected to result in an after tax gain on sale of approximately $195 million or
$4.89 per diluted share. Approximately $190 million of after tax proceeds are
expected to be used to repay currently outstanding borrowings. 

As a result of ATI being reclassified to discontinued operations and the current
outlook for the continuing businesses, the Company anticipates diluted earnings
per share from continuing operations for the full year 2009 before special
charges to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.55 per diluted share. Special charges
for the year are expected to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.40 per diluted
share. The previously provided guidance for cash flow from continuing operations
is expected to be reduced by approximately $70 million to a range of $210
million to $220 million as a result of the ATI sale. The estimated impact of the
divestiture on 2009 free cash flow&#185; is a reduction of approximately $30 million
including the elimination of minority interest dividends to GE. 

"In light of the economy we expect challenges to the initial revenue growth
targets that we set for the year, however we are implementing cost containment
measures expected to offset the bottom line impact," stated Jeffrey P. Black,
chairman and chief executive officer. 

Said Black, "The completion of this transaction allows us to further reduce our
outstanding debt and provides additional financial flexibility to support future
growth. We greatly appreciate the contributions that the ATI employees have made
to Teleflex over the years and are pleased to transition the businesses to GE, a
well respected industry leader." 

"I am also pleased to announce that John Suddarth, President of the Aerospace
segment since 2004, will also assume management responsibility of the Commercial
segment, as its President," commented Black. 

Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP acted as legal advisor to Teleflex on this
transaction.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its view on the European auto sector to "attractive" based on an expectation that the worst was over, with the decline in Western European car sales reaching a trough in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Buying the European auto sector at the time of Western European sales decline troughs has generated significant absolute and relative share price returns since 1973," Goldman said, adding the sector currently presents one of the best buying opportunities in 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman raised French car maker Renault SA (RENA.PA) and the Swedish truck company Scania AB SCVb.ST to "neutral" from "sell." It also upgraded Autoliv Inc (ALV.N) and Leoni AG (LEOGn.DE) to "buy" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Car sales should start to receive downside support from government incentive programs in countries such as Germany, Italy, France and, possibly, even the UK and the United States, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage said with sales volumes stabilizing, the car industry could start to see a reversal in some of the working capital outflows it suffered during 2008 -- when it faced demand destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With greater visibility on potential working capital outflows, we believe the sector's current trough enterprise valuations are likely also to mark the trough in equity values," the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, industry management expectations and consensus estimates for 2009/2010 have fallen significantly over the last few months and now reflect a more realistic economic outcome, Goldman said in a note titled "Switching the light on at the end of the tunnel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Goldman said it does not expect sales volumes to rebound anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to model a rather muted recovery in Europe, with a flat 2010 market outlook (in volume terms)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It downgraded Peugeot SA (PEUP.PA) by a notch to "sell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage reiterated its "conviction buy" rating on Fiat FIA.MI and GKN PLC (GKN.L) and a "conviction sell" on Volvo AB (VOLVb.ST). It removed Valeo (VLOF.PA) from its conviction sell list but kept a "sell" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mihir Dalal in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La planta de Anveres disminuye sus costos operativos y reduce las emisiones de
gases de efecto invernadero en B&#233;lgica
ANVERES, B&#233;lgica--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil inaugur&#243; hoy su &#250;ltima planta de cogeneraci&#243;n de alta eficiencia en
su refiner&#237;a de Anveres, en B&#233;lgica. La cogeneraci&#243;n es la producci&#243;n simult&#225;nea
de electricidad y calor o vapor &#250;til para los procesos industriales. Adem&#225;s de
generar 125 megavatios, la nueva planta reducir&#225; las emisiones de di&#243;xido de
carbono en aproximadamente 200.000 toneladas por a&#241;o, lo que equivale a quitar
cerca de 90.000 autom&#243;viles de las carreteras europeas. 

"La eficiencia energ&#233;tica es una de las herramientas m&#225;s efectivas disponibles
para reducir las emisiones de gas de efecto invernadero", afirma Sherman Glass,
presidente de ExxonMobil Refining &amp; Supply. "Desde 2004, ExxonMobil ha invertido
en m&#225;s de 1.500 megavatios de capacidad de cogeneraci&#243;n en cinco pa&#237;ses". 

Con la inauguraci&#243;n de la planta de Anveres, ExxonMobil ahora tiene
participaci&#243;n en cerca de 4.600 megavatios de capacidad de cogeneraci&#243;n en
alrededor de 100 instalaciones individuales, en m&#225;s de 30 sitios alrededor del
mundo. Esta capacidad es suficiente para cubrir las necesidades de m&#225;s de 5
millones de hogares en Europa. 

"Esta nueva planta de cogeneraci&#243;n permite la generaci&#243;n eficiente de energ&#237;a
para hacer funcionar bombas, compresores y otros equipos en nuestras
instalaciones, y adem&#225;s produce vapor adicional que se utiliza en el proceso que
transforma petr&#243;leo crudo en productos refinados", afirm&#243; Gilbert Asselman,
gerente de la refiner&#237;a de Anveres. 

"Con la &#250;ltima tecnolog&#237;a, la cogeneraci&#243;n es considerablemente m&#225;s eficiente
que los m&#233;todos tradicionales de producir vapor y energ&#237;a por separado. Esto da
como resultado costos operativos m&#225;s bajos y emisiones de gas de efecto
invernadero significativamente menores". 

Las nuevas plantas adicionales que se encuentran en construcci&#243;n en Singapur y
en China aumentar&#225;n la capacidad de cogeneraci&#243;n de ExxonMobil a m&#225;s de 5.000
megavatios en los pr&#243;ximos 3 a&#241;os. 

Acerca de la refiner&#237;a de Anveres de ExxonMobil

La refiner&#237;a de Anveres es la segunda refiner&#237;a m&#225;s grande de ExxonMobil en
Europa y tiene una capacidad de aproximadamente 305.000 barriles por d&#237;a. 

La nueva planta de cogeneraci&#243;n de Anveres tendr&#225; la capacidad de generar m&#225;s de
125 megavatios de electricidad. La construcci&#243;n de las instalaciones requiri&#243;
m&#225;s de 1 mill&#243;n de horas-hombre. Las instalaciones de cogeneraci&#243;n de Anveres
son m&#225;s eficientes que muchas plantas de cogeneraci&#243;n gracias a su sistema de
recuperaci&#243;n del calor. Adem&#225;s de generar vapor, la planta de cogeneraci&#243;n
utiliza el calor creado en el escape de la turbina de gas para calentar el
petr&#243;leo crudo, el paso inicial en el proceso para convertirlo en productos
refinados. Esta tecnolog&#237;a alternativa de recuperaci&#243;n del calor es la que
destaca a Anveres entre todas las dem&#225;s unidades de cogeneraci&#243;n.

&lt;p&gt;Refinaria da Antu&#233;rpia diminui custos operacionais e reduz emiss&#245;es de gases do
efeito estufa na B&#233;lgica
ANTU&#201;RPIA, B&#233;lgica--(Business Wire)--
A ExxonMobil inaugurou hoje sua mais nova usina de cogera&#231;&#227;o de alta efici&#234;ncia,
na sua refinaria da Antu&#233;rpia, na B&#233;lgica. Cogera&#231;&#227;o &#233; a produ&#231;&#227;o simult&#226;nea de
eletricidade e calor ou vapor usados nos processos industriais. Al&#233;m de gerar
125 megawatts, a nova usina vai reduzir as emiss&#245;es de di&#243;xido de carbono em
aproximadamente duzentas mil toneladas por ano, o equivalente &#224; remo&#231;&#227;o de cerca
de noventa mil autom&#243;veis das estradas da Europa. 

"A efici&#234;ncia energ&#233;tica &#233; uma das mais eficazes ferramentas dispon&#237;veis para
reduzir as emiss&#245;es de gases do efeito estufa", disse Sherman Glass, presidente
da ExxonMobil Refining &amp; Supply. "Desde 2004, a ExxonMobil vem investindo em
mais de mil e quinhentos megawatts de capacidade de cogera&#231;&#227;o em cinco pa&#237;ses." 

Com a inaugura&#231;&#227;o da refinaria da Antu&#233;rpia, a ExxonMobil agora tem participa&#231;&#227;o
em cerca de quatro mil e seiscentos megawatts de capacidade de cogera&#231;&#227;o em
cerca de cem instala&#231;&#245;es individuais de mais de trinta locais de todo o mundo.
Essa capacidade &#233; suficiente para suprir as necessidades de mais de cinco
milh&#245;es de lares na Europa. 

"Esta nova usina de cogera&#231;&#227;o permite gera&#231;&#227;o eficiente de eletricidade para
operar bombas, compressores e outros equipamentos nas nossas instala&#231;&#245;es, ao
mesmo tempo produzindo o vapor adicional necess&#225;rio para os processos que
transformam &#243;leo cru em produtos refinados", disse Gilbert Asselman, gerente da
refinaria da Antu&#233;rpia. 

"Com a tecnologia mais recente, a cogera&#231;&#227;o &#233; significativamente mais eficiente
que os m&#233;todos tradicionais de produ&#231;&#227;o de vapor e energia separadamente. Isso
resulta em menores custos operacionais e emiss&#245;es de gases do efeito estufa
menos significativas." 

Instala&#231;&#245;es adicionais em constru&#231;&#227;o em Cingapura e na China aumentar&#227;o a
capacidade de cogera&#231;&#227;o da ExxonMobil em mais de cinco mil megawatts nos
pr&#243;ximos tr&#234;s anos. 

Sobre a refinaria da ExxonMobil na Antu&#233;rpia

A refinaria da Antu&#233;rpia &#233; a segunda maior refinaria da ExxonMobil na Europa e
tem capacidade para produzir aproximadamente 305 mil barris por dia. 

A nova usina de cogera&#231;&#227;o da Antu&#233;rpia ter&#225; capacidade para gerar mais de 125
megawatts de eletricidade. A constru&#231;&#227;o da refinaria exigiu mais de um milh&#227;o de
homens-hora. A unidade de cogera&#231;&#227;o da Antu&#233;rpia &#233; mais eficiente do que muitas
das usinas de cogera&#231;&#227;o tradicionais, por causa do seu sistema de recupera&#231;&#227;o de
calor. Al&#233;m de gerar vapor, a unidade de cogera&#231;&#227;o usa o calor criado na turbina
de g&#225;s de escape para aquecer o &#243;leo cru - a etapa inicial do processo de
convers&#227;o do &#243;leo cru em produtos refinados. Essa tecnologia alternativa de
recupera&#231;&#227;o de calor &#233; o que distingue Antu&#233;rpia de outras unidades de
cogera&#231;&#227;o. 

Sobre a ExxonMobil Refining &amp; Supply

&lt;p&gt;Anlage in Antwerpen mindert Betriebskosten und reduziert Treibhausgasemissionen
in Belgien
ANTWERPEN, Belgien--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil hat heute in seiner Raffinerie im belgischen Antwerpen sein neuestes
Hochleistungs-Heizkraftwerk eingeweiht. Kraft-W&#228;rme-Kopplung ist die
gleichzeitige Erzeugung von Elektrizit&#228;t und n&#252;tzlicher W&#228;rme beziehungsweise
von f&#252;r industrielle Prozesse verwendetem Dampf. Neben der Erzeugung von 125
Megawatt wird das neue Kraftwerk die belgischen Kohlendioxidemissionen um etwa
200.000 Tonnen pro Jahr reduzieren, was einer Beseitigung von etwa 90.000 Autos
von den europ&#228;ischen Stra&#223;en entspricht. 

&#8222;Energieeffizienz ist eines der effektivsten Hilfsmittel f&#252;r die Reduzierung der
Treibhausgasemissionen", sagte Sherman Glass, President von ExxonMobil Refining
&amp; Supply. &#8222;Seit 2004 hat ExxonMobil in f&#252;nf L&#228;ndern in
Kraft-W&#228;rme-Kopplungskapazit&#228;ten von mehr als 1.500 Megawatt investiert." 

Mit der Einweihung der Anlage in Antwerpen ist ExxonMobil nunmehr an
Kraft-W&#228;rme-Kopplungskapazit&#228;ten von etwa 4.600 Megawatt in etwa 100 einzelnen
Anlagen an mehr als 30 Standorten auf der ganzen Welt beteiligt. Dies sind
gen&#252;gend Kapazit&#228;ten, um den Bedarf von mehr als f&#252;nf Millionen Haushalten in
Europa zu decken. 

&#8222;Dieses neue Heizkraftwerk erm&#246;glicht die effiziente Elektrizit&#228;tserzeugung f&#252;r
den Antrieb von Pumpen, Kompressoren und anderen Ger&#228;ten in unseren Anlagen,
w&#228;hrend gleichzeitig zus&#228;tzlich Dampf erzeugt wird, der f&#252;r Prozesse ben&#246;tigt
wird, durch die Roh&#246;l in raffinierte Produkte umgesetzt wird", sagte Gilbert
Asselman, Manager der Raffinerie in Antwerpen. 

&#8222;Durch die neueste Technologie ist die Kraft-W&#228;rme-Kopplung deutlich effizienter
als traditionelle Methoden zur separaten Erzeugung von Dampf und Strom. Dies
f&#252;hrt zu geringeren Betriebskosten und wesentlich weniger
Treibhausgasemissionen." 

Weitere neue Anlagen in Singapur und China befinden sich im Bau. Sie werden die
Kraft-W&#228;rme-Kopplungskapazit&#228;ten von ExxonMobil in den n&#228;chsten drei Jahren um
mehr als 5.000 Megawatt erh&#246;hen. 

&#220;ber die Raffinerie von ExxonMobil in Antwerpen

Die Raffinerie in Antwerpen ist die zweitgr&#246;&#223;te Raffinerie von ExxonMobil in
Europa und verf&#252;gt &#252;ber eine Kapazit&#228;t von etwa 305.000 Barrel pro Tag. 

Das neue Heizkraftwerk in Antwerpen wird mehr als 125 Megawatt Strom erzeugen
k&#246;nnen. Der Bau der Anlage erforderte &#252;ber eine Millionen Arbeitsstunden. Die
Kraft-W&#228;rme-Kopplungsanlage in Antwerpen ist aufgrund seines
W&#228;rmer&#252;ckgewinnungssystems effizienter als viele traditionelle Heizkraftwerke.
Neben der Erzeugung von Dampf nutzt die Kraft-W&#228;rme-Kopplungsanlage die im
Gasturbinenexhaustor erzeugte Hitze zur Erw&#228;rmung von Roh&#246;l - dem ersten Schritt
bei der Umsetzung von Roh&#246;l in raffinierte Erzeugnisse. Diese alternative
W&#228;rmer&#252;ckgewinnungstechnologie ist es, was Antwerpen von anderen
Kraft-W&#228;rme-Kopplungsanlagen unterscheidet.

&lt;p&gt;L`installation d`Anvers fait baisser les co&#251;ts d`exploitation et r&#233;duit les
&#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre en Belgique
ANVERS, Belgique--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil a inaugur&#233; aujourd`hui sa toute nouvelle usine de cog&#233;n&#233;ration &#224; haut
rendement sur le site de sa raffinerie d`Anvers en Belgique. La cog&#233;n&#233;ration est
la production simultan&#233;e d`&#233;lectricit&#233; et de chaleur ou de vapeur pour une
utilisation par des processus industriels. Outre la g&#233;n&#233;ration de 125 m&#233;gawatts,
la nouvelle usine va r&#233;duire les &#233;missions de CO2 en Belgique d`environ 200 000
tonnes par an, ce qui &#233;quivaut &#224; diminuer d`&#224; peu pr&#232;s 90 000 le nombre de
voitures sur les routes europ&#233;ennes. 

&#171; L`efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique est l`un des outils les plus efficaces &#224; notre
disposition pour r&#233;duire les &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233;
Sherman Glass, le pr&#233;sident d`ExxonMobil Refining &amp; Supply. &#171; Depuis 2004,
ExxonMobil a investi dans une capacit&#233; de cog&#233;n&#233;ration de 1 500 m&#233;gawatts dans
cinq pays. &#187; 

Avec l`inauguration de l`usine d`Anvers, ExxonMobil d&#233;tient d&#233;sormais des
int&#233;r&#234;ts dans une capacit&#233; de cog&#233;n&#233;ration d`environ 4 600 m&#233;gawatts dans pr&#232;s
de 100 installations individuelles sur plus de 30 sites dans le monde entier.
Cela repr&#233;sente une capacit&#233; suffisante pour alimenter les besoins de plus de 5
millions de foyers en Europe. 

&#171; Cette nouvelle usine de cog&#233;n&#233;ration permet de g&#233;n&#233;rer de l`&#233;lectricit&#233; de
fa&#231;on rentable servant &#224; faire fonctionner des pompes, des compresseurs et du
mat&#233;riel dans nos installations, tout en produisant par la m&#234;me occasion de la
vapeur suppl&#233;mentaire, n&#233;cessaire dans les processus qui transforment le p&#233;trole
brut en produits raffin&#233;s &#187;, a indiqu&#233; quant &#224; lui Gilbert Asselman, le
directeur de la raffinerie d`Anvers. 

&#171; Gr&#226;ce &#224; la toute derni&#232;re technologie, la cog&#233;n&#233;ration est consid&#233;rablement
plus rentable que les m&#233;thodes classiques consistant &#224; produire de la vapeur et
de l`&#233;lectricit&#233; s&#233;par&#233;ment. Ceci donne lieu &#224; des co&#251;ts d`exploitation moins
&#233;lev&#233;s et &#224; d`importantes r&#233;ductions des &#233;missions de gaz &#224; effet de serre. &#187; 

D`autres usines en cours de construction &#224; Singapour et en Chine vont porter la
capacit&#233; de cog&#233;n&#233;ration d`ExxonMobil &#224; plus de 5 000 m&#233;gawatts sur les trois
prochaines ann&#233;es. 

&#192; propos de la raffinerie ExxonMobil d`Anvers

La raffinerie d`Anvers, la deuxi&#232;me plus grosse raffinerie ExxonMobil en Europe,
poss&#232;de une capacit&#233; d`environ 305 000 barils par jour. 

La nouvelle usine de cog&#233;n&#233;ration d`Anvers sera capable de g&#233;n&#233;rer plus de 125
m&#233;gawatts d`&#233;lectricit&#233;. La construction des installations a pris plus de 1
million d`heures de travail. L`usine de cog&#233;n&#233;ration d`Anvers est plus rentable
que de nombreuses usines traditionnelles de cog&#233;n&#233;ration en raison de son
syst&#232;me de r&#233;cup&#233;ration de thermique. Outre la g&#233;n&#233;ration de vapeur, l`usine de
cog&#233;n&#233;ration utilise la chaleur cr&#233;&#233;e au niveau de l`&#233;chappement des turbines &#224;
gaz pour chauffer le p&#233;trole brut, l`&#233;tape initiale du processus de conversion
du p&#233;trole brut en produits raffin&#233;s. Cette technologie alternative de

&lt;p&gt;Antwerp Facility Lowers Operating Costs and Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions in
Belgium
ANTWERP, Belgium--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil today inaugurated its newest high efficiency cogeneration plant at
its Antwerp refinery in Belgium. Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of
electricity and useful heat or steam used for industrial processes. In addition
to generating 125 megawatts, the new plant will reduce Belgium's carbon dioxide
emissions by approximately 200,000 tonnes per year, the equivalent of removing
about 90,000 cars from Europe`s roads. 

"Energy efficiency is one of the most effective tools available for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions," said Sherman Glass, president of ExxonMobil Refining
&amp; Supply. "Since 2004, ExxonMobil has invested in over 1,500 megawatts of
cogeneration capacity in five countries." 

With the inauguration of the Antwerp facility, ExxonMobil now has interests in
about 4,600 megawatts of cogeneration capacity in about 100 individual
installations at more than 30 sites around the world. This is enough capacity to
supply the needs of more than 5 million homes in Europe. 

"This new cogeneration plant allows for the efficient generation of electricity
to run pumps, compressors and other equipment in our facilities, while at the
same time, producing additional steam that is needed in processes that transform
crude oil into refined products," said Gilbert Asselman, manager of the Antwerp
refinery. 

"With the latest technology, cogeneration is significantly more efficient than
traditional methods of producing steam and power separately. This results in
lower operating costs and significantly less greenhouse gas emissions." 

Additional new facilities under construction in Singapore and China will
increase ExxonMobil's cogeneration capacity to more than 5,000 megawatts in the
next three years. 

About the ExxonMobil Antwerp Refinery

The Antwerp Refinery is the second largest ExxonMobil refinery in Europe and has
a capacity of approximately 305,000 barrels per day. 

Antwerp`s new cogeneration plant will be capable of generating more than 125
megawatts of electricity. Construction of the facility required over 1 million
man-hours. Antwerp`s cogeneration facility is more efficient than many
traditional cogeneration plants because of its heat recovery system. In addition
to generating steam, the cogeneration facility utilizes heat created in the
gas-turbine exhaust to heat crude oil - the initial step in the process of
converting crude oil into refined products. This alternative heat recovery
technology is what sets Antwerp apart from other cogeneration units. 

About ExxonMobil Refining &amp; Supply

ExxonMobil Refining &amp; Supply encompasses a global network of reliable and
efficient manufacturing plants, transportation systems, and distribution centers
that provide a range of fuels, lubricants, and other high-value products and
feedstocks to our customers around the world.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, March 25 (Reuters) - China rejected Coca-Cola's
(KO.N) bid to buy top local juice maker Huiyuan (1886.HK) because
it feared the U.S. multinational could abuse its position across
the whole soft drinks market, an official said in remarks
published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ministry of Commerce spokesman Yao Jian said regulators
treated carbonated soft drinks and juice beverages as a conjoined
sector -- one, he said, in which Coca-Cola could deter
competitors to the detriment of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yao fleshed out the ministry's rationale for rejecting the
bid last week in an interview in the official People's Daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Potential competitors would find it very difficult to enter
this market and grow into substantive competitors against
Coca-Cola and thereby eradicate or restrict the possibility of
Coca-Cola engaging in abusive conduct," Yao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Multinational investment could be a boon for China's economy,
Yao said, adding a broad caveat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If mergers and acquisitions lead to multinational companies
gaining or enhancing dominant status, producing exclusionary and
competition-restricting outcomes, this will hinder economic
development," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China rejected the proposed deal under an anti-monopoly law
enacted last year, stating that the combined concentration of the
two companies would have hurt competition in the juice business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huiyuan controls over a tenth of the Chinese fruit and
vegetable juice market, which grew 15 percent last year to $2
billion. Coca-Cola has a 9.7 percent market share. Huiyuan is
listed in Hong Kong and registered in the Cayman Islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision to block the deal drew criticism from trade
lawyers and economists who said China appeared willing to wield
its anti-monopoly law to fend off foreign attempts to buy
promising domestic firms, even when resulting market
concentration would not be excessive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Yao said "nationalist sentiment" was not a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Coca-Cola already had market dominance in the
carbonated drinks sector, citing local industry association
estimates that it holds 60.6 percent of the market. It could have
leveraged that influence in the juice sector, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although there is not strong substitutability between the
carbonated beverage and juice beverage markets," Yao said, "both
are non-alcoholic drinks and belong to two closely intertwined
markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola, he said, could have used its position to "transfer
its dominance of the carbonate beverage market to the juice
beverage market".

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Twenty years ago, when crude oil was gushing out of the wrecked Exxon Valdez supertanker and Prince William Sound was being blackened by what would become the nation's worst tanker spill, oil giant Exxon Corp was vilified in Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bumper stickers said the corporation's name was the "sign of the double-cross." A sarcastic T-shirt took jabs at the company's perceived arrogance, proclaiming: "Exxon: We Don't Care. We Don't Have to Care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Exxon Mobil Corp, as the company is now known, is expanding in Alaska and officials are striking a conciliatory tone about the tanker disaster that has defined the company in Alaska and much of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The event around Valdez, you can't overstate how tragic it was and how it was such a low point for the company in our 125-year history," said company spokesman Alan Jeffers. "We understand the feelings of the people of Alaska about the spill itself and the continuing impact that it had and recognize how difficult it was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As economic malaise forces other oil companies to cut back, delay projects and lay off employees, Exxon has embarked on this season's biggest new project in Alaska's petroleum-rich North Slope region -- a 50-mile (80-kilometre) ice road, and a two-well drilling program at the long-dormant Point Thomson field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has put over 250 employees and contract workers on duty at Point Thomson, despite a legal dispute in which the state is trying to revoke leases for nonperformance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has tripled its Anchorage office space, said Craig Haymes, the company's Alaska production manager. It is actively examining options for a massive natural gas pipeline, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it has boosted its community contributions. This year, Exxon became one of the four prime sponsors of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, ponying up $1.25 million over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all part of a move into a higher-profile role as an oil-field operator rather than a mere investor in the North Slope's Prudhoe Bay and other properties operated by other oil companies such as BP Plc or ConocoPhillips, according to Exxon officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been in Alaska for 50 years. We'll be here for another 50 years," Haymes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAMAGE REMAINS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with still-pungent oil lingering on some beaches, Prince William Sound herring stocks nearly wiped out by an epidemic that fishermen believe was triggered by the spill, various animal populations depleted and residents exhausted by long years of still-unresolved litigation, many Alaskans are still bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A June 25 U.S. Supreme Court decision, which shrank a punitive award that had originally been $5 billion to a mere $507.5 million, was devastating to fishermen, Alaska Natives and other spill litigants. Meanwhile, Exxon is prospering, with more than $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon is very, very healthy, unlike Prince William Sound," said state Senator Hollis French, an Anchorage Democrat. "I think Alaskans for several generations will have a bad taste in their mouths from that incident."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some political experts say lingering anger at Exxon has been reflected in state policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, Governor Sarah Palin suggested Exxon was unwanted as a partner in a long-desired but as-yet-unbuilt North Slope natural gas pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sentiment shared by a lot of Alaskans is, you know, Exxon, don't let the door hit you in the stern on your way out if you choose not to participate in progressing development of Alaska's resources," Palin said at a news conference a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alaska's Natural Resources Commissioner Tom Irwin, who has been in the forefront of the battle to revoke Point Thomson leases so that they can be sold to other companies, once issued a statement saying he "did not trust" Exxon to follow through with its promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, French said, if Exxon is trying to improve its operations and make more contributions to Alaska's economy and nonprofit organizations, the move should be welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They shouldn't be punished or excoriated for that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bill Rigby and Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon Mobil investing in Alaska oil projects * Looking at involvement in new large gas pipeline * Local bitterness remains over U.S.'s largest oil spill By Yereth Rosen ANCHORAGE, Alaska, March 24 (Reuters) - Twenty years ago, when crude oil was gushing out of the wrecked Exxon Valdez supertanker and Prince William Sound was being blackened by what would become the nation's worst tanker spill, oil giant Exxon Corp was vilified in Alaska. Bumper stickers said the corporation's name was the sign of the double-cross. A sarcastic T-shirt took jabs at the company's perceived arrogance, proclaiming: Exxon: We Don't Care. We Don't Have to Care. Today, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), as the company is now known, is expanding in Alaska and officials are striking a conciliatory tone about the tanker disaster that has defined the company in Alaska and much of the world.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - News that Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) might quickly pay back taxpayer money could pressure able rivals to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program was intended to provide lenders with more capital to spur lending and improve the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of companies have taken TARP money, ranging from $45 billion accepted by both Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) to $541,000 by The Victory Bank of Limerick, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with TARP now seen more as an albatross, expectations are growing that more banks will repay their money as soon as they can. That would also free banks from dividend payouts, typically 5 percent a year. as well as Congress' demonstrated willingness to change the rules of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you have now is the stronger banks who have the money, but with one eye on Congress," said Jerry Blanchard, a partner in the financial institutions practice at Bryan Cave LLP in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're a fairly well-capitalized bank, you don't want the government looking over your shoulder," he added. "Many of these banks also get upset getting painted with the same brush as larger investment banks that caused some of the problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, many banks including Bank of America argue they should not be faulted for using TARP, which they view as a cushion in case the economy sours further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We took the TARP not because we needed to, but because it made sense given the nature of the freefall of the economy at that time," said Richard Hickson, chief executive of Trustmark Corp (TRMK.O), a Jackson, Mississippi lender with $9.8 billion of assets that took a $215 million infusion. "We feel capable of repaying it, but I want to be very surefooted and thoughtful about it. Let's not go 'ready, fire, aim.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN EYES REPAYMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is hoping to pay back its $10 billion of TARP money as soon as possible but hurdles remain, according to a person familiar with the process who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the bank hoped to repay the money as soon as next month. Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A payback would follow the hysteria over bonuses paid by the insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N), and news that Goldman had received $12.9 billion of AIG bailout money because it was a counterparty to the insurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen of the largest U.S. banks will soon undergo government stress tests to assess their ability to handle the economic downturn, and their need for more capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would not be surprised to see some money paid back next quarter" by other banks, said Michael Yoshikami, president of YCMNET Advisors in Walnut Creek, California. "It is, in a way, a free market stress test. If you can repay TARP money, and still operate with good capital reserves, you're essentially saying you've passed your own internal stress test."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks regret participating in TARP, including Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N), which took $25 billion it did not want because former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the vitriol results from a rule that lets the government unilaterally impose new restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did that last month by capping executive bonuses, and could do so again once the Senate considers the fate of AIG bonuses. Last week's House of Representatives bill setting a 90 percent tax would also hit bonuses for thousands of workers at other banks nationwide, a form of guilt by association that banks say would cause good employees to flee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is this America, when you can do what your government asks you to do and then retroactively you also have additional conditions put on?" Wells Fargo Chairman Richard Kovacevich said on March 13 in comments at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury spokesman Isaac Baker declined to comment on Goldman or others repaying TARP, or whether early repayment would hurt lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EARLY PAYBACK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Keefe Bruyette  Woods said 184 companies have indicated they will not tap the TARP, and at least five major banks hope to repay their infusions soon: Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are also eyeing repayments. Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis has said the largest U.S. bank could repay TARP money this year if the economy cooperates. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) Chief Executive John Mack told Congress he wants to repay that bank's $10 billion infusion as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KBW said at least five smaller lenders have filed to repay TARP money: Bank of Marin Bancorp (BMRC.O), Iberiabank Corp (IBKC.O), Signature Bank (SBNY.O), Sun Bancorp Inc (SNBC.O) and TCF Financial Corp (TCB.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it identified seven banks that it said could repay TARP money with existing capital: Goldman, Morgan Stanley, City National Corp (CYN.N), Comerica Inc (CMA.N), SCBT Financial Corp SCBT.O, Sterling Bancshares Inc SBIB.O and Trustmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A City National spokeswoman declined to comment, and a Sterling spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Comerica and SCBT did not return calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be reason to wait, given the uncertain economy. "If I were trying to pick the bottom of the economy, I might want to keep my powder dry," Bryan Cave's Blanchard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trustmark's Hickson views TARP as a form of term insurance. "We have it now so we can grow loans, keep the Mississippi economy flowing," he said. "I would not allow the marketplace to dictate what Trustmark is going to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Additional reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Time is making Warren Buffett's investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) look better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Buffett's insurance and investment company Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) six months ago bought $5 billion of Goldman preferred shares yielding 10 percent, it also got warrants to buy an equal amount of common stock at $115 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, those warrants fell out of the money, as Goldman shares tumbled with the rest of the financial sector. But they have reversed course, and on Tuesday rose above $115 for the first time since October 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It shows that long-term has a place in investing," said Michael Yoshikami, president of YCMNET Advisors in Walnut Creek, California, which owns Berkshire stock. "Frankly, the strike price was never the thesis for the investment, but was rather an add-on for a 10 percent fixed-income investment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman have more than doubled since hitting a record low of $47.44 last November 21, with about two-thirds of the gain coming since March 9, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is eyeing the repayment of the $10 billion it took from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, and has said it would like to repay it this year, despite a $2.12 billion fourth-quarter loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times said Goldman has tentatively decided to repay the TARP early and hopes to do so within a month, citing people involved in the process. That report appeared "well informed," according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak. Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffett favors long-term investments, and has downplayed criticism for the timing of his Goldman investment and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warrants attached to a similar $3 billion preferred stock investment by Berkshire last October in General Electric Co (GE.N) remain out of the money. The warrants are exercisable at $22.25 per share, but GE trades around half that level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I got 10 percent preferred that I don't think I could get now," Buffett said on CNBC television on March 9. "That was a time when both of those companies wanted money immediately and we could structure a preferred that was attractive. But the fact that business is going to get worse does not mean you should wait to buy stocks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trading, Goldman shares were up $1.76, or 1.6 percent, at $113.69, after earlier rising to $115.64. Berkshire's Class A shares were down $50 at $89,950.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp said it has hired JPMorgan (JPM.N)
banker Joseph Jiampietro to advise on complex financial
transactions, as the regulator braces to run more auctions to
sell bad bank assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jiampietro helped financial institutions buy and sell
assets at JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He joins the FDIC as it prepares to facilitate one of the
biggest asset transfers in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The United States said on Monday that the government would
help otherwise healthy banks sell off hundreds of billions of
dollars of bad assets, through auctions and by providing
financing to prospective buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I believe that the FDIC will benefit greatly from Mr.
Jiampietro's extensive markets and transactional expertise as
the Corporation assumes broader responsibilities in significant
and complex financial programs," FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDIC also is widely expected to seize billions more of
assets from troubled banks and sell them or give them to
healthier institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jiampietro moved from UBS to JPMorgan in 2007. Before he
worked at the Swiss bank, he was a corporate lawyer and he also
served as legal counsel with the United States Senate Committee

price was never the thesis for the investment, but was rather an
add-on for a 10 percent fixed-income investment."

 Shares of Goldman have more than doubled since hitting a
record low of $47.44 last Nov. 21, with about two-thirds of the
gain coming since March 9, according to Reuters data.

 Goldman is eyeing the repayment of the $10 billion it took
from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, and has
said it would like to repay it this year, despite a $2.12
billion fourth-quarter loss.

 The New York Times said Goldman has tentatively decided to
repay the TARP early and hopes to do so within a month, citing
people involved in the process. That report appeared "well
informed," according to a person familiar with the matter who
was not authorized to speak. Goldman declined to comment.

 Buffett favors long-term investments, and has downplayed
criticism for the timing of his Goldman investment and others.

 Warrants attached to a similar $3 billion preferred stock
investment by Berkshire last October in General Electric Co
(GE.N) remain out of the money. The warrants are exercisable at
$22.25 per share, but GE trades around half that level.

 "I got 10 percent preferred that I don't think I could get
now," Buffett said on CNBC television on March 9. "That was a
time when both of those companies wanted money immediately and
we could structure a preferred that was attractive. But the fact
that business is going to get worse does not mean you should
wait to buy stocks."

 In afternoon trading, Goldman shares were up $1.76, or 1.6
percent, at $113.69, after earlier rising to $115.64.
Berkshire's Class A shares were down $50 at $89,950.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades six classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
pass-through certificates series 2005-LDP2 and assigns Rating Outlooks as
follows: 

--$11.2 million class L to 'BB' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$14.9 million class M to 'BB-' from 'BB'; Outlook Negative; 

--$11.2 million class N to 'B+' from 'BB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$7.4 million class O to 'B' from 'B+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$7.4 million class P to 'B-' from 'B'; Outlook Negative; 

--$11.2 million class Q to 'CCC/DR1' from 'B-'. 

Additionally Fitch affirms the following classes and assigns Rating Outlooks as
follows: 

--$50.4 million class A-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$549.7 million class A-1A at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$257.1 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$367.4 million class A-3 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$122.7 million class A-3A at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$561.3 million class A-4 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$123.4 million class A-SB at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$247.9 million class A-M at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$50 million class A-MFL at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$216 million class A-J at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$18.6 million class B at 'AA+'; Outlook Stable; 

--$41 million class C at 'AA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$26.1 million class D at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$26.1 million class E at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; 

--$29.8 million class F at 'A'; Outlook Stable; 

--$26.1 million class G at 'A-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$44.7 million class H at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable; 

--$29.8 million class J at 'BBB'; Outlook Negative; 

--$37.2 million class K at 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch does not rate the $29.4 million class NR. 

The downgrades are due to Fitch expected losses from two loans (0.6%) which
transferred to special servicing since Fitch's last rating action. Due to the
relatively small size of the non-investment grade classes, the expected losses
result in a more significant decline in the credit enhancement levels of these
classes. The largest of the specially serviced loan (0.47%) is secured by a 480
unit apartment complex in Tallahassee, FL. The loan transferred to special
servicing when the borrower filed for bankruptcy. The special servicer has
subsequently worked out a forbearance agreement which envisions a full cure of
the default and payment of all past due amounts by year-end 2010. The loan is
performing under the forbearance agreement. As of June 30, 2008 the property was
89% occupied. Though not imminent, Fitch believes that losses are ultimately
likely. 

The other specially serviced loan (0.14%) is secured by a 22,736 square foot
retail center in Lake Forest, CA. The loan transferred due to imminent default
when the largest tenant (75% of the net rentable area) vacated the property. The
loan is 90 days delinquent and the special servicer is pursuing foreclosure. 

The negative Rating Outlooks are reflective of 23 loans (4.81%) identified as
Fitch Loans of Concern primarily due to low occupancies, low debt service
coverage ratios, or certain property specific issues. These include the two
specially serviced loans. In addition, 11% of the pool matures in 2010. These
loans have a weighted average interest rate of 4.97%. 

As of the March 2009 reporting period, the transaction has paid down 3.5% to
$2.82 billion from $2.98 billion. Since issuance 10 loans (1.9%) have defeased. 

Fitch reviewed the year-end 2008 operating information for the one investment
grade shadow-rated loan in the pool, the Russ Building (2.1%). It is secured by
a 509,368 square foot office building located in the Financial District
submarket of San Francisco, CA. As of December 2008, the property was 95%
occupied compared to 87% at issuance. The loan retains its investment grade
shadow rating.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms J.P. Morgan Commercial Mortgage Finance Corp.'s mortgage
pass-through certificates, series 2000-C9, and assigns Rating Outlooks as
follows: 

--$318.7 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$36.6 million class B at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

--$14.3 million class F at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$14.3 million class G at 'AA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$20.4 million class H at 'BB+'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch does not rate the $16.4 million class J certificates. The class K and
class NR certificates have been reduced to zero due to realized losses. The
class A-1 has been paid in full. 

The rating affirmations are due to stable overall pool performance since the
last Fitch rating action. In total 62.8% of the pool has defeased, including
nine of the top 10 loans (31%). As of the February 2009 distribution date, the
pool has paid down 38.8% to $498 million from $814.4 million at issuance. Rating
Outlooks reflect the likely direction of any rating changes over the next one to
two years. 

There are two specially serviced loans (1%). The largest specially serviced
asset (0.8%) is an office property in Warwick, RI. The loan is 90+ days
delinquent. The property lost three tenants, accounting for 68% of the net
rentable area, in 2008 due to lease expirations. 

The second specially serviced asset (0.3%) is a retail property in Park Ridge,
IL. The loan transferred to the special servicer in March 2009. The loan is
current but has a maturity date in April 2009. The property is fully occupied by
one tenant which has a lease expiration in June 2009. 

Of the non-defeased loans, approximately 92% have a maturity or anticipated
repayment date in the next 12 months. The weighted average debt service coverage
ratio and interest rate for these loans were 1.40 times (x) and 8.15%,
respectively. Fitch assigns a Negative Outlook to class H due to the near-term
maturity concentration.

of building wide-ranging solutions based on Microsoft technologies, such
as setting up networks using Windows Server 2008 and the Windows Essential
Server Solutions product line."

    The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and represents
Microsoft's ongoing commitment to the success of partners worldwide. The

&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq has invited France's Total (TOTF.PA) and U.S. firm Chevron Corp (CVX.N) to jointly bid against Norway's StatoilHydro (STL.OL) for a contract to develop its 6 billion barrel Nahr Bin Umar southern oilfield, the Oil Ministry said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Total and Chevron consortium are favored to win this contract because they have together studied a group of Iraqi oil fields, including Nahr Bin Umar," a senior official in the ministry told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official added that two other fields in that study were Majnoon and West Qurna Phase I, both of which were among fields offered up in two bidding rounds that Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani announced last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of those rounds will be awarded by the middle of this year and the second by the end. The Nahr Bin Umar contract was nothing to do with those rounds, the official said, adding that the ministry was waiting to receive the firms' offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field in Iraq's southern oil hub of Basra produces just 50,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), despite its proven reserves of at least 6 billion barrels, the ministry says. It has the capacity to produce 10 times as much, it says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third company would be invited to join in the bidding process but it had not yet been decided which one, the Oil Ministry official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq is aggressively courting foreign investment in its oil industry in an effort to modernize creaking infrastructure devastated by decades or war, sanctions and neglect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shahristani has said he wants to raise production to 6 million barrels per day in the next five to six years, from its current average of 2.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This offer is part of our accelerated plan to boost oil production through EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contracts," the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Total said it does not comment on ongoing discussions but added Total is interested in Iraqi investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;StatoilHydro spokeswoman Mari Dotterud said: "We are very pleased with the invitation ... It is clear that the security situation in Iraq has improved, but is still demanding. We will continue to monitor the situation closely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Wojciech Moskwa in Oslo and Tom Bergin in London; Writing by Tim Cocks; Editing by James Jukwey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) has been smacked lower this morning by a
downgrade at Goldman Sachs from "buy" to "neutral." Analyst Mark Wienkes said
the company's shares are now valued at a 25% premium to its entertainment peers
- a gap Wienkes expects to narrow. He cut his 6-month price target to $20 from
$26. The analyst expects "tepid" box office results for Disney films in fiscal
2009 to have an effect on the stock, as the market is "looking to award value
only for near-term results." On a longer-term basis, Wienkes says the stock
should outperform due to its strong brands, smart execution across multiple
platforms, and other factors. 

The security is trading down 4% this morning following the downgrade and is
currently sitting on a year-to-date loss of more than 23%. The equity has
recently rebounded off its March 10 low of $15.14, resulting in a gain of
approximately 25% as it climbed above its 10-day and 20-day moving averages.
These trendlines had served as a layer of staunch resistance from Jan. 8 through
March 11.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - "A thick pancake of shiny black" covered the still waters of Prince William Sound in the hours after the Exxon Valdez split open in an ecological disaster that offers lessons for any future forays for Arctic oil, eyewitness and conservationist Dennis Kelso recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Alaska's environment conservation chief 20 years ago, it was Kelso's job to enforce clean-up standards around the supertanker on March 24, 1989, as it leaked oil into prime fishing grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Valdez ultimately spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaskan waters, fouling 1,300 miles of coastline and disrupting or killing marine wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clean-up cost more than $2 billion and is still proceeding. Exxon, now known as ExxonMobil, paid some $1 billion in damages, and state and federal governments are seeking $92 million more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelso, now with the environmental group Ocean Conservancy, remembered traveling to the spill site in a small Coast Guard vessel with Alaska's then-Governor Steve Cowper, about six hours after the Valdez hit Bligh Reef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a thick pancake of shiny black, it was really calm," Kelso said in an interview. "We were right next to the vessel, the Coast Guard (boat) nosed up against the Exxon Valdez, which was listing and hanging on the reef, and the governor and I climbed up the rope ladder ... up to the deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a skeleton crew there, but no one from Exxon," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What struck him, apart from the pungent smell of newly spilled oil, was that Exxon's legally approved clean-up plan was not under way as it should have been. But he found plenty of Exxon personnel at an "incendiary" town meeting in the town of Valdez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RUBBER BOOTS AND THREE-PIECE SUITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The governor and I walked into this meeting and were the only ones who've been on the tanker," Kelso said. "We're obviously oily ... we're both wearing rubber boots ... and the Exxon officials are there but they're wearing three-piece suits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelso saw the Valdez spill and its aftermath as a systemic failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was the breakdown of an industrial system that the public had been assured would not break down," he said. "And because it was thought to be so reliable, some of the safeguards had been dismantled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the ecological devastation, Kelso said, the damage from the Valdez disaster calls into question whether Arctic offshore drilling should be part of U.S. energy strategy. Clean-up and recovery of oil has never been successfully accomplished in rough, ice-laden Arctic water, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bush administration's decision to offer millions of acres (hectares) of oil and gas leases in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas and Bristol Bay were based on 40-year-old information that failed to take the effects of global warming into account, Kelso said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate change spurred by human activities -- such as the emission of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants, oil refineries and fossil-fueled vehicles -- has hit the Arctic region roughly twice as hard as temperate areas. Arctic summer sea ice has decreased dramatically in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At a time when the entire set of ecosystems is under deep stress from global climate disruption, we would be well advised to go carefully when we think about extending these industrial activities," Kelso said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Vicki Allen)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Eve of Final Inspections, Proof that Dozens of Waste Pits Never Touched Were
Counted As "Remediated"
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
With judicial inspections in Chevron`s long-running environmental trial in
Ecuador about to end, new proof has emerged that the oil giant never touched the
majority of toxic waste pits that it certified as "clean" to Ecuador`s
government in exchange for a legal release, said a lawyer for the Amazon Defense
Coalition. 

The new evidence will be turned over to prosecutors who already have indicted
two Chevron lawyers and seven former government officials for criminal fraud
relating to the purported remediation, said Pablo Fajardo, the Ecuadorian lawyer
leading the class action lawsuit on behalf of 30,000 rainforest residents. 

The purported remediation was performed by Texaco (now Chevron) between 1995 and
1998 on pits that were mostly built in the early 1970s. The so-called clean-up
was controversial from the start, with Amazon residents claiming toxic pits were
covered with dirt for cosmetic purposes, allowing contaminants to continue
leaching into the soil and groundwater to this day. Texaco also received the
release before any work was done. 

The release has no bearing on the claims of the 30,000 residents bringing the
civil suit, as they did not sign off on it, said Fajardo. But it does provide
evidence of an underlying fraud that proves the remediation never really
occurred, despite Chevron`s claims today to the court and its public relations
materials. 

Texaco was the exclusive operator of several large oil fields in Ecuador`s
Amazon from 1964 to 1990. Chevron bought Texaco in 2001 and will bear any
liability in the case. 

In any event, the so-called release and remediation are now haunting Chevron in
an even bigger way with new evidence that Texaco never even touched the majority
of pits it certified as cleaned, said Fajardo. The final four inspections of 101
ordered by the court will be finished this week, clearing the way for a final
decision on $27 billion in damages. 

"Some pits Chevron covered with dirt for cosmetic purposes and called them
remediated," said Fajardo. "We now know there are many more pits that Chevron
never even touched but counted as remediated in its certification to the
government." 

"It is just unbelievable that a sophisticated American oil company could think
it would get away with this," added Fajardo. "This took a high level of
sophisticated planning and clearly could not have been done without the
cooperation of corrupt Ecuadorian government officials." 

A report by Texaco sub-contractor Woodward Clyde, the U.S.-based company that
did the clean-up, clearly indicates that the results fell far short of what
Texaco claimed at the time and what Chevron today continues to maintain today. 

According to the Woodward-Clyde report:

* Texaco agreed under its contract with Ecuador`s government to "remediate" only
130 of its 356 well sites to obtain a legal release from government claims. At
the 130 wells sites, it identified the existence of 250 unlined waste pits,
which were used to permanently dump toxic sludge when wells were drilled - a
violation of customary industry practice and environmental laws in both the U.S.
and Ecuador. 
* Of the 250 waste pits identified, Texaco actually touched only 162 of them.
Texaco claimed he other 88 pits were being "used" by the local community,
despite the fact they were filled with toxic oil sludge. (No evidence has ever
been produced by Texaco or Chevron that any pit was actually being "used" by the
local community other than what its engineers claimed at the time.) 
* The 88 pits were designated "No Further Action" based on a "visual" inspection
of the pit. No soil or water sampling was done to determine if the pit was
actually contaminated with hydrocarbons - a clear violation of scientific
protocol and of Texaco`s legal obligations under its clean-up contract with the
government. 
* Even worse for Chevron, the 250 pits identified was a gross undercount. During
the trial, the court found 379 pits at the same 130 sites - or 129 more pits
than Texaco had claimed at the time that it was obligated to remediate. 
* Texaco thus moved dirt at only 43% of the 379 pits that it was obligated to
"remediate" even though it received credit for cleaning all 379 pits to receive
its legal release, according to Fajardo.

In September of last year, the two Texaco lawyers who negotiated and supervised
the clean-up - American Ricardo Reis-Veiga and Ecuadorian Rodrigo Perez Pallares
- were hit with a criminal indictment for lying about the remediation results.
Seven key government officials with whom they worked closely at the time were
also indicted. 

Both Reis Veiga and Perez Pallares continue to work for Chevron. Both have
played instrumental roles in supervising Chevron`s defense in the current civil
trial where their previous conduct relating to the remediation is at issue. 

The lawsuit charges that Texaco dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic
waste into Amazon waterways and abandoned more than 900 large waste pits gouged
out of the jungle floor, creating one of the worst oil-related environmental
catastrophes in the world. The $27 billion in damages is more than the company`s
record-breaking profits in 2008. 

More than 62,000 chemical sampling results are in evidence. The court expert
found the sampling results prove that 100% of the inspected sites, which cover
an area roughly the size of Rhode Island, show illegal levels of toxic
hydrocarbons in the soil. 

A final decision by Judge Juan Nunez is expected later this year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI, March 24 (Reuters) - Gas supplies from Reliance
Industries' (RELI.BO) KG Basin block will will replace about 7
percent of local oil consumption in 2009/10, rising to 14
percent in the following three years, Goldman Sachs said in a
report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The U.S. bank said the start of supplies from the block off
India's east coast would also trigger investment of over $10
billion in gas transmission and distribution infrastructure in
the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would also reduce the country's current account and
fiscal deficits and support economic growth, Goldman Sachs
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reliance Industries, India's most valuable listed company,
is expected to pump gas from its D-6 block in Krishna Godavari
basin in early April, Petroleum Secretary R.S. Pandey said on
Tuesday. India's fiscal year starts on April 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs estimated the oil import bill of Asia's
third-largest oil consuming nation bill would fall by 1 percent
in 2009/10 and an average of 3 percent for the following three
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All else being equal, the current account deficit could
improve by 0.2 percent of GDP in 2009/10, and progressively
higher to an average improvement of 0.6 percent of GDP in
2010/11 to 2013/14".

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays is in talks with Goldman Sachs about a sale of the British bank's iShares unit, a source familiar with the situation said, adding one more name to a growing list of possible bidders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, sources said that private equity groups Hellman  Friedman, Bain Capital and TPG had all shown interest in iShares, the exchange-traded funds provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HF wanted to form a consortium and was eyeing an offer of around $5 billion, while Bain Capital and Goldman were mulling separate offers, the first source said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bids for the business are not due until at least this Thursday, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the Financial Times reported on its website that other trade bidders that are thought to be interested in iShares include Vanguard, the U.S. fund manager specializing in index-tracking funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays, which said last week it may sell the iShares exchange-traded funds provider, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have put the value of iShares -- part of Barclays Global Investors, the San Francisco-based fund management arm -- at around 3 billion pounds ($4.37 billion), more than one-third of Barclays's market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street journal reported on Friday that Barclays was offering to finance the purchase of the unit, lending up to 80 percent of the unit's price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital, the investment bank, is one of the biggest providers of funding for buyouts, but like all banks it has pulled back on providing buyout loans during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be more willing to provide a big loan for a business it knows so well, however, especially if it helps its parent achieve a deal to secure much-needed cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays could use the proceeds of any disposal to cover the cost of joining a government scheme to insure banks against losses on risky assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sale could also remove the need for the bank to sell new shares, or issue them directly to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would enable Barclays to avoid surrendering a stake to the government, in contrast to other British banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Victoria Howley; Writing by Douwe Miedema; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  OSLO, NORWAY, and ARMONK, NY, Mar 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Ringnes, Norway's largest brewery and a subsidiary of the Carlsberg
Group, today announced that the company is using IBM (NYSE: IBM) sensor
technology to gain greater visibility into its logistics operations, and
in the process, to better serve Norwegian retailers and consumers.

    Across Norway, retailers and restaurants rely on Ringnes to provide almost
half a billion liters of beverages annually, including beer, soft drinks
and bottled water. With shipping volumes as large as these, Ringnes needs
to make its deliveries as predictable as possible so retail customers can
maintain the right amount of the beverages on their shelves at all times.

    With 200 trucks on the road at any given time, Ringnes has never had a
real-time overview of the exact location of the containers used to
transport both beverages and empty bottles returned by stores. Now,
Ringnes is using RFID technology that enables the company to track the
arrival, departure, loading and unloading of each container at its Oslo
facility. The data on the tags is collected and processed using IBM
software. Prior to the creation of its new system, Ringnes employees
tracked containers using manual logs. The exact location of a truck could
only be determined visually or by phone. Manual maintenance of such large
operations can lead to errors and bottlenecks.

    Now, Ringnes is using RFID tags to track each shipping container. These
smart sensors capture all data linked to the plant's 40 loading gates. The
IBM system is helping Ringnes to reduce costs and make more timely
deliveries. Employees in the Ringnes Oslo facility are now able to access
a complete view of the trucks and containers inside the shipping and
receiving terminal, as well as their load status. Ringnes can quickly
determine whether a trailer or container is on or off site, how long it
was parked at the facility, and when it was loaded, unloaded, and driven
away. In addition, the brewery can quickly spot and resolve bottlenecks
in its logistics operations and address them in order to speed deliveries.

    "Even small changes in our logistics system can have a positive effect on
our bottom line," said Jan Inge Bakkane, business process manager at
Ringnes. "The system we've created with IBM will allow our logistics
operations to work smarter, which makes for better customer service."

    Ringnes is considering extending the system to its 4 other locations and
integrate it with the company's other logistics systems. In the future,
Ringnes also plans to use RFID tags on its pallets to track the movement
of individual products to retailers. This will further the company's
ability to help customers maintain the right amount of each product at
all times.

    "Through this project, IBM and Ringnes are demonstrating how sensor
technology can be used to infuse their supply chains with unprecedented
levels of intelligence," said Morten Thorkildsen, country general manager
for IBM Norway.

    All of the data from the RFID tags Ringnes is using is captured and stored
using IBM's WebSphere Premises Server software. It is then made available
for viewing and analysis via a Web-based dashboard based on IBM's DB2
AlphaBlox application.

&lt;p&gt;  STUTTGART, GERMANY and ARMONK, NY, Mar 24 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it is working with Volkswagen Group,
Europe's leading vehicle manufacturer, to improve the automaker's
material logistics operations through the use of sensor technology.

    The new system will significantly enhance the carmaker's efficiencies in
day-to-day operations, for instance at the goods-receiving stage. As a
result, Volkswagen is preparing to introduce this technology at its
central logistics hall, located at its major plant in Germany.

    Volkswagen is deploying the new system following a one-year pilot project
in which the automaker and IBM tested RFID technology with suppliers.
Using this system, shipping containers carrying auto parts destined for
Volkswagen will be increasingly fitted with RFID tags.

    "The pilot project has been ground-breaking," said Kurt Rindle, global
sensor Solutions executive, IBM. "Volkswagen is driving innovation by
becoming the first vehicle manufacturer to make daily use of RFID
technology in the flow of materials between suppliers and the
manufacturing line."

    The information on the tagged containers is automatically collected by
readers at all key locations throughout the supply chain -- first at the
supplier's shipping department, through the transportation process until
they arrive at Volkswagen, then during storage, collection and
installation on the automaker's assembly line. The same process is used
when Volkswagen returns the empty shipping containers to its suppliers to
ensure that all containers are returned after the auto parts are
received. The technology is also reducing the need for paper documents
and barcode labels.

    "Our long-term goal is to implement an integrated, paperless production
and logistics chain throughout the whole Group," said Klaus Hardy
Muehleck, Group CIO and head of Group IT at Volkswagen. "The pilot
project showed that we can reliably integrate RFID technology into our
business processes at a low cost," he said.

    For the pilot, Volkswagen fitted around 3,000 shipping containers with
passive RFID tags, supplied by Intermec Technologies Corporation. The
technology has been refined so that it can also automatically register
metal containers, which normally interfere with RFID technology. The tags
were used on containers carrying sunroofs for the new Volkswagen Golf.
Readers at the entrances to the manufacturing line, along with mobile
handheld scanners and forklifts were used to identify the containers and
their contents.

    The IBM technology being used for this project is comprised of IBM Global
Technology Services' RFID container management solution together with the
IBM WebSphere Premises Server, an application-neutral RFID middleware
product.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) hopes to pay back the $10 billion it took from the U.S.
government's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program within
a month, The New York Times said on Tuesday, citing people
involved in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The urgency to repay the money follows last week's uproar
over bonuses paid to executives at the insurer American
International Group Inc (AIG.N), and revelations that Goldman
was the largest recipient of government money stemming from its
role as an AIG counterparty, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs spokesman Ed Canaday declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A growing number of TARP recipients have said they plan to
repay their money or do so as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some have complained that investors perceive TARP
recipients as not being strong enough to operate on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others have complained about the government's unilateral
ability to impose new restrictions on TARP recipients,
including limitations on bonuses that could prompt thousands of
employees to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Repaying TARP money would also spare recipients of making
dividend payouts to taxpayers. For Goldman and most other
recipients, the annual payout is 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Kovacevich, the chairman of Wells Fargo  Co
(WFC.N), on March 13 complained about the strings attached to
TARP. He also said that had the government not forced Wells
Fargo to take $25 billion, the bank would have been able to
raise private capital and perhaps avoid a later dividend cut.

    negligible performance degradation when deploying Exchange Server 2007.
    

    
The ESRP results that 3PAR submitted demonstrated the ability to scale
Exchange Server 2007 databases simply and confidently within a single,
massively scalable storage platform, thereby avoiding the costs and
complexities associated with multiple systems. 3PAR's results of
24,000-user, 48,000-user, and 96,000-user Exchange Server 2007
configurations with a single, consolidated 3PAR InServ T800 Storage
Server demonstrated the linear scalability of the 3PAR InServ array.

    "Our previous environment was more expensive, more management-intensive,
and limited our ability to scale to meet the demands of our students,"
said Bryan Lucas, CTO at Texas Christian University. "The combination of
Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and 3PAR Utility Storage allows us the
agility to easily accommodate increasing student storage needs with
minimal management overhead, all at a fraction of the cost of traditional
storage."

    The following results demonstrate that customers can easily calculate the
required number of InServ Controller Nodes and disk drives required to
support Exchange Server 2007 deployments based on the number of mailboxes
and approximate aggregate IOPS (I/Os per second):


Mailboxes   Disk Drives / Controllers   Aggregate IOPS
---------   -------------------------   --------------
  24,000         160 / 2                   14,753.1
  48,000         320 / 2                   27,469.2
  96,000         640 / 4                   55,405.0

    
3PAR
InServ Storage Servers were able to deliver this linear
scalability because they feature a clustered architecture that utilizes
fine-grained and autonomic striping of data across massively parallel
internal resources. This unique architecture has been demonstrated to
deliver exceptional performance and scalability on which customers like
Texas Christian University have come to rely for their Exchange Server
2007 deployments.

    3PAR also tested and submitted a 24,000-mailbox configuration using
Exchange Server 2007 with Cluster Continuous Replication (CCR). CCR is a
High Availability (HA) feature of Exchange Server 2007 that combines the
asynchronous log shipping and replay technology built into Exchange Server
2007 with the failover and management features provided by the Cluster
service.

    Finally, 3PAR -- a pioneer of thin provisioning and thin copy technologies
-- submitted a similar 24,000-mailbox configuration with CCR using 3PAR
Thin Provisioning. 3PAR's Thin Provisioning performance numbers
demonstrated only a 1.4 percent decrease in aggregate IOPS as compared to
the IOPS achieved using the same configuration but without 3PAR Thin
Provisioning. 3PAR's submission demonstrated that customers deploying 3PAR
Thin Provisioning to achieve storage cost reduction in Exchange Server
2007 deployments do not have to sacrifice performance.

    "The decision to deploy 3PAR Thin Provisioning was an easy one," said
Lucas. "With 3PAR, we saved 5x on our storage hardware, reducing what
would have cost us approximately five dollars per mailbox down to less
than a dollar per mailbox. Those were savings on storage we couldn't pass
up -- especially given the current economic climate."

"3PAR's ESRP results demonstrate the ability to scale massively and
do more with less with a single 3PAR InServ T-Class storage array in
Exchange Server 2007 environments," said Jeff Boles, Senior Analyst and
Director at Taneja Group. "3PAR has repeatedly and consistently
demonstrated how the sophisticated technologies within their InServ
arrays enable them to do 'more for less.' In this case, less InServ
storage -- and consequently less power, space, and cooling -- delivers
more performance. For IT organizations shopping for new storage because
of data growth, new performance demands, or just the realization that
their current storage should be more efficient, 3PAR's reputation for
smart, efficient storage should put them on any short list where 'more
for less' is an important consideration," said Boles.

    "These ESRP results demonstrate how 3PAR, as a longtime thin provisioning
pioneer, delivers linear scalability and uncompromising thin provisioning
performance with Exchange Server 2007 databases," said David Scott,
President and CEO for 3PAR. "The ability to consolidate with confidence is
critical in a climate where organizations are under tremendous pressure to
do more with less. Avoiding the costs and complexities of purchasing and
maintaining multiple storage systems can make the difference between
surviving and perishing in these lean economic times."

    "The Exchange Solution Reviewed Program (ESRP) for storage allows
Microsoft partners like 3PAR to demonstrate the storage benefits,
capabilities, and best practices that customers can take advantage of
when deploying Exchange Server 2007," said Astrid McClean, Sr. Technical
Product Manager at Microsoft Corp. "We are pleased that 3PAR participated
in the ESRP to demonstrate the performance, scalability, and thin
provisioning benefits that our mutual Exchange Server 2007 customers can
realize with 3PAR utility storage."

    The ESRP for storage is a Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 program designed
to facilitate third-party storage testing and solution publishing for
Exchange Server 2007. The program combines a storage testing harness
(Jetstress) with solution publishing guidelines. Specific results posted

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - The chief executive of Dell Inc said on Tuesday that talk of IBM possibly buying Sun Microsystems was providing an "enormous opportunity" to the world's No. 2 PC maker in the corporate server market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Dell said such talk created uncertainty over the future of Sun's Solaris-based servers and accelerated a customer migration to the servers based on standard industry components, known as x86 servers, which are Dell's mainstay product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the potential IBM-Sun union, Dell is also facing an uphill battle with network equipment maker Cisco Systems with and Hewlett-Packard. Cisco has announced a foray into the server market and HP has started to offer a more complete package of technology services to its corporate clients after its purchase of EDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just the rumor of IBM potentially purchasing Sun creates an enormous opportunity because all of the Sun accounts are very concerned what will happen to the Solaris platform and Sparc microprocessor," Dell told a briefing in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this accelerates the migration (to x86-based servers) and sends a lot of those accounts into an opportunity," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources with knowledge of the matter have said International Business Machines Corp is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported that IBM was offering to pay at least $6.5 billion in cash, with the total deal value at about $8 billion, including $1.4 billion of cash on Sun's balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell lags both IBM and HP in the server market, with a 2008 market share of around 12 percent, according to research group IDC. Its focus has been on low- to mid-range x86 servers, and Dell ranks second in that market after HP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell also said that the company was exploring the business of smaller screen devices, while its consumer business is growing faster than the industry in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is considering making and selling smartphones based on Google's Android operating system and Microsoft's Windows Mobile software, the Wall Street Journal reported in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC sales make up around 60 percent of Dell's revenue, and the global recession and popularity of cheaper personal computers caused the company's quarterly revenue to fall more than expected in the three months to the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sachi Izumi; Editing by Hugh Lawson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and China's ICBC (1398.HK) have been in discussions about the New York bank reducing its stake in the world's largest financial institution, according to a report on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other Western banks before it, Goldman has been expected to consider selling down part of its 4.9 percent ownership of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS) when the lock-up period ends at the end of next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That stake is worth around $8.5 billion, based on ICBC's market capitalization of about $178 billion which makes it the world's biggest bank by that measure. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that a Goldman sell down could raise around $1 billion for the bank by selling 15-20 percent of its holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICBC signed a deal in 2005 to sell a 10 percent stake to a consortium that included Goldman, European insurer Allianz AG (ALVG.DE) and American Express Co (AXP.N) for more than $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equity capital market bankers in Asia expect the other two members of the consortium to consider selling their stakes as well, as their lock-up periods also end at the end of next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICBC's shares soared after the bank went public in 2006, nearly tripling in price by November 2007. But the global economic slowdown has taken its toll on the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICBC shares fell 1 percent to HK$3.48 on Tuesday, not far above their IPO price of HK$3.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Western shareholders in other Chinese banks have also been trimming or selling their stakes to free up cash and help restore their battered balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America (BAC.N) raised $2.83 billion in January by selling part of its stake in China Construction Bank (CCB) (601939.SS). Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) sold its 4.26 percent in Bank of China (3988.HK) (601988.SS) that same month, raising $2.34 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether Goldman sells is difficult to call. It's been talked about ad nauseum since the CCB placement," said JPMorgan analyst Sunil Garg. "Some of the commercial banks have had a bigger need for capital in their own markets than Goldman. But yes, its a possibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garg pointed out that shares of Chinese banks that had Western sellers have widely risen since the sell down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What that tells you is that most of these stakes were really financial stakes, rather than truly strategic. When it's a true strategic partner, it's viewed as a negative event."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has said the bank would like to repay the $10 billion it received from the U.S. government to get out from under executive pay and other restrictions tied to the funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay and Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays (BARC.L) is in talks with Goldman Sachs (GS.N) about a sale of the British bank's iShares unit, a source familiar with the situation said, adding one more name to a growing list of possible bidders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, sources said that private equity groups Hellman  Friedman, Bain Capital and TPG TPG.UL had all shown interest in iShares, the exchange-traded funds provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HF wanted to form a consortium and was eyeing an offer of around $5 billion, while Bain Capital and Goldman were mulling separate offers, the first source said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bids for the business are not due until at least this Thursday, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the Financial Times reported on its website that other trade bidders that are thought to be interested in iShares include Vanguard, the U.S. fund manager specializing in index-tracking funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays, which said last week it may sell the iShares exchange-traded funds provider, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have put the value of iShares -- part of Barclays Global Investors, the San Francisco-based fund management arm -- at around 3 billion pounds ($4.37 billion), more than one-third of Barclays's market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street journal reported on Friday that Barclays was offering to finance the purchase of the unit, lending up to 80 percent of the unit's price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital, the investment bank, is one of the biggest providers of funding for buyouts, but like all banks it has pulled back on providing buyout loans during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be more willing to provide a big loan for a business it knows so well, however, especially if it helps its parent achieve a deal to secure much-needed cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays could use the proceeds of any disposal to cover the cost of joining a government scheme to insure banks against losses on risky assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sale could also remove the need for the bank to sell new shares, or issue them directly to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would enable Barclays to avoid surrendering a stake to the government, in contrast to other British banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Lloyds Banking Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(LLOY.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Victoria Howley; Writing by Douwe Miedema; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies Deliver Scalable Platform for Marketing Optimization
NEWTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Enterprise marketing software provider Neolane, Inc. today announced it will
integrate IBM (NYSE: IBM) DB2 Database software, including DB2 Workgroup and
InfoSphere Warehouse, into its marketing automation platform. Additionally,
Neolane will leverage IBM`s InfoSphere Master Data Management (MDM) Server
capabilities as an option to provide marketers with more confidence about the
relevancy and quality of their data for improved campaign effectiveness,
customer value and return on investment (ROI). Neolane will market the combined
solutions to customers worldwide. 

As marketing spend remains under intense scrutiny, Neolane and IBM are working
together to help marketers achieve a better understanding of their clients and
better manage and automate the customer communication workflow. In data
intensive environments, IBM`s InfoSphere MDM Server becomes the cornerstone to
establishing a single marketing view of the customer, providing Neolane`s
automated enterprise marketing platform with a unified source to drive
consistent, coordinated customer communication across channels. Through the
integrated IBM InfoSphere Warehouse infrastructure, organizations utilizing
Neolane`s platform will also be able to improve their understanding of their
customers, helping them to more rapidly meet customer needs and capitalize on
new opportunities. 

"IBM and Neolane have complementary solutions that enable marketers to maximize
the use of core master data on customers, locations, products and accounts while
ensuring that data is updated and synchronized across channels in real-time,"
said Rob Thomas, vice president of Information Management, IBM. "Using
InfoSphere Warehouse and Master Data Management software, Neolane`s clients will
be able to turn large amounts of customer data into effective marketing
campaigns which will result in more valuable long-term customer relationships." 

Neolane`s Cross-Channel Direct Marketing and Lead Management Optimization
solutions are based on a single, web-services based platform that centrally
manages direct marketing campaigns, leads, resources, customer data and
analytics. The Neolane platform was specifically engineered to handle the entire
range of traditional and emerging channels, including mobile (SMS and MMS).
Together with the IBM InfoSphere MDM Server, Neolane helps marketers:

* Ensure coherence and real-time synchronization of customer data across
multiple repositories; 
* Consume or publish any data stored in the customer domain in order to create a
single customer profile and drive unified programs across channels; 
* Deliver real-time, event driven or scheduled customer communications; and 
* Maximize programs associated with advanced geographic segmentation and
targeting; up-sell, cross-sell and product bundling opportunities, and more.

"In high-volume marketing environments, creating a single view of the customer
can be a daunting, time consuming process that can negatively impact campaign
effectiveness if not done correctly," said Stephan Dietrich, president, Neolane
Inc. "Working with IBM is a tremendous opportunity to deliver additional value
to organizations that are bound to large, difficult-to-mine databases. With
Neolane and IBM`s InfoSphere MDM Server, those customers will be able to
maximize the benefits of Neolane`s automated enterprise marketing platform to
improve cross-channel campaign effectiveness and generate revenues." 

Ouest-France Benefits From Neolane and IBM Solution

Neolane has already generated positive customer results based on its integration
with IBM`s InfoSphere MDM Server. Neolane was the winner of IBM`s 2008
Information Management "Rookie of the Year" Award based on the successful
implementation of the Neolane platform and IBM InfoSphere MDM Server at
Ouest-France, the top daily newspaper in France. Ouest-France implemented the
joint Neolane and IBM InfoSphere MDM solution in order to develop and optimize
its relationship marketing programs across multiple channels - e-mail, website,
direct mail, SMS and call centers. 

"The combination of Neolane`s enterprise marketing platform and IBM`s MDM
solution allows us to discover new revenue opportunities by developing a unified
customer relationship across channels," said Jean-Dominique Hardy, vice director

 (Refiles to add missing word 'about' in first paragraph)
 (Adds details, background, analyst quote, changes dateline,
adds byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, March 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) and China's ICBC (1398.HK) have been in discussions
about the New York bank reducing its stake in the world's
largest financial institution, according to a report on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like other Western banks before it, Goldman has been
expected to consider selling down part of its 4.9 percent
ownership of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
(601398.SS) when the lock-up period ends at the end of next
month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That stake is worth around $8.5 billion, based on ICBC's
market capitalisation of about $178 billion which makes it the
world's biggest bank by that measure. The Wall Street Journal
reported on Tuesday that a Goldman sell down could raise around
$1 billion for the bank by selling 15-20 percent of its
holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC signed a deal in 2005 to sell a 10 percent stake to a
consortium that included Goldman, European insurer Allianz AG
(ALVG.DE) and American Express Co (AXP.N) for more than $3
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equity capital market bankers in Asia expect the other two
members of the consortium to consider selling their stakes as
well, as their lock-up periods also end at the end of next
month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC's shares soared after the bank went public in 2006,
nearly tripling in price by November 2007. But the global
economic slowdown has taken its toll on the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC shares fell 1 percent to HK$3.48 on Tuesday, not far
above their IPO price of HK$3.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major Western shareholders in other Chinese banks have also
been trimming or selling their stakes to free up cash and help
restore their battered balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America (BAC.N) raised $2.83 billion in January by
selling part of its stake in China Construction Bank (CCB)
(601939.SS). Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) sold its 4.26
percent in Bank of China (3988.HK) (601988.SS) that same month,
raising $2.34 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whether Goldman sells is difficult to call. It's been
talked about ad nauseum since the CCB placement," said JPMorgan
analyst Sunil Garg. "Some of the commercial banks have had a
bigger need for capital in their own markets than Goldman. But
yes, its a possibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garg pointed out that shares of Chinese banks that had
Western sellers have widely risen since the sell down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What that tells you is that most of these stakes were
really financial stakes, rather than truly strategic. When it's
a true strategic partner, it's viewed as a negative event."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has said the bank would like to repay the $10
billion it received from the U.S. government to get out from
under executive pay and other restrictions tied to the funds.

&lt;p&gt; * Dell CEO says talk of IBM buying Sun creates opportunity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says exploring smaller screen device business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says growth of its consumer business beating industry in Q1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sachi Izumi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOKYO, March 24 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Dell Inc
DELL.O said on Tuesday that talk of IBM (IBM.N) possibly buying
Sun Microsystems JAVA.O was providing an "enormous opportunity"
to the world's No. 2 PC maker in the corporate server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Dell said such talk created uncertainty over the
future of Sun's Solaris-based servers and accelerated a customer
migration to the servers based on standard industry components,
known as x86 servers, which are Dell's mainstay product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apart from the potential IBM-Sun union, Dell is also facing
an uphill battle with network equipment maker Cisco Systems
(CSCO.O) with and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N). Cisco has announced a
foray into the server market and HP has started to offer a more
complete package of technology services to its corporate clients
after its purchase of EDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Just the rumour of IBM potentially purchasing Sun creates an
enormous opportunity because all of the Sun accounts are very
concerned what will happen to the Solaris platform and Sparc
microprocessor," Dell told a briefing in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think this accelerates the migration (to x86-based
servers) and sends a lot of those accounts into an opportunity,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources with knowledge of the matter have said International
Business Machines Corp is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal reported that IBM was offering to pay
at least $6.5 billion in cash, with the total deal value at about
$8 billion, including $1.4 billion of cash on Sun's balance
sheet. [ID:nN20518314]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dell lags both IBM and HP in the server market, with a 2008
market share of around 12 percent, according to research group
IDC. Its focus has been on low- to mid-range x86 servers, and
Dell ranks second in that market after HP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dell also said that the company was exploring the business of
smaller screen devices, while its consumer business is growing
faster than the industry in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is considering making and selling smartphones
based on Google's (GOOG.O) Android operating system and
Microsoft's (MSFT.O) Windows Mobile software, the Wall Street
Journal reported in January. [ID:nLU451329]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PC sales make up around 60 percent of Dell's revenue, and the
global recession and popularity of cheaper personal computers
caused the company's quarterly revenue to fall more than expected
in the three months to the end of January. [ID:nN26360990]

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - "The Stoneheart Trilogy," a young-adult fantasy book series by Charlie Fletcher, is moving toward a big-screen adaptation, with Robert Zemeckis' production company, ImageMovers, and Walt Disney Pictures in negotiations to pick up film rights to the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The books revolve around a 12-year-old London boy who enters a hidden alternate world where statues, imbued with the essence of their makers, come to life. The boy's presence upsets a balance between good and evil, and while dealing with such creatures as sphinxes and gargoyles, he teams with an orphan girl and the statue of a World War I gunner to try to set things right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intent is to adapt "Stoneheart" using performance-capture technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third "Stoneheart" book, "Silvertongue," is due in stores next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sheri Linden at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds analyst comment, details on IBM's recent results)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 25 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) will cut about
5,000 jobs in the United States, adding to similarly large cuts
in the past few months, sources with knowledge of the matter
told Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The job cuts will account for over 4 percent of IBM's U.S.
workforce, which totaled around 115,000 at the end of 2008. The
sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the
issue, said the cuts will mostly be in IBM's global services
business, which includes outsourcing and consulting services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An International Business Machines Corp spokesman declined
to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which had a total workforce of 398,455 as of
the end of 2008, has not disclosed how many jobs it has cut so
far this year, but has said it was making "structural changes"
to reduce spending and improve productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think the company showed a lot more stability than most
its competitors. At the same time, I think it's wise to
remember that the economy remains unsettled," said Charles
King, principal analyst with technology research firm Pund-IT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It makes sense for a company like IBM to take a close look
at its employees and projects that are in process and so on,
and play the safe game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wednesday's news also comes as IBM is in exclusive talks to
buy Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O, according to sources
familiar with the matter, a move that would create a clear
leader in the high-end computer server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM, which now earns around two-thirds of its revenue from
outside the United States, has been expanding its workforce in
emerging markets like India and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end of 2008, employment in the BRIC countries --
Brazil, Russia, India and China-- totaled around 113,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has been hit by slower U.S. technology spending, and
its fourth-quarter revenue fell 6.4 percent from a year ago,
although it has fared better than many rivals thanks to its
global footprint and a decreased emphasis on hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A month ago, IBM affirmed its full-year forecast of $9.20
earnings per share, and said contract signings for its business
services had grown so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares fell 0.42 percent to close at $97.95 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;SAN ANTONIO, March 25 (Reuters) - A process safety program
has improved the reliability of Chevron Corp's (CVX.N)
2.2-million barrel per day (bpd) refining system and yielded a
gain in throughput equivalent to a new refinery, Jeet Bindra,
Chevron's president of global manufacturing said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We found if you operate your refinery reliably and safely,
you can produce as much as one new greenfield refinery," Bindra
said in a speech to the Hart World Refining  Fuels
Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has reduced unplanned operational interruptions by
40 percent in the past two years through regular planned
maintenance and preventive maintenance, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Small increases in operational reliability at each refinery
from the safety program have equaled a capacity gain between
100,000 and 150,000 bpd, Bindra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now is not the time to cut corners," he said. "You need to
know the condition of your equipment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board called on
refiners and chemical plant operators to not reduce maintenance
as they cut costs to counter falling refining margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cost-cutting in equipment maintenance was seen as a factor
in the deadly March 23, 2005 blast at BP Plc's Texas City,
Texas, refinery, the CSB found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is also looking at increased operational automation
of operations to improve reliability at its refineries, he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think the technology is available today to react to
upset conditions without human interaction," Bindra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Operational control has been centralized in the past two
decades in refinery command centers with operators monitoring
computer screens and reacting to malfunction alarms with gauges
and control valves on refinery units as back-ups.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) Chief Executive Paul Otellini said IBM's (IBM.N) discussions to acquire Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O are likely to succeed for one ringing reason: Money Talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a chat with Intel employees on Monday, Otellini said it is no surprise International Business Machines Corp's interest in the high-end computer maker comes in the wake of a plunge in Sun's stock price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can tell you that Sun was shopped around the valley and around the world in the last few months," Otellini said in comments detailed on Wednesday in a filing with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of companies got calls or visits on buying some or all the assets of the company.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 25 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) Chief
Executive Paul Otellini said IBM's (IBM.N) discussions to
acquire Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O are likely to succeed for
one ringing reason: Money Talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; During a chat with Intel employees on Monday, Otellini said

interest in the high-end computer maker comes in the wake of a
plunge in Sun's stock price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I can tell you that Sun was shopped around the valley and
around the world in the last few months," Otellini said in
comments detailed on Wednesday in a filing with the U.S.
Securities Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A lot of companies got calls or visits on buying some or

&lt;p&gt;March 25 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities started
coverage of BlackBerry smartphone maker Research in Motion
RIM.TORIMM.O with an "underweight" rating and a price
target of $40, saying the company is already operating close to
its peak earnings power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Analyst Ehud Gelblum said further growth in unit volume
would be offset by declines in average selling price and
corresponding growth in research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While unit volumes and subscriber numbers should continue
to grow, we believe the rate of growth should slow considerably
over the next 18 months as we move beyond the recent slew of
new model launched," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He noted that consumer replacement cycles were lengthening
across the entire handset market due to weak consumer spending,
and the rising unemployment was expected to erode Research in
Motion's customer base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gelblum said currently users were replacing their
BlackBerrys every 1.5 years at an unsustainably high
replacement rate of 69 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He expects the replacement rate to fall 43 percent by
fiscal 2011, implying a new BlackBerry every 2.3 years.
However, analyst Gelblum noted that the company's high-margin
services revenue stream provides strong gross profit and cash
flow, helping offset the declining device margins. Shares of
the company were up 2 percent at $43.56 in morning trade
Wednesday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;March 25 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded CB
Richard Ellis Group Inc (CBG.N) to "overweight" from "neutral"
on Wednesday, a day after the real estate services firm amended
its credit agreement with lenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Analyst Anthony Paolone said the restructured debt
agreement will alleviate the liquidity risk surrounding the
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have tried to incorporate very weak operating
assumptions and come to the conclusion that the risk/reward and
upside/downside in the stock is attractive," said the analyst,
who set a $7 target price on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to covenant relief, the company will be able to
add back up to $225 million to operating earnings calculated
for covenant purposes through cost savings, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the analyst warned that from a fundamental
perspective, the company is going to continue to face
challenges in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Commercial real estate is still not changing hands much,
so investment sales revenues should remain under pressure,"
Paolone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company rose 64 percent to trade at $4.81 in
morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; * NPL ratio continues to improve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * $1.9 bln loss on U.S. subprime, agency securities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Goldman extends lockup on most of ICBC stake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Recasts with Goldman Sachs details; adds quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tony Munroe and Simon Rabinovitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG/BEIJING, March 25 (Reuters) - Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (1398.HK), the world's biggest
lender by market value, posted flat fourth-quarter profit and
struck a deal to extend Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) investment in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in ICBC (601398.SS) have been under pressure on
market expectations that foreign strategic investors led by
Goldman Sachs will begin to offload their stakes in the bank
when the first lock-up provision lapses in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under its old agreement, Goldman Sachs was permitted to sell
half of its 4.93 percent stake in ICBC in April and the rest in
October. Now it has committed to keep 80 percent of its ICBC
stake, now worth about $8.75 billion, until April 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time American Express Co (AXP.N) said it may
sell its 0.38 percent stake in ICBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Vice Chairman Michael Evans, who appeared at ICBC's
20008 earnings media conference in Beijing, said the Wall Street
firm does not need to raise cash and would not use the sale of
its ICBC stake excluded from the new lockup to repay funds it
owes to the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman Sachs does not need to raise cash as a firm," Evans
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in no rush to sell any ICBC shares," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State-run ICBC posted fourth quarter net income of 18.11
billion yuan ($2.65 billion), compared with 18.02 billion yuan a
year earlier and in line with the average forecast of 18.3
billion yuan by analysts polled by Reuters Estimates, as higher
provisions against soured assets offset loan growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOUGHER 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across the Chinese banking industry, credit costs are
forecast to rise this year as banks set aside capital against
futire bad loans. Interest margins are expected to tighten
following a spree of rate cuts late last year as Beijing takes
measures to keep the economy growing at 8 percent or above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts also expect more non-performing loans across the
industry as China's slowing economic growth squeezes borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the year, ICBC earned 110.84 billion yuan, up 36 percent
from 81.5 billion in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC made allowances for losses on U.S. subprime mortgage
and agency-backed debt totalling $1.9 billion. The bank's
overall allowance for impairment losses for the year jumped by
48.3 percent to 55.5 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC's non-performing loan ratio continued to fall, reaching
2.29 percent for the year, compared with 2.74 percent in 2007.
To prepare for a possible increase in NPLs, the bank increased
its coverage ratio against bad loans to 130.15 percent from
103.5 percent a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net interest margin improved to 2.95 percent for the year
from 2.8 percent in 2007, while net fee and commission income
rose 15 percent. Loans for the year rose 12.2 percent to 4.57
trillion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "ICBC's net interest margin increased and NPL ratio came
down but we have to see whether this trend will be continued in
the first quarter of 2009," said Ernie Hon, an analyst at ICEA
Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For earning graphic, click on:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WORLD'S BIGGEST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chinese banks, less battered than overseas rivals by the
global economic slowdown, hold the top three spots by market
value among global banks, with ICBC by far the largest at $178.6
billion, ahead of China Construction Bank (0939.HK)(601939.SS)
and Bank of China (3988.HK)(601988.SS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That kind of muscle has fuelled expectations that China will
look to buy or invest in overseas financial institutions at
bargain prices, although Beijing is wary after its sovereign
wealth fund made big investments in Blackstone Group (BX.N) and
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) that are now under water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC, which owns 20 percent of South Africa's Standard Bank
(SBKJ.J), is nonetheless looking to expand overseas through
acquisitions and by growing its existing businesses, President
Yang Kaisheng told Reuters in an interview earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, Bank of China missed forecasts when it posted a
58 percent drop in fourth quarter profits, although investors
took solace in its aggressive provisioning against bad assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, American Express (AXP.N) and German insurer
Allianz (ALVG.DE) own a combined 7.2 percent of ICBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong shares in ICBC have lost 26 percent in the 52
weeks through Tuesday, worse than the 21 percent and 12 percent
declines seen by Bank of China and Construction Bank. Foreign
strategic investors sold big stakes in both China Construction
Bank and Bank of China earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC shares rose 1.13 percent on Wednesday to close at
HK$3.58 ahead of the results report.

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Mar 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Honourable Peter Van Loan, Minister of Public Safety, made the
following statement in response to the announcement that the Canada
Border Services Agency had seized 78 kilograms of cocaine with an
estimated worth of $9.8 million at the Ambassador Bridge border crossing
in Windsor, Ontario.

    "I want to congratulate the Border Services Officers who discovered this
very significant quantity of illegal drugs. Their diligent work, combined
with sophisticated detection technology, help to keep dangerous drugs off
our streets and keep our communities safe.

    The Government of Canada recognizes that illicit drugs undermine healthy
families and safe communities, fuel organized crime and foster petty
crime. For this reason, as part of our Government's National Anti-Drug
Strategy, we have invested $102 million over five years to support law
enforcement in combating the production and distribution of illicit
drugs. Legislative reforms, recently introduced by this Government and
now before Parliament, would help further disrupt gang and drug
activities.

    I encourage all Canadians to take note of yet another successful
operation by the Canada Border Services Agency. Our message to organized
crime and drug traffickers is clear: there will be serious consequences
for these illegal pursuits, which jeopardize the safety of our
communities."

&lt;p&gt;  GUANGZHOU CITY, CHINA, Mar 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Guangzhou Metro Corporation (GZ Metro) has selected IBM (NYSE: IBM)
technology and services to improve the City's rapid transit system
serving more than two million passengers a day. IBM will help GZ Metro
manage all of its IT and physical assets including four commuter lines,
60 stations and more than 116 kilometers of track.

    Smart transportation systems, like GZ Metro, help improve safety and
reliability, while reducing travel delays, emissions and fuel consumption.
As part of the Guangdong Provincial Government's Five-Year Development
Plan (2008 to 2012), the government will improve Guangzhou City's
infrastructure to support the organization of the 16th Asian Games, held
next year. The investment program is aimed to turn the public
transportation system into an environment-friendly, intelligent and
digitalized transportation system.

    Currently, GZ Metro's various assets are estimated to be worth more than
RMB 20 billion (US$2.9 billion). The efficiency of GZ Metro is dependent
on complete visibility across all its assets in order to provide safe and
uninterrupted railway services. Under the agreement signed in February
2009, GZ Metro is working with IBM to introduce an Integrated Asset
Management (IAM) System as part of its modernization efforts. The IAM
system will be the first of its kind for China.

    With multiple software applications installed, GZ Metro is currently only
able to draw a partial view of its total assets. As a result, the company
does not have the visibility it needs to achieve efficiency and on-time
service. To provide safe and uninterrupted railway services, GZ Metro
wanted to build an advanced, secure and reliable IT platform to manage its
software, services and physical assets including tracks, carriages,
advertising spots and shops in the train stations.

    "With traffic congestion on the rise in cities across China, it has become
critical to build smarter rail systems and governments are investing
heavily in these projects," said Marc Chapman, General Manager, Global
Business Services, Greater China, IBM. "By having control over each asset
across the entire rail system, Guangzhou Metro is able to improve safety
and on time arrivals for passengers and commuters."

    For the implementation of the IAM platform, IBM Global Business Services
will build a uniform asset classification and coding system for all
assets, as well as integrate the operational and financial management
processes in investment, construction, operation and asset maintenance --
throughout the entire life cycle of asset management. The system will
improve the GZ Metro's transparency into their operational processes,
which can enhance asset-related decision-making, asset service delivery
and return on investment. This will contribute to GZ Metro's business
objective of improving efficiency and increasing asset uptime.

    The IAM platform, powered by IBM Maximo software, will help GZ Metro
improve maintenance procedures by integrating the overall work procedures
with contract management, as well as monitor and manage the maintenance
equipment. This will lower the operational maintenance cost while
improving productivity and prolonging the lifespan of the equipment.

    The IAM project is instrumental to supporting the GZ Metro's expansion
plan. In anticipation of a sharp increase in the number of passengers, the
rapid transit railway operator is investing RMB 12 billion (US$1.76
billion) this year to expand the networks which will be able to operate
nine commuter lines. As a result, GZ Metro's daily passenger capacity will
increase from two to four million.

    Metro had evaluated the asset management offerings from IBM and several
other international IT companies. IBM Global Business Services was chosen
as the consultancy partner for its deep industry experience and extensive
business and technology experience in asset management.

&lt;p&gt;  GUANGZHOU CITY, CHINA, Mar 25 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Guangzhou Metro Corporation (GZ Metro) has selected IBM (NYSE: IBM)
technology and services to improve the City's rapid transit system
serving more than two million passengers a day. IBM will help GZ Metro
manage all of its IT and physical assets including four commuter lines,
60 stations and more than 116 kilometers of track.

    Smart transportation systems, like GZ Metro, help improve safety and
reliability, while reducing travel delays, emissions and fuel consumption.
As part of the Guangdong Provincial Government's Five-Year Development
Plan (2008 to 2012), the government will improve Guangzhou City's
infrastructure to support the organization of the 16th Asian Games, held
next year. The investment program is aimed to turn the public
transportation system into an environment-friendly, intelligent and
digitalized transportation system.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) has sued the Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK holding company and urged a federal bankruptcy court not to interfere with its September purchase of the thrift's banking operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed Tuesday with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware, three days after Washington Mutual sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp for well over $13 billion in connection with the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual accused the regulator of agreeing to an unreasonably low $1.9 billion price in arranging the sale of its banking operations to JPMorgan last September 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators seized Washington Mutual that day and appointed the FDIC as receiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it sued to ensure that it does not lose any of its interests in Washington Mutual's banking operations, which it said it bought in good faith. It also wants to be reimbursed for various claims it might face over the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Berz, a lawyer for Washington Mutual, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington Mutual parent is trying to pay creditors with amounts it recovers in its Chapter 11 proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan case is In re Washington Mutual Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware (Wilmington), No. 08-12229. The earlier Washington Mutual case is Washington Mutual Inc v.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, March 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street bank Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) said on Wednesday it has no need to raise cash by
selling a big stake in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs holds 4.93 percent of ICBC, a stake worth about
$8.75 billion, and on Wednesday agreed not to sell 80 percent of
it before April 28, 2010. Under its previous lockup agreement,
Goldman could sell half the stake in April 2009 and the other
half in October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in no rush to sell ICBC shares," Goldman Sachs Vice
Chairman Michael Evans said at ICBC's 2008 results media

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING--(Business Wire)--
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and The Goldman Sachs
Group, Inc. today announced that Goldman Sachs has committed to a new lock-up in
relation to its investment in ICBC. Under the existing lock-up, the ICBC shares
held by Goldman Sachs would have become free in equal installments on April 28,
2009 and October 20, 2009. Under the new lock-up, Goldman Sachs will not sell
80% of its ICBC shares at any time prior to April 28, 2010. 

In addition, ICBC and Goldman Sachs reaffirmed that they will continue their
collaborative efforts under the existing terms of the January 2006 Strategic
Cooperation Agreement. These efforts are focused on sharing global best
practices in areas such as credit, market and operational risk management,
corporate governance, corporate and investment banking and asset management. 

Mr. Jiang Jianqing, Chairman of ICBC, said: "We are delighted that Goldman Sachs
will remain a major strategic investor in ICBC. Our relationship over the past
three years has proven very successful and we look forward to continued close
cooperation between our two firms." 

Mr. Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs,
said: "Today's announcement underscores our firm`s confidence in ICBC and our
commitment to China. We look forward to working closely with ICBC, one of the
most important financial institutions in the world, and further developing our
strategic cooperation." 

Goldman Sachs` investment in ICBC represents approximately 4.93% of ICBC`s total
outstanding shares. 

If Goldman Sachs pursues a sale of its ICBC shares that will be released from
the existing lock-up on April 28, 2009, it will explore all potential methods of
sale that would maximize value and minimize market impact, with a preference for
a private sale to investors. 

ICBC

ICBC is the largest wholesale and retail bank in China by assets and deposits
and is a market leader in many business areas including corporate and personal
loans, deposits, mortgages, e-banking, custodian services and inter-bank
clearing. It provides a wide range of commercial banking services to corporate
and individual customers. ICBC has approximately 16,000 outlets and employs
385,000 people across China. It had total assets of RMB9.4 trillion at the end
of 2008.

providing investment banking, securities and investment management services to a

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - News that Goldman Sachs Group Inc might quickly pay back taxpayer money could pressure able rivals to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program was intended to provide lenders with more capital to spur lending and improve the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of companies have taken TARP money, ranging from $45 billion accepted by both Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp to $541,000 by The Victory Bank of Limerick, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with TARP now seen more as an albatross, expectations are growing that more banks will repay their money as soon as they can. That would also free banks from dividend payouts, typically 5 percent a year. as well as Congress' demonstrated willingness to change the rules of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you have now is the stronger banks who have the money, but with one eye on Congress," said Jerry Blanchard, a partner in the financial institutions practice at Bryan Cave LLP in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're a fairly well-capitalized bank, you don't want the government looking over your shoulder," he added. "Many of these banks also get upset getting painted with the same brush as larger investment banks that caused some of the problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, many banks including Bank of America argue they should not be faulted for using TARP, which they view as a cushion in case the economy sours further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We took the TARP not because we needed to, but because it made sense given the nature of the freefall of the economy at that time," said Richard Hickson, chief executive of Trustmark Corp, a Jackson, Mississippi lender with $9.8 billion of assets that took a $215 million infusion. "We feel capable of repaying it, but I want to be very surefooted and thoughtful about it. Let's not go 'ready, fire, aim.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN EYES REPAYMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is hoping to pay back its $10 billion of TARP money as soon as possible but hurdles remain, according to a person familiar with the process who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the bank hoped to repay the money as soon as next month. Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A payback would follow the hysteria over bonuses paid by the insurer American International Group Inc, and news that Goldman had received $12.9 billion of AIG bailout money because it was a counterparty to the insurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen of the largest U.S. banks will soon undergo government stress tests to assess their ability to handle the economic downturn, and their need for more capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would not be surprised to see some money paid back next quarter" by other banks, said Michael Yoshikami, president of YCMNET Advisors in Walnut Creek, California. "It is, in a way, a free market stress test. If you can repay TARP money, and still operate with good capital reserves, you're essentially saying you've passed your own internal stress test."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks regret participating in TARP, including Wells Fargo  Co, which took $25 billion it did not want because former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the vitriol results from a rule that lets the government unilaterally impose new restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did that last month by capping executive bonuses, and could do so again once the Senate considers the fate of AIG bonuses. Last week's House of Representatives bill setting a 90 percent tax would also hit bonuses for thousands of workers at other banks nationwide, a form of guilt by association that banks say would cause good employees to flee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is this America, when you can do what your government asks you to do and then retroactively you also have additional conditions put on?" Wells Fargo Chairman Richard Kovacevich said on March 13 in comments at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury spokesman Isaac Baker declined to comment on Goldman or others repaying TARP, or whether early repayment would hurt lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EARLY PAYBACK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Keefe Bruyette  Woods said 184 companies have indicated they will not tap the TARP, and at least five major banks hope to repay their infusions soon: Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase  Co, Northern Trust Corp, PNC Financial Services Group Inc and U.S. Bancorp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are also eyeing repayments. Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis has said the largest U.S. bank could repay TARP money this year if the economy cooperates. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack told Congress he wants to repay that bank's $10 billion infusion as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KBW said at least five smaller lenders have filed to repay TARP money: Bank of Marin Bancorp, Iberiabank Corp, Signature Bank, Sun Bancorp Inc and TCF Financial Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it identified seven banks that it said could repay TARP money with existing capital: Goldman, Morgan Stanley, City National Corp, Comerica Inc, SCBT Financial Corp, Sterling Bancshares Inc and Trustmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A City National spokeswoman declined to comment, and a Sterling spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Comerica and SCBT did not return calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be reason to wait, given the uncertain economy. "If I were trying to pick the bottom of the economy, I might want to keep my powder dry," Bryan Cave's Blanchard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trustmark's Hickson views TARP as a form of term insurance. "We have it now so we can grow loans, keep the Mississippi economy flowing," he said. "I would not allow the marketplace to dictate what Trustmark is going to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Additional reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, March 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street bank Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) agreed not to sell at least 80 percent of its stake
in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK)(601398.SS),
the world's biggest bank by market value, until 2010, ICBC said
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs owns 4.93 percent of ICBC and investors have
been worried that the New York-based firm will sell some of its
holding when lockup provisions on the stake lapse in April and
October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC said Goldman has committed to a new lockup period, under
which it will not liquidate 80 percent of the stake before April
28, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Goldman sells the remaining 20 percent of its ICBC stake
earlier it will maximise value and minimise market impact, ICBC
said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - News that Goldman Sachs Group Inc might quickly pay back taxpayer money could pressure able rivals to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program was intended to provide lenders with more capital to spur lending and improve the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of companies have taken TARP money, ranging from $45 billion accepted by both Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp to $541,000 by The Victory Bank of Limerick, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with TARP now seen more as an albatross, expectations are growing that more banks will repay their money as soon as they can. That would also free banks from dividend payouts, typically 5 percent a year. as well as Congress' demonstrated willingness to change the rules of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you have now is the stronger banks who have the money, but with one eye on Congress," said Jerry Blanchard, a partner in the financial institutions practice at Bryan Cave LLP in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're a fairly well-capitalized bank, you don't want the government looking over your shoulder," he added. "Many of these banks also get upset getting painted with the same brush as larger investment banks that caused some of the problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, many banks including Bank of America argue they should not be faulted for using TARP, which they view as a cushion in case the economy sours further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We took the TARP not because we needed to, but because it made sense given the nature of the freefall of the economy at that time," said Richard Hickson, chief executive of Trustmark Corp, a Jackson, Mississippi lender with $9.8 billion of assets that took a $215 million infusion. "We feel capable of repaying it, but I want to be very surefooted and thoughtful about it. Let's not go 'ready, fire, aim.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN EYES REPAYMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is hoping to pay back its $10 billion of TARP money as soon as possible but hurdles remain, according to a person familiar with the process who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the bank hoped to repay the money as soon as next month. Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A payback would follow the hysteria over bonuses paid by the insurer American International Group Inc, and news that Goldman had received $12.9 billion of AIG bailout money because it was a counterparty to the insurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen of the largest U.S. banks will soon undergo government stress tests to assess their ability to handle the economic downturn, and their need for more capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would not be surprised to see some money paid back next quarter" by other banks, said Michael Yoshikami, president of YCMNET Advisors in Walnut Creek, California. "It is, in a way, a free market stress test. If you can repay TARP money, and still operate with good capital reserves, you're essentially saying you've passed your own internal stress test."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks regret participating in TARP, including Wells Fargo  Co, which took $25 billion it did not want because former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the vitriol results from a rule that lets the government unilaterally impose new restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did that last month by capping executive bonuses, and could do so again once the Senate considers the fate of AIG bonuses. Last week's House of Representatives bill setting a 90 percent tax would also hit bonuses for thousands of workers at other banks nationwide, a form of guilt by association that banks say would cause good employees to flee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is this America, when you can do what your government asks you to do and then retroactively you also have additional conditions put on?" Wells Fargo Chairman Richard Kovacevich said on March 13 in comments at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treasury spokesman Isaac Baker declined to comment on Goldman or others repaying TARP, or whether early repayment would hurt lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EARLY PAYBACK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Keefe Bruyette  Woods said 184 companies have indicated they will not tap the TARP, and at least five major banks hope to repay their infusions soon: Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase  Co, Northern Trust Corp, PNC Financial Services Group Inc and U.S. Bancorp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others are also eyeing repayments. Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis has said the largest U.S. bank could repay TARP money this year if the economy cooperates. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack told Congress he wants to repay that bank's $10 billion infusion as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KBW said at least five smaller lenders have filed to repay TARP money: Bank of Marin Bancorp, Iberiabank Corp, Signature Bank, Sun Bancorp Inc and TCF Financial Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it identified seven banks that it said could repay TARP money with existing capital: Goldman, Morgan Stanley, City National Corp, Comerica Inc, SCBT Financial Corp, Sterling Bancshares Inc and Trustmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A City National spokeswoman declined to comment, and a Sterling spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Comerica and SCBT did not return calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be reason to wait, given the uncertain economy. "If I were trying to pick the bottom of the economy, I might want to keep my powder dry," Bryan Cave's Blanchard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trustmark's Hickson views TARP as a form of term insurance. "We have it now so we can grow loans, keep the Mississippi economy flowing," he said. "I would not allow the marketplace to dictate what Trustmark is going to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Additional reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - American Express Co (AXP.N) may have to set aside a significant amount of money to cover more losses in the next few quarters as U.S. credit card defaults are expected to remain high, analysts at J.P. Morgan Securities said, as they reinitiated the stock with an "underweight" rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts Andrew Wessel and Daniel Kim projected a 45 percent increase in loss-reserve expense for the company in 2009 versus a year ago, and a nearly 6 percent decline in billed business due mainly to a fall in consumer discretionary spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan analysts expect U.S. consumers to cut down on discretionary spending and build savings until unemployment levels stabilize and the housing market collapse begins to abate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given this macro view and our 10 percent unemployment outlook, we believe AmEx will face ongoing declines in billed business and significant increases in charge-offs well into 2010," the analysts wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a price target of $10.50 on the stock. AmEx, the largest U.S. charge card operator by sales volume, said last week that its net charge-off rate -- debts the company believes will never be repaid -- rose to 8.70 percent in February from 8.30 percent in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our model forecasts peak charge-offs of 11 percent on a managed basis in second quarter of 2010," the analysts said, adding that they saw further downside risk to their current charge-off estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts, however, believe AmEx is well-capitalized when compared with peers, and said the company may not need additional equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan analysts also expect AmEx to remain profitable through the cycle, but said a prolonged recession will restrict material earnings growth until 2011. Shares of the company, which caters to wealthier consumers that are viewed as more credit worthy, closed at $13.90 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Anil D'Silva)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is likely to post profits in every quarter this year, and the long-term outlook for the company is now positive again, veteran banking analyst Richard Bove said and began coverage of the former investment-banking giant with a "hold" rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bove, however, advised new buyers of Goldman shares to seek a better price to enter the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some profit taking is inevitable until earnings catch up to the stock price gain," wrote Bove in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm, whose shares have gained more than 45 percent in the last three months, is pulling away from some of its past investment commitments and may sell its stake in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS), Bove said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's investments in ICBC and private-equity exposure are expected to take a heavy toll on the former investment bank as the value of those investments deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is one of several Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients that plans to repay the money as soon as possible, but terms of last fall's Treasury rescue financing require banks to replace the TARP funds with permanent capital such as common stock, preferred shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It (Goldman) is likely to take advantage of the new U.S. Treasury program to rid bank balance sheets of legacy assets in multiple ways both investing and assisting other investors," Bove said and set a target of $123 on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares closed at $110.60 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ramya Dilip in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - China rejected Coca-Cola's (KO.N) bid to buy top local juice maker Huiyuan (1886.HK) because it feared the U.S. multinational could abuse its position across the whole soft drinks market, an official said in remarks published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministry of Commerce spokesman Yao Jian said regulators treated carbonated soft drinks and juice beverages as a conjoined sector -- one, he said, in which Coca-Cola could deter competitors to the detriment of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yao fleshed out the ministry's rationale for rejecting the bid last week in an interview in the official People's Daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Potential competitors would find it very difficult to enter this market and grow into substantive competitors against Coca-Cola and thereby eradicate or restrict the possibility of Coca-Cola engaging in abusive conduct," Yao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fan Gang, a member of the People's Bank of China's monetary policy advisory committee, also said the rejection of the deal was based on monopoly concerns, not nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For some people it's too easy to blame nationalism. That's unfair," Fan told Reuters during a conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday. "The monopoly is the issue. That's why we introduced an anti-monopoly law. Now we can use it (and create) diversification in the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yao said multinational investment could be a boon for China's economy, adding a broad caveat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If mergers and acquisitions lead to multinational companies gaining or enhancing dominant status, producing exclusionary and competition-restricting outcomes, this will hinder economic development," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China rejected the proposed deal under an anti-monopoly law enacted last year, stating that the combined concentration of the two companies would have hurt competition in the juice business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huiyuan controls over a tenth of the Chinese fruit and vegetable juice market, which grew 15 percent last year to $2 billion. Coca-Cola has a 9.7 percent market share. Huiyuan is listed in Hong Kong and registered in the Cayman Islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to block the deal drew criticism from trade lawyers and economists who said China appeared willing to wield its anti-monopoly law to fend off foreign attempts to buy promising domestic firms, even when resulting market concentration would not be excessive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Yao said "nationalist sentiment" was not a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Coca-Cola already had market dominance in the carbonated drinks sector, citing local industry association estimates that it holds 60.6 percent of the market. It could have leveraged that influence in the juice sector, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although there is not strong substitutability between the carbonated beverage and juice beverage markets," Yao said, "both are non-alcoholic drinks and belong to two closely intertwined markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, he said, could have used its position to "transfer its dominance of the carbonate beverage market to the juice beverage market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Chris Buckley and Susan Fenton; Editing by Nick Macfie and Jonathan Hopfner)&lt;/p&gt;

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Eastman Chemical Co (NYSE: EMN), ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), Exxon Mobil Corp
(NYSE: XOM), Chevron Corp (NYSE: CVX) and JA Solar Holdings Co Ltd (NASDAQ:
JASO). 

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from
the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Eastern Chemical Still Corroding

Eastman Chemical Co (NYSE: EMN) is engaged in the manufacture and sale of
chemicals, plastics and fibers. Based in Kingsport, Tennessee, the company has
12 manufacturing sites in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific, supplying products
throughout the world. 

Eastman is witnessing rising raw material prices and a declining demand for its
products. In addition, lack of free cash flow, PET capacity increases coupled
with slowing growth, and PET industry overcapacity force us to rate the stock a
Sell with a target of $18.00. 

Conoco Downgraded to Hold

Our downgrade of ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) shares reflects the company's
weakened competitive position relative to its super-major peers in the current
tentative commodity-price environment. Given its OECD-centric asset portfolio,
ConocoPhillips is forced to live with high natural decline rates and costs. 

While we believe that the company should benefit from the anticipated
stabilization in oil prices, we see better investment opportunities in this
space. Our preferred names remain Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron Corp
(NYSE: CVX), given their relatively defensive postures. 

JA Solar Growth Story Shines

Cash-rich JA Solar Holdings Co Ltd (NASDAQ: JASO) with an increasingly
geographically diversified customer base, has one of the lowest cost structures
among its peers. Going forward, improving production costs, coupled with ongoing
capacity expansions, and committed supply of key raw materials, will continue to
boost the growth story. 

However, rising silicon wafer costs, tepid module demand in Europe, after-shocks
of the Lehman bankruptcy and the company's high R expenses may affect ASPs
[average selling prices] over the near-term. Accordingly, we maintain our BUY
recommendation on JASO with a six-month target price of $3.25. Price
appreciation to our near-term valuation target represents 25.5% upside
potential.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Twenty years ago, when crude oil was gushing out of the wrecked Exxon Valdez supertanker and Prince William Sound was being blackened by what would become the nation's worst tanker spill, oil giant Exxon Corp was vilified in Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bumper stickers said the corporation's name was the "sign of the double-cross." A sarcastic T-shirt took jabs at the company's perceived arrogance, proclaiming: "Exxon: We Don't Care. We Don't Have to Care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Exxon Mobil Corp, as the company is now known, is expanding in Alaska and officials are striking a conciliatory tone about the tanker disaster that has defined the company in Alaska and much of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The event around Valdez, you can't overstate how tragic it was and how it was such a low point for the company in our 125-year history," said company spokesman Alan Jeffers. "We understand the feelings of the people of Alaska about the spill itself and the continuing impact that it had and recognize how difficult it was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As economic malaise forces other oil companies to cut back, delay projects and lay off employees, Exxon has embarked on this season's biggest new project in Alaska's petroleum-rich North Slope region -- a 50-mile (80-kilometre) ice road, and a two-well drilling program at the long-dormant Point Thomson field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has put over 250 employees and contract workers on duty at Point Thomson, despite a legal dispute in which the state is trying to revoke leases for nonperformance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has tripled its Anchorage office space, said Craig Haymes, the company's Alaska production manager. It is actively examining options for a massive natural gas pipeline, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it has boosted its community contributions. This year, Exxon became one of the four prime sponsors of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, ponying up $1.25 million over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all part of a move into a higher-profile role as an oil-field operator rather than a mere investor in the North Slope's Prudhoe Bay and other properties operated by other oil companies such as BP Plc or ConocoPhillips, according to Exxon officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been in Alaska for 50 years. We'll be here for another 50 years," Haymes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAMAGE REMAINS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with still-pungent oil lingering on some beaches, Prince William Sound herring stocks nearly wiped out by an epidemic that fishermen believe was triggered by the spill, various animal populations depleted and residents exhausted by long years of still-unresolved litigation, many Alaskans are still bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A June 25 U.S. Supreme Court decision, which shrank a punitive award that had originally been $5 billion to a mere $507.5 million, was devastating to fishermen, Alaska Natives and other spill litigants. Meanwhile, Exxon is prospering, with more than $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon is very, very healthy, unlike Prince William Sound," said state Senator Hollis French, an Anchorage Democrat. "I think Alaskans for several generations will have a bad taste in their mouths from that incident."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some political experts say lingering anger at Exxon has been reflected in state policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, Governor Sarah Palin suggested Exxon was unwanted as a partner in a long-desired but as-yet-unbuilt North Slope natural gas pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sentiment shared by a lot of Alaskans is, you know, Exxon, don't let the door hit you in the stern on your way out if you choose not to participate in progressing development of Alaska's resources," Palin said at a news conference a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alaska's Natural Resources Commissioner Tom Irwin, who has been in the forefront of the battle to revoke Point Thomson leases so that they can be sold to other companies, once issued a statement saying he "did not trust" Exxon to follow through with its promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, French said, if Exxon is trying to improve its operations and make more contributions to Alaska's economy and nonprofit organizations, the move should be welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They shouldn't be punished or excoriated for that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bill Rigby and Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments by PBOC adviser Fan Gang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, March 25 (Reuters) - China rejected Coca-Cola's
(KO.N) bid to buy top local juice maker Huiyuan (1886.HK) because
it feared the U.S. multinational could abuse its position across
the whole soft drinks market, an official said in remarks
published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ministry of Commerce spokesman Yao Jian said regulators
treated carbonated soft drinks and juice beverages as a conjoined
sector -- one, he said, in which Coca-Cola could deter
competitors to the detriment of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yao fleshed out the ministry's rationale for rejecting the
bid last week in an interview in the official People's Daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Potential competitors would find it very difficult to enter
this market and grow into substantive competitors against
Coca-Cola and thereby eradicate or restrict the possibility of
Coca-Cola engaging in abusive conduct," Yao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fan Gang, a member of the People's Bank of China's monetary
policy advisory committee, also said the rejection of the deal
was based on monopoly concerns, not nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For some people it's too easy to blame nationalism. That's
unfair," Fan told Reuters during a conference in Hong Kong on
Wednesday. "The monopoly is the issue. That's why we introduced
an anti-monopoly law. Now we can use it (and create)
diversification in the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yao said multinational investment could be a boon for China's
economy, adding a broad caveat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If mergers and acquisitions lead to multinational companies
gaining or enhancing dominant status, producing exclusionary and
competition-restricting outcomes, this will hinder economic
development," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China rejected the proposed deal under an anti-monopoly law
enacted last year, stating that the combined concentration of the
two companies would have hurt competition in the juice business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huiyuan controls over a tenth of the Chinese fruit and
vegetable juice market, which grew 15 percent last year to $2
billion. Coca-Cola has a 9.7 percent market share. Huiyuan is
listed in Hong Kong and registered in the Cayman Islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision to block the deal drew criticism from trade
lawyers and economists who said China appeared willing to wield
its anti-monopoly law to fend off foreign attempts to buy
promising domestic firms, even when resulting market
concentration would not be excessive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Yao said "nationalist sentiment" was not a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Coca-Cola already had market dominance in the
carbonated drinks sector, citing local industry association
estimates that it holds 60.6 percent of the market. It could have
leveraged that influence in the juice sector, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although there is not strong substitutability between the
carbonated beverage and juice beverage markets," Yao said, "both
are non-alcoholic drinks and belong to two closely intertwined
markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola, he said, could have used its position to "transfer
its dominance of the carbonate beverage market to the juice
beverage market".

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's rejection of Coca-Cola's (KO.N) attempt to buy Huiyuan Juice (1886.HK) should not deter global private equity firms from investing in the country, JPMorgan's (JPM.N) top Asia private equity banker said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anand Narayan, the bank's head of financial sponsors coverage for Asia-Pacific, also told the Reuters Private Equity and Hedge Funds Summit that private equity firms in the region are focused on investing in retail and consumer goods, with the main goal of tapping China and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People have successfully invested and taken money out of China. So, one particular transaction should not influence their ability or shift their views in terms of dealmaking," Narayan said, referring to the Coke deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Virtually every firm has a China strategy. To them, fundamentally, it's about companies," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity activity in Asia, like the rest of the world, has ground to a near halt, hit by the economic slowdown and credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But several private equity firms are still sitting on large piles of money allocated to invest in deals across Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One investment theme the firms are eyeing closely is domestic consumption plays, according to Narayan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The element of retail and consumer goods is, without a doubt, the focus," he said. "There are other things like industrial goods, but feeding people, clothing people, making sure they're able to buy goods, those are the three things people are looking at."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some recent examples include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co.'s KKR.UL plans to invest $100 million into China's Mengniu Modern Farm. On Wednesday, U.S. restaurant operator Yum! Brands (YUM.N) agreed to buy around 20 percent of China hot-pot chain Little Sheep (0968.HK) from U.K. private equity firm 3i Group (III.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of dealflow, Narayan said he expects transactions will be picking up by the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As I look at the rest of 2009, given the dislocation of the equity and debt markets and the need for capital--and this being the growth engine of the world--if you believe that thesis, I think private equity has a very important role to play," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

[nBOM474076] But a source with knowledge of the situation, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told Reuters IBM was not in the bidding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Potential buyers may be wary about the likelihood of customer losses as well as a lack of clarity on Satyam's true value due to the years of accounting fraud. Analysts also say any new buyer will likely face legal liabilities from angry Satyam shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Spice Group executive said the company had not yet decided whether to participate in the auction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are in a discussion mode now," said Preeti Malhotra, executive director of Spice Innovative Technologies, a unit of the diversified Spice Group. She said Spice had asked its lawyers to write to the Satyam board requesting an open and transparent auction process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Spice Group Chairman B.K. Modi told Reuters on Wednesday the company might withdraw from bidding due to a lack of transparency in the process, explaining that its request for other shortlisted bidders to be named had not been met. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Economic Times report named private equity firm Apax Partners, Indian engineering conglomerate Larsen &amp; Toubro (LART.BO) and Tech Mahindra (TEML.BO) among the selected bidders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Satyam said on Tuesday it hoped to finalise a buyer by April 30, and that potential bidders, who had submitted a detailed expression of interest by March 20, should expect to receive a response by Wednesday. [nBOM491582] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A spokeswoman for Satyam said the company would not make any comment on the bidding process. An IBM spokesman also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Satyam has been struggling since founder and Chairman Ramalinga Raju shocked investors in January by saying profits had been overstated for years and assets falsified. Raju is being held in jail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Satyam, which specialises in business software, ended up 4.2 percent on Thursday at 42.20 rupees in a broader market .BSESN that rose 3.5 percent, valuing the company at around $550 million. The stock has plunged more than 90 percent from its last year's high of 544 rupees.    Its U.S. shares rose 4 cents, or 2.47 percent, to $1.66. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    For recent stories on Satyam, see [nBOM394323] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee in Bangalore and Ritsuko Ando in New York; Editing by John Mair, Tiffany Wu and Gunna Dickson) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((ritsuko.ando@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646 223 6084; Reuters Messaging: ritsuko.ando.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: SATYAM/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM's (IBM.N) talks to acquire Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O are continuing and may extend beyond next week, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM is still examining Sun's business as part of its due diligence process, said the source, who was not authorized to speak about the talks and therefore requested anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither IBM nor Sun has issued any statement to say they are in talks, although sources said last week that the two sides are negotiating a merger that would bolster IBM's high-end server and software business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on March 18 that IBM could pay as much as $8 billion for Sun, amounting to a 100 percent premium for the high-end server computer maker. If a deal is sealed, it would be IBM's largest acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source said on Thursday that IBM's due diligence process, or examination of Sun's business, was necessary considering Sun's size and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IBM spokesman declined to comment, and Sun was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have said Sun would bolster IBM's position against rivals like Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), both of which have been acquiring smaller, niche technology firms to broaden their product and service offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun shares were up 1.5 percent at $7.97 in early afternoon trading, shedding some of their earlier gains to $8.23.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades and assigns Rating Outlooks to the following classes of
JP Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, series 2005-LDP5:


--$63 million class K to 'BB' from 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$26.2 million class L to 'BB-'from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$15.7 million class M to 'B+' from 'BB'; Outlook Negative; 

--$15.7 million class N to 'B' from 'BB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$5.2 million class O to 'B-' from 'B+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$5.2 million class P to 'B-' from 'B'; Outlook Negative; 

--$10.5 million class Q to 'CCC/RR1' from 'B-'. 

In addition, Fitch affirms and assigns Outlooks to the following classes: 

--$193.5 million class A-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$200 million class A-2FL at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$297.5 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$171.5 million class A-3 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$1,395.9 million class A-4 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$169.5 million class A-SB at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

--$52.5 million class H at 'BBB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$42 million class J at 'BBB'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch does not rate the $52.5 million NR or HG-1 through HG-5 classes. 

The downgrades are due to expected losses on the three specially serviced loans
(0.7%) in the transaction. The Negative Outlooks are the result of Fitch
identified Loans of Concern (9.8%), as well as a maturity concentration of loans
scheduled to mature in 2009 and 2010 (14.8%). As of the March 2009 distribution
date, the transaction has paid down 1.5% to $4.23 billion from $4.33 billion at
issuance. The Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of any rating changes
over the next one to two years. 

The largest specially serviced loan (0.3%) is secured by a 465-unit multifamily
property in Birmingham, AL. The loan transferred to the special servicer for
imminent default in December 2008. The servicer reported the collateral was
found to be in good condition with ongoing repairs due to a fire. The special
servicer is currently in negotiations with the borrower on potential workout
options. 

The second specially serviced loan (0.3%) is secured by a 99,123 sf retail
property in Concord, CA. The loan transferred to the special servicer in
December 2008 for monetary default after the borrower indicated they were having
difficulty collecting a rental payment from one of the center's tenants. The
borrower failed to bring the loan current by the negotiated deadline of Dec. 31,
2008 and the special servicer is moving towards foreclosure. 

The final specially serviced loan (0.06%) has been in special servicing since
October 2007. The loan is secured by a 102,341 sf retail center in Three Rivers,
MI. In October 2008 a settlement agreement was entered into and a receiver was
appointed. The property is currently 18.7% occupied and leasing efforts by the
receiver are underway. 

Fitch reviewed the three shadow-rated loans: Brookdale Office Portfolio (8.1%),
Houston Galleria (7%) and Jordan Creek (4%). All loans maintain their investment
grade shadow ratings due to their stable performance since issuance. 

Brookdale Office Portfolio is secured by twenty-one office buildings totaling
3.1 million sf located in various states. The loan consists of an A Note and a B
Note, with only the A Note in the trust. As of December 2008, the weighted
average portfolio occupancy remained relatively stable at 81.3% compared to
84.1% at issuance. The loan has a five-year interest only period followed by 30
year amortization and is scheduled to mature in September 2015. 

Houston Galleria is secured by a 1.3 million sf retail property located in
Houston, TX. The whole loan consists of A-1and A-2 notes, a B Note and a C Note,
with only the A-1 note in the pooled trust. The C note collateralizes the HG
classes which are not rated by Fitch. As of September 2008, occupancy remained
stable at 93% compared to 89.5% at issuance. The loan is interest only and is
scheduled to mature in December 2015. 

Jordan Creek is secured by a 939,085 sf retail property in West Des Moines, IA.
The loan consists of an A Note and a B Note, with only the A Note in the trust.
As of December 2008, occupancy has increased to 95% from 85.9% at issuance. The
loan's maturity was March 1, 2009; however the borrower is in negotiations with
the servicer to extend the loan for one year. The modified loan term will have a
maturity of March 1, 2010. According to the servicer, final approval for the
loan extension request is in process and expected to close shortly. Fitch will
continue to monitor the situation. 

Approximately 14.7% of the pool is scheduled to mature over the next two years.
The weighted average coupon for maturing loans is 5%. Generally, performance is
stable for the maturing loans, with a weighted average DSCR of 1.79 times(x).

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades JP Morgan Chase commercial mortgage pass-through
certificates, series 2005-LDP4, assigns recovery ratings, and assigns Rating
Outlooks as follows: 

--$10 million class J to 'BB' from 'BB+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$13.4 million class K to 'BB-' from 'BB'; Outlook Negative; 

--$13.4 million class L to 'B' from 'BB-'; Outlook Negative; 

--$6.7 million class M to 'B-' from 'B+'; Outlook Negative; 

--$3.3 million class N to 'B-' from 'B'; Outlook Negative; and 

--$10 million class P to 'CCC/RR1' from 'B-'. 

In addition, Fitch affirms the following classes and assigns Rating Outlooks as
follows: 

--$390.3 million class A-1A at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$206 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$181.2 million class A-2FL at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

--$26.8 million class G at 'BBB'; Outlook Negative; and 

--$30.1 million class H at 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative. 

Fitch does not rate the $33.5 million class NR. Class A-1 has paid in full. 

The downgrades are due to expected losses on the four specially serviced loans
(1.7%) in the transaction. The Negative Rating Outlooks are the result of a high
percentage of Fitch identified Loans of Concern (16.5%), as well as a maturity
concentration of loans scheduled to mature in 2010 (16%). As of the March 2009
distribution date, the transaction has paid down 4.9% to $2.55 billion from
$2.68 billion at issuance. Three loans (4.1%) are currently defeased, including
Embassy Suites - Washington D.C. (1.4%), which was shadow rated investment grade
at issuance. The Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of any rating
changes over the next one to two years. 

The largest specially serviced loan (0.52%) is secured by a 480-unit multifamily
property in Kalamazoo, MI. The loan transferred in January 2008 after cash flow
became insufficient to pay debt service. The property is currently being
marketed for sale and recent offers indicate that losses are likely. 

The remaining three specially serviced loans (1.13%), all representing less than
(0.5%) of the pool individually, remain current on their debt service payments.
The respective borrowers are in negotiations with the servicer on potential
workout options. 

Plastipak Portfolio (3.5%) and Embassy Suites - Washington D.C. (1.4%), shadow
rated investment grade at issuance, maintain their shadow ratings based on
stable performance. Additionally, Embassy Suites is fully defeased. Plastipak
Portfolio is secured by 14 industrial/warehouse properties, comprising 4,447,890
square feet (sf) and located across various cities in eight states. The
portfolio remains 100% owner-occupied by Plastipak Packaging, Inc. (Plastipak)
and Clean Tech, Inc., both non-investment-grade rated tenants. 

Fitch has identified 33 loans (16.5%) as Fitch Loans of Concern for declines in
performance and/or occupancy. Fitch continues to monitor the performance of the
second largest loan (5.1%) in the pool, Silver City Galleria, a regional mall in
Taunton, MA. The debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) ending September 2008 had
declined to 1.09 times (x) from 1.44x at year-end (YE) 2007 due to decreases in
rental rates. Additionally, Steve and Barry's, which represented 8% of the net
rentable area (NRA) vacated their space due to the company's bankruptcy filing
and store closures. Occupancy excluding the Steve and Barry's space as of
September 2008 was 83%. Fitch will continue to monitor the loan's performance. 

Approximately 16% of the pool is scheduled to mature in 2010; however, 12.5% of
the maturity concentration is related to the largest loan in the pool, the
Regency Portfolio. The portfolio is comprised of 20 retail properties located in
six states. The centers are composed of a strong, diverse tenant base which
includes tenants such as Safeway, CVS, Albertsons, and Publix. As of YE2007, the
reported DSCR was 1.88x, an improvement from the DSCR at issuance (1.64x). The
loan, which has a coupon of 5%, matures in July 2010. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of

&lt;p&gt;Unleashing Your Dreams + Coca-Cola = "Open Happiness" for U.S. Hispanic
Consumers


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola, the #1 sparkling beverage brand among Hispanic Americans, invites the
more than 45 million U.S. Hispanics to take a break, open a Coke, unleash their
dreams and enjoy one of life`s simple pleasures. "Destapa Tus Sue&#241;os" or
"Unleash Your Dreams" is the central message for `Destapa La Felicidad,` the
Hispanic adaptation of `Open Happiness` - the new global integrated marketing
campaign for Coca-Cola that launched in January. 

The fully integrated Hispanic adaptation includes new point of sale, enhanced
shopper experiences, consumer promotions, television, radio, print and out of
home advertising, mobile, digital and music components. The campaign began
airing a new television commercial nationwide on March 20, and will expand its
media presence with a strong showing during Univision`s highest rated program
"Premio Lo Nuestro" music awards, on March 26, at 8:00 P.M. This campaign is
Coca-Cola North America`s latest step in an ongoing plan to revitalize sparkling
beverages in the U.S. The new ad will run on Spanish language networks including
Univision, Telemundo and TeleFutura. 

"For Hispanics, happiness means pursuing and achieving their dreams, and
Coca-Cola has always been there to provide them with the simple pleasure of
refreshment during their journey," said Reinaldo Padua, assistant vice
president, Hispanic Marketing, Coca-Cola North America. "For many, achieving
their dream means seeing their children graduate from college, owning their own
business, learning to speak English or meeting their favorite celebrity or
sports figure. This year, our message will inspire Hispanic consumers and our
programs will help them achieve some of those dreams." 

`Destapa La Felicidad` is an evolution of the `Coke Side of Life/El Lado
Coca-Cola de la Vida` campaign that featured award-winning commercials such as
"Video Game," "Happiness Factory", "A la Mesa" and "It`s Mine." The new campaign
will continue to invite people to bring positivity, optimism and fun into their
lives through an engaging creative and an uplifting message. 

"The combination of inspirational marketing, in-store activation and our unique
Hispanic programs will ensure that we continue to strengthen our longstanding
consumer relationships and build new ones," said Katie Bayne, chief marketing
officer, Coca-Cola North America. "These programs speak to the Company`s deep
commitment to revitalizing the sparkling beverage category by providing another
end-to-end targeted marketing campaign." 

Coca-Cola`s exciting 2009 integrated marketing campaign will include programs
that will help make dreams come true for Hispanic consumers, including:

* Coca-Cola Telenovela Club - Al Diablo Con Los Guapos

Telenovelas are a rich part of Hispanic popular culture, and many people dream
of one day meeting their favorite Telenovela star. On March 1, the Coca-Cola
Telenovela Club launched its fifth promotion with "Al Diablo con los Guapos."
Through this promotion, fans will have the opportunity to win premiums related
to the novela, authentic novela memorabilia and enter a sweepstakes for the
chance to meet two of the stars. The program is scheduled to run through the end
of March through My Coke Reward/Mis Premios Coca-Cola and participating
retailers in major Hispanic markets.

* Soccer - Mexican National Team

Futbol is a true passion point for Hispanic consumers, and many of them aspire
to meet their favorite players. Beginning in May, Coca-Cola will implement a
robust national marketing, advertising and public relations campaign featuring
the Mexican National Team (MNT) in the U.S., which will offer several memorable
opportunities for futbol fans, including a soccer clinic with Guillermo "Memo"
Ochoa; attending friendly matches of the MNT in the U.S.; in-game experience as
part of Coca-Cola "Ball Kids" program in MNT matches; collectable premiums and
more.

* Family Food Bundles

For Hispanics, meals with family are one of the most important times of the day,
and Coca-Cola is the preferred beverage brand to celebrate this occasion.
Through 2009, Coca-Cola will continue partnering with authentic food brands to
bring Hispanic families taste, refreshment and value in this important daily
event.

* Community and Civic Organization Sponsorship

Since 1987 Coca-Cola has invested more than $20 million dollars in support of
Hispanic organizations and initiatives. In partnership with organizations such
as the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF) and LULAC National Educational Service
Centers, Inc. (LNESC), the Company has been able to directly impact the lives of
many Hispanics including Latino youth. In 2009 the Company will support more
than 100 Hispanic initiatives, programs and organizations including the National
Hispana Leadership Institute and the National Alliance for Hispanic Health. 

"Throughout its history, Coca-Cola has always expressed a refreshingly positive
view of the world. `Destapa Felicidad` is an updated reflection of that
perspective expressing the brand`s role in bringing moments of pleasure to
people," said Padua. 

The campaign was developed in partnership with Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the Hispanic
marketing and advertising agency of record for Coca-Cola North America.

&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
On March 5, 2009, Johnson Bottini, LLP ("Johnson Bottini") filed a class action
lawsuit (the "Complaint") in United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of General
Electric Company (the "Company") (NYSE:GE) during the period January 23, 2009
through February 27, 2009, inclusive (the "Class Period"). 

The Complaint alleges that on January 23, 2009, the Company's Chairman and CEO,
Jeffrey Immelt, stated unequivocally that GE would maintain its quarterly $.31
per share dividend, having sufficient cash on hand and cash flow to achieve that
goal. In direct contradiction to Immelt`s assurance, on February 27, 2009, GE
announced it was cutting the dividend to $.10 per share. The next day, GE shares
fell from $8.51 per share to $7.60 per share. Shockingly, Mr. Immelt sold over
52,000 shares of GE stock at $11.10 per share and other officers of the Company
sold over 380,000 shares at that same price during the short Class Period. Mr.
Immelt then repurchased 50,000 shares after the announcement at between $7.51
and $8.30 per share. As a result, Mr. Immelt and the other officers allegedly
violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by
issuing false and misleading statements and selling their personally held GE
shares at inflated prices based on those statements. Shareholders may obtain a
copy of the complaint by contacting Johnson Bottini at the phone number or
e-mail addresses listed below. 

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the class members and is
represented by Johnson Bottini, a law firm with significant experience in
prosecuting class actions and substantial expertise in actions involving
corporate fraud. If you are a member of the class described above, you may move

&lt;p&gt; * IBM still in due diligence on Sun Micro - source&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sun shares up 1.5 pct, off earlier highs
 (Adds share move, background on talks)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - IBM's (IBM.N) talks to
acquire Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O are continuing and may
extend beyond next week, according to a person with knowledge
of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM is still examining Sun's business as part of its due
diligence process, said the source, who was not authorized to
speak about the talks and therefore requested anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither IBM nor Sun has issued any statement to say they
are in talks, although sources said last week that the two
sides are negotiating a merger that would bolster IBM's
high-end server and software business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street Journal reported on March 18 that IBM could
pay as much as $8 billion for Sun, amounting to a 100 percent
premium for the high-end server computer maker. If a deal is
sealed, it would be IBM's largest acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source said on Thursday that IBM's due diligence
process, or examination of Sun's business, was necessary
considering Sun's size and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An IBM spokesman declined to comment, and Sun was not
immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts have said Sun would bolster IBM's position
against rivals like Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Cisco
Systems Inc (CSCO.O), both of which have been acquiring
smaller, niche technology firms to broaden their product and
service offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun shares were up 1.5 percent at $7.97 in early afternoon
trading, shedding some of their earlier gains to $8.23. IBM
shares were up 0.7 percent at $98.64.

service solutions, and IBM today announced a major milestone in the rollout of
their Service Experience Management (SEM) strategy, first announced in 2008.
Under an OEM agreement with IBM, KANA has completed the integration of IBM`s
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Foundation and DB2 database software into
its core Service Experience Management solution, KANA Service. Expanding on the
traditional OEM model, IBM is offering Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) such
as KANA additional support beyond that of a typical OEM agreement by providing
sales force alignment, technical integration, support in reducing development
cost, and quicker time to value for joint customers. 

As part of this strategic relationship, KANA solutions are standardized and
optimized on IBM hardware and software to offer the highest levels of
performance and ease of management. The new solution will enable companies to
design and deliver ideal service experiences that drive customer retention and
cost savings. KANA Service is scheduled for release in the second quarter of
2009. 

KANA Service is designed for companies that must deliver superior customer
service in the face of limited resources, increased competition, and constant
business change. KANA Service enables organizations to easily deliver the ideal
Service Experience based on customer profile, business context, and cost
constraints. The solution gives customer service executives unprecedented
control over the end-to-end Service Experience -- enabling them to adapt to
change in minutes, not months, and make customer service a strategic
differentiator for their business. 

KANA Service is built on IBM`s market-leading SOA and Information Management
foundation, which breaks down traditional barriers to integration. IBM`s SOA
foundation puts an end to painful point-to-point integrations, enabling
"information on-demand" by simply connecting applications once to the middleware
layer. 

Rob Thomas, IBM`s Worldwide Vice President of Business Development for
Information Management, said, "KANA and IBM have worked closely over the past
year to develop a new Service Experience Management solution, combining the
latest customer service capabilities from KANA with market-leading SOA and
Information Management middleware from IBM, along with a joint go-to-market
plan. Our partnership is a model of how ISVs can take advantage of IBM`s
software solutions and resources." 

"In today`s economic climate, Service Experience has become the differentiating
factor in highly competitive industries," said Michael Fields, chief executive
officer, KANA. "Companies need a new generation of customer service solutions
that will allow them to adapt quickly to economic and competitive pressures. The
KANA SEM solution incorporates IBM software and will enable companies to deliver
optimized, one-to-one Service Experiences in an ever-changing business
environment. We continue to work closely with IBM to bring our SEM solution to
market in the second quarter of 2009."

&lt;p&gt;  FREMONT, CA, Mar 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. ("NET") (NYSE: NWK) announced today
that ITER, an international research and development project, is
deploying NET's VX Series Unified Communications Gateways to enable
ITER's move from a traditional hardware-based voice system to a
software-powered voice solution. The VX platforms will allow ITER to
bring voice services in-house and build a robust and reliable global
network that supports the seamless deployment of Microsoft unified
communications (UC) to ITER's locations around the world.

    NET's VX Series, which is qualified for Microsoft Office Communications
Server 2007 Release 2, offers ITER a "core" switching point for all its
voice related services, providing ITER the ability to migrate to a UC
environment. This solution delivers a complete, robust gateway for ITER's
Microsoft OCS environment that includes PSTN access for national and
international calls, switching of private traffic to the previous system,
fax-over-IP, and video conferencing. With Microsoft's recent issuance of
OCS Release 2, ITER will be able to smoothly integrate services such as
enterprise voice conferencing and SIP trunking in the future.

    "NET's VX Series delivers high availability with exceptional voice quality
and was able to meet all of our technical requirements," said Juergen
Dirnberger. "Further, the VX Series solution will enable us to extend
globally the tools we use for voice calls while simplifying our
communications, thereby increasing productivity. NET's technical support
made the integration seamless."

    "Our ability to accommodate nearly any type of existing network and
telecom infrastructure makes our VX Series a compelling choice," said
Francois Le, Vice President Global Sales at NET. "We are very pleased to
provide ITER a solution to address their unique requirements."

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola`s Landmark Billboards in Times Square, Piccadilly Circus and Kings
Cross to Go Dark
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company announced today that many of its iconic signs will go dark
in support of Earth Hour on Saturday, March 28. The Company also is
participating in local awareness-raising events in more than 50 countries to
support what is expected to be the largest ever, global climate event. 

"We are pleased to join thousands of communities, organizations and individuals
in raising awareness about actions we all can take to slow, stop and eventually
reverse the effects of climate change," said Muhtar Kent, president and CEO of
The Coca-Cola Company. "Earth Hour is a great way to demonstrate that small,
simple steps like turning out lights, when taken by people around the world, can
drive real momentum in fighting a universal issue like climate change." 

Iconic Coca-Cola signs are scheduled to go dark in Times Square and on top of
The Mirage hotel on the Las Vegas strip in the United States, Piccadilly Circus
in London, and Kings Cross in Sydney. Other well-known illuminated signs and
billboards will go off from Mexico to Cairo to Shanghai. The Company also is
helping promote Earth Hour in various markets with radio, movie theater,
television and print advertising. 

In Atlanta, the Company`s worldwide headquarters and the World of Coca-Cola will
go dark as will the Grady Board and Woodruff Park signs. Elsewhere in the United
States and Canada, the Company is donating an estimated $300,000 in media
support to showcase Earth Hour PSAs, yielding over 5 million daily impressions
across more than 197 markets during the two week period leading up to the event.


Coca-Cola employees are being encouraged to participate in Earth Hour
activities, along with their families and friends. An Earth Hour reminder will
be sent to employees in Spain with an event-branded candle to be lit during the
lights out hour, and in Latin America, employees will receive pins and glow
worms with key messages to mark the occasion. In addition, dozens of Coca-Cola
offices and bottling facilities will go dark, and viewing parties and other
special events are planned around the world. Earth Hour also is being promoted
on Coca-Cola delivery trucks in some markets. 

Coca-Cola system locations involved include: Argentina, Australia, Bahrain,
Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, France, Great Britain, Guatemala,
Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Korea, Malaysia,
Mauritius, Mexico, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines,
Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Trinidad and
Tobago, Turkey, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, Vietnam and Zambia. 

Earth Hour is a symbolic event that raises awareness and provides an opportunity
for The Coca-Cola Company to demonstrate its commitment to climate protection.
The Company is working to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions in its
manufacturing operations system-wide with a goal to grow its business but not
its carbon footprint. The Company also has committed to a 5 percent absolute
emissions reduction in developed countries by 2015 (based on a 2004 baseline).
These global commitments will prevent the release of more than 2 million metric
tons of CO2 in 2015. 

"World Wildlife Fund is pleased that Coca-Cola is taking part in Earth Hour
2009," said WWF-US President and CEO Carter Roberts. "The climate crisis is
threatening the ability of our planet to support its inhabitants in the future.
Not only is energy efficiency good for the bottom line, but smart companies know
they must operate in ways that don`t deplete our world`s limited natural
resources if they want to stay in business in the long term. Earth Hour is a
great time for companies to find ways to reduce their environmental
footprint-not only in their own operations, but throughout their supply chain." 

More than 2,700 cities, towns and municipalities in 83 countries are preparing
to turn off their lights for one hour, making Earth Hour 2009 the largest
climate event in history. Individuals, businesses, governmental organizations,
schools and community organizations will come together, demonstrating that it`s
possible to take action on global warming.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, updates with closing share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, March 26 (Reuters) - Shares in Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK) gained nearly 15 percent in
Hong Kong on Thursday after Goldman Sachs (GS.N) pledged to
extend the lockup on most of its stake in the state-run bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors were also heartened by a fourth-quarter earnings
report late on Wednesday that met market expectations for flat
profit growth and contained no nasty surprises, which helped lift
shares in other mainland banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Relative to peers, we maintain our views that pressure on
NIM (net interest margin) and NPLs (non-performing loans) should
be the least at ICBC, thanks to its superior deposit franchise,
fixed rate bonds and prudent management," CLSA analysts wrote in
a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong shares in No.2 lender China Construction Bank
(0939.HK), which is scheduled to post full-year results on
Friday, ended 7.5 percent higher, while Bank of China's (3988.HK)
Hong Kong shares closed up 7.85 percent and Bank of
Communications (3328.HK) gained 9.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "ICBC's earnings were quite strong and that has spurred
buying in other Chinese banks too. There are expectations that
the banks that haven't come out with their earnings yet would
also have performed decently," said Howard Gorges, vice chairman
with South China Brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is just more optimism all around," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC Chairman Jiang Jianqing said on Thursday the bank's
overseas acquisition strategy would focus on Asia and emerging
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC owns 20 percent of South Africa's Standard Bank
(SBKJ.J), Africa's biggest lender, and has said it will continue
to look for overseas opportunities through acquisitions and by
building on its existing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beijing has encouraged a spate of lending as part of its
efforts to maintain economic growth of 8 percent a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC expects to make 65 percent of its loans for 2009 during
the first half of the year, Jiang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said it would not sell 80
percent of its nearly 5 percent holding in ICBC before April
2010. Previously it could sell half the stake next month and the
other half in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICBC shares, which had been under pressure from investors
worried that Goldman Sachs would unload half its stake next
month, closed at HK$4.11, up 14.8 percent and their highest level
since early January. Its Shanghai-listed shares ended 5.84
percent higher at 3.99 yuan.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - The prospect of IBM (IBM.N) purchasing loss-making Sun Microsystems JAVA.O might be good for Sun's long-suffering shareholders but it could be bad news for a partner across the Pacific: Fujitsu Ltd (6702.T).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fujitsu, Japan's biggest computer server vendor, but still a small global player, partners Sun in high-end servers and processors through which Fujitsu generates several hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the SPARC computer franchise of Sun and Fujitsu competes with IBM's own range of Power-class servers, mainframes and supercomputers, IBM and Sun's likely alliance is expected to complicate the partnership and, in the worst case for Fujitsu, end it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If that partnership dissolves, it will affect Fujitsu's ability to push out its next processor post-SPARC," said Hiroyuki Tsuzuki, an analyst at research firm IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Fujitsu would have to either shift its focus to other platforms or spend a lot of money to develop new processors on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said any loss in the server market could hurt Fujitsu, whose technology solution division including servers, is expected to be its only profitable business unit this year out of its three main segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The electronic conglomerate's other divisions such as consumer PCs, mobile phones and semiconductors are struggling due to a slump in demand and tumbling prices, hurt by the deepening economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources have said IBM is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems. The Wall Street Journal said a deal could be worth $6.5 billion to $8 billion. The merged company would hold 65 percent of the $17 billion market for Unix servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) also entering the server market, pressure has risen for firms such as Fujitsu to step up their offerings or acquire niche technologies to expand into new markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources from Fujitsu say the firm is financially not strong enough to face off against IBM and launch a competing bid for Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese firm has cash and cash equivalent of nearly $5 billion, while IBM has $12.7 billion in cash, according to recent financial statements.

"With or without this (IBM-Sun deal), it is already hard for them to expand services by just increasing hardware sales."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fujitsu's strategy has been to focus on providing long-term, comprehensive services, including hardware and maintenance, to corporate clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Fujitsu, as well as other Japanese server makers such as NEC (6701.T) and Hitachi (6501.T), want to compete better globally, it might have to consider its own acquisitions to gain in size, Deutsche Securities analyst Takeo Miyamoto said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is too big of a gap between the top three and the Japanese makers, and the (IBM-Sun) deal would even make the gap bigger," he said.

&lt;p&gt; * IBM-Sun deal likely to complicate Sun-Fujitsu partnership&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Fujitsu might switch to other platform, bear high costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Fujitsu, others may have to look for MAs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sachi Izumi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOKYO, March 26 (Reuters) - The prospect of IBM (IBM.N)
purchasing loss-making Sun Microsystems JAVA.O might be good
for Sun's long-suffering shareholders but it could be bad news
for a partner across the Pacific: Fujitsu Ltd (6702.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fujitsu, Japan's biggest computer server vendor, but still
a small global player, partners Sun in high-end servers and
processors through which Fujitsu generates several hundreds of
millions of dollars in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the SPARC computer franchise of Sun and Fujitsu
competes with IBM's own range of Power-class servers,
mainframes and supercomputers, IBM and Sun's likely alliance is
expected to complicate the partnership and, in the worst case
for Fujitsu, end it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If that partnership dissolves, it will affect Fujitsu's
ability to push out its next processor post-SPARC," said
Hiroyuki Tsuzuki, an analyst at research firm IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Fujitsu would have to either shift its focus to
other platforms or spend a lot of money to develop new
processors on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said any loss in the server market could hurt
Fujitsu, whose technology solution division including servers,
is expected to be its only profitable business unit this year
out of its three main segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The electronic conglomerate's other divisions such as
consumer PCs, mobile phones and semiconductors are struggling
due to a slump in demand and tumbling prices, hurt by the
deepening economic recession. [ID:nT146022]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources have said IBM is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems.
The Wall Street Journal said a deal could be worth $6.5 billion
to $8 billion. [ID:nN20518314] The merged company would hold 65
percent of the $17 billion market for Unix servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) also entering the server
market, pressure has risen for firms such as Fujitsu to step up
their offerings or acquire niche technologies to expand into
new markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources from Fujitsu say the firm is financially not strong
enough to face off against IBM and launch a competing bid for
Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Japanese firm has cash and cash equivalent of nearly $5
billion, while IBM has $12.7 billion in cash, according to
recent financial statements. Sun had a market value of $6
billion as of Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N), and Dell DELL.O control
nearly three-fourths of the global server market, whereas Sun
and Fujitsu hold about 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively,
according to IDC. Fujitsu has a quarter of the share in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GAME OVER FOR HARDWARE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fujitsu's shares have risen about 25 percent in the last
few weeks, buoyed by gains in global markets, but the stock is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;still down about 40 percent over the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Securities analyst Yoshiharu Izumi said a
potential loss of the alliance with Sun may not force Fujitsu
to alter its business strategy because it is already focusing
on expanding services rather than hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The game's pretty much done for hardware," he said. "With
or without this (IBM-Sun deal), it is already hard for them to

long-term, comprehensive services, including hardware and
maintenance, to corporate clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if Fujitsu, as well as other Japanese server makers

better globally, it might have to consider its own acquisitions

said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is too big of a gap between the top three and the
Japanese makers, and the (IBM-Sun) deal would even make the gap
bigger," he said. "They would have to seek larger size ...
their options include buying smaller players."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein's compensation fell 98.4 percent in 2008, as banks faced huge writedowns and losses due to investments in toxic assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth-largest U.S. bank reported that the total value of the 2008 compensation was $1.1 million, under accounting rules required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2007, he received a total of $70.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Blankfein was awarded a basic salary of $600,000 and no new bonus or option awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filing showed he earned another $277,828 for restricted stock units granted for prior years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein's perks and other benefits in 2008 included $111,223 for personal use of company automobiles and $40,543 in medical and dental plan payments, the filing showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman Sachs reported Blankfein's compensation in a summary table included in a proxy filing on Friday with the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. public companies are required to disclose the total value of annual pay awards to top executives under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The reported figures may differ from how executive pay consultants and others tabulate an executive's annual compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman received $10 billion of capital from the U.S. government in October, under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report forecasts that long-form videos, such as TV
shows and movies, will total 22.8 billion streams annually, or
4.1 percent of total video streams by 2013, with short-form
and user-generated video making up more than 75 percent of the
category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ad revenue from long-form video is expected to outstrip the
other two categories, however, with long-form content
accounting for 69 percent of total ad-related revenue by 2013,
the report showed.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein's compensation fell 98.4 percent to $1.1 million in 2008, as banks faced huge writedowns and losses due to investments in toxic assets, the fifth largest U.S. bank said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - As IBM's (IBM.N) negotiations to buy Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O enter another week, some analysts are weighing the risks in what could be the biggest U.S. technology deal this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, IBM was still examining Sun's business as part of its due diligence process, and talks may extend beyond next week, according to one source who was not authorized to speak about the talks and therefore requested anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most on Wall Street say a deal would bolster IBM's high-end computer and software business, and help ensure the survival of much-smaller Sun. But they also note that Sun's lagging business could hurt IBM's margins and derail its shift to more lucrative software and services from increasingly commoditized hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strategically we're a little lukewarm on it," said Edward Jones analyst Andy Miedler. "Financially this could make sense. But we question how much IBM needs Sun and whether it will would be able to get better value out of Sun's software than Sun is getting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wachovia analyst David Wong disagreed with some views that Sun's software assets would help IBM grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun posted an 11 percent decline in quarterly revenue for its fiscal quarter ended December 28, while gross margins shrank to 41.9 percent from 48.5 percent from a year earlier. The company rose to prominence in the 1990s but never fully recovered from the dotcom bubble burst earlier this decade, and analysts say failed talks with IBM could trigger a sell-off in the shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although Sun has what we consider to be interesting software intellectual property, including Solaris and Java, Sun's own revenue breakout shows that less than 10 percent of its sales are directly ascribable to software," Wong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think that an acquisition of Sun would offer limited benefit to IBM."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on March 18 that IBM could pay as much as $8 billion for Sun, amounting to a 100 percent premium for the high-end server computer maker. If a deal is sealed, it would be IBM's largest acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Global research analyst Amitabh Goel earlier this week said Sun was simply too troubled and that there was too much risk for IBM to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All said and done, Sun Microsystems still remains a company with a huge cost base, with a declining revenue trend adding further to its woes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SILENCE FROM BOTH SIDES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither IBM nor Sun has said they are in talks, and both declined to comment on news reports of their negotiations. Some analysts said the lack of official confirmation and explanation of their strategies made it hard to assess potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, many analysts are still upbeat that a deal could give IBM a clear lead in the server market against Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Dell Inc DELL.O. It would also give IBM an edge against Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), which some see as its biggest rival in several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman Brothers analyst Shaw Wu said that even though Sun had not succeeded in making much profit from its new software products, he believed that they could find more demand if they were coupled with IBM's broad portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Java software could do for IBM, to some extent, what iTunes does for personal computer and iPod maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O). "I think it's a fair parallel. iTunes is not really an engine in itself but it really helps Apple sell the other stuff," Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said IBM will likely launch a major restructuring at Sun once it buys the company. That could result in more job losses at a company known for talented engineers and heavy focus on research and development, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has already cut several thousand jobs in recent months, and is cutting another 5,000 U.S. jobs on top of that, people with knowledge of the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most agreed the greatest risk for Sun at the moment was in the deal falling through. Failed negotiations with IBM likely will mean that Sun will need to look for another buyer, and contend with a lower offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If skeletons tumble out of Sun's closet during the process, the deal could fall apart," said one technology banker familiar with the process of due diligence. "We've done hundreds of transactions where it looks good on the surface, then you get in there and you back away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun shares closed at $7.83 on Friday, down from a high of $9.27 struck after the deal was first reported, but still significantly above $4.97, its last closing price before the talks were first reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM likes to take the charge when doing due diligence," said one Sun shareholder, who requested anonymity. "But every day that a deal doesn't happen makes me more nervous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell 4.7 percent to $94.15 on the New York Stock Exchange, on a day when by comparison the tech-laden Nasdaq fell 2.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando and Anupreeta Das; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM is still examining Sun's business as part of its due diligence process, said the source, who was not authorized to speak about the talks and therefore requested anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither IBM nor Sun has issued any statement to say they are in talks, although sources said last week that the two sides are negotiating a merger that would bolster IBM's high-end server and software business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on March 18 that IBM could pay as much as $8 billion for Sun, amounting to a 100 percent premium for the high-end server computer maker. If a deal is sealed, it would be IBM's largest acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source said on Thursday that IBM's due diligence process, or examination of Sun's business, was necessary considering Sun's size and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IBM spokesman declined to comment, and Sun was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have said Sun would bolster IBM's position against rivals like Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), both of which have been acquiring smaller, niche technology firms to broaden their product and service offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun shares were up 1.5 percent at $7.97 in early afternoon trading, shedding some of their earlier gains to $8.23.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Friday the company is "thinking about what we want to do" about releasing the results of a government stress test on the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, March 27 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) Chief
Executive Jamie Dimon said on Friday the company is "thinking
about what we want to do" about releasing the results of a
government stress test on the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Dimon said the company already conducts stress tests on its
performance and makes regular disclosures, but would not say
that JPMorgan will make public the results of the regulators'
test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. government is testing 19 of the largest U.S. banks
to see how they would perform under more adverse economic
conditions than they are expected to face. Officials have said
the tests are not pass/fail, and are instead designed to
determine the amount of capital they might need if conditions
further deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government has until the end of April to complete the

money, we don't need the capital" when asked if JPMorgan
planned to participate in the government's toxic asset plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday provided more
details on a government plan to cleanse banks' balance sheets
of up to $1 trillion in distressed assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further, Dimon said the mark-to-market accounting guidance
that the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has
proposed will "mean almost nothing to us" but might help some
other banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FASB plans to vote next week on the guidance, which would
give banks more leeway to interpret how they should apply
mark-to-market accounting standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark-to-market accounting is aimed at giving investors an
accurate view of financial companies' books, but some banks and
lawmakers have blamed the rules for accelerating the financial
crisis.

&lt;p&gt;March 27 (Reuters) - Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) is expected to
continue to benefit from exclusive brands and a focus on
cutting costs, said J.P. Morgan Securities, which raised its
price target and earnings estimates on the mid-priced retailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "While some investors have chose to jump ship following a
great run, we think Kohl's is just beginning to hit its stride
and believe the stock has legs from here," analyst Charles Grom
wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grom said the department store chain's strategy of
partnering with brands that already have recognition seems to
be paying off, and is a big reason behind traffic stabilizing
in the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kohl's, which recently signed a marketing deal with pop
star Britney Spears, also has abundant store growth
opportunities, said Grom, who raised his price target on the
stock to $46 from $42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The retailer has a renewed focus on sustainable cost cuts
and is managing expenditures well, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Kohl's mantra is 'cash is king' in this environment, which
make sense," said Grom, who raised his 2009 earnings per share
estimate for the company to $2.40 from $2.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lower remodel costs and less costly Mervyns' openings have
allowed the company to cut capital expenditures, the analyst
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kohl's said earlier it plans to open about 55 stores and
remodel 51 others -- a majority of which will be former Mervyns
locations, which it acquired after Mervyns went bankrupt last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $43.04 Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  HONG KONG, Mar 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
GP Batteries International Limited (SIN: G08), one of the world's leading
battery manufacturers, has selected IBM (NYSE: IBM) technology to increase
the effectiveness of its sales planning, performance tracking and
financial reporting.

    These are three critical areas for manufacturers in the current economic
climate as they seek new business insights to help re-think factory
decisions, prioritize initiatives that maximize customer service, and
increase visibility to their global supply chains.

    Prior to the implementation, GP Batteries used a spreadsheet-based
reporting process which required manual data entry and took as long as two
weeks to pull sales forecasting information manually through the
spreadsheets. By the time the reports were delivered to the management
team, the data was already out of date. With headquarters in Hong Kong,
production facilities in the North and South-East Asia region, and sales
offices in major cities worldwide, the co-ordination between manufacturing
and sales was adversely affected, which in turn caused operational
inefficiencies.

    To support its long term growth, GP Batteries recognized it required new
abilities to transform data from disparate spreadsheets into relevant and
timely business information for consistent execution of decision-making
across manufacturing, sales and all other departments as market conditions
change. Following the evaluation of the offerings from IBM and other
companies including Microsoft and Oracle, GP Batteries turned to IBM for
an advanced performance management system in a single platform consisting
of IBM Cognos 8 BI, Cognos TM1 and Cognos 8 Controller running on four IBM
System x3650 servers.

    With the new business insights gained, GP batteries will be able to
improve its sales planning and forecasting capabilities by translating
the results of "what-if" scenario planning, forecasting and business
modeling into action plans to maintain organizational agility. They will
be able to drill down to the store-keeping unit (SKU) level in real-time,
as well as review a dashboard of cross-business performance indicators.

    In addition, the improvements to the company's financial reporting
capability -- with integrated information from data collection to
financial consolidation and output -- will help the financial and
accounting team close the books faster.

    "Our standardization on IBM software for performance management will help
improve the strategic decision making across the organization and
streamline our external reporting and compliance processes," said Michael
Wong, Director of Information Technology (MIS department), GP Batteries.

    "The IBM Cognos team has been able to provide a single vendor solution for
the whole performance management suite, eliminating the need for us to
communicate with different vendors and the complexity of having to
integrate several different solutions. They understood our business needs
and have been working closely with us to meet our requirements," he added.

    As a result of the implementation, GP Batteries has also been able to
deploy their staff more effectively to manage all IT requirements.

    "Companies now recognize the need to use information more effectively in
order to successfully compete in today's dynamic and challenging global
economy," said Cindy Cheng, Executive, Cognos, Software Group, IBM
China/Hong Kong Limited. "As leading multinational companies like GP
Batteries manage their headquarters, manufacturing plants and sales
offices across multiple locations and time zones, they are seeking
smarter ways to leverage information to improve their organizational
effectiveness and competitiveness, as well as to capture new
opportunities in these challenging times."

    Under the agreement signed in December 2008, the deployment will be
conducted in three phases starting in the middle of February. The project
is expected to be completed by the end of 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Quark`s XML Authoring Tool Now Supports Microsoft Office 2007, Offers Native
User Interface Support for French, German and Japanese Languages, and Includes
New Style Functionality
DENVER--(Business Wire)--
Quark announced today Quark XML Author 3.0 for Microsoft Word, the next version
of Quark`s XML authoring tool that allows users to create XML content easily
within Microsoft Word, the world`s most widely-used word processor.
Organizations from around the world choose Quark XML Author because it allows
non-technical business workers to use Microsoft Word to create intelligent
content with little or no training. 

"Quark XML Author enhances the user-defined XML support within Microsoft Word
and allows users to create XML content easily, which eliminates many of the
barriers associated with the adoption of XML," said Ayca Yuksel, Senior Product
Manager from Microsoft. "Through our partnership with Quark, we`ve enabled many
Microsoft Word users to author structured XML content that can be managed in
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server." 

Melissa Webster, Program Vice President for Content and Digital Media
Technologies at IDC said, "Business users use Microsoft Word for authoring and
they`ve been very reluctant to adopt the specialized XML authoring tools that
were designed for technical communicators. At the same time, XML is key to
realizing the full power of dynamic publishing. What`s needed is a solution that
turns Microsoft Word into an XML authoring tool, and that`s what Quark XML
Author provides." 

Quark XML Author 3.0

Quark XML Author 3.0 supports Microsoft Office 2007 and Microsoft Vista from a
single XML Author code base, which offers stability and uninterrupted
productivity to users who have or are in the process of upgrading to the most
current versions of Microsoft Office. The new version of Quark XML Author also
offers native user interface support for French, German, and Japanese languages,
which increases user productivity and collaboration among global teams. 

In addition, Quark XML Author 3.0 offers new style and formatting functionality
that gives users more control over their content, including:

* New integration with Design Science`s MathType Editor for equations 
* Improved tool bar for use with the Microsoft Office 2007 native ribbon
interface 
* Improved feature that allows for bulk changes throughout a document 
* Advanced indenting and style capabilities for list items and paragraphs

"Our relationship with Microsoft continues to allow us to bring superior XML
authoring solutions to organizations across a range of industries so they can
improve and automate their publishing processes," said John Friske, General
Manager of XML products for Quark. "Together we continue to bring a powerful and
unique tool to the many Microsoft Office users adopting XML." 

Users of Quark XML Author for Microsoft Word are able to upgrade to version 3.0
automatically. The new version is backward compatible with Microsoft Office
2000-2007 and is bi-directionally compatible with Quark XML Author 2.x files. It
will be available on April 30, 2009.

Quark XML Author for Microsoft Word

In its 2008 acquisition of In.vision Research, Quark gained XML Author for
Microsoft Word, formerly known as In.vision Xpress Author. Quark XML Author
enhances Microsoft Word`s native XML support by allowing users to create
narrative XML documents directly - without seeing tags, being constrained to
boxes, or being aware of the technical complexities associated with XML. Equally
important, XML Author ensures that the content an author creates is constantly
validated against the XML standard - eliminating the need to rework content at a

&lt;p&gt;Bei den bekannten Anzeigetafeln von Coca-Cola an Times Square, Piccadilly Circus
und Kings Cross gehen die Lichter aus
ATLANTA, USA--(Business Wire)--
Die Coca-Cola Company hat heute bekannt gegeben, dass bei vielen ihrer kultigen
Anzeigetafeln zur Unterst&#252;tzung der Earth Hour am Samstag, dem 28. M&#228;rz, die
Lichter ausgehen werden. Das Unternehmen beteiligt sich dar&#252;ber hinaus an
regionalen Veranstaltungen zur Bewusstseinsbildung in mehr als 50 L&#228;ndern, um
das Ereignis zu unterst&#252;tzen, das wohl das gr&#246;&#223;te weltweite Klima-Event aller
Zeiten werden wird. 

&#8222;Wir freuen uns sehr, zusammen mit Tausenden von Gemeinden, Organisationen und
Einzelpersonen das Bewusstsein f&#252;r Ma&#223;nahmen zu st&#228;rken, die wir alle ergreifen
k&#246;nnen, um die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels zu verlangsamen, zu stoppen und
letztendlich umzukehren", sagte Muhtar Kent, President und CEO von The Coca-Cola
Company. &#8222;Die Earth Hour ist ein gro&#223;artiger Weg, um zu demonstrieren, dass
kleine, einfach Schritte, wie das Ausschalten des Lichts, sofern sie von
Menschen auf der ganzen Welt unternommen werden, gro&#223;e Auswirkungen beim Kampf
gegen ein allgegenw&#228;rtiges Problem wie den Klimawandel haben k&#246;nnen." 

Es ist geplant, dass bei den kultigen Coca-Cola-Zeichen am Times Square und auf
dem Dach des Hotels The Mirage am Strip in Las Vegas in den Vereinigten Staaten
sowie am Piccadilly Circus in London und am Kings Cross in Sydney die Lichter
ausgehen werden. Weitere bekannte Leuchtanzeigen und Anzeigetafeln von Mexiko
bis Kairo bis Shanghai werden ausgeschaltet. Auch unterst&#252;tzt das Unternehmen
die Werbung f&#252;r die Earth Hour in diversen M&#228;rkten mit Radio-, Kino- und
Fernsehwerbung sowie durch Printanzeigen. 

In Atlanta werden am weltweiten Hauptsitz des Unternehmens sowie in der World of
Coca-Cola die Lichter ausgehen, genauso wie an den Leuchtanzeigen Grady Board
und Woodruff Park. An anderen Orten in den Vereinigten Staaten und Kanada
spendet das Unternehmen gesch&#228;tzte USD 300.000 zur Unterst&#252;tzung der Medien bei
der Ver&#246;ffentlichung von &#246;ffentlichen Ank&#252;ndigungen zur Earth Hour. Dies
erm&#246;glicht w&#228;hrend der zwei Wochen vor dem Ereignis eine t&#228;gliche Auflage von
&#252;ber f&#252;nf Millionen in mehr als 197 M&#228;rkten. 

Die Mitarbeiter von Coca-Cola werden dazu ermuntert, zusammen mit ihren Familien
und Freunden an der Earth Hour teilzunehmen. Den Mitarbeitern in Spanien wird
eine mit dem Logo des Ereignisses versehene Kerze geschickt, die w&#228;hrend der
Stunden ohne Licht angez&#252;ndet werden soll, und in Lateinamerika erhalten die
Angestellten anl&#228;sslich des Ereignisses Anstecknadeln und Leuchtschlangen.
Dar&#252;ber hinaus werden die Lichter in Dutzenden B&#252;ros und Abf&#252;llanlagen von
Coca-Cola ausgehen und Partys zum gemeinsamen Ansehen der Ereignisse sowie
andere Sonderveranstaltungen sind &#252;berall auf der Welt geplant. In einigen
M&#228;rkten wird die Earth Hour auch auf den Liefer-LKWs von Coca-Cola beworben. 

Die Standorte von Coca-Cola in den folgenden L&#228;ndern sind beteiligt:
Argentinien, Australien, Bahrain, Belgien, Bolivien, Brasilien, Chile, China,
Kolumbien, Costa Rica, D&#228;nemark, Dominikanische Republik, Ecuador, &#196;gypten, El
Salvador, Frankreich, Gro&#223;britannien, Guatemala, Honduras, Hongkong, Indien,
Indonesien, Italien, Japan, Kenia, Korea, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexiko,
Nicaragua, Norwegen, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippinen, Rum&#228;nien, Russland,
Singapur, S&#252;dafrika, Spanien, Schweden, Thailand, Trinidad und Tobago, T&#252;rkei,
Vereinigte Staaten, Uruguay, Venezuela, Vietnam und Sambia. 

Die Earth Hour ist eine symbolische Veranstaltung, die das Bewusstsein steigert
und der Coca-Cola Company Gelegenheit bietet, ihr Engagement f&#252;r den Klimaschutz
zu demonstrieren. Das Unternehmen arbeitet daran, in seinen Produktionsbetrieben
systemweit die Kohlendioxidemissionen zu stabilisieren, und hat das Ziel, seine
Gesch&#228;fte, aber nicht seine CO2-Bilanz auszubauen. Das Unternehmen hat sich
dar&#252;ber hinaus bis 2015 einer absoluten Emissionsreduzierung von f&#252;nf Prozent
(basierend auf den Zahlen von 2004) in Entwicklungsl&#228;ndern verpflichtet. Diese
weltweiten Engagements werden im Jahr 2015 den Aussto&#223; von mehr als zwei
Millionen Tonnen CO2 verhindern. 

&#8222;Der World Wildlife Fund freut sich, dass sich Coca-Cola an der Earth Hour 2009
beteiligt", sagte der President und CEO von WWF USA, Carter Roberts. &#8222;Die
Klimakrise bedroht die F&#228;higkeit unseres Planeten, seine Bewohner in Zukunft zu
versorgen. Energieeffizienz ist nicht nur gut f&#252;r das Endresultat, sondern
intelligente Unternehmen wissen, dass sie, sofern Sie langfristig im Gesch&#228;ft
bleiben wollen, so arbeiten m&#252;ssen, dass die begrenzten Ressourcen unserer Welt
nicht ersch&#246;pft werden. Earth Hour ist eine hervorragende M&#246;glichkeit f&#252;r
Unternehmen, Wege zu finden, ihre Umweltbilanz zu reduzieren - nicht nur in
ihrem eigenen Betrieb, sondern in ihrer gesamten Lieferkette." 

Mehr als 2.700 St&#228;dte und Gemeinden in 83 L&#228;ndern bereiten sich darauf vor, ihre
Lichter eine Stunde lang auszuschalten und die Earth Hour 2009 damit zum gr&#246;&#223;ten
Klimaereignis aller Zeiten zu machen. Einzelpersonen, Unternehmen und
Regierungsorganisationen, Schulen und Gemeindeeinrichtungen werden
zusammenkommen und zeigen, dass es m&#246;glich ist, Ma&#223;nahmen gegen die globale
Erw&#228;rmung zu ergreifen.

&lt;p&gt;OSLO, March 27 (Reuters) - Norway's top oil and gas
producer, StatoilHydro (STL.OL), said Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
issued a writ in the fourth-quarter for up to 1 billion crowns
($153.6 million) compensation in a dispute over an offshore
Norway oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon said StatoilHydro may have sold stakes in the small
Mikkel field in the Norwegian Sea to Italy's ENI (ENI.MI) and
France-based Total (TOTF.PA) too cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; StatoilHydro operates Mikkel, whose production is tied in to
the larger Aasgard field, and has a 43.97 percent stake. Exxon
has 33.48 percent, ENI has 14.90 percent and Total 7.65 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, the Norwegian government issued a similar writ
over the stake sales, and is seeking compensation of 4-7 billion
crowns, after tax. [ID:nOSL001245]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "During the fourth quarter of 2008, ExxonMobil... issued a
similar writ (to the Norwegian government) with a compensation
claim approximating an estimated exposure of up to 1 billion
after tax," StatoilHydro said in the legal proceedings section
of its 2008 annual report. "StatoilHydro rejects both claims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; StatoilHydro said the stakes were sold at market prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs believe the price was too low and may have
been lowered after ENI and Total dropped arbitration proceedings
against StatoilHydro over alleged overcharging connected with
Aasgard in 1997-2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The overcharging suit concerned the Aasgard field partners
-- which include Eni, Total, Exxon and the Norwegian state --
paying for work to expand the onshore Kaarstoe gas terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The writ is related to transactions Statoil made that were
below market value," Exxon Mobil spokesman Eirik Hauge told
Reuters. "Exxon is joining the (Norwegian) state, which has a
similar case against Statoil."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The StatoilHydro-operated Aasgard field is one of the
largest offshore Norway, producing some 122,000 barrels of oil
per day and nearly 10 billion cubic metres of gas per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For details, double click on:

&lt;p&gt;The Big Apple Joins 1,000 Cities Around the World, Including Paris, Las Vegas,
London, Chicago, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Rome, Beijing, Nairobi and Moscow, in
Historic Call to Action on Climate Change
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
As momentum builds around the world for the first global vote for action on
climate change, several of New York City`s most recognizable buildings and
landmarks have committed to turn off their lights for World Wildlife Fund`s
Earth Hour. 

Beginning at 8:30 p.m. on March 28th, individuals and organizations around New
York City will turn off non-essential lighting on some of the most iconic
structures that make up the Manhattan skyline. New Yorkers will join the global
movement that has spread to more than 1,000 cities in 80 countries. In the U.S.,
the city joins Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los
Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco in dimming its skyline to cast a
vote for action on the climate crisis. 

"This will be a pivotal year in the future of our planet as we look to Congress,
President Obama and global leaders to take immediate and decisive action on
climate change," said Carter Roberts, CEO of World Wildlife Fund. "Having New
York City go dark for Earth Hour will send a powerful message to the world that
the U.S. is ready to assume a leadership position in solving one of the most
serious challenges facing our planet today. By turning out the lights, the
people of New York City will be casting a vote in support of the future of the
Earth."

most renowned buildings and landmarks including:

including Columbia University, PACE University, the Building Owners and Managers
Association of New York, the U.S. Green Building Council New York, Fall Out Boy
Pete Wentz`s Angels + Kings, and many more.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) as Bull of the Day and
Cadence Design Systems (Nasdaq: CDNS) as Bear of the Day. In addition, the
analysts at Zacks Equity Research discuss the latest on J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM),
Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) has an enormously diverse revenue stream
consisting of market leading products in all three of its business segments.
However, due to a number of products expected to experience declining sales,
revenue will likely fall in 2009. 

We expect EPS to remain flat from 2008, benefiting form improving margins and
share buybacks. Then again, J s consistency, product diversity, financial
stability and long-term growth potential make it a very attractive holding in
this turbulent market. 

We rate the stock a Buy based on the stock`s attractive valuation and strong
company fundamentals. Our price target is $70. 

Bear of the Day

We expect that a turnaround is going to take time for Cadence Design Systems
(Nasdaq: CDNS) due to mounting financial problems leading to lackluster growth.
The company reported weak 2008 results and provided guidance for a poor 2009. 

We have lost confidence in the company`s ability to survive in the market and
show healthy fundamentals. Cadence has been losing share to Synopsys and is
struggling through a downturn in the semiconductor cycle. Cadence also withdrew
its bid for Mentor Graphics in 2008, further dimming its growth prospects. 

Cadence recently came out with enhanced version of its products, but it will
take time for these to generate additional revenue. We maintain a Sell rating on
the shares and maintain our six-month price target of $2.50. 

Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

On Addressing Risk Prevention

When Bear Stearns was failing, the only safe port in the storm was J.P. Morgan
(NYSE: JPM) and when Merrill Lynch was about to go under, it was Bank of America
(NYSE: BAC) that stepped up to the plate to keep it alive. Both of these actions
were actively encouraged and subsidized by the regulators. It would seem a bit
two-faced to turn around and make them unwind the transactions so quickly. 

We have, in a larger sense, also been going the wrong way on the whole issue of
"too big to fail" for much the same reason. Not only did J.P. Morgan take over
Bear Stearns, but it also took over Washington Mutual, the largest thrift in the
country, when it failed. Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) took over Wachovia, but not
before a bit of a battle with Citigroup over it (talk about some potentially
very ugly kids from that marriage!). 

The problem of "too big to fail" has so far been addressed by making these
institutions even bigger. But hey -- it was a crisis, and there were not a lot
of other routes to go down, particularly if one wanted to avoid outright
nationalization of institutions. 

If we can`t break up these financial institutions, the least we can do it to try
to effectively regulate them. This is where the call for a systemic risk
regulator would come in. Most likely it will be the Fed, but conceivably the job
could be done by either the Treasury or the FDIC.

boa para os resultados, mas as empresas inteligentes sabem que devem operar de
modo a n&#227;o esgotar os limitados recursos naturais do mundo, se quiserem

&lt;p&gt;Les c&#233;l&#232;bres panneaux publicitaires Coca-Cola de Times Square, Piccadilly Circus
et Kings Crossvont s`&#233;teindre
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company a annonc&#233; aujourd`hui que beaucoup de ses panneaux
embl&#233;matiques allaient s`&#233;teindre en signe de soutien &#224; l`initiative Earth Hour
pr&#233;vue pour le samedi 28 mars. La soci&#233;t&#233; participe &#233;galement &#224; des &#233;v&#233;nements
mobilisateurs &#224; l`&#233;chelle locale dans plus de 50 pays, afin de soutenir ce qui
devrait &#234;tre l`&#233;v&#233;nement le plus important au monde en faveur du climat. 

&#171; Nous sommes heureux de nous joindre &#224; des milliers de communaut&#233;s,
d`organisations et d`individus en vue de promouvoir dans les consciences les
actions que nous pouvons tous mener pour ralentir, arr&#234;ter et finalement
renverser les effets du changement climatique &#187;, d&#233;clare M. Muhtar Kent,
pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral de The Coca-Cola Company. &#171; L`initiative Earth Hour
est une excellente fa&#231;on de d&#233;montrer que, quand ils sont r&#233;p&#233;t&#233;s dans le monde
entier, des gestes aussi simples que le fait d`&#233;teindre les lumi&#232;res peuvent
inciter &#224; une mobilisation soutenue en faveur d`une cause aussi universelle que
le combat contre le changement climatique. &#187; 

&#192; l`heure pr&#233;vue, les panneaux embl&#233;matiques Coca-Cola vont s`&#233;teindre dans
Times Square et sur le toit de l`h&#244;tel The Mirage &#224; Las Vegas aux &#201;tats-Unis, au
carrefour de Piccadilly Circus &#224; Londres et &#224; Kings Cross &#224; Sydney. D`autres
panneaux illumin&#233;s bien connus s`&#233;teindront du Mexique au Caire, en passant par
Shanghai. La soci&#233;t&#233; aide &#233;galement &#224; promouvoir l`initiative Earth Hour dans
divers march&#233;s par des annonces publicitaires &#224; la radio, dans les cin&#233;mas, &#224; la
t&#233;l&#233;vision et dans la presse. 

&#192; Atlanta, le si&#232;ge social mondial de la soci&#233;t&#233; et l`exposition permanente &#171;
The World of Coca-Cola &#187; s`&#233;teindront comme le feront les panneaux de l`h&#244;pital

don d`une somme estim&#233;e &#224; 300 000 dollars afin de diffuser dans les m&#233;dias des
messages d`int&#233;r&#234;t public (PSA) concernant l`initiative Earth Hour. En tout,
plus de 5 millions d`annonces quotidiennes seront diffus&#233;es dans plus de 197
march&#233;s pendant les deux semaines pr&#233;c&#233;dant l`&#233;v&#233;nement. 

Les employ&#233;s de Coca-Cola ainsi que leurs familles et amis sont incit&#233;s &#224;
participer aux activit&#233;s Earth Hour. En Espagne, un rappel sera envoy&#233; aux
employ&#233;s avec une bougie comm&#233;morative qu`ils pourront allumer pendant les
heures sans lumi&#232;re. En Am&#233;rique latine, les employ&#233;s vont recevoir des pins et
des vers lumineux avec des slogans pour marquer l`&#233;v&#233;nement. En outre, des
douzaines de bureaux et d`usines d`embouteillage Coca-Cola vont &#233;teindre leurs
lumi&#232;res. Dans le monde entier, des soir&#233;es participatives et des &#233;v&#233;nements
sp&#233;ciaux sont pr&#233;vus. Dans certains march&#233;s, la promotion de l`initiative Earth
Hour est faite par le biais des camions de livraison Coca-Cola. 

Le r&#233;seau Coca-Cola se mobilise notamment dans les pays suivants : Afrique du
Sud, Argentine, Australie, Bahre&#239;n, Belgique, Bolivie, Br&#233;sil, Chili, Chine,

Earth Hour est un &#233;v&#233;nement symbolique qui &#233;veille les consciences et donne &#224;
The Coca-Cola Company l`occasion de manifester son engagement envers la
protection du climat. La soci&#233;t&#233; fait des efforts pour stabiliser ses &#233;missions
de dioxyde de carbone dans l`ensemble de ses installations de fabrication. Son
objectif est d`&#233;tendre ses op&#233;rations commerciales, mais pas son empreinte
carbone. Avec 2004 comme r&#233;f&#233;rence de base, la soci&#233;t&#233; s`est engag&#233;e &#224; r&#233;duire
de 5 % ses &#233;missions totales dans les pays d&#233;velopp&#233;s d`ici &#224; 2015. Au plan
mondial, cet engagement aura pour effet en 2015 de retenir jusqu`&#224; 2 millions de
tonnes m&#233;triques de CO2. 

&#171; Le Fonds mondial pour la nature (WWF) se r&#233;jouit de la participation de
Coca-Cola &#224; l`initiative Earth Hour 2009 &#187;, ajoute M. Carter Roberts,
pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral du WWF-US. &#171; La crise climatique menace la capacit&#233;
de la plan&#232;te &#224; subvenir aux besoins futurs de ses habitants. L`efficacit&#233;
&#233;nerg&#233;tique est non seulement bonne pour le chiffre d`affaires, mais les
soci&#233;t&#233;s intelligentes savent qu`elles doivent trouver des m&#233;thodes
d`exploitation respectueuses des ressources naturelles limit&#233;es de notre terre
si elles veulent que leurs activit&#233;s perdurent. Pour les soci&#233;t&#233;s, Earth Hour se
pr&#233;sente comme une occasion parfaite pour qu`elles trouvent les moyens de
r&#233;duire leur empreinte environnementale, non seulement dans leurs propres
activit&#233;s, mais aussi dans l`ensemble de leur cha&#238;ne logistique. &#187; 

Plus de 2 700 villes, communes et municipalit&#233;s situ&#233;es dans 83 pays se
pr&#233;parent &#224; &#233;teindre leurs lumi&#232;res pendant une heure, ce qui fera d`Earth Hour
2009 l`&#233;v&#233;nement climatique le plus important &#224; ce jour. Des personnes, des
entreprises, des agences gouvernementales, des &#233;coles et des organisations
communautaires vont se rassembler et d&#233;montrer qu`il est possible de prendre des
initiatives contre le r&#233;chauffement climatique.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Russians Oksana Domnina and Maxim Shabalin delivered a timely free dance performance to outduel their American rivals and capture the gold at the Figure Skating World Championships on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoring an event-best 100.85, they edged U.S. duo Tanith Belbin and Benjamin Agosto by a final count of 206.30 to 205.08.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belbin and Agosto were bidding to become the first U.S. team to take gold at the worlds, but had to settle for second place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada's Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir took the bronze medal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It feels great," said Shabalin, who has been plagued by a knee injury for the past year. "(It hurt) a little bit; this city and arena are so amazing that I couldn't skate badly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domnina added: "Right now we don't have any emotions. We can't believe it yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the frontrunners heading into last year's world championships, the Russian tandem was unable to compete due to Shabalin's knee surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COUNTER DISPLAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took the ice on Friday night having watched Belbin and Agosto put up a top score of 100.27, but Domnina and Shabalin calmly produced a counter display, topping off a strong program with an elegant lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not the first time Belbin and Agosto were getting a close look at their Russian counterparts as both teams train in the same facility and share coaches Natalia Linichuk and Gennadi Karpanossov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger," Agosto said. "We're so happy to have put out three strong performances we felt so good about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korean sensation Kim Yu-na produced a commanding performance in the short program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 18-year-old blew away the early competition with a score of 76.12, the best ever for a woman. With Canada's Joannie Rochette her nearest competitor at 67.90, Yu-na has turned Saturday's free skate into a virtual coronation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The short program is just the short program, I will focus on the long program (on Saturday)," Yu-na said. "I am very happy with how I did today. Now I just want to do well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's defending champion Mao Asada was running third after a unremarkable 66.06 left her disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim overwhelmed her opponents in a performance that seemed to shock her, and certainly delighted the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smiling and theatrical the whole way, the Four Continents champion put herself in perfect position to take her first world title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's Miki Ando, the 2007 champion, was fourth with a 64.12, followed by Italy's Carolina Kostner and Finland's Laura Lepisto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by N.Ananthanarayanan; To query or comment on this story email sportsfeedback@thomsonreuters.com)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) could see its
earnings and shares rise as U.S. consumers increase their use
of credit and debit cards for every-day and big-ticket
purchases, Barron's reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Visa shares closed at $54.25 on Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange, but Barron's said some fans of the
payments-network company think the stock could trade beyond
$70, even in a difficult economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since Visa's main costs relate to marketing its brand,
Barron's said it has the flexibility to protect or increase its
margins and has room to meet or beat earnings forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Visa beats expectations, Barron's said the shares could
head toward $70, which would "reinforce Visa's emerging status
as a core blue-chip-like holding."

&lt;p&gt;With Full Support for IBM Virtual Client Solutions, Devon IT's Thin Clients
Provide Cost-Effective Approach To Managing and Accessing Virtualized Desktops
KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Devon IT Solutions India Pvt Ltd today announced its new line of thin client
solutions, orderable with IBM part numbers. Devon has worked directly with IBM
to launch this complete line of thin client solutions that complements IBM's
Virtual Client Solutions (VCS) infrastructure. 

"We are committed to providing industry-leading and cost-effective thin client
technology for users," explained Joe Makoid, President, Devon IT. "When a market
and technology leader like IBM is progressing thin client/hosted client
architecture and collaborate with leaders such as Citrix and VMware it is
obvious that the current approach to desktop computing is shifting. We have
always been proponents of server-centric computing and centralized management as
a way for IT managers to reduce costs dramatically. Devon Thin Clients provide
IBM customers an easy and cost-effective way to order complete hosted desktop
solutions from one source." 

"The economic realities of India technology requires new ideas to solve current
problems. The benefits of server-based and virtual desktops are compelling and
will address problems like security and operating costs," said Sunil Bangalore,
Program Director India Software Labs IBM India Pvt. Ltd. "This cost-effective
alternative to the traditional desktop PC provides increased security,
centralized management, and adds operational flexibility to desktop computing.
The variety of virtual client solutions, coupled with Devon IT's thin client, is
a potent combination that makes it easy for IT managers to evaluate, assess, and
ultimately implement their own virtualized desktop environments." 

The IBM Virtual Client Solutions bring important benefits to the information
technology (IT) department. In addition to delivering security and control, the
Virtualized Hosted Client Infrastructure will enable companies to support more
users with fewer resources, while offering the best possible desktop experience
from virtually anywhere and on virtually any device. 

Devon's Line of Thin Clients with IBM part numbers provide a complete set of
desktop, mobile and specialized thin client solutions that will meet any end
user requirement. 

TC2

The ultra-small and inexpensive TC2 is an ideal desktop replacement for
businesses looking to downsize their infrastructure and reduce management and
power costs. The small form factor unit consumes only 8 watts and is completely
silent. Despite its size, it is fully-functioned and allows users to connect to
a variety of servers and virtual desktops. The TC2 is exclusively a Devon IT
product and is orderable through IBM using an IBM part number. 

TC5

The TC5 is a next-generation thin client from Devon IT for users who need high
performance from a small footprint client. The TC5 gives users the capability to
use multiple displays with one stateless unit. This ultra-advanced desktop
appliance supports dual DVI video, internal wireless (Optional) and comes with
either the DeTOS Operating System or Windows XP Embedded. The TC5 is exclusively
a Devon IT product and will be orderable through IBM using an IBM part number. 

TC10

The TC10 is the highest performance desktop access device in the world. It is
the first desktop access device that gives the end user a true PC experience
with instant screen updates, full multimedia support, and full USB
compatibility. It connects to IBM's HC10 Workstation Blade using PC-over-IP(tm),
a technology that changes the desktop computing model by enabling desktop
consolidation benefits to be realized across the enterprise. Unlike a
traditional RDP thin client, the TC10 is for demanding users that require real
time PC-like capability such as financial traders and power users such as CAD
engineers. The TC10 is equivalent to the IBM CP20. 

SafeBook LVO

The SafeBook LVO is the next-generation mobile thin client notebook. Built on
the Lenovo ThinkPad platform the SafeBook LVO is available with Windows XP
embedded software and is compatible with Lenovo ThinkPad docking stations and
accessories. The SafeBook LVO is a mobile thin client laptop with no hard drive,
so all sensitive data is protected against loss or theft. With its low purchase
price, low operating and maintenance costs, and reinforced security functions,
the SafeBook LVO offers the latest thin client technology in a lightweight,
mobile notebook. The SafeBook LVO is exclusively a Devon IT product, and is
orderable through IBM using an IBM part number. 

Devon Thin Client Software

Devon's software, which includes its DeTOS operating system and its Thin Manage
management suite allows IT managers to easily create, deploy and manage their
virtual desktop infrastructure. VDI is complex and therefore requires a holistic
management framework to orchestrate the many components required for successful
virtual desktop delivery and management. Devon's suite of software streamlines
and simplifies desktop virtualization deployments, enabling IT organizations to
gain greater management and control, ensure data and asset security, deliver a
superior end-user experience, and provide enterprise business continuity and
cost reductions. 

"We are partnering with IBM to accelerate hosted client solutions like the VCS,"
noted Rajesh Naidu, General Manager of Bangalore-based Devon IT Solutions India
Pvt Ltd. "Our thin clients that are orderable from IBM can help customers
immediately access any application without changing the architecture, touching
the infrastructure or rewriting code and that is exactly what they are looking
for in a secure access hosted client solution."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney and Google's YouTube said on Monday they have reached a pact to offer sports highlights, clips of television shows and other short-form content on the hugely popular video-sharing site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal will see videos from sports network ESPN from April and the Disney/ABC Television networks such as ABC Entertainment and SoapNet become available on YouTube from May. Disney Media Networks will have the option to sell its own advertising inventory within those channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the deal does not entail full-length programing, analysts said it represents an important validation for YouTube as it seeks to present itself as an outlet for professionally-made, premium video content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The important thing is we got ABC up on the platform, it remains to be seen how that will grow," said YouTube head of content partnerships Jordan Hoffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoffner said the deal was the product of several months of work and adds to the comprehensiveness of YouTube's library of professional video content which includes content from CBS Corp, the Food Network and Discover Communications Inc's the Discovery Channel, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has resisted making its original content widely available for free through third party distributors on the Web before now. But in recent weeks there have been reports of plans for the media company to partner not just with YouTube but also with Hulu, the online video service owned by News Corp and NBC Universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear whether Disney is still considering a separate deal with Hulu. Representatives at Disney and Hulu were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Sweeney, co-chair, Disney Media Networks said in a statement announcing the YouTube partnership that the deal offers Disney the opportunity to reach a broader online audience, to experiment with different monetization models "and to "extend the reach of our advertisers within branded environments that they most desire."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanford Bernstein  Co. analyst Jeff Lindsay said Disney appears to be taking a cautious approach in its deal with YouTube, perhaps to minimize creating too big of a stir among the cable and satellite providers with which it has television distribution agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said the deal could cause other producers of premium cable TV content to take note and explore ways of offering programing over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouTube is easily the most popular online video service in the United States, according to data from Web audience measurement firm comScore, with more than 99 million unique viewers in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite that popularity it has been under pressure from Google investors keen to see the audience numbers converted to dollars. YouTube has yet to make a significant contribution to Google's bottom-line, and the site has struggled to convince advertisers to make a major financial commitment with so many of the videos dominated by clips uploaded by users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One sign that YouTube executives are prepared to start making compromises is that it has agreed for Disney to test pre-roll advertising on short-form content. YouTube founders Chad Hurley and Steve Chen have in the past said that pre-roll advertising would harm the popularity of its service as its videos are short-form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Google were up $1.56 at $344.25 in after-hours trade. Disney shares were up 15 cents at $18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic and Yinka Adegoke)&lt;/p&gt;

Disney Media Networks will have the option to sell its own

analysts said it represents an important validation for YouTube
as it seeks to present itself as an outlet for
professionally-made, premium video content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "The important thing is we got ABC up on the platform, it
remains to be seen how that will grow," said YouTube head of
content partnerships Jordan Hoffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hoffner said the deal was the product of several months of
work and adds to the comprehensiveness of YouTube's library of
professional video content which includes content from CBS Corp

appears to be taking a cautious approach in its deal with
YouTube, perhaps to minimize creating too big of a stir among
the cable and satellite providers with which it has television
distribution agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he said the deal could cause other producers of premium
cable TV content to take note and explore ways of offering
programming over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; YouTube is easily the most popular online video service in
the United States, according to data from Web audience
measurement firm comScore, with more than 99 million unique

Google investors keen to see the audience numbers converted to

and SoapNet become available on YouTube from May. Disney Media
Networks will have the option to sell its own advertising
inventory within those channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies said that as part of the agreement, the ESPN
Video Player will be integrated into ESPN's channel on YouTube and
the sports network will also produce additional short-form content
through YouTube's player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ESPN content that is available on the ESPN channel and player
will not contain long-form content from its linear networks --
such as cable television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has resisted making its original content widely
available for free through third party distributors on the Web
before now. But in recent weeks there have been reports of plans
for the media company to partner not just with YouTube but also
with Hulu, the online video service owned by News Corp (NWSA.O)
and NBC Universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This deal provides us with the opportunity to reach a broader
online audience, to experiment with different monetization models
and to extend the reach of our advertisers within branded
environments that they most desire," said Anne Sweeney, co-chair,
Disney Media Networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal will be a major boost for YouTube, which has
struggled to convince advertisers to make a major financial
commitment with so many of the videos dominated by clips uploaded
by users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The video service is easily the most popular online video
service in the United States, according to data from Web audience
measurement firm comScore, with more than 99 million unique
viewers in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But despite that popularity it has been under pressure from
Google investors keen to see the audience numbers converted to
dollars. YouTube has yet to make a significant contribution to
Google's bottom-line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One sign that YouTube executives are prepared to start making
compromises is that it has agreed for Disney to test pre-roll
advertising on short-form content. YouTube founders Chad Hurley
and Steve Chen have in the past said that pre-roll advertising
would harm the popularity of its service as its videos are
short-form.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Mar 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled a new generation of Intel Xeon processor
5500 series-based System x(TM) servers and software that enable customers
to more easily roll out virtualized computing and significantly reduce
growing operating costs with higher performance, simplified management
and increased utilization.

    With the new systems, IBM engineers addressed key challenges in today's
data center, where hefty costs for power usage and IT management pile-up,
while processors sit idle or under-utilized. To help enable a more dynamic
infrastructure, IBM's four new x86 rack servers and blades feature unique
designs -- such as lower wattage requirements -- that can slash energy
costs up to 93 percent.(1) At the same time, the new System x servers
boast double the compute performance in some models, and support more
memory, storage and I/O to help customers of all sizes ease the
transition to highly efficient virtualized computing resources. System x
blades and racks lead the industry with 96GB to 1TB memory options.

    "The world is going through changes that require IT professionals in every
industry to consolidate, virtualize and support a variety of different
platforms -- a mix of operating systems, hardware, middleware and
applications. And there is no one-size-fits-all solution for most
businesses," said Adalio Sanchez, general manager, IBM System x. "Not only
do these announcements continue our strong commitment to invest in and
deliver leading x86 servers that address our customer's needs, System x
supports multiple architectures and is designed to lower ownership costs
and enable new paradigms such as Cloud computing."

    In addition to hardware innovations, IBM announced new management software
to complement Systems Director 6.1, which enables clients to automatically
manage virtual and physical assets across platforms. IBM Power Systems,
System z, storage and non-IBM x86 servers are all supported, with a
potential cost savings in management costs of up to 44 percent.

    "VMware and IBM have worked closely together for many years to leverage
each others' expertise to increase IT efficiency, control and choice for
our customers," said Brian Byun, vice president of global alliances at
VMware. "With unique scale-up capacity supporting up to 96 cores and the
ability to use up to 1 TB of memory, IBM's System x servers complement
VMware's upcoming next-generation VMware vSphere family of products and
are an excellent choice for customers deploying private cloud
environments."

    New IBM Servers: Lower Ownership Costs Through Innovation

    This new generation of System x technology maximizes the power and
performance with a new generation of intelligent server processors -- the
Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processor 5500 series.

    IBM BladeCenter HS22

    A no-compromise blade with breakneck speed, the two-socket IBM BladeCenter
HS22 offers outstanding performance, flexible configuration options and
simple management in an efficient server designed to run a broad range of
workloads. Among other features, the completely revamped HS22 features
three times as much memory as its predecessor, which allows the HS22 to
process twice as many transactions per minute. In fact, customers can
achieve as high as a 11-to-1 consolidation ratio migrating older rack and
blade servers onto HS22 blades, while saving over 93 percent in energy
costs alone.(1) In addition, two hot-swap internal storage bays offer
customers a choice of SAS, SATA, or solid state options. The HS22 offers
best-in-class reliability and is fully compatible with all BladeCenter
enterprise and office chassis, protecting the investments customers have
already made in BladeCenter.

    IBM System x3650 M2 and x3550 M2

    Built with all-new, energy-smart designs to simplify power distribution
and reduce energy loss, these two-socket enterprise servers feature lower
wattage, highly efficient power supplies exceeding the "80 Plus Gold"
standard, counter-rotating fans, altimeters, and advanced power
management. These innovations translate into reducing energy consumption
and lowering annual energy costs for a single enterprise class data
center.(2) They also feature outstanding performance delivering computing
speeds up to 6.4GT/s, design redundancy and unique security options.

    IBM System x iDataPlex dx360 M2

    The iDataPlex dx360 M2 is specifically designed for data centers that
require high performance, yet are constrained on floor space, power and
cooling infrastructure. The dx360 M2 provides up to five times the compute
density versus 1U rack servers in the data center, and can cool the data
center 70 percent more efficiently with the Rear Door Heat Exchanger. One
of the new generation of System x and BladeCenter servers, the dx360 M2
significantly reduces operational costs, is simple to manage, and is
pre-integrated for rapid scaling to solve today's IT business challenges.

    As testament to the computing power of the new iDataPlex dx360 M2, the
University of Toronto's SciNet Consortium will be using the new system,
along with IBM's advanced POWER6 architecture, to build a system capable
of performing 360 trillion calculations per second. The supercomputer will
pioneer an innovative hybrid design containing two systems that can work
together or independently, connected to a massive five petabyte storage
complex. Because it is a hybrid using IBM's highly efficient iDataPlex
system and POWER6 architecture, the system will be extremely flexible,
capable of running a wide range of software at a high level of
performance.

    "IBM innovations in the server space allow us to scale our business
rapidly, as needed," said Don Goodwin, Latisys executive vice president,
sales and marketing, Fairfax, Va., a leading high-density co-location and
managed hosting company using a mix of IBM blades and iDataPlex scale-out
servers. "The mix of formats provided by System x allows us to support a
wide range of applications and more easily move our enterprise and web
hosting offerings into new markets."

    New Levels of Performance

    IBM's new-generation x86 servers deliver new levels of performance and
efficiency for the enterprise. The System x3650 M2 has posted leadership
2-processor results for SPECPower_ssj2008, the two-tier SAP SD Standard
Application Benchmark and for the VMware VMmark virtualization
benchmark.(3) In addition, the IBM BladeCenter HS22 has posted a
leadership 2-processor result for SPECjbb2005.(4)

    To complement the complete line up of rack, blade and iDataPlex offerings,
IBM will also be releasing new business optimized tower solutions in 2Q.
These towers will meet the challenges of running high performance IT in
the desk side space where security, serviceability, ease of use and
reliability are critical. These new systems make the most of the new
features and performance of the new Intel processor family.

    Systems Management Leadership

    IBM today also announced key system management upgrades designed to
complement its new generation of x86 systems and help IT managers
orchestrate the unique workload demands of modern businesses.

    IBM Systems Director 6.1

    The new IBM Systems Director 6.1 provides powerful tools for managing both
physical and virtual resources and features an easy-to-use, web-based
interface with integrated wizards/tutorials, such as Systems Director
Active Energy Manager. It delivers broad cross-platform support including
IBM Power Systems, System z, storage and non-IBM x86 servers, with a
potential cost savings that can reach 34.5 percent for Windows servers and
43.8 percent for Linux x86 servers.

    Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)

    IBM is offering next-generation BIOS -- the Unified Extensible Firmware
Interface (UEFI) -- to provide a consistent BIOS across its portfolio and
to allow for more detailed remote-configuration options.

    Integrated Management Module (IMM)

    The Integrated Management Module (IMM) combines diagnostics, virtual
presence and remote control to manage, monitor, troubleshoot and repair
from any corner of the world. Its standards-based alerting also enables
"out-of-the-box" integration into enterprise management environments and
provides a single firmware stack for all IMM based systems.

    IBM ToolsCenter

    The IBM ToolsCenter initiative simplifies the acquisition and usage of
single system management tools with a single webpage to acquire tools. It
establishes a common look and feel across the entire tool set, which
maximizes efficiency and reduces training cost. The latest addition to the
ToolsCenter portfolio, IBM bootable media creator is used to create custom
bootable media (CD, DVD or USB key) with updates for clients' systems.

    Express Models for Midsize Businesses

    IBM is also introducing "Express" models of three systems that are
designed for midsize companies. Two rack-mounted servers, the System
x3650 M2 Express and x3550 M2 Express, deliver twice the virtualization
performance and use up to 60 percent less power than previous
generations. The new IBM BladeCenter HS22 Express is a versatile,
easy-to-use blade optimized for performance and energy efficiency. The
HS22 is two times faster than previous IBM blades and offers
best-in-class reliability, availability and serviceability.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs investment banker Byron Trott, the rare Wall Street dealmaker who gained the trust of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, is leaving to start his own merchant banking firm, a person familiar with the situation said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trott, a vice chairman in Goldman's investment banking division and head of its Chicago office, intends to raise a merchant banking fund that could swell to $2 billion. The Chicago-based business will be named BDT Capital Partners, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trott, 50, will focus on family owned and entrepreneurial companies, investing capital and providing advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trott gained fame playing the coveted role of serving as adviser to Berkshire Hathaway, helping the acquisitive Buffett through a series of deals. On more than once occasion, Buffett praised Trott in his letters and meetings with Berkshire shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other deals, Trott last year convinced Buffett to help finance Mars Inc's $23 billion takeover of Wm. Wrigley  Co, invest $3 billion in General Electric Co and buy $5 billion of Goldman Sachs preferred stock during last autumn's financial panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trott's departure comes as a parade of bankers leave big Wall Street firms to join boutique firms or companies that are not subject to compensation limits set by the U.S. government. Big banks have also shed thousands of jobs in the past year as the prolonged credit crisis puts the brakes on deal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman in particular has seen several senior bankers decamp, including media banker Joseph Ravitch, who earlier this month announced plans to leave. Energy banker William Wicker last month said he would jump to Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in February, Suzanne Donohoe, who ran Goldman's asset management international unit, left to join Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM led dozens of tech companies in calling on Monday for open standards to promote "cloud" computing, a fledgling technology the industry hopes will drive growth over the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rival Microsoft Corp dismissed the effort, accusing International Business Machines Corp of seeking to exert control of the field, while cloud-computing pioneers Amazon.com Inc and Google Inc, Salesforce.com Inc were conspicuously absent from a list of companies endorsing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cloud computing" -- one of the hottest buzz words in Silicon Valley -- refers to a variety of ways in which technology companies offer services over the Web from remote data centers, seemingly from the cloud of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBM-led resolution -- dubbed the Open Cloud Manifesto -- calls for making cloud computing products compatible with each other to boost their appeal to businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies are generally reluctant to adopt proprietary new technologies where they feel locked into one provider out of concern they won't have the option to switch to another vendor if things go sour or better options arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not that everything is going to be perfectly compatible, but it is going to be somewhat similar so that you can move from one vendor to another. It gives businesses the comfort level they need to buy," said Stephen O'Grady, an analyst with technology research firm RedMonk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tech industry is under pressure to encourage businesses to adopt cloud computing technologies, which could help them save money by outsourcing part of their IT operations to mega-data centers that can achieve huge economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides issues of compatibility, companies worry about the security implications of storing information at remote computer centers and moving it across the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech researcher Gartner Inc estimates that the market for cloud-based business software, computing services and storage from companies including Salesforce.com Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft and IBM will total about $10 billion this year. That's just a fraction of the $223 billion that Gartner is projecting for the business software market alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM sees the manifesto as a first step toward establishing specific standards so customers can confidently switch between cloud-computing providers, said Irving Wladawski-Berger, chairman emeritus of the IBM Academy of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Grady of RedMonk expects that some of the standards would focus on security areas such as data protection and identity verification, alleviating some of the biggest concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backers of the manifesto include ATT Corp., Cisco Systems Inc, EMC Corp, Novell Inc, Red Hat Inc, Sun Microsystems Inc and VMware Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Amazon said her company was reviewing the document. A Google spokesman said his company decided not to support the manifesto, but did not give a reason. A spokesman for Salesforce.com could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft vocally criticized IBM's role in drafting the manifesto, saying Microsoft was only asked to sign on at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears to us that one company or just a few companies would prefer to control the evolution of cloud computing, as opposed to reaching a consensus across key stakeholders (including cloud users) through an 'open' process," Microsoft executive Steven Martin said in a blog posting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wladawski-Berger at IBM said his company was one of the key leaders of the project, but that other organizers included Google. He added that he was surprised Google decided not to sign the document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that he believed Microsoft and IBM would eventually work out their differences over the emerging standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been around for a long time. There are always food fights at the beginning," he said. "This will get worked out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Jason Szep)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *IBM leads dozens of companies in seeking 'open' cloud&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *Microsoft says IBM seeks to control evolution of new tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, March 30 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) led dozens of tech
companies in calling on Monday for open standards to promote
"cloud" computing, a fledgling technology the industry hopes
will drive growth over the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) dismissed the effort,
accusing International Business Machines Corp of seeking to
exert control of the field, while cloud-computing pioneers
Amazon.com Inc, Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Salesforce.com Inc were
conspicuously absent from a list of companies endorsing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cloud computing" -- one of the hottest buzz words in

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Dutch navigation device maker TomTom NV said on Monday they had reached a settlement after more than a year of squabbling over software patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, both companies had sued the other, claiming patent infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of a five-year agreement, Microsoft said TomTom will pay Microsoft for use of the eight car navigation and file management system patents in the case Microsoft brought against TomTom, while Microsoft will be able to use the four patents included in the TomTom countersuit without any payment to TomTom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TomTom confirmed there was a settlement but declined further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company in February sued in federal court in its home state of Washington and petitioned the U.S. International Trade Commission claiming TomTom -- which makes portable navigation devices for cars and mapping software for handheld computers -- breached eight of its patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the patents involved in the case related to innovations in car navigation technology and other computing functionality that Microsoft has licensed to other companies, such as TomTom's rival Garmin Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TomTom countersued in the U.S. District Court for the eastern district of Virginia, earlier this month, claiming Microsoft violated a number of its patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares slightly pared losses after the announcement, down 3.9 percent at $17.43 in a broad market decline. Ahead of the settlement announcement, TomTom shares closed at 3.413 euros in Amsterdam, down 7.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, Exxon bid $85.2 million for 18 blocks in the Marcellus, a large shale formation that runs through parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, was the high bidder on six Marcellus blocks, paying a total of $22.4 million for acreage in Tioga and Lycoming counties in Pennsylvania, company spokesman Patrick McGinn, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recent technological advances, the natural gas trapped in shale was considered too expensive or difficult to retrieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, processes like hydraulic fracturing are used.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) investment banker Byron Trott, the rare Wall Street deal
maker who gained the trust of billionaire investor Warren
Buffett, is leaving to start his own merchant banking firm, a
person familiar with the situation said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Trott, a vice chairman in Goldman's investment banking
division and head of its Chicago office, intends to raise a
merchant banking fund that could swell to $2 billion. The
Chicago-based business will be named BDT Capital Partners, the
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trott, 50, will focus on family owned and entrepreneurial
companies, investing capital and providing advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trott gained fame playing the coveted role of serving as
adviser to Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), helping the acquisitive
Buffett through a series of deals. On more than once occasion,
Buffett praised Trott in his letters and meetings with
Berkshire shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among other deals, Trott last year convinced Buffett to
help finance Mars Inc's $23 billion takeover of Wm. Wrigley 
Co, invest $3 billion in General Electric Co (GE.N) and buy $5
billion of Goldman Sachs preferred stock during last autumn's
financial panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trott's departure comes as a parade of bankers leave big
Wall Street firms to join boutique firms or companies that are
not subject to compensation limits set by the U.S. government.
Big banks have also shed thousands of jobs in the past year as
the prolonged credit crisis puts the brakes on deal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman in particular has seen several senior bankers
decamp, including media banker Joseph Ravitch, who earlier this
month announced plans to leave. Energy banker William Wicker
last month said he would jump to Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also in February, Suzanne Donohoe, who ran Goldman's asset
management international unit, left to join Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts  Co.

SAN ANTONIO--(Business Wire)--
Janice Zhang and Austin West received Best in Fair awards today at the 2009
ExxonMobil Texas Science and Engineering Fair. Zhang and West`s projects were
selected from among more than 1,100 as the best in the state, in the senior and
junior division respectively. The 23rd annual competition, which concluded with
today`s awards ceremony, began on March 27. 

During the awards, more than $50,000 in scholarships were presented to
outstanding competitors. Students competed in two divisions - junior (grades six
through eight) and senior (grades nine through 12) - and each project was
assigned to one of the fair`s 19 categories. Awards were given to first through
fourth place winners in each category, and Grand Prize and Best in Fair projects
in each division. Senior division Grand Prize winners, including Zhang, received
all-expense paid trips to the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair
(ISEF) May 10-15 in Reno, Nev. The top 10 percent of competitors in the junior
division qualified to participate in the Discovery Channel Young Scientists
Challenge. 

"The ExxonMobil Texas Science and Engineering Fair brings together some of the
best and brightest young minds in the state and we are proud to sponsor it each
year," said Truman Bell, senior program officer for education and diversity,
ExxonMobil Foundation. "This competition provides students with a forum in which
to sharpen the research and critical thinking skills that are vital to their
academic success. Whether they become professors, scientists or engineers, these
young people will find solutions for the challenges we will face in the future,
and we are excited to support them on their path to those goals." 

For the ninth consecutive year, ExxonMobil served as the title sponsor of the
state-level competition, which is hosted by The University of Texas at San
Antonio (UTSA) and the Texas Science Careers Consortium. ExxonMobil`s grant of
$75,000 supported not only the fair, but also a diversity recruitment
initiative, which aids qualifying minority students with project and travel
expenses that might otherwise prevent them from competing. 

"We are proud to host this competition once again and we`re thankful to
ExxonMobil for their ongoing support of math and science education," said Dr.
Stuart Birnbaum, associate professor, UTSA and executive director of the
ExxonMobil Texas Science and Engineering Fair. "Each student who participated
this year put forth a great deal of effort and ingenuity and that hard work is
apparent in the quality of projects that were presented here. Congratulations to
this year`s winners and we look forward to seeing the innovative projects our
competitors will bring to the fair next year." 

Students qualified for the state fair by placing first, second or third in one
of 13 regional fairs throughout Texas. Each regional fair is sanctioned by
Science Service, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the
understanding and appreciation of science among people of all ages. 

Special awards were presented to projects in both divisions by nonprofit and
professional organizations, including: National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), National Society of Professional Engineers, Northrop
Grumman, Society of American Military Engineers, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S.
Surgeon General, and the U.S. Water Environment Federation.

&lt;p&gt; * Parties settle dispute after more than a year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft says TomTom to make payments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Financial details of settlement not disclosed
 (Adds background on dispute, share prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, March 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and
Dutch navigation device maker TomTom NV (TOM2.AS) said on
Monday they had reached a settlement after more than a year of
squabbling over software patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the last few weeks, both companies had sued the other,
claiming patent infringement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the terms of a five-year agreement, Microsoft said
TomTom will pay Microsoft for use of the eight car navigation
and file management system patents in the case Microsoft
brought against TomTom, while Microsoft will be able to use the
four patents included in the TomTom countersuit without any
payment to TomTom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TomTom confirmed there was a settlement but declined
further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Specific financial terms of the agreement were not
disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company in February sued in
federal court in its home state of Washington and petitioned
the U.S. International Trade Commission claiming TomTom --
which makes portable navigation devices for cars and mapping
software for handheld computers -- breached eight of its
patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said the patents involved in the case related to
innovations in car navigation technology and other computing
functionality that Microsoft has licensed to other companies,
such as TomTom's rival Garmin Ltd (GRMN.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TomTom countersued in the U.S. District Court for the
eastern district of Virginia, earlier this month, claiming
Microsoft violated a number of its patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares slightly pared losses after the
announcement, down 3.9 percent at $17.43 in a broad market
decline. Ahead of the settlement announcement, TomTom shares
closed at 3.413 euros in Amsterdam, down 7.2 percent.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Mar 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The JPMorgan Chase Foundation today announced a grant of $605,000 to
provide critical early literacy, math and science resources for public
school students across the country on DonorsChoose.org. The funds will
support 1,500 public school classrooms and 39,000 students, most of whom
attend schools in low-income communities, through DonorsChoose.org -- a
nonprofit website connecting donors with specific classroom needs in
public schools.

    "The JPMorgan Chase Foundation is proud to sponsor this grant, which was
initiated by a bank program that donated a portion of debit-card purchases
to benefit schools," said Mark Rigdon, VP, Director of Global
Philanthropic Strategy and Programs at JPMorgan Chase Foundation.
"DonorsChoose.org is one more innovative way we are tackling educational
challenges in the community. It helps provide the literacy, math and
science resources that students nationwide need to be successful in
school and life."

    The $605,000 grant represents funds that had been designated for public
schools through a debit-card program of Washington Mutual Bank, which
JPMorgan Chase acquired in September 2008.

    DonorsChoose.org's focus on providing low-income students with the
resources they need to succeed makes the organization a natural partner
for JPMorgan Chase Foundation.

    "DonorsChoose.org is thrilled that the JPMorgan Chase Foundation has
demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to improving our public schools,"
said Charles Best, Founder and CEO of DonorsChoose.org. "The JPMorgan
Chase Foundation family is undoubtedly an invaluable ally in our campaign
to expand educational opportunity. With this generous gift,
DonorsChoose.org will bring to life hundreds of early literacy, math and
science classroom projects."

    About the JPMorgan Chase Foundation

    The mission of the JPMorgan Chase Foundation -- the philanthropic arm of
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. -- is to "Build vibrant, sustainable communities in
our markets across the globe that support, engage, and enrich the lives of
children, youth, and families." The mission comes to life through
investments in programs that focus on Community Development, Education and
Arts &amp; Culture. Through its education investments, the Foundation seeks to
ensure that all children, particularly those from disadvantaged
backgrounds, have access to high quality educational opportunities.

    About DonorsChoose.org

    Founded in 2000, DonorsChoose.org is a nonprofit website where public
school teachers describe specific educational projects for their students,
and donors can choose the projects they want to support. After completing
a project, the donor hears back from the classroom they supported in the
form of photographs and student thank-you letters.

    To date, 88,000 public and charter school teachers have used the site to
secure funding for $30.3 million in books, art supplies, technology, and
other resources that their students need to learn. Through
www.DonorsChoose.org, individuals from all walks of life have helped 1.8
million students from low-income families.

&lt;p&gt;LG to Preload the MySpace Mobile App on the Next-Generation of Windows Phones

World`s Premier Social Portal Works With Microsoft to Launch Open Source Kit for
Silverlight Developers
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
MySpace, the world`s premier social portal, today announced support for
Microsoft Windows Mobile and Microsoft Silverlight. The new MySpace mobile
application, available this summer, will run on Windows phones and utilize
Silverlight, Microsoft Corp`s free browser plug-in that powers rich Internet
application (RIA) experiences, into the MySpace Open Platform. 

"We are pleased to bring MySpace users the benefits and flexibility of
Microsoft`s platforms," said Aber Whitcomb, chief technology officer of MySpace.
"Our relationship enables app developers to use Silverlight to create engaging
MySpace apps and allows Windows Mobile users to have a more personal MySpace
experience on their phone." 

Today`s news is in conjunction with the CTIA Wireless 2009 in Las Vegas from
April 1-3 and the Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco March 31-April 3. MySpace and
Microsoft will present a session at the Web 2.0 Expo on Silverlight on the
MySpace Open Platform. The 50 minute session will take place on Thursday, April
2nd at 1:30pm PT and will focus on how developers can build Silverlight
applications on MySpace using the jointly released Open Source kit for
Silverlight. 

Windows phones + MySpace

The companies are in close collaboration to offer a MySpace for Windows Mobile
application which will be available for download later this summer. The
application is fully optimized with a user-friendly interface and will deliver
rich content and data to MySpace users on the go. It integrates MySpace`s main
social features and functionality with the Windows operating system to provide
access to the community in a way that`s familiar to the Windows Mobile user. 

"Talking to family, sending pictures and connecting with long-lost friends is
important to our customers, and we are giving them the option to do that on the
go by teaming up with MySpace," said Stephanie Ferguson, general manager
Business Experiences Team, in the Mobile Communications Business at Microsoft
Corp. "MySpace is a pioneer in the social networking space, and the MySpace
application will be a tremendous asset to the collection of applications you can
access on your Windows phone." 

The MySpace application will be available on Windows Mobile 6.1 phones later
this summer and then in the fall of 2009 through the Windows Marketplace for
Mobile, directly through phones, and the Web. LG will preload the MySpace
application on their Windows phones, making it even easier than ever for users
to gain real-time access to their global MySpace network. The new Windows phones
are expected to be available in the second half of 2009. 

Through this relationship, MySpace is further committed to mobile as a central
element of the MySpace global business strategy. Today`s news also further
solidifies MySpace`s leadership role in the market establishing a unique
position for the company in providing applications for all major smart phone
device platforms including iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Sidekick, Palm, Nokia,
and now Windows Mobile. MySpace has more than 20 million worldwide mobile users.


Silverlight + MySpace

The introduction of Silverlight into the MySpace Open Platform empowers MySpace
developers with more freedom and flexibility to design OpenSocial applications
using the tools and technology they want. Silverlight and the MySpace Open
Platform will enable developers to rapidly create and deliver sophisticated
MySpace applications with a custom look and feel through the flexible skinning
of controls and data. 

Microsoft and MySpace have released an Open Source kit that makes it easy to
develop OpenSocial applications using Silverlight that run on the MySpace Open
Platform. To learn about this kit and how designers and developers can use it to
create interactive, engaging apps on MySpace, please visit
http://www.myspace.com/silverlightonmyspace, and read the blog post about
MySpace`s support of Silverlight at developer.myspace.com. 

"Microsoft is pleased to work with MySpace to enable developers to create
compelling and custom OpenSocial applications using Silverlight," said Brian
Goldfarb, director of the developer platform group at Microsoft. "By utilizing
the Open Source kit released by Microsoft and MySpace, developers can now
harness the power of the rich media features in Silverlight to take the user
experience to a new level for the MySpace community."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) last year paid a combined $58 million to Co-President
Jon Winkelried and General Counsel Gregory Palm, buying out two
top executives suffering from a severe cash crunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Proxy documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission Friday also showed that Chief Executive Lloyd
Blankfein and other officers, though forgoing 2008 bonuses,
received substantial returns from exclusive investment funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman disclosed it purchased employee fund interests from
Palm for $38.3 million and from Winkelried for $19.7 million to
help them "meet their liquidity needs," a Goldman spokesman
said. Without those deals, two of the bank's largest
stockholders may have raised cash through stock sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Neither we nor the executives involved thought it was in
the interest of the firm for them to sell shares in an
extraordinarily turbulent market," a spokesman said. "We
thought it would send the wrong signals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winkelried, 49, is the second-largest individual Goldman
stockholder at 2.8 million shares, according to the proxy. Palm
is the third-largest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winkelried cashed out roughly 30 percent of his employee
fund holdings, while Palm sold 25 percent. Goldman chose which
stakes it wanted and negotiated the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision to buy the executives out was made in early
September, before Goldman accepted $10 billion in government
funds, the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speculation has swirled about the circumstances surrounding
Winkelried, 49, since the veteran trading and investment
banking executive placed a Nantucket, Massachusetts, estate on
the market last fall for $55 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, Goldman announced that Winkelried would retire,
effective Tuesday. There was market talk that Winkelried, who
also owns a house in Short Hills, New Jersey, and a horse ranch
in Colorado, had been squeezed by falling investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPECIAL POOLS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These unusual internal dealings shined a spotlight on
Goldman's investment pools, which let employees participate in
Goldman's merchant banking, venture capital, real estate and
other funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proxy said shares in 2008 funds were purchased by
Goldman for the same amount executives put in. Shares in
private equity and hedge funds were bought at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman explained that it offers up to $500,000 of
financing to each employee across all funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said last year it continued to provide loans to
officers, spouses and affiliates who invested in vintage 2000
funds that offered a fixed return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, Goldman offered to buy out fund stakes
to provide cash for employees whose money was tied up in
long-term investments, such as Goldman's Whitehall real estate
fund. Buyouts were made at an undisclosed discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STILL WEALTHY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late last year, Goldman's top executives announced their
decision to give up all cash and stock bonuses in response to
public outrage over Wall Street compensation amid the mounting
cost of the bailout, rising unemployment and slowing economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet the proxy also showed that Goldman's partners and top
executives still received lucrative returns from these employee
funds, offered under favorable terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein received $11.3 million of distributions from
these funds last year, while Winkelried received nearly $5
million. Palm received $10.9 million while Gary Cohn, soon to
be Goldman's sole president and chief operating officer,
received $7.4 million of distributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such payments are considered investment returns and not
included in annual compensation figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year Winkelried received a cash salary of $600,000,
but no new stock or option awards. The bank said he earned $2.5
million from stock awards granted for prior years. Compensation
overall fell to $3.4 million from $71.5 million a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the bank's $5 billion preferred stock investment
from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N),
Winkelried as a top executive officer can sell no more than 10
percent of his Goldman stock. These limits apply even in
retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Executive pay has become a lightening rod since the U.S.
government stepped in to bail out the banking system last fall.
Goldman in October received $10 billion of capital from the
U.S. Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program,
though the money came with executive pay caps.

&lt;p&gt;  PITTSBURGH, PA, Mar 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and a group of leading utilities -- the Global
Intelligent Utility Network Coalition -- today announced that they handed
over stewardship of their Smart Grid Maturity Model to the Carnegie
Mellon(R) Software Engineering Institute (SEI). As progressive utilities
around the globe modernize power grids with digital technology,
executives want to know that making the grid smarter is the right thing
to do and they want to know how to do it.

    The electric grid is the largest and most complex machine in the world and
in places it is now critically overburdened. Impacts of climate change,
available technology, and the current economic crisis represent the final
tipping point for a much needed overhaul. The Smart Grid Maturity Model
will serve as a strategic framework for utilities, vendors, regulators,
and consumers that have a role in smart grid transformation -- from
technological to regulatory to organizational.

    According to the U.S. Department of Energy, if the North American grid
were just 5% more efficient, the energy savings would equate to
eliminating the fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from 53
million cars -- one of the reasons that the DoE is supporting this effort
through its Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability and the
National Energy Technology Laboratory. Support of the Smart Grid Maturity
Model by DoE enables it to be accessible to all stakeholders of the
electric power industry.

    "The software development industry is a prime example of how maturity
models have moved entire industries forward," said Guido Bartels, General
Manager, Global Energy &amp; Utilities Industry at IBM. "We selected SEI
because of its demonstrated success in providing frameworks that enhance
business and technical processes, security, resiliency and
interoperability -- all critical elements in responding to opportunities
driving the sustainable supply and use of energy essential today."

    Part of the global research university Carnegie Mellon, the SEI operates
at the leading edge of technical innovation. It serves as a national and
international resource for architecture, network security, process
improvement, and systems integration. The SEI has developed worldwide de
facto standards, like the Capability Maturity Model(R) Integration (CMMI)
and led international efforts to improve network security through its
world-recognized CERT(R) program.

    "We are excited to be part of this new frontier technology," said Paul
Nielsen, CEO and director of the SEI. "The Smart Grid Maturity Model
developed by IBM creates a roadmap of activities, investments, and best
practices that leads to creating a smart grid. Utilities using the model
will be able to establish the appropriate development path, communicate
the strategy and vision, and assess current opportunities."

    To stimulate, guide, and support efforts and investments in smart grids,
the SEI will assume primary responsibility for the ongoing governance,
growth and evolution of the model. In order to support widespread adoption
and use, the SEI will ensure availability of the model and supporting
materials and services for the user community; maintain consistency of its
application, validity, and results; and analyze and provide feedback on
its use, value and impact for stakeholders.

    Tom Standish, group president of Regulated Operations, CenterPoint Energy,
encourages every utility to participate in the Smart Grid Maturity Model
survey. "It provides insights into where you are on your smart grid
journey and what milestone objectives to set to achieve the benefits of
smart grid -- for both customers and business," said Standish.

    In addition to the SEI activities, the World Energy Council (WEC) will be
a channel for global dissemination, participation and adoption of the
model using its worldwide network of member committees.

    IBM initially led the development of the model in collaboration with the
Global Intelligent Utility Network Coalition and with support from
American Productivity &amp; Quality Center (APQC). More than 40 utilities
worldwide have participated in the model to date, representing 100
million customers of utilities across the globe. A key function of the
Smart Grid Maturity Model tool is to gauge advancements made in Smart
Grids and show returns on investments. This function allows it to be well
positioned to have a role in procedures being implemented in support of
the U.S. efforts to modernize the power grid. The model offers observable
indicators to measure progress, and helps facilitate the development and
execution of smart grid programs.

&lt;p&gt;March 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs replaced railroad
operator Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) with Burlington Northern
Santa Fe BNI.N on Americas buy list, citing Burlington's
attractive valuation and "best-in-class" intermodal franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage downgraded Union Pacific to "neutral" from
"buy" based on the company's industry-worst quarter-to-date
volume declines, balanced by its ability to control costs and
strong pricing outlook for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Burlington Northern Santa Fe is taking share from Union
Pacific," analyst David Feinberg wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The intermodal agreement with JB Hunt Transport Services
(JBHT.O) will give Burlington a structural advantage when
volumes pick up, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst -- who forecast a 13.3 percent decline in 2009
industry volumes, wider than his previous view of a 10.8
percent decline -- however, said U.S. railroads are on track
for recovery in the second half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the worst rate of decline on record, railroads
should be able to maintain base pricing power of 4.3 percent in
2009, driven by prices of existing contracts and falling fuel
prices, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Burlington Northern were down more than 2 percent
at $60.35, while those of Union Pacific fell about 5 percent to
$40.94 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For more on price target changes, double-click on

&lt;p&gt;Desktone Executive Selected as Featured Speaker
CHELMSFORD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Desktone, Inc., provider of the first platform that enables hosted virtual
desktops as an outsourced subscription service, announced that it will be a
featured speaker at the 2009 Sys-Con 5th International Virtualization Conference
and Expo, being held at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City, March 30-April 1,
2009. 

Desktone`s senior director of strategic development, Jeff Fisher, will address
attendees on April 1 at 3:45pm during his session, "Cloud-hosted Desktops: The
Smart, Low-Risk Way to Enter the Cloud." He will explore how consuming desktops
as a service (DaaS) via the cloud enables enterprises to keep their data secure
within their own infrastructure while reaping the cloud`s cost and flexibility
benefits. The topic of cloud-hosted desktops will also be discussed by Carl
Kraenzel, Distinguished Engineering at IBM, in "Smarter Work with Desktop Clouds
in the Mobile Enterprise" on March 31 at 2:20pm. 

"For many people, enterprise cloud computing connotes a combination of server
virtualization and hosting. However, there are considerable obstacles with this
server-side approach, the most critical of which are the location and security
of data," said Fisher. "Cloud-hosted desktops, on the other hand, are a
low-risk/high-reward proposition. Not only are desktop workloads easier to move
to the cloud, they don`t require moving sensitive data. I`m pleased to be able
to explore the concept of cloud-hosted desktops at this important Sys-Con
conference, and discuss why it`s a smart way for enterprises to enter to cloud."


Desktone is a pioneer in cloud-hosted desktops. Its Virtual-D Platform, which is
uniquely designed along two tiers (enterprise and service provider), lets
enterprises maintain ownership and control over their Windows OS images,
applications and all relating licensing while outsourcing the physical data
center infrastructure powering their virtual desktops to service provider
partners, such as IBM. This dramatically reduces enterprise desktop TCO and
transforms virtual desktop infrastructure costs from CAPEX to OPEX. 

The Sys-Con Fifth International Virtualization Conference and Expo East is the
leading virtualization event of the year, attracting key thought leaders in the
field of infrastructure and pioneers of virtualization technologies. For more
information, visit www.virtualizationconference.com. 

About Desktone

Desktone, Inc. provides the industry`s first virtual desktop hosting platform,
enabling desktops to be delivered as an outsourced subscription service. The
Desktone Virtual-D Platform integrates all required technologies into a single,
automated, self-service platform. By enabling desktops as a service, Desktone
simplifies large-scale desktop provisioning and management, transforms virtual
desktop infrastructure costs from CAPEX to OPEX, provides greater protection of
physical resources and corporate information, and increases business agility-all
of which reduces desktop total cost of ownership. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;March 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added Gap Inc (GPS.N) to
its conviction buy list and said it expects sales trends,
particularly at the apparel company's Old Navy division, to
improve in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Analyst Michelle Tan said Gap made a major mistake in
merchandise last year by trying to reposition the Old Navy
brand as a "fast fashion" type retailer aimed at 20-year olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, this year, improvements in spring product offering
and a new marketing campaign should help drive sales at Old
Navy, said the analyst, who raised her price target on the
stock to $15 from $14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gap, which operates the Banana Republic, Old Navy, and its
namesake stores, will also benefit as "apparel spending appears
to be at least temporarily stabilizing," Tan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $13.06 Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  CHELMSFORD, MA, Mar 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Aspect, a unified communications (UC) solutions provider, today announced
that it has marked the one-year anniversary of its global strategic
alliance with Microsoft Corp. Since launching the strategic alliance in
March 2008, Aspect has achieved many significant milestones, including
delivering new product offerings, launching a UC Services practice,
garnering extensive Microsoft certifications, managing a leading-edge
rollout of Microsoft(R) Office Communications Server 2007 Release 2 across
Aspect, and winning new UC customers. Together, the two companies have
been focused on their shared vision of software-powered UC to help
organizations address their communications needs across the enterprise and
in the contact center.

    "The Microsoft-Aspect alliance, and Microsoft's equity investment in
Aspect, is a strong, joint commitment to UC, and to connecting the
enterprise and the contact center," said Melanie Turek, industry
principal, Frost &amp; Sullivan. "Such alliances are critical for customers
and companies that want to quickly leverage a UC strategy to streamline
their business processes with communications. With Microsoft Office
Communications Server 2007 Release 2 and the Aspect(R) Unified IP(TM)
Microsoft .NET-based platform product, companies can seamlessly bring UC
to the enterprise and to the contact center."

    Working closely with Microsoft, Aspect met a number of key milestones
throughout the year, including:


--  Aspect launched a UC Services practice and secured an early customer
    win with Quicken Loans Inc. Aspect's UC Services practice helps
    organizations identify the right opportunities for UC across the enterprise
    to improve business and communications processes and navigate
    implementation obstacles. The UC Services practice completed its first
    deployment of a UC RapidStart voice pilot at Quicken Loans Inc. The Aspect
    UC Services team worked closely with the Quicken Loans IT teams to install
    and configure Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 and integrate its
    voice capabilities into the PBX system in less than one week.

--  Aspect introduced Aspect Unified IP 6.6 with the new Ask an Expert
    feature that utilizes the instant messaging and presence technology
    available in Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007. With this
    feature, agents can identify available experts in the enterprise based on
    specific skill sets to address customer inquiries, therefore streamlining
    business processes and improving first-call resolution.  This is the first
    of several Aspect product releases on the roadmap as part of the Aspect-
    Microsoft strategic alliance that will provide tight platform-level
    integration with Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007.

--  Aspect initiates global company deployment of Office Communications
    Server 2007 R2. To date, Aspect has completed deployment of Office
    Communications Server 2007 R2 at the company's headquarters in Chelmsford,
    Mass. and an office site in San Jose, Calif. The sites have completely
    migrated to Office Communications Server 2007 R2 for all voice and
    voicemail services, audio and Web conferencing, instant messaging (IM) and
    presence. Aspect also retired its PBX in these locations for all employee
    peer-to-peer and corporate calling services. The company will see
    aggressive ROI numbers, including reduced conference calling costs of
    $75,000 per month and additional cost savings resulting from the company's
    use of session initiation protocol (SIP) Trunking.

--  Aspect is recognized as one of the first voice specialized partners
    for Office Communications Server 2007 R2. Microsoft has certified Aspect as
    a Office Communications Server 2007 Release 2 Voice specialization partner
    for the Microsoft Unified Communications Solutions competency.  Aspect
    received this certification following the successful completion of the
    Microsoft Technology Adoption Program (TAP) internal pilot for Office
    Communication Server 2007 R2 Voice specialization. To date, approximately
    100 Aspect employees have been certified.

--  New companies choose Aspect contact center solution with Microsoft UC.
    Global Crossing recently purchased Aspect Unified IP 6.6 and is deploying
    it across its contact center operations to help improve customer
    communication and satisfaction.  Global Crossing chose Aspect Unified IP
    largely based on Microsoft and Aspect's shared vision of UC and how the
    contact center fits into Global Crossing's enterprise-wide UC initiatives.
    Global Crossing is using Aspect Unified IP for advanced call routing
    capabilities to intelligently transfer callers to the proper agents based
    on their skill sets and customer data gathered by back-end applications.
    The agents use the call blending capabilities to respond to incoming calls
    and customer questions on subscriptions while also using the outbound
    capabilities to increase sales.

--  Three customer briefing centers showcase UC capabilities. Aspect
    opened three customer briefing centers in London, Boston and Singapore.
    These offices now have the capabilities to demonstrate all Aspect unified
    communication applications so customers and prospects can experience first-
    hand the benefits of Microsoft UC and the Aspect UC applications for the
    contact center. The customer briefing centers also offer remote
    demonstration capabilities for access through the Internet and around the
    globe.
    

    
"The Aspect-Microsoft strategic alliance is an excellent way for
companies to take the unified communications journey. Aspect has not just
delivered on its promise of unified communications capabilities for the
contact center and the enterprise, but has also proved its commitment to
giving customers tangible solutions that deliver real results," said
Gurdeep Singh Pall, corporate vice president, Unified Communications
Group at Microsoft Corp. "Joint customer wins with industry leaders such
as Quicken Loans, Inc. and Global Crossing are a testament to this.
Through our alliance, Microsoft and Aspect are making a statement -- that
Aspect's powerful software and services capabilities coupled with
Microsoft unified communications technologies supply the tools a company
needs to see real business results from deploying unified communications."

    As the alliance moves into its second year, the companies will continue to
build momentum in product development and customer implementations. Aspect
and Microsoft will be focused on:


--  Developing additional product offerings to power UC capabilities.
    Aspect will introduce two new Aspect Unified IP releases with additional UC
    functionality as well as two PerformanceEdge(TM) releases offering tighter
    integration to Office Communications Server 2007 R2.

--  Expanding Microsoft UC expertise. Aspect will have 200 fully trained
    and Microsoft UC certified employees by June 2009, including individuals in
    Aspect(R) Professional Services, Aspect(R) Technical Services, Aspect(R)
    Education Services, sales and IT.

--  Completing the global Aspect rollout of Office Communications Server
    2007 R2. Aspect will complete its global rollout of Microsoft Office
    Communications Server to approximately 1,800 workers, including its contact
    center representatives, this year. This will enable Aspect agents to
    identify appropriate experts in the enterprise based on skill set, and
    hence properly and efficiently address customer inquiries.
    

    
"Microsoft and Aspect have successfully achieved a remarkable number
of accomplishments in the first year of the alliance, but we know this is
just the beginning of achieving our shared UC vision," said Jim Foy, chief
executive officer, Aspect. "We're seeing tremendous interest from both
customers and prospects in our new UC applications powered by Aspect
Unified IP and PerformanceEdge, as well as our comprehensive UC Services
offerings. We're confident that as more businesses look for ways to lower
costs and streamline business processes, they'll turn to Microsoft and
Aspect to leverage UC and truly transform the way they communicate."

VoiceCon Orlando 2009, Booth No. 309 -- Polycom, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLCM) and
Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) today announced that the two companies are
deepening their strategic relationship to deliver one of the broadest and
most powerful sets of voice and video solutions for unified
communications and collaboration. As part of Microsoft's vision to
broaden the availability of Microsoft RoundTable, Polycom has licensed
the right to distribute RoundTable, effective April 13, 2009. The
product, renamed the Polycom(R) CX5000 Unified Conference Station, will
be available through Polycom and its extensive channel network.

    Known respectively for innovative collaboration solutions, Microsoft and
Polycom are working together to help customers enhance team communication
and collaboration with voice and video conferencing. As a leader in
telepresence, video and voice communications solutions, Polycom continues
to expand the market for visual communication with a range of new
solutions that will put video conferencing and collaboration capabilities
into general purpose, point-to-point, and multipoint environments. The
CX5000 adds to Polycom's broad portfolio and enables it to address the
video collaboration needs of organizations that rely on Microsoft Office
Communications Server 2007 and Microsoft Office Live Meeting service.

    Originally launched by Microsoft in October 2007, the CX5000 is a
plug-and-play device that connects to a PC through a USB connection, so no
extra provisioning or configuration is needed -- any user can walk into a
conference room, plug in a laptop, and start a meeting. The CX5000 is
designed for enterprises that use Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2007 or
Office Communications Server 2007 and want a simple way to add audio and
visual communication to an Office Live Meeting or Office Communications
Server 2007 session. When used with Office Live Meeting service, or as
part of Office Communications Server 2007, the CX5000 combines content, a
panoramic 360-degree view of the entire meeting room, and a separate view
of the active speaker for a unique and engaging voice and video
experience.

    "Microsoft and Polycom share a long-standing, strategic relationship in
the unified communications space, and we are confident in Polycom's depth
of experience and customer support in the conferencing market," said
Gurdeep Singh Pall, corporate vice president in the Unified
Communications Group at Microsoft. "Our vision to make RoundTable
available to more people in more countries has been realized with the
introduction of the Polycom CX5000 Unified Conferencing Station, and
shows further evidence of Microsoft's commitment to a software platform
that enables device innovation."

    "Our collaboration with Microsoft is a key component of Polycom's vision
to provide our customers with unified communications endpoints that
embody the high quality for which Polycom is known," said Sunil Bhalla,
senior vice president and general manager of Voice Communications
Solutions at Polycom. "With our expertise in enterprise collaboration and
our broad distribution network, it makes perfect sense for us to
incorporate the CX5000 into our family of devices optimized for Microsoft
UC solutions. We look forward to our continued relationship with
Microsoft and the benefits this will bring our joint customers."

    Customers using the device report better daily interaction with
colleagues, as well as significant operational benefits.

    "The University of Kentucky has a very robust IP-based voice and video
network, and Microsoft and Polycom are integral to our communications
strategy," said Doyle Friskney, chief technology officer. "We've been
using RoundTable for real-time communications and information-rich virtual
meetings, and it has helped us streamline operations, improve
productivity, and reduce travel costs significantly and encourage
improved productivity.  As we continue to enhance our UC platform, it
gives us great confidence knowing two companies with innovative
technologies and high quality products that truly make a difference in
our daily interactions are deepening their partnership in this way."

    "IDC's 2009 Top 10 list for Enterprise Networking includes the prediction
that 2009 will become the year of the great enterprise video experiment
which will help businesses do more with less," said Nora Freedman, senior
analyst, Unified Communications Infrastructure, IDC. "The ability for
partners to cross-sell video and voice solutions, as well as leverage
their respective distribution channels, can help to lower the barriers to
entry in an enterprise, which is especially advantageous in this economy."

    Polycom offers a full suite of devices that integrate with Office
Communications Server 2007. Polycom's series of CX phones optimized for
Office Communications Server 2007 includes the CX700 IP telephone, CX200
desktop USB phone and CX100 personal speakerphone. These phones deliver
crystal-clear, wideband audio and provide full, convenient access to the
advanced presence-enabled features of Office Communications Server 2007.
For versatile video communications, Polycom's HDX video endpoints
register, authenticate and share presence information with Office
Communications Server 2007, making it simple for users to launch video
calls by clicking on presence-enabled contacts to see the availability
status of Polycom video and telepresence users. Additionally, Polycom's
RMX 2000(TM) real-time media conferencing platform works with Microsoft
Office Communications Server 2007 R 2, allowing users to launch on-demand
voice, video and unified (voice and video) conferences with other
standards-based video and voice endpoints.

    Availability &amp; Pricing

    The Polycom CX5000 will be available beginning April 13, 2009, at a list
price of U.S. $4,300. The CX5000 will be available in 27 countries through
Polycom's extensive channel partner network and will be available for
shipment in late April. Once the Polycom CX5000 is available, RoundTable
will no longer be sold. Microsoft will continue to support all RoundTable
devices already sold, while Polycom will provide front-line customer
support for CX5000 units sold beginning April13. To learn more about the

&lt;p&gt;- CommVault Simpana 8 Software Provides Dramatic Operational Efficiencies,
Performance Gains, and Wider, More Global Management of Information -
OCEANPORT, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
CommVault (NASDAQ:CVLT):

News Facts

* CommVault has furthered its industry-leading position in heterogeneous and
application data management with enhancements to its support for Microsoft Corp.
data and applications with its new Simpana 8 software. 
* CommVault Simpana 8 software, the major new release of the market-leading
enterprise data management software, includes advances in recovery management,
data reduction, virtual server management, and content organization. 
* CommVault Simpana 8, the only truly singular, unified data management platform
has been tightly integrated with Microsoft`s key applications to provide
superior data and information management for Microsoft Windows Server 2008,
Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Office
SharePoint Server 2007 and Active Directory. Customers can meet a broad spectrum
of their discovery and recovery management requirements while eliminating the
need for myriad point level products. With Simpana 8 software`s tight
integration with Microsoft applications, customers gain significant advantages
in storage management cost reduction, broader functionality and overall
operational efficiency.

Simpana 8 Software Provides a Wide Range of Data Management Benefits to
Microsoft Customers

* Records Management: New heterogeneous Records Management capabilities with the
Records Center site, a key component of Office SharePoint Server 2007. Customers
can leverage the on-line, near-line, and off-line content management
capabilities of Simpana software to enable a heterogeneous Records Management
solution. 
* FAST Integration: Simpana 8 software`s Content Director feature embeds the
powerful Microsoft FAST Indexing Engine to granularly manage data based on
content in Exchange Server 2007, Office SharePoint Server 2007, and Microsoft

attractive price than a comparable dedicated appliance. Further, CommVault`s
unique, end-to-end approach expands the benefits of block-level deduplication
for Exchange Server 2007 and Office SharePoint Server 2007 across all backup and
archive copies within an organization, resulting in cost-efficient scaling and
performance across the entire data management infrastructure. 
* Backup and Recovery and Content Management: CommVault software can now provide
backup, recovery, indexing and search capabilities for Office Communications
Server 2007. 
* Virtualization Management: Simpana 8 software provides additional management
capabilities for Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 R2 and Windows Server 2008 with
Hyper-V technology environments including the ability to restore data backed up
from VMware directly to Hyper-V. 
* Performance Enhancements for Office SharePoint Server 2007: Simpana 8 software
enhances the performance for Office SharePoint Server 2007 data management
including site, granular, and content-indexed data from backups. 
* Discovery Capabilities: Enhanced data mining capabilities for Exchange Server
2007 and Office SharePoint Server 2007 leverage the rich snapshot infrastructure
of Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service.

&lt;p&gt;D2 Offers Private Demos of Its mCUE Converged Communications Software on
Motorola`s MOTOROKR E6 Linux-Based Smartphone at VoiceCon Orlando 2009
ORLANDO, Fla. &amp; SANTA BARBARA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
D2 Technologies, the market leader in embedded IP communications software
platforms, today announced that its mCUE converged mobile communications client
software is now interoperable with IBM Lotus Sametime, today`s most widely
deployed unified communications (UC) platform in the enterprise. Through this
native support, D2`s mCUE achieves increased versatility and better promotes the
use of Linux-based mobile devices in enterprise UC scenarios. In turn, OEMs and
ODMs can now use mCUE`s converged presence-based communications user interface
(CUI) to more quickly develop and introduce to market new mobile devices that
integrate all session types, including cellular voice call, VoIP, IM, SMS and
email messaging. 

The company is staging invitation-only previews at VoiceCon Orlando 2009 that
show mCUE and IBM Lotus Sametime on Motorola`s MOTOROKR E6, one of the earliest
and most successful Linux-based smartphones introduced to market. Conference
attendees interested in arranging a private demonstration of mCUE on the
MOTOROKR E6 should contact D2 directly at marketing@d2tech.com. 

"By demonstrating mCUE`s interoperability with IBM Lotus Sametime on Motorola`s
MOTOROKR E6, we can clearly show customers how it is possible to quickly and
easily bring mobile unified communications to the enterprise," said Doug
Makishima, vice president of marketing and sales at D2 Technologies. "mCUE is a
highly versatile software, configurable to any enterprise environment composed
of UC, IP PBX and FMC systems. In addition to IBM Lotus Sametime, a
vendor-proprietary enterprise communications protocol and service, mCUE supports
several major standardized protocols for VoIP, IM and presence as well as third
party, open-API protocols and services. It gives developers a complete turnkey
solution for developing multi-mode, multi-protocol, multi-service mobile
communication capabilities on Linux, arguably today`s hottest operating system
for mobile devices." 

D2`s mCUE pairs an innovative, patent-pending communications user interface with
the company`s vPort MP VoIP software platform to address the needs of OEMs and
service providers delivering integrated UC and Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC)
functionality. mCUE provides a complete embedded software framework for
multi-mode mobile devices for enterprise, carrier and consumer use, such as
dual-mode Wi-Fi enabled smartphones, WiMAX/3G/4G and Wi-Fi enabled MIDs,
netbooks and home communications hubs. 

Mobile devices with mCUE provide users with advanced presence-based and
push-to-x control of cellular and VoIP calls, PBX feature activation, IM, email,
SMS and other features typically only available on PC-based unified
communications soft clients. Its revolutionary user interface, built on top of a
multi-identity, multi-session, multi-protocol engine, enables flexible
interoperability with multiple communications services such as enterprise IP
PBXs and UC systems, and commercial VoIM services like Google Talk, Yahoo!, MSN,
AIM, and others. It is highly adaptable to any network deployment scenario for
enterprise UC/FMC services or consumer-oriented converged communications
services offered by IMS, pre-IMS or legacy service provider networks.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background and details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone and Dan Wilchins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group
Inc(GS.N) said the two heads of its Global Alpha hedge fund --
which lost about 80 percent of its value between its 2007 peak
and the end of 2008 -- resigned from the bank on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Carhart, 43, and Raymond Iwanowski, 42, ran Global
Alpha and a group that managed the firm's quantitative, or
computer-driven, investments. They are departing along with
research co-head Giorgio De Santis, Goldman Sachs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The departures follow years of disappointing performance at
Global Alpha, whose assets fell to $2.5 billion last year from
a peak of $12 billion in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The poor performance of the fund, once Goldman's flagship
offering, had dragged on Goldman's asset management results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined to comment other than to confirm
that the three had left the company. The departures were
reported first by financial news bog Clusterstock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global Alpha had been Goldman's largest hedge fund before
bad bets in 2006 and volatile markets in 2007 led to steep
losses and waves of client redemptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund continued to struggle last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carhart and Iwanowski will be replaced by Katinka
Domotorffy, most recently head of strategy at Goldman's
quantitative group, a person familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Domotorffy will be assisted by co-chief investment officers
Kent Daniel, Bill Fallon and Robert Jones, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carhart had been head of the quant investment strategies
group and co-chief investment officer with Iwanowski of quant
macro and fixed income strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carhart also was co-chief investment officer, with Jones,
of quant equity strategies, the person familiar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones will continue as lead manager of quant equity
strategies, along with Domotorffy and Daniel, who had been
co-head of research with De Santis, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Domotorffy will be co-head of quant macro and fixed income
strategies with Fallon, the senior portfolio manager of the
group, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quantitative managers use computer models to buy and sell
securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The departures come after two bad years spoiled more than a
decade of success for Carhart and Iwanowski at Goldman Sachs,
which was briefly the world's largest hedge fund manager as
investors clamored to get into Global Alpha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global Alpha was launched in 1995 with just $10 million and
scored big gains for investors over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in 2006 the fund dropped 12 percent on wrong-way bets
on Japanese stocks and positions that depended on a stronger
dollar and a drop in Asian and U.S. stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund continued to lose value and suffer redemptions in
2007 as the global credit crunch roiled markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The moves also break up a remarkable partnership. Carhart
is a former assistant finance professor at the University of
Southern California. He first met Iwanowski when they attended
University of Chicago's business school in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carhart and Iwanowski will stay on for a couple of weeks of
transition, according to an internal memo, before pursuing
"separate personal and professional objectives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Joseph Giannone; Editing Bernard Orr and Ted

&lt;p&gt; * Volume rises, reported fees fall&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Bank of America/Merrill combined market share falls
 (Adds Bank of America comment, paragraphs 9-10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N),
considered among the healthier of the biggest U.S. banks,
topped the rest of Wall Street in arranging stock and bond
sales in the first quarter as upheaval in capital markets drove
volume up and fees down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following a 38 percent plunge in the volume of new stock
and bond issues in 2008, issuance in the first quarter rose 22
percent from a year earlier to $1.7 trillion, Thomson Reuters
data released on Tuesday show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reported fees slid 30 percent to $2.57 billion as the
pickup in total volume was fueled by fixed-income securities,
often with government backing. More lucrative equity-related
issuance sank 46 percent to $71 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, which in 2008 ended Citigroup Inc's (C.N)
eight-year reign as the world's top underwriter, arranged
$176.7 billion of offerings in the first quarter for a 10.4
percent market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays Plc (BARC.L) was second with $146.8 billion, while
Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), which bought Merrill Lynch  Co
on Jan. 1, edged Citigroup for third with $111.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In reported fees, JPMorgan also ranked first, with $286.6
million, followed by Citigroup's $268.8 million and Morgan
Stanley's (MS.N) $247.1 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You're going to end up for some period of time where
clients go toward the fittest and strongest," said Michael
Holland, a portfolio manager at Holland  Co in New York. "The
JPMorgans are going to be more highly valued as potential
agents than they were before the crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rankings reflected the collapse or sale of several
banks, including Merrill. JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns Cos, and
Barclays bought part of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
LEHMQ.PK. Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N), which bought Wachovia
Corp, ranked 28th; Wachovia had ranked 20th in all of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America's issuance volume dropped 12 percent from
year-earlier results for the bank and Merrill combined, making
it the only top-10 underwriter to see a drop. Its market share
on this basis fell to 6.6 percent from 9.2 percent. JPMorgan's
and Barclays' market shares also fell, but by smaller amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A year ago, we were number five and number 11, and now
we're number three," Bank of America spokesman Timothy Gilles
said, referring to Merrill's and Bank of America's separate
rankings. "This shows the power of our combination, and any
other interpretation of the data is not sensible or accurate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOVERNMENT BACKING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Underwriting could have been worse had financial companies
such as Citigroup, Bank of America and General Electric Co's
(GE.N) GE Capital unit been unable to sell tens of billions of
dollars of debt backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
under the government's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drug companies also aided issuance, as Roche Holding AG
(ROG.VX) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) together issued close to $30
billion of debt to buy Genentech Inc and Wyeth WYE.N,
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other markets remained essentially shut, including initial
public offerings, where volume slid 97 percent. One U.S.
company, Mead Johnson Nutrition Co (MJN.N), went public in the
first quarter, Thomson Reuters data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But activity picked up in March, and bankers said the
second quarter might also show more healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Large investors are edging back into stocks, according to a
Reuters poll of 45 top asset managers worldwide, though equity
holdings remain below long-term averages. [ID:nLV947858]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The tone for the first two months was, basically, 'When is
it all going to end?'" said Joe Castle, head of U.S. equity
syndicate at Barclays Capital. "When you have the shift in
frame of mind from trying to avoid losses to interest in taking
positions, you know capital markets activity will pick up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if it does, the industry has been retrenching to
accommodate weakened economies and capital markets worldwide.
Bank of America has said it may cut 35,000 jobs after buying
Merrill, and has seen some top bankers and traders defect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's a big problem," Holland said. "You have the
intellectual capital and the relationships (with clients)
leaving as well."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
(GS.N) said the heads of its computer-driven investments and
Global Alpha, once the bank's largest hedge fund, retired on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Departing were Mark Carhart and Raymond Iwanowski, who
helped run Global Alpha and a group that managed quantitative
investments. They left the bank along with research co-head
Giorgio De Santis, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The departures follow two years of disappointing
performance at Global Alpha, where assets fell to $2.5 billion
last year from a peak of $12 billion in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs confirmed the departures but declined further
comment. The retirements were reported first by financial news
blog Clusterstock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global Alpha had been Goldman's largest hedge fund before
volatile markets in 2007 led to steep losses and a wave of
redemptions. The fund continued to struggle last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Replacing Carhart and Iwanowski will be Katinka Domotorffy,
most recently head of strategy at Goldman's quantitative group,
a person familiar with the situation said. Domotorffy will be
assisted by co-chief investment officers Kent Daniel, Bill
Fallon and Robert Jones, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carhart had been head of the quant investment strategies
group and co-chief investment officer with Iwanowski of quant
macro and fixed income strategies. Carhart also was co-CIO,
with Jones, of quant equity strategies, the person familiar
explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones will continue as lead manager of quant equity
strategies, along with Domotorffy and Daniel, who had been
co-head of research with De Santis, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Domotorffy will be co-head of quant macro and fixed income
strategies with Fallon, the senior portfolio manager of the

&lt;p&gt;- Revered Company with 50+ Year Legacy Returns to Roots in African-American
Community; Enterprise to be Led by Veteran New Management Team -
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) has sold its Johnson Products Company unit,
one of the world`s most recognized market leaders in African-American hair care
products, to RCJP Acquisition, Inc., a newly formed independent entity comprised
of Los Angeles-based private equity firms Rustic Canyon/Fontis Partners, LP and
St. Cloud Capital LLC, along with an African-American management team of
industry veterans. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 

The company will operate as Johnson Products Company. The new management team
will be led by two industry veterans with strong ties to the business, husband
and wife team, Eric Brown and Renee Cottrell-Brown. They have extensive
experience in the ethnic hair care arena, having both held senior executive
positions with the Pro-Line International, Inc. subsidiary of Alberto-Culver
Company (NYSE: ACV). Brown will serve as chief executive officer, with
Cottrell-Brown as executive vice president. 

Founded in 1954 by George Ellis Johnson, Sr., Johnson Products, formerly
headquartered in Chicago, has been a mainstay brand for more than a half-century
in the African-American community. In 1971, the company became the first
minority-run enterprise to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Today,
Johnson Products offers more than 30 hair care products, including the Gentle
Treatment and Ultra Sheen brands. The company is headquartered in Los Angeles,
with offices in Dallas. 

"The acquisition of Johnson Products represents the renewal of a family of
products that revolutionized the ethnic hair care industry starting in the
1950s, and a next stage of growth for a legendary company that has been an
iconic figure and model of success for African-Americans," Brown said. "The new
Johnson Products Company will provide us with a platform to bring product
innovations and promotions to a unique multi-cultural consumer group and
reintroduce the brands to a new generation. We have an outstanding, motivated
team, and we are extremely excited and optimistic about the future of this new
venture." 

Johnson Products has annualized sales of more than $23 million. Its products are
sold throughout the United States and participate in a global market that the
company estimates to be approximately $1.8 billion. 

The management team brings more than 55 years of experience to the newly formed
company. It has helped launched some of the industry`s most successful ethnic
hair care brands, including the Soft &amp; Beautiful, Comb-Thru and Just-For-Me
product lines, all part of Pro-Line International. 

Brown most recently was president of Pro-Line International, which has been part
of Alberto-Culver Company since 2000. In January 2004, Brown moved into a
corporate position with Alberto-Culver as vice president global business
development, where he was instrumental in consummating global licensing,
distribution, acquisition and divesture opportunities for many of
Alberto-Culver`s global brands. 

Brown is joined by Renee Cottrell-Brown, who since 2006 operated a marketing
consulting firm, Streetwise Marketing Solutions, based in Arlington, TX, which
provides marketing services to start-ups and small-to-medium growth companies
that market multi-cultural personal care products. She previously held a 25-year
career with Pro-Line Corporation and Pro-Line International, most recently as
global vice president of retail marketing. 

"It makes me extremely happy to know that the brands of Johnson Products will be
owned by people who understand the African-American consumer market and care
about the brands," said founder Johnson, 82, whose company became part Procter &amp;
Gamble in 2003 with its acquisition of Wella AG. "Eric Brown and Renee
Cottrell-Brown will be successful in re-energizing the company, and I wish them
the very best in their endeavors." 

Comer J. Cottrell, founder of Pro-Line International, said, "I am excited and
pleased to congratulate Eric and Renee on their acquisition of Johnson Products.
We have always had a great deal of respect for the company and its founder. The
acquisition will perpetuate the legacy of minority ownership and contributions
to the industry." 

Lafayette Jones, president of SMSI-Urban Call Marketing, Inc. and founder of the
American Health and Beauty Aids Institute applauds the move and is pleased to
see the Brown team at the helm of the re-energized company. "I am very proud
that the rich history of African-American entrepreneurship and community
involvement continues with the acquisition of Johnson Products from Procter &amp;
Gamble," Jones said. "As second generation industry leaders, Eric Brown and
Renee Cottrell-Brown, along with the company`s legacy brands, have a solid
foundation upon which to rebuild the company." 

Kacy Rozelle and Marshall Geller of St. Cloud Capital, along with Daniel
Villanueva and Gabrielle Greene of Rustic Canyon/Fontis Partners, will join the
Johnson Products` board of directors. 

"All of us at St. Cloud are very excited to be part of this transaction and look
forward to working closely with this talented management team," said Rozelle,
managing director of St. Cloud. 

Gabriel Greene, partner of Rustic Canyon/Fontis Partners, said: "The wealth of
experience of the management team, coupled with the support of the expanded
board and advisory board, position Johnson Products to reestablish itself as a
great source of pride in the community." 

Johnson Products Company has been supported by leading food, drug and mass
retailers as well as beauty and barber suppliers for more than 50 years. Jay
Forbes, president of the Forbes Connection LLC and former vice president of Drug
Store News, said he welcomes JPC back to the forefront of the ethnic hair care
industry. "In a market that demands innovation, creativity and thoughtful
product positioning, I cannot think of two more talented individuals who better
understand the ethnic consumer and the retail community," said Forbes. "I`m
certain that Renee and Eric, with their collective experience over many years
contributing to the growth of the Pro-Line family business, will excel in
re-energizing Johnson Products, a great legacy company with outstanding brands."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
In the course of routine surveillance, Fitch Ratings downgrades Jacksonville,
Florida's (the city) approximately $573.2 million in Better Jacksonville Plan
(BJP) infrastructure sales tax revenue bonds. The Rating Outlook is revised to
Negative from Stable. At the same time, Fitch affirms the city's $534.4 million
in BJP transportation revenue bonds at 'AA' and revises the Outlook to Negative
from Stable. 

Concurrently, Fitch affirms the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: 

--Implied general obligation bonds at 'AA'; 

--$678.7 million excise tax revenue bonds at 'AA'; 

--$132.7 million local option sales tax bonds at 'AA'; 

--$153 million capital improvement revenue bonds at 'AA-'; 

--$104.7 million guaranteed entitlement revenue bonds at 'AA-'; 

--$133.9 million capital project revenue bonds at 'A+'. 

The downgrade to 'AA-' on the BJP infrastructure sales tax bonds is based on the
projected decline in debt service coverage to levels inconsistent with an 'AA'
rating. The bonds are secured by a half cent local infrastructure sales tax
approved by voters in 2000 to fund BJP projects. While coverage of maximum
annual debt service (MADS) remained constant in fiscal 2008 at 1.42 times (x),
year to date pledged sales tax revenues through February show a 5.8% decrease.
If pledged revenues continue to decline at that rate through fiscal 2009, which
Fitch believes is optimistic, coverage would decline to 1.34x, and would decline
further if the drop in sales tax revenue continues beyond the current fiscal
year. Also factored into the rating are the general credit characteristics of
the city including strong management, sound financial position, and a diverse
economy. The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's belief that the trend of
weakening revenues may continue or even accelerate, given the current economic
climate. 

The Negative Outlook reflects the city's plans to further leverage the security
to the point where coverage levels may be inconsistent with the current rating
category. The affirmations of the other securities are based on their sound
respective debt service coverage levels, satisfactory legal provisions, and the
general credit characteristics of the city. While pledged revenues for some of
these securities have declined at a similar or greater rate than the decline in
BJP sales tax revenue, higher levels of coverage provide more of a cushion in
the event of sustained revenue declines. 

Located on the northeastern coast of Florida, Jacksonville is the most populous
city in Florida; the 2007 estimated population was 805,605, an increase of 9.4%
over the 2000 census figure. The city's diverse economic base has a strong long
term profile bolstered by its historical naval presence, large cargo port with a
natural river harbor, and major banking, insurance, health care, and
manufacturing industries. While the effect of the current economic downturn has
so far been less severe in the city than in other parts of the state,
unemployment has increased to 8.6% in January 2009 from 4.7% a year prior. 

Financial operations are strong resulting in operating surpluses in four out of
the last five years. Unaudited fiscal 2008 results show a $14.2 million surplus
driven by the implementation of an effective expenditure reduction program and
additional fees instituted to offset the impact of recent property tax reform.
The unreserved fund balance plus a $40 million emergency reserve held in the
general fund equal a satisfactory 8.8% of spending. Estimates for fiscal 2009
year end indicate break even results. 

Overall debt levels are moderate at 3.9% of taxable assessed value, or $2.952
per capita. The city's capital improvement plan (CIP) for fiscal 2009-13 is
relatively small at $77 million, although it excludes all BJP projects, which at
$2.3 billion account for the majority of the city's capital needs. The CIP is
fully funded and projects are concentrated in roads, accounting for roughly 50%
of spending.

&lt;p&gt;KUWAIT, March 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) aims
to chop billions of dollars from the cost of increasing output
capacity at the world's fourth-largest oilfield in the United
Arab Emirates, a senior executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The capacity rise at Upper Zakum accounts for about a third
of the UAE's planned boost to total capacity of 3.5 million
barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 from around 2.8 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The field currently pumps above 500,000 bpd and Abu Dhabi
aims to boost output to 750,000 bpd, Exxon's Regional Vice
President Richard Vierbuchen told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vierbuchen declined to say when the field would reach
750,000 bpd or how much the development would cost, but said
Exxon and state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) were
looking at ways to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have lots of exciting new ideas to cut costs... to
reduce the costs of development by billions of dollars,"
Vierbuchen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UAE has already cut costs by around 20 percent on other
multi-billion dollar projects to boost capacity, driving down
contractor prices to reflect the slump in markets for raw
materials as the global economy slows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia has also sent contractors back
to the drawing board with bids as it looks for cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon took a 28 percent stake in the concession holder for
the Upper Zakum field, Zakum Development Co (Zadco), in January
2006. Initial plans were to boost production to 750,000 bpd by
2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ADNOC owns 60 percent of Zadco, while Japan's Inpex (1605.T)
owns the remaining 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UAE is the world's fifth largest oil exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Eman Goma, Writing by Reem Shamseddine,

&lt;p&gt;  SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, Mar 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
EnergyAustralia, Australia's largest electricity distribution network,
today announced an agreement with IBM (NYSE: IBM) for the implementation
of an energy network monitoring and control solution.

    A key project within EnergyAustralia's overall intelligent network
program, the Distribution Monitoring and Control (DM) project involves
the roll-out of 12,000 sensing devices throughout the electricity
distribution network, creating a smart grid. The project will enable
EnergyAustralia to deliver energy more efficiently and reliably, and
allow a greater number and range of environmental solutions to be
integrated into the electricity network such as renewable energy.

    Under the agreement signed in the first quarter of this year, IBM will
design and build the system IT architecture to support the project, in
which sensing devices will connect with EnergyAustralia's operational
systems using a combination of fourth generation and existing
technologies. This world-class intelligent network will carry the
necessary data for EnergyAustralia to reduce outages through faster fault
location and preventative maintenance and, to work towards managing
distributed energy sources such as solar and storage devices.

    EnergyAustralia's Managing Director George Maltabarow said the project was
an important part of the company's initial investment of $170 million in
its smart network rollout.

    "This project will help us stay at the forefront of the global intelligent
network transformation," Mr. Maltabarow said. "It will give us an instant
picture of the electricity network which will help shorten power
interruptions by allowing us to quickly locate and repair faults.

    "It will also mean preventative maintenance can be better targeted so we
can avoid faults and outages in the first place."

    In addition to consulting, systems integration and IT services expertise,
IBM has invested heavily in solutions such as Tivoli Netcool and Websphere
Datapower to assist utilities in realizing their intelligent network
visions.

    "IBM is delighted to bring its infrastructure, systems integration and
project management expertise to bear on this ground-breaking
transformation project," said David Murray, General Manager, IBM
Communications Sector, Australia.

    "Only through the creation of a smart grid that can sense, communicate,
analyze and respond, can Australia build the energy infrastructure it
needs to meet the challenges of climate change, globalization, and
changing consumer demand."

    IBM Smart Grid

    IBM is working with clients in nearly 50 Smart Grid engagements across
emerging and mature markets around the world. More about IBM's 'Smarter
Planet' initiative: its vision to bring a new level of intelligence to how
the world works -- how every person, business, organization, government,
natural system, and man-made system interacts, can be found here:

&lt;p&gt;ThinkPad X301, T400 and T500 Laptops Designed for Unified Communications/VoIP
RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Lenovo today announced that it is the first PC maker to offer laptops that are
Optimized for Microsoft Office Communicator 2007. As a certified partner in the
Microsoft Partner Program, this qualification means that the Lenovo ThinkPad
X301, T400 and T500 laptop PCs meet Microsoft`s stringent requirements for high
quality audio and video, giving users an excellent unified communications
experience, while also lowering the total cost of ownership for a Voice over
Internet Protocol (VoIP) environment. 

Unified communications refers to the convergence of multimedia including voice,
video and data over a common Internet Protocol (IP) infrastructure. Customers
can communicate through voice and video conference calls, email/calendaring and
instant messaging in real-time, irrespective of the communication device. The
network requirements for VoIP, call set up and call quality management are
important functions to build upon for customers who want to expand the
capabilities of their network. To help customers maximize their networks, Lenovo
has extended unified communications capabilities to several ThinkPad laptops.
With the market for unified communications continuing to grow, many companies
are seeing the benefits including increased productivity, greater efficiency and
reduced travel and communication costs. 

"Unified Communications is advancing the way our customers communicate today and
as the first PC maker to have our VoIP technology qualified by Microsoft, we are
already delivering these capabilities to our customers," said Sam Dusi, vice
president, Worldwide ThinkPad Product Marketing. "We are providing our customers
with enhanced microphones, enhanced speakers, and an enhanced user interface,
and bringing them one step closer to our ultimate goal of making unified
communications through our ThinkPad laptops as easy to use as a phone." 

Designing PC Technology for Communications

Lenovo has designed many of its ThinkPad laptops with leading technologies and
usability features to give business users a leading communications experience.
Lenovo includes stereo speakers for a fuller, richer experience with 10 band
equalization and dynamic range compression for a more balanced sound, optimized
speaker and microphone placement and added in Audio Director functionality,
which adds up to a fuller and richer sound and allows users to switch between
headphones and speakers easily without changing settings. For an excellent video
experience, Lenovo designed the laptops with optimized cameras, digital zoom and
improved image quality. 

"By optimizing laptops for Microsoft Office Communicator, Lenovo is helping
businesses streamline their Microsoft Office Communicator deployments," said,
Eric Swift, senior director, Microsoft Unified Communications Group, Microsoft.
"Customers can now deploy a cost effective, single device for their
communications needs using Lenovo`s PC technology to help ensure a high quality
audio and video experience." 

Unified Communications Enhancing Productivity

Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 works hand-in-hand with the hardware devices,
such as PCs and smartphones, to locate and then engage individuals in the
ongoing business needs of their organizations wherever their location. With
costly travel dollars at a premium, unified communications also helps reduce the
need for travel through audio and live web video conferencing. Microsoft Office
Communicator 2007 provides streamlined communications, operational flexibility
and control and an extendable communications platform. Additionally, unified
communications solutions can help reduce carbon emissions, a growing concern in
many companies` corporate social responsibility practices.

&lt;p&gt;Findings from First Study of Varenicline in Heart Disease Patients Presented at
ACC
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc today announced the results of a study that found that 47 percent of
smokers with a history of cardiovascular disease who took CHANTIX/CHAMPIX&#174;
(varenicline) were able to quit smoking and remain abstinent during the last
four weeks of treatment (weeks 9-12) compared with just 13.9 percent of those
given placebo. These findings were presented today at the American College of
Cardiology 58th Annual Scientific Session in Orlando, Fla. 

"These data are consistent with the findings from the pivotal varenicline
trials, which showed that varenicline was more effective than placebo among
smokers who were generally healthy," said Dr. Nancy A. Rigotti, professor of
medicine at Harvard Medical School, director of the Tobacco Research and
Treatment Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, and lead study investigator.
"This study demonstrates that varenicline is effective in helping smokers with
cardiovascular disease quit smoking. The safety profile of varenicline in this
study also resembles that of the pivotal studies. The results are encouraging
because the participants were at greater risk for death given their advanced
ages, durations of smoking and histories of cardiovascular disease." 

Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk for cardiovascular disease. In the
United States, approximately 130,000 adults die each year from smoking-related
cardiovascular disease. This figure is approximately one-third of all
smoking-related deaths among adults age 35 and older. Studies have shown that
quitting smoking reduces the risk of death by 36 percent for smokers who have
coronary heart disease, a type of cardiovascular disease. 

"Patients are always encouraged to quit smoking after experiencing a cardiac
event, such as a heart attack or stroke, but many eventually start smoking
again, putting themselves at serious risk for a second event," said Dr. Robert
A. Kloner, director of research at the Heart Institute of Good Samaritan
Hospital and professor of medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the
University of Southern California in Los Angeles. "It`s important that every
smoker, and particularly those with heart disease, work with a health care
professional to develop a quit plan." 

About the Study

The multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 714 adult
patients (ages 35-75 years) who had smoked an average of 10 or more cigarettes
daily in the year before enrollment. All patients wanted to quit smoking but had
not tried to in the past three months, and had stable, documented cardiovascular
disease that had been diagnosed more than two months prior. Eligible
cardiovascular disease diagnoses included history of heart attack, a certain
type of heart surgery, chest pain, peripheral arterial vascular disease, and
stroke or transient ischemic attack. 

Patients were randomized to twelve weeks of treatment with either varenicline
(n=355) or placebo (n=359) and were followed to week 52 in a blinded
post-treatment phase. All patients received smoking cessation counseling
throughout the study. The primary study endpoint was continuous abstinence rate
during the last four weeks of treatment (weeks 9-12). The key secondary endpoint
was continuous abstinence rate from the last four weeks of treatment through the
post-treatment phase (weeks 9-52). 

At the end of 52 weeks, 19.2 percent of patients who were randomized to take
varenicline during the treatment phase remained abstinent, compared with 7.2
percent of patients randomized to take placebo. 

Varenicline was generally well-tolerated. In the varenicline group, 7.4 percent
of patients experienced cardiovascular events vs. 6.6 percent in the placebo
group (difference 0.8, 95 percent CI: -3.0 to 4.6). Serious adverse events
occurred in 6.5 percent patients treated with varenicline compared with 6.0
percent of those given placebo. None of the serious adverse events involved
depression, suicidality, or abnormal behavior. 

The most common adverse events reported in the study were nausea (29.5 percent
for varenicline vs. 8.6 percent for placebo), headache (12.7 percent vs. 11.1
percent), insomnia (11.9 percent vs. 6.6 percent), vomiting (8.2 percent vs. 1.1
percent), abnormal dreams (7.9 percent vs. 1.7 percent), fatigue (7.1 percent
vs. 4.0 percent), nasopharyngitis (6.5 percent vs. 8.6 percent), constipation
(6.5 percent vs. 2.0 percent), diarrhea (6.2 percent vs. 5.1 percent), dizziness
(6.2 percent vs. 4.6 percent), and dyspepsia (5.4 percent vs. 3.4 percent). 

This trial was funded by Pfizer Inc and was conducted in 15 countries. 

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

CHANTIX/CHAMPIX&#174; (varenicline) is a prescription medicine to help adults 18 and
over stop smoking. Adults who smoke may benefit from quit smoking support
programs and/or counseling during their quit attempt. It`s possible that
patients might slip up and smoke while taking varenicline. If patients slip up,
they can stay on varenicline and keep trying to quit. 

Some patients have had changes in behavior, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal
thoughts or actions when attempting to quit smoking while taking varenicline, or
after stopping varenicline. If patients, their families or caregivers notice
agitation, depressed mood or changes in behavior that are not typical for the
patients, or if patients develop suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior, they
should stop taking varenicline and tell their doctor right away. Patients should
also tell their doctor about history of depression or other mental health
problems before taking varenicline, as these symptoms may worsen while taking
varenicline. 

The most common side effects include nausea (30 percent), sleep problems,
constipation, gas, and/or vomiting. Side effects that are bothersome or don`t go
away should be reported to a doctor. 

Patients may have trouble sleeping, vivid, unusual or strange dreams while
taking varenicline. Patients should be advised to use caution driving or
operating machinery until they know how quitting smoking with varenicline may
affect them. 

Varenicline should not be taken with other quit smoking products. A lower dose
of varenicline may be necessary in patients with kidney problems or who get
dialysis. -5- 

Before starting varenicline, patients should tell their doctors if they are
pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or if they take insulin, asthma medicines, or
blood thinners. Medicines like these may work differently when patients quit
smoking.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Among patients aged 65 and older with established coronary heart disease,
Lipitor&#174; (atorvastatin calcium) 80 mg significantly reduced the relative risk of
a first cardiovascular event by 23 percent and provided significant reductions
in the risk of subsequent second, third and fourth cardiovascular events over a
period of five years compared to Lipitor 10 mg, according to data presented
today at the 58th annual scientific sessions of the American College of
Cardiology (ACC) in Orlando, FL. This post hoc sub-analysis was designed and
completed following the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study. 

"More people are surviving heart attacks than ever before due to improved
healthcare," said Dr. Nanette Wenger, professor of medicine, division of
cardiology, Emory University School of Medicine. "But anyone who experiences one
cardiovascular event remains at increased risk for additional events. Age
further increases this risk. This sub-analysis showed that in the TNT study
intensive Lipitor therapy provided sustained reductions in the risk of multiple
cardiovascular events in an older population with coronary heart disease." 

The American Heart Association estimates that 470,000 Americans will have a
recurrent heart attack this year. Most cardiovascular outcomes trials, including
the overall TNT trial, however, evaluate only the time to a patient`s first
cardiovascular event and thus may underestimate potential longer-term effects of
treatment. This sub-analysis evaluated any cardiovascular event during the full
duration of the five-year TNT study in 3,809 patients aged 65 and older with
stable coronary heart disease. Any cardiovascular event was defined as death
from heart disease, non-fatal heart attack, resuscitated cardiac arrest,
revascularization procedure, procedure-related heart attack, chest pain, fatal
or non-fatal stroke, peripheral arterial disease or hospitalization due to
chronic heart failure. 

In this study, Lipitor 80 mg demonstrated the following risk reductions compared
to Lipitor 10 mg:

* a significant 23 percent relative risk reduction in a first cardiovascular
event 
* a significant 25 percent relative risk reduction in a subsequent second
cardiovascular event 
* a significant 30 percent relative risk reduction in a subsequent third
cardiovascular event 
* a significant 33 percent relative risk reduction in a subsequent fourth
cardiovascular event 
* a 22 percent relative risk reduction in a subsequent fifth cardiovascular
event, which did not reach statistical significance

Although the original TNT study was not designed to look at subsequent
cardiovascular events beyond the first CV event, these results suggest sustained
risk reductions with Lipitor 80 mg compared with Lipitor 10 mg in this patient
population. 

Throughout the overall TNT study, both doses of Lipitor were generally well
tolerated. 

About the TNT Study

The TNT study was an investigator-led trial coordinated by an independent
steering committee and funded by Pfizer. The study enrolled 10,001 men and women
with coronary heart disease aged 35 years to 75 years in 14 countries and
followed them for an average of five years. Primary study results were published
in TheNew England Journal of Medicine in 2005. 

The primary endpoint of the original TNT study was the occurrence of a first
major cardiovascular event, defined as death from heart disease, non-fatal heart
attack, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or non-fatal stroke. 

The endpoint for this sub-analysis of older patients was any cardiovascular
event, defined as death from heart disease, non-fatal heart attack, resuscitated
cardiac arrest, revascularization procedure, procedure-related heart attack,
chest pain, fatal or non-fatal stroke, peripheral arterial disease or
hospitalization due to chronic heart failure. 

Lipitor 80 mg is not a starting dose. 

Important U.S. Prescribing Information

Lipitor is a prescription medication. It is used in patients with multiple risk
factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, age, low
HDL ("good" cholesterol) or smoking to reduce the risk of heart attack and
stroke, certain kinds of heart surgery and chest pain. Lipitor is also used in
patients with type 2 diabetes and at least one other risk factor for heart
disease such as high blood pressure, smoking or complications of diabetes,
including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce the risk of heart attack
and stroke. 

Lipitor is used in patients with existing coronary heart disease to reduce the
risk of heart attack, stroke, certain kinds of heart surgery, hospitalization
for heart failure, and chest pain. 

When diet and exercise alone are not enough, Lipitor is used along with a
low-fat diet and exercise to lower cholesterol. 

Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is
not for women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant. 

Patients taking Lipitor should tell their doctors if they feel any new muscle
pain or weakness. This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle side effects.
Patients should tell their doctors about all medications they take. This may
help avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check
liver function before and during treatment and may adjust the dose. The most
common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain and heartburn. They tend
to be mild and often go away.

&lt;p&gt; * Names Pandora, Facebook, Isaac Mizrahi partners&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sees collaboration with operators helping take-up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sinead Carew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has
signed up multiple software partners for its upcoming cellphone
software marketplace, including Web music service Pandora, game

Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software company said on Tuesday it plans to discuss
those partnerships and conduct demonstrations of the software
store -- set to launch later this year -- at the CTIA wireless
showcase in Las Vegas this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple Inc (AAPL.O) started the trend for cellphone
application stores last summer and its offerings from third-
party developers of software, ranging from the practical to the
whimsical, have helped boost iPhone sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts are skeptical whether Apple's rivals will be
able to generate as much interest from consumers and developers
with their own mobile software offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd
RIM.TO, which popularized email on the go, to officially

already has a store for phones based on its Android system. And
Palm Inc PALM.O is planning one for its Pre phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, Microsoft revealed plans to open Windows

new Windows phones in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a keynote speech at the show, the president of
Microsoft's entertainment and devices unit, Robbie Bach, will
announce an alliance with fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, who
will design themes to let consumers customize their phone's
appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also plans to make its marketplace attractive to
carriers with options such as a share of software revenue, 70
percent of which goes to the software developers, according to
Andy Lees, who heads Microsoft's Window Mobile division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're also partnering with mobile operators very closely
so they can have their own stores in the mobile market place,"
Lees said in an interview ahead of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This would mean that purchases could be included in the
consumer's phone bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That means we're a very friendly strategy for carriers and
for (consumers)," Lees said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He promised strong operator support for the store, but
declined to name specific customers.
