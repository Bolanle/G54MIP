			Synageva BioPharma&#8482; to Present at the 32nd 
      Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Synageva 
      BioPharma Corp. (Synageva) (NASDAQ:GEVA), a biopharmaceutical 
      company developing therapeutic products for rare diseases, today 
      announced its presentation at the upcoming J.P. Morgan Healthcare 
      Conference being held in San Francisco, CA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sanj K. Patel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Synageva, will 
      present on Tuesday, January 14, 2014, at 4:30 p.m. PST (7:30 p.m. EST). 
      The presentation will be webcast live and may be accessed from the 
      &#8220;Webcasts  Presentations&#8221; section of the Investor Relations tab on the 
      home page of Synageva&#8217;s website at www.synageva.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sebelipase alfa for lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL Deficiency)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			LAL 
      Deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease 
      (LSD) caused by a marked decrease in LAL enzyme activity. LAL Deficiency 
      presenting in children and adults, historically called Cholesteryl Ester 
      Storage Disease (CESD), is an underappreciated cause of cirrhosis and 
      accelerated atherosclerosis. These complications are due to the buildup 
      of fatty material in the liver, blood vessel walls and other tissues as 
      a result of the decreased LAL enzyme activity. Infants presenting with 
      LAL Deficiency, historically called Wolman disease, show very rapid 
      progression with death, usually in the first six months of life. 
      Affected infants develop severe malabsorption, growth failure and liver 
      complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sebelipase 
      alfa (SBC-102) is a recombinant form of the human LAL enzyme being 
      developed by Synageva as an enzyme replacement therapy for LAL 
      Deficiency. Synageva is evaluating sebelipase alfa in global Phase 3 
      clinical trials in infants, children and adults with LAL Deficiency. 
      Sebelipase alfa has been granted orphan designation by the U.S. Food and 
      Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the 
      Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Additionally, 
      sebelipase alfa received fast track designation by the FDA, and 
      Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for LAL Deficiency 
      presenting in infants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SBC-103 for MPS IIIB
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) consist of a group of rare LSDs caused 
      by a deficiency of enzymes needed to break down complex sugars called 
      glycosaminoglycans. The MPS III syndromes (also known as Sanfilippo 
      syndromes) share complications with other MPS diseases but represent a 
      clinically distinct subset with marked central nervous system 
      degeneration. Mucopolysaccharidosis 
      IIIB (MPS IIIB, also known as Sanfilippo B syndrome) is caused by a 
      decrease in alpha-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAGLU) enzyme activity which 
      leads to the buildup of abnormal amounts of heparan sulfates (HS) in the 
      brain and other organs. The accumulation of abnormal HS, particularly in 
      the central nervous system, leads to severe cognitive decline, 
      behavioral problems, speech loss, increasing loss of mobility, and 
      premature death.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SBC-103 
      is a recombinant form of the human NAGLU enzyme being developed by 
      Synageva as an enzyme replacement therapy for MPS IIIB. Using various 
      dosing approaches, SBC-103 reduced HS substrate storage in the brain, 
      liver and kidney in an MPS IIIB animal model. SBC-103 has been granted 
      orphan designation by the FDA and the EMA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Synageva&#8217;s additional pipeline programs and manufacturing platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Synageva&#8217;s additional pipeline programs include other proteins targeting 
      rare diseases at various stages of preclinical development. These 
      diseases are characterized by significant morbidity and mortality and 
      these programs are selected based on scientific rationale, high unmet 
      medical need, potential to impact disease course and strategic alignment 
      with the company&#8217;s corporate focus. In addition to these novel pipeline 
      programs, Synageva is leveraging its manufacturing platform to develop 
      improved biologic therapies for diseases with high unmet medical need.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Synageva&#8217;s proprietary manufacturing platform utilizes technology to 
      produce drug product with consistent characteristics that enable 
      robustness and flexibility during scale-up. In addition, the platform 
      can provide favorable structural properties for bio-distribution and 
      cell targeting in comparison to glycoproteins produced from other 
      sources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Synageva routinely posts information that may be important to investors 
      in the &#8220;Investor Relations&#8221; section of the company&#8217;s web site at www.synageva.com. 
      Synageva encourages investors and potential investors to consult this 
      web site regularly for important information about the company.

      respected news operation,&#8221; said Swisher and Mossberg.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the deal Swisher, Mossberg and other Revere journalists will 
      appear on-air across all of the News Group properties including CNBC,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve Bank filed a motion on Friday to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a former employee who claimed she was fired after refusing to alter a critical examination of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ex-employee, Carmen Segarra, said after examining Goldman's legal and compliance divisions for seven months, she found the bank did not have policies to prevent conflicts of interest as required by regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 30-page court document, lawyers for the New York Fed said some of Segarra's claims were "implausible owing to numerous contradictions within her pleading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most glaringly, the allegation that Goldman Sachs did not have any conflict of interest policy is belied by plaintiff's own exhibits, which show that the 'nonexistent' policies were, in fact, available on Goldman Sachs's public website," the document said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys who filed the motion in federal court in the Southern District of New York and Segarra's lawyer, Linda Stengle, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Segarra's lawsuit, the New York Fed's Legal Compliance and Risk team voted to downgrade Goldman's annual rating pertaining to policies and procedures as a result of findings. She alleges that two New York Fed officials overseeing the Wall Street bank, Michael Silva and his deputy Michael Koh, were concerned a downgrade would hurt the Goldman's business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Koh and Silva are named as defendants in Segarra's lawsuit, as well as her former supervisor, Johnathon Kim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segarra was assigned to Goldman's legal and compliance divisions from October 2011 until May 2012, and looked into three controversial transactions related to Solyndra, Capmark and the merger of El Paso and Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N). At that point, Kim, Silva and Koh fired her and had her escorted from the building by security guards after weeks of disputes and pressure to change her examination findings, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Segarra v. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York et al in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District Of New York, No. 1:13-cv-07173-RA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mica Rosenberg; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 3 (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve
Bank filed a motion on Friday to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a
former employee who claimed she was fired after refusing to

numerous contradictions within her pleading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most glaringly, the allegation that Goldman Sachs did not

rating pertaining to policies and procedures as a result of 
findings. She alleges that two New York Fed officials overseeing
the Wall Street bank, Michael Silva and his deputy Michael Koh,
were concerned a downgrade would hurt the Goldman's business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Koh and Silva are named as defendants in Segarra's
lawsuit, as well as her former supervisor, Johnathon Kim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segarra was assigned to Goldman's legal and compliance
divisions from October 2011 until May 2012, and looked into
three controversial transactions related to Solyndra, Capmark
and the merger of El Paso and Kinder Morgan Inc. At that
point, Kim, Silva and Koh fired her and had her escorted from
the building by security guards after weeks of disputes and
pressure to change her examination findings, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Segarra v. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
et al in the U.S District Court for the Southern District Of New
York, No. 1:13-cv-07173-RA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 3 (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve
Bank filed a motion on Friday to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a
former employee who claimed she was fired after refusing to
alter a critical examination of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ex-employee, Carmen Segarra, said after examining
Goldman's legal and compliance divisions for seven months, she
found the bank did not have policies to prevent conflicts of
interest as required by regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 30-page court document, lawyers for the New York Fed
said some of Segarra's claims were "implausible owing to
numerous contradictions within her pleading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most glaringly, the allegation that Goldman Sachs did not 
have any conflict of interest policy is belied by plaintiff's
own exhibits, which show that the 'nonexistent' policies were,
in fact, available on Goldman Sachs's public website," the
document said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys who filed the motion in federal court in the
Southern District of New York and Segarra's lawyer, Linda
Stengle, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A
Goldman Sachs spokesperson also did not respond to a request for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Segarra's lawsuit, the New York Fed's Legal
Compliance and Risk team voted to downgrade Goldman's annual
rating pertaining to policies and procedures as a result of 
findings. She alleges that two New York Fed officials overseeing
the Wall Street bank, Michael Silva and his deputy Michael Koh,
were concerned a downgrade would hurt the Goldman's business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Koh and Silva are named as defendants in Segarra's

				Masimo (NASDAQ: MASI) is the global leader in innovative noninvasive monitoring technologies that significantly improve patient care -- helping solve "unsolvable" problems. In 1995, the company debuted Measure-Through Motion and Low Perfusion pulse oximetry, known as Masimo SET&#174;, which virtually eliminated false alarms and increased pulse oximetry's ability to detect life-threatening events. More than 100 independent and objective studies have shown that Masimo SET&#174; outperforms other pulse oximetry technologies, even under the most challenging clinical conditions, including patient motion and low peripheral perfusion. In 2005, Masimo introduced rainbow SET&#174; Pulse CO-Oximetry technology, allowing noninvasive and continuous monitoring of blood constituents that previously required invasive procedures, including total hemoglobin (SpHb&#174;), oxygen content (SpOC&#8482;), carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO&#174;), methemoglobin (SpMet&#174;), and Pleth Variability Index (PVI&#174;), in addition to SpO2, pulse rate, and perfusion index (PI). In 2008, Masimo introduced Patient SafetyNet&#8482;, a remote monitoring and wireless clinician notification system designed to help hospitals avoid preventable deaths and injuries associated with failure to rescue events. In 2009, Masimo introduced rainbow&#174; Acoustic Monitoring&#8482;, the first-ever noninvasive and continuous monitoring of acoustic respiration rate (RRa&#8482;).&#160;Masimo's rainbow&#174; SET&#174; technology platform offers a breakthrough in patient safety by helping clinicians detect life-threatening conditions and helping guide treatment options. In 2010, Masimo acquired SEDLine&#174;, a pioneer in the development of innovative brain function monitoring technology and devices. And in 2012, Masimo acquired the assets of Spire Semiconductor, LLC, a maker of advanced light emitting diode (LED) and other advanced component-level technologies; and PHASEIN AB, a developer and manufacturer of ultra-compact mainstream and sidestream capnography, multigas analyzers, and handheld capnometry solutions. Masimo SET&#174; and Masimo rainbow&#174; SET&#174; technologies also can be found in over 100 multiparameter patient monitors from over 50 medical device manufacturers around the world. Founded in 1989, Masimo has the mission of "Improving Patient Outcome and Reducing Cost of Care... by Taking Noninvasive Monitoring to New Sites and Applications&#174;."

$2 billion settlement with federal authorities to resolve
suspicions that the bank ignored signs of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi

the prosecutors in Manhattan and the remainder to the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and a unit of the Treasury
Department investigating breakdowns in the bank's safeguards
against money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government plans to use some of the payout for Madoff's

Treasury Department's Office of the Inspector General was
examining whether JPMorgan interfered with the OCC's attempts to
probe the bank's relationship with Madoff..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madoff had also separately told U.S. authorities that
JPMorgan - the bank he had used during his decades-long
investment scam - had tried to stop the OCC from getting
information about their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

      Junction Solutions To Implement Microsoft Dynamics AX for King Arthur 
      Flour
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Junction Solutions, a leading provider of vertical market-specific 
      on-premise and on-demand software applications and services for the food 
      and beverage, multi-channel retail, and life sciences sectors, announced 
      today it will implement Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 for King Arthur Flour 
      to support the food company&#8217;s strong growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Founded in 1790, King Arthur Flour is America's oldest flour company and 
      premier baking resource, offering ingredients, mixes, tools, recipes, 
      and educational opportunities to bakers. Headquartered in Norwich, 
      Vermont, King Arthur Flour products are also available in supermarkets 
      nationwide. The employee-owned company operates three core divisions: 
      Wholesale, which provides flour, baking mixes and bulk flour to 
      retailers, distributors and bakeries nationwide; Direct, which sells its 
      baking tools, ingredients and proprietary products through the company&#8217;s

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      King Arthur Flour has seen significant growth in the past five years and 
      needed to replace multiple legacy systems to continue its growth track. 
      The company selected Junction Solutions, with their deep food and 
      beverage and multi-channel retail expertise, to implement Microsoft 
      Dynamics AX to replace these legacy systems. King Arthur Flour has 
      sophisticated customer support operations that include wholesale 
      distribution to grocery stores requiring state of the art EDI and Trade 
      Promotions Management, a direct-to-consumer call center, a retail store, 
      and a B2C ecommerce website. King Arthur Flour also intends to optimize 
      operations with Junction Solutions&#8217; Genetic Optimizer, an advanced 
      production scheduling system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Junction Solutions demonstrated a clear understanding of the distinct 
      challenges of the food business and the requirements we need to improve 
      efficiency throughout our multiple channel sales operations,&#8221; said Steve 
      Cochran, vice president, Infrastructure, King Arthur Flour. &#8220;We expect 
      that Dynamics AX and Junction Solutions will help us effectively manage 
      our growth in the years ahead.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delighted to add this leading CPG company to our large and 
      growing base of food customers,&#8221; said Christian Hutter, senior vice 
      president, Manufacturing, Distribution, Junction Solutions. &#8220;King Arthur 
      Flour selected the Microsoft Dynamics AX platform and Junction Solutions 
      to support their rapid growth. We look forward to helping the company 
      meet its strategic goals in not only improving operational performance 
      and optimizing margins but also managing their growth more profitably.&#8221;

			About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics 
      based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the 
      translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines with a core 
      focus on RNAi therapeutics toward genetically defined targets for the 
      treatment of serious, life-threatening diseases with limited treatment 
      options for patients and their caregivers. These include: patisiran 
      (ALN-TTR02), an intravenously delivered RNAi therapeutic targeting 
      transthyretin (TTR) for the treatment of TTR-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) 
      in patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP); ALN-TTRsc, a 
      subcutaneously delivered RNAi therapeutic targeting TTR for the 
      treatment of ATTR in patients with familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy 
      (FAC); ALN-AT3, an RNAi therapeutic targeting antithrombin (AT) for the 
      treatment of hemophilia and rare bleeding disorders (RBD); ALN-AS1, an 
      RNAi therapeutic targeting aminolevulinate synthase-1 (ALAS-1) for the 
      treatment of porphyria including acute intermittent porphyria (AIP); 
      ALN-CC5, an RNAi therapeutic targeting complement component C5 for the 
      treatment of complement-mediated diseases; ALN-PCS, an RNAi therapeutic 
      targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia; ALN-TMP, an 
      RNAi therapeutic targeting TMPRSS6 for the treatment of beta-thalassemia 
      and iron-overload disorders; ALN-AAT, an RNAi therapeutic targeting 
      alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) for the treatment of AAT deficiency liver 
      disease; and ALN-ANG, an RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of genetic 
      forms of mixed hyperlipidemia and severe hypertriglyceridemia, amongst 
      other programs. As part of its &#8220;Alnylam 5x15&#8221; strategy, the company 
      expects to have five RNAi therapeutic products for genetically defined 
      diseases in clinical development, including programs in advanced stages, 
      on its own or with a partner by the end of 2015. Alnylam has additional 
      partnered programs in clinical or development stages, including 
      ALN-RSV01 for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 
      infection and ALN-VSP for the treatment of liver cancers. The company&#8217;s 
      leadership position on RNAi therapeutics and intellectual property have 
      enabled it to form major alliances with leading companies including 
      Merck, Medtronic, Novartis, Biogen Idec, Roche, Takeda, Kyowa Hakko 
      Kirin, Cubist, Ascletis, Monsanto, Genzyme, and The Medicines Company.

      recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies. Alnylam&#8217;s VaxiRNA&#8482; 
      platform applies RNAi technology to improve the manufacturing processes 
      for vaccines; GlaxoSmithKline is a collaborator in this effort. Alnylam 
      scientists and collaborators have published their research on RNAi 
      therapeutics in over 100 peer-reviewed papers, including many in the 
      world&#8217;s top scientific journals such as Nature, Nature Medicine, 
      Nature Biotechnology, Cell, the New England Journal of 
      Medicine, and The Lancet. Founded in 2002, Alnylam maintains

      Research and Markets: Global Financial Accounting Application Market 
      2014-2018 with Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., and SAP AG Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/nngl63/global_financial) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Financial Accounting Application Market 2014-2018" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Financial Accounting Application market 
      to grow at a CAGR of 3.01 percent over the period 2013-2018. One of the 
      key factors contributing to this market growth is the need to improve 
      the operational efficiency and productivity. The Global Financial 
      Accounting Application market has also been witnessing the increasing 
      adoption of cloud-based financial accounting application software. 
      However, the cross-functional integration among various departments 
      could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this market space are Intuit Inc., Microsoft 
      Corp., Oracle Corp., and SAP AG.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other vendors mentioned in the report are COA Solutions, Deltek Inc., 
      Epicor Software Corp., Exact Software, Infor, Lawson Software Inc., 
      NetSuite Inc., Technology One Ltd., and the Sage Group plc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: Financial 
      accounting solutions perform debits and credits, but beyond the general 
      ledger, fixed assets, accounts payable and other transactional systems, 
      there are some other important financial accounting solutions that 
      assist in cash management, planning, and budgeting. Today, enterprises 
      want all time access to cash management, financial planning, budgeting 
      and other solutions. In addition, enterprises are increasingly relying 
      on cloud solutions for planning, budgeting, banking, and treasury 
      solutions in use at their firms. More large enterprises are adopting the 
      use of cloud-based solutions because they have a greater need for 
      consolidation budgeting, planning and reporting tools. In addition, 
      large enterprises have growing needs for more modern and mobile 
      applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers is the need to improve 
      operational efficiency and productivity. Financial accounting 
      application software helps organizations to deploy standard processes in 
      order to achieve consistency, and it also ensures automation of 
      processes in order to accelerate them.

			SeniorNet Shares its Operational Model and Latest Microsoft Workshop 
      with Chinese Delegation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New SeniorNet Headquarters Opens in Florida
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SeniorNet Learning Center in San Jose Willows, Calif. recently 
      welcomed a delegation 
      of 14 dignitaries from various regions in China to provide insight 
      into how SeniorNet has become so successful and to share its operational 
      and educational protocols. The visitors were management representatives 
      for the Committees on Aging in China from the national level and 
      throughout 12 provinces and municipalities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The delegation, which attended a Microsoft Windows 8 workshop, saw 
      firsthand how class content and curriculum is developed using surveys of 
      intended students, as well as SeniorNet&#8217;s extensive use of volunteers in 
      the teaching process. Drawing on local resources such as tech company 
      retirees, community facilities and donated equipment, SeniorNet 
      minimizes its need to conduct massive fundraising activities that strain 
      limited resources by partnering with major corporations such as 
      Microsoft, IBM, Google, Que Publishing and others who help fulfill its 
      mission.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ms. Li Shumei, Deputy Director, Heilongjiang Provincial Committee on 
      Aging said SeniorNet has, &#8220;a very good self-support education model 
      without relying on budget and tendency of bureaucratic management. Such 
      a model would help the still developing China develop more educations 
      centers alike. It is a valuable example.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This was an enlightening new business model for SeniorNet&#8217;s Chinese 
      counterparts. The delegation was eager to return to China and put what 
      they learned into practice for the senior citizens in their home country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Leslie M. Smith, IBM Business Development Executive (retired) and 
      SeniorNet Chairman of the Board said, &#8220;We were just delighted to host 
      the Chinese delegation and share our knowledge. Computers skills are 
      crucial to social connections for seniors and the hope that this will 
      connect more people outside the U.S. is the best New Year&#8217;s gift we 
      could get.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Headquarters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In a move from its former location in Herndon, Virginia, SeniorNet 
      officially opened its new headquarters on January 1 at 5237 Summerlin 
      Commons Blvd., Suite 314, Fort Myers, FL 33907. The phone number is 
      (239) 275-2202 and the fax number is (239) 275-2501.

      celebrates how moms are there along the journey to pick their kids back 
      up and encourage them to try again. One major part of that journey will 
      be watching their kids compete in Sochi. For those moms that traveled 
      all that way to support their athletes, PG has announced they will be 
      on the ground for them with the PG Family Home, where PG brands will 
      support and serve all moms and families of Olympians in Sochi.

			PG Presents &#8220;Pick Them Back Up&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Building on the momentum of the award winning short film &#8220;Best Job,&#8221; 
      which debuted prior to the London 2012 Olympic Games and garnered more 
      than 21 million views, PG is introducing the latest installment in the Thank 
      You Mom campaign, &#8220;Pick 
      Them Back Up.&#8221; The new film depicts the stories of four moms of 
      athletes from around the world and shows their journey to achieve their 
      dreams and the important role moms play along the way.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I could see myself &#8211; and my mom &#8211; in the new PG piece,&#8221; said Lindsey 
      Vonn, US Olympic Gold Medalist, Alpine Skiing. &#8220;As a child, and even 
      with my recent injuries, my mom has always been there encouraging me to 
      get back up when I fell. Her personal stories of resilience and her 
      constant support make me want to pick myself up and keep going.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Mom&#8217;s contributions to their kids&#8217; lives are full of incredible 
      sacrifices,&#8221; said Jodi Allen, PG VP of North American Marketing and 
      Brand Operations. &#8220;We&#8217;re so moved by these moms and the way they help 
      their children overcome obstacles to achieve their dreams. As athletes 
      are named to Team USA, we celebrate the person that helped get each 
      athlete there and who picked them up each time they fell &#8211; mom!&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pick Them Back Up&#8221; will appear in short form as television commercials 
      in more than 20 countries across the world. The spot will be available 
      online on PG&#8217;s 
      YouTube channel on January 6th and will also be aired on U.S. 
      television, with a notable debut during the Golden Globes on January 12th. 
      The film also features music created by the same world-renowned composer 
      from &#8220;Best Job,&#8221; Ludovico Einaudi. Known for his emotive and 
      effortlessly lyrical music, Einaudi&#8217;s new composition evokes the love, 
      passion and commitment that moms have for their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;When I saw the commercial for the first time, it immediately brought 
      back memories of Evan&#8217;s figure skating journey,&#8221; said Tanya Lysacek, 
      mother of U.S. Olympic champion Evan Lysacek. &#8220;This film really captures 
      what we&#8217;ve gone through with Evan. I always say that skating is a sport 
      of failure and you have to fall many, many times before you can really 
      make an element perfect. But that&#8217;s true for all children &#8211; they need to 
      fall again and again in life, and our job as moms is to pick them back 
      up, dust them off, and send them off to try again!&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			PG Provides &#8220;Home Away from Home&#8221; for Moms in 
      Sochi with PG Family Home
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moms of U.S. Olympians spend their lives standing behind their children 
      as they work to achieve their dreams, so as part of PG&#8217;s commitment to 
      moms while they watch their athletes compete, brands such as Pantene&#174;, 
      Covergirl&#174;, Bounty&#174; and Gillette&#174; have come together to create the PG 
      Family Home for Sochi 2014. The PG Family Home is a gift that will 
      support and serve all moms and families of Olympians around the world. 
      It is a &#8220;home away from home&#8221; where families can spend time together in 
      a relaxed and friendly environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Located in the Sochi 2014 Olympic Park, the Family Home will be open 
      from the 8th of February through the 23rd offering 
      athletes, their moms and families all the comforts of home. Brands like 
      Pantene, Covergirl and Gillette will be providing more than 1,000 beauty 
      and grooming services, while Pampers will be offering changing stations 
      for families with young children.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;PG brands don&#8217;t just live at the finish line,&#8221; said Allen. &#8220;They are 
      with moms every day in their journey of raising a child, so during The 
      Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games, our brands will be there to support 
      moms of Olympians in the PG Family Home with services that make an 
      extraordinary difference when a family is far from home.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the Family Home, PG is proud to offer thanks to all 357 
      moms of US Olympians  Paralympians with a gift of a $1,000 VISA gift 
      card to help them on their journey to Sochi, because after all the hard 
      work, some moms can&#8217;t afford to be there to watch their child compete.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s so great that brands like Pantene, Covergirl and Olay are taking 
      care of my mom in the PG Family Home and helping her experience the 
      comforts of home while she&#8217;s in Sochi,&#8221; said Lindsey Vonn, US Olympic 
      Gold Medalist, Alpine Skiing. &#8220;Knowing that my mom will be supported 
      while she cheers me on allows me to fully focus on my competition, 
      without any worries about those that flew all that way to be there for 
      me.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG&#8217;s Thank You Mom campaign kicked off in October with the 
      release of &#8220;Raising an Olympian,&#8221; a film series showcasing the journey 
      of 28 world-class athletes, as seen through the eyes of their moms. The 
      videos have collectively garnered 19 million views since the launch. The 
      campaign is also coming to life through a variety of media channels and

	Endologix, Inc. develops and manufactures minimally invasive treatments for aortic disorders.&#160;The company's primary focus is endovascular stent grafts for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).&#160;AAA is a weakening of the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in the body, resulting in a balloon-like enlargement. Once AAA develops, it continues to enlarge and, if left untreated, becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture. The overall patient mortality rate for ruptured AAA is approximately 75%, making it a leading cause of death in the U.S. Additional information can be found on Endologix's website at www.endologix.com.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: COMPANY CONTACT:

Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yusof, a former chief financial officer with Malaysian telco
Axiata, is the latest hire for big investment banks

deals in Southeast Asia as activity in the region heats up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been the most successful foreign
investment bank in Malaysia in the last two years, Thomson
Reuters league table data show. In 2013, the U.S. bank took a 21
percent market share in Malaysia's investment banking segment,
double that of its nearest rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman Sachs earned hundreds of millions of
dollars from arranging debt offerings for a single Malaysian
client, state fund 1MDB, IFR reported. Goldman Sachs declined to
comment on the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yusof is the second ex-Goldman banker to join Deutsche Bank
in Southeast Asia in recent months, after the German bank hired
Boon-Kee Tan as head of client coverage for the region last
July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same month Deutsche also poached UBS's veteran head
of investment banking in Thailand, Phumchai Kambhato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yusof, who has been with Goldman Sachs since 2010, resigned
a couple of weeks ago, a second source told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The
sources could not be named as the hiring has not been made

		&lt;p&gt;
			ExxonMobil 
      reinforced its long-term supply commitment to the fast-growing 
      Asia-Pacific market today during an event celebrating the expansion of 
      its Singapore chemical production facility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Global chemical demand will grow at a faster pace than GDP as people 
      seek higher standards of living and purchase more household and packaged 
      goods manufactured with chemical products,&#8221; Rex W. Tillerson, Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:&#160;XOM) chairman and chief executive officer, said 
      at the event.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Two-thirds of that growth in chemical demand will be here in the 
      Asia-Pacific region. ExxonMobil&#8217;s expanded Singapore chemical plant is 
      uniquely positioned to serve these growth markets &#8211; from China to the 
      Indian subcontinent and beyond.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil&#8217;s expansion project doubled the size of its finished product 
      capacity in Singapore, making it the largest chemical expansion in the 
      company&#8217;s history.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Singapore chemical facility, which now accounts for about 
      one-quarter of ExxonMobil&#8217;s global chemical capacity, incorporates more 
      than 40 new proprietary technologies and is designed to be one of 
      ExxonMobil&#8217;s most energy efficient and flexible sites. For example, a 
      new steam cracker can process an unprecedented range of feedstock, from 
      light gases to crude oil, to produce an expanded slate of premium and 
      commodity petrochemicals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tillerson noted that the foundation for the advancements at the 
      Singapore complex were established decades ago and strengthened through 
      the company&#8217;s relationships with and respect for the people and nation 
      of Singapore. &#8220;Government leaders here wisely pursued a stable policy 
      course that encouraged international investment, teamwork and advanced 
      technologies,&#8221; Tillerson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Leo Yip, chairman of the Singapore Economic Development Board, said, 
      &#8220;The official opening of ExxonMobil&#8217;s Singapore Chemical Plant Expansion 
      enhances Singapore&#8217;s leadership position as Asia&#8217;s energy and chemicals 
      hub. This latest investment &#8211; the single largest manufacturing 
      investment in Singapore&#8217;s history &#8211; is testament to our ability to 
      successfully attract and execute complex mega-projects. The expansion of 
      ExxonMobil&#8217;s chemical plant will create meaningful and exciting career 
      opportunities for Singaporeans and also enable Singapore to broaden our 
      chemicals industry with higher-value downstream chemical facilities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Png Cheong Boon, CEO, JTC Corporation, said, &#8220;The opening of 
      ExxonMobil&#8217;s chemical plant is a testimony of the excellent 
      infrastructure on Jurong Island and the strong partnership with 
      ExxonMobil. We remain committed to work with the industry to ensure that 
      Jurong Island remains a key energy and chemical hub in the region.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tillerson said that Singapore&#8217;s leadership has built a nation that 
      promotes openness, transparency and free trade that enable progress 
      through the exchange of talent, goods, services and ideas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil has operated in Singapore for 120 years and is one of the 
      country&#8217;s largest foreign manufacturing investors. The company employs 
      2,000 people at its refining and chemical production complex in 
      Singapore. ExxonMobil cogeneration facilities, with capacity of 360 
      megawatts, meet the steam and electricity needs of the manufacturing 
      complex, resulting in lower operating costs and reduced greenhouse gas 
      emissions.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is closer to naming a new chief executive, according to a source familiar with the board's thinking, but it lost a front-runner candidate on Tuesday when Ford Motor Co's (F.N) chief, Alan Mulally, said he would not be going to the software giant.&lt;/p&gt;

familiar with Microsoft's board's discussions said Mulally's
candidacy raised questions about "culture and leadership style".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulally's apparent interest in the job attracted
considerable media attention that overshadowed Ford's
product-related announcements, such as the roll-out of the new
Mustang, something that frustrated Ford's board of directors,
people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 7 (Reuters) - An infrastructure fund run by
Goldman Sachs has sold its stake in the holding company
of SSA Marine, one of the world's largest privately held port
operators, the firm said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GS Infrastructure Partners, which bought into the company 
in mid-2007, and other institutional investors sold their shares
in SSA Marine's ultimate parent company, FRS Capital Corp, to
the founding Smith/Hemingway family, SSA said in a release on
its website. After the deal, Mexican businessman Fernando Chico
Pardo took a 49 percent share in the business, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial details of the transaction were not released. A
Goldman spokesman was not immediately available to comment on
the reason for the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction comes as pressure mounts on Wall Street
banks to get out of physical commodity trading because of 
concerns about their role in the raw material supply chain. SSA
Marine is not a commodity trader but is involved in several
large coal export terminals as well as container ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co agreed to pay $2.6 billion to the U.S. government and Bernard Madoff victims to settle allegations that the bank failed to tell authorities about its suspicions of fraud at Madoff's fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as the bank cut its exposure to Madoff's fund to minimize its losses it what ended up being a $17.3 billion Ponzi scheme, JPMorgan never shared its doubts with U.S. authorities, government prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bank connected the dots when it mattered to its own profit but was not so diligent when it came to its legal obligations," Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In part because of that failure, for decades, Bernie Madoff was able to launder billions of dollars in Ponzi proceeds essentially through a single set of accounts at JPMorgan," Bharara added. The bank's $1.7 billion settlement with the Department of Justice, part of the larger deal announced Tuesday, is the largest forfeiture a bank has ever had to pay to resolve anti-money laundering violations. The deal does not include charges against individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement is only the latest of JPMorgan's legal difficulties. In November, the bank agreed to a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the bank's mortgage bonds. JPMorgan still faces at least eight other government probes, covering everything from its hiring practices in China to whether it manipulated the Libor benchmark interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are big payouts, even to a bank whose profit has topped $20 billion a year. The Madoff settlement underscores how being the largest U.S. bank can be a hindrance as well as a benefit to JPMorgan. Like its Wall Street rivals, JPMorgan a colossus in which internal communication is often imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We recognize we could have done a better job pulling together various pieces of information and concerns about Madoff from different parts of the bank over time," JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti said in an email. The bank filed a notice of suspicious activity with regulators in London in October 2008, but not in the United States, he acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "We do not believe that any JPMorgan Chase employee knowingly assisted Madoff's Ponzi scheme."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice agreed to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the bank as part of its settlement. Tuesday's deal also settles probes by multiple bank regulators into failures in JPMorgan's anti-money laundering policies. The bank agreed to improve its controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts viewed the $1.7 billion forfeiture as a tough penalty for JPMorgan, but several questioned why no individuals faced charges over the bank's failure to alert authorities for more than a decade to concerns about Madoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite those egregious facts, it appears that no person, no bank official, no bank employee, not a single one, is going to be held personally accountable for the scandal," said former Treasury Department official Jimmy Gurule, now a professor at Notre Dame University's law school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said Tuesday afternoon that the tab for the settlements will reduce fourth-quarter results by about $850 million, after the bank had already set aside money to cover most of the expenses. In the third quarter, the bank set aside another $7.2 billion to cover expected legal losses, bringing the total funds it had stockpiled for settlements to $23 billion. The settlement payments announced on Tuesday are not tax-deductible, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had been expected to make about $5.13 billion in the quarter, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. Shares of JPMorgan fell 1.3 percent to $58.26 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement also includes a $350 million penalty from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In private litigation, the bank will pay $218 million to settle the class action suit and $325 million to settle a U.S. bankruptcy trustee's suit. The Department of Justice portion of the payout will go to Madoff's victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bank was clearly willfully blind, I think, to detecting and reporting suspicious transactions to the Treasury Department," Gurule said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the transactions had been reported, it is not clear if Madoff would have been shut down. Analyst Harry Markopolos told the Securities and Exchange Commission multiple times about his suspicions about Madoff's consistently good returns, and was ignored by the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'JUST ONE BIG LIE'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madoff was a quiet force for years on Wall Street, serving at one time as the chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Through his Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC hedge fund, he operated the largest Ponzi scheme that has ever been uncovered. It collapsed in December 2008 after he told senior employees at his firm "it's all just one big lie" and turned himself in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madoff pleaded guilty in 2009 of defrauding thousands of investors and is serving a 150-year prison sentence. Investors lost $17.3 billion in principal, the bankruptcy court trustee has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1986 until his arrest in 2008, Madoff kept an account at JPMorgan Chase, or banks it had bought, according to the statement of facts the bank agreed to disclose as part of its settlement with the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account at the bank received deposits and transfers of about $150 billion, almost exclusively from investors in Madoff Securities, yet the money was not used to buy securities as Madoff had promised, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, in the 1990's Madoff routinely transferred money between two accounts, one held at an undisclosed bank and one at JPMorgan held by Norman Levy, one of its most important private banking clients. Levy is described only as a "private bank client" in the government's statement of facts, but he is named in the lawsuit filed against JPMorgan by the Madoff bankruptcy trustee Irving Picard, according to a source familiar with an unredacted copy of the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levy died in 2005 at the age of 93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the statement of facts, Levy and Madoff wrote checks back and forth to each other each day to take advantage of normal delays in the check-clearing process and make it seem as though the accounts had more money than they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan paid interest on the inflated amount in Levy's account and continued dealing with Madoff even after the other bank notified it of the scheme, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An employee of JPMorgan's private bank said in a 1994 memo that "the daily cost associated" with Madoff's withdrawals was "outrageous." But when the employee tried to tell Levy about the scheme, Levy responded: "If Bernie is using the float, it is fine with me; he makes a lot of money for my account."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While people in some parts of JPMorgan failed to take their suspicions about Madoff's results to people in other parts of the giant company and the U.S. government, they moved quickly enough to withdraw money from Madoff-related entities and save the company some $200 million right before Madoff was arrested, according to the statement of facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first two weeks of October 2008, JPMorgan's "Equity Exotics Desk" sought to reduce its exposure to hedge funds following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan's earlier takeover of Bear Stearns. On October 16, 2008, an analyst in Equity Exotics assigned to scrutinize investments wrote a long email compiling suspicions about Madoff, including his "lack of transparency," use of small and unknown accounting firms and resistance "to provide meaningful disclosure" on his exceptionally good returns, according to the statement of facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan official in London reviewed the analyst's memo and filed a suspicious activity report with the U.K. Serious Organised Crime Agency saying Madoff's consistently superior performance seemed "to appear too good to be true -- meaning that it probably is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said JPMorgan was redeeming 300 million euros from two Madoff feeder funds out of a total of 350 million euros. JPMorgan took additional steps involving structured products linked to Madoff funds to limit possible losses. Without these steps, JPMorgan would have lost $250 million instead of the $40 million loss it booked, according to the statement of facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan's deferred prosecution agreement with prosecutors runs a normal course, Bharara will seek to dismiss the criminal charges against the bank at the end of the two-year period. The settlement does not include detailed descriptions of how JPMorgan is expected to improve its anti-money laundering efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Emily Flitter and David Henry, additional reporting by Aruna Viswanatha, Karen Freifeld Jonathan Stempel and Joseph Ax,; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Bernadette Baum and Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

million loss it booked, according to the statement of facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan's deferred prosecution agreement with prosecutors runs a normal
course, Bharara will seek to dismiss the criminal charges against the bank at
the end of the two-year period. The settlement does not include detailed
descriptions of how JPMorgan is expected to improve its anti-money laundering
efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fabrice Tourre, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice president who was found liable for defrauding investors over a failed mortgage transaction, has failed to persuade a federal judge to dismiss the case or give him a new trial.&lt;/p&gt;

It said Tourre's lawyer has advised that Tourre intends to keep enough assets there to cover a maximum penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest did not rule on that request on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pamela Chepiga, a partner at Allen &amp; Overy who is representing Tourre, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Forrest's decision or the SEC request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been paying Tourre's legal fees, and an appeal is possible after a penalty is assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre has become a symbol of the 2008 financial crisis, in part because of an email in which he referred to himself as "fabulous Fab."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC case remains one of the government's biggest legal victories over conduct said to have contributed to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many individuals have been sued by the SEC and other regulators, few have gone to trial.

&lt;p&gt;* Tourre argues judge incorrectly instructed jurors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Judge says "no merit" to Tourre's argument on conviction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* SEC seeking $1.15 million, including fine, from Tourre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* SEC worried Tourre might lend funds and be unable to pay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Fabrice Tourre, the former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice president who was found
liable for defrauding investors over a failed mortgage
transaction, has failed to persuade a federal judge to dismiss
the case or give him a new trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan said on
Tuesday that jurors did not make a mistake on Aug. 1 in finding
Tourre liable on six of the seven civil charges brought by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre was accused of engineering a 2007 transaction that
enabled a hedge fund run by billionaire John Paulson to reap a
big profit while costing investors $1 billion in losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He argued that his conduct did not amount to fraud, that
there was a lack of evidence to support such a finding, and that
Forrest had instructed jurors incorrectly on the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"None of these arguments has merit," the judge concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest is still reviewing an SEC request that Tourre pay
$1.15 million, including a $910,000 fine, as punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case took an unusual turn on Tuesday when the SEC,
citing information learned through "law enforcement channels,"
said Tourre was planning by Jan. 9 to transfer 300,000 pounds
(about $492,000) out of a UK bank account and lend it to a close
relative who was buying an apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerned this might leave Tourre short of funds, the SEC
asked Forrest to direct that he keep $1.15 million in a U.S.

representing Tourre, did not immediately respond to requests for
comment on Forrest's decision or the SEC request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been paying Tourre's legal fees, and an appeal
is possible after a penalty is assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre has become a symbol of the 2008 financial crisis, in
part because of an email in which he referred to himself as
"fabulous Fab."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC case remains one of the government's biggest legal
victories over conduct said to have contributed to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many individuals have been sued by the SEC and other
regulators, few have gone to trial. The SEC has not charged any
senior executives at major banks, and Tourre has argued that the
regulator made him a scapegoat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOTTOM LINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jurors found Tourre liable for misleading investors in a
2007 synthetic collateralized debt obligation called Abacus
2007-AC1 by concealing how Paulson had helped construct the
transaction and bet that it would fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also said Tourre misled ACA Capital Holdings Inc, which
also chose assets for Abacus, into believing Paulson's firm
would be an equity investor in the CDO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre claimed that several charges should be dismissed
because they were premised on the charge on which he was held
not liable, but the judge disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bottom line is that Tourre and Goldman Sachs designed a
transaction with Paulson to enable Paulson to short a weak
quality portfolio of residential mortgage-backed securities,"
Forrest wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A jury could reasonably infer that informing the long
investors that ACA had selected the portfolio -- while leaving
out that Paulson was a short and had also selected the portfolio
-- was a necessary part of making the fraudulent scheme a
success," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a "short" position means that an investor is betting
a security will fall in value, while taking a "long" position is
a bet that the price of the security will rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest also rejected Tourre's claim that there was no
evidence that Abacus influenced his salary or bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said jurors could reasonably conclude that Abacus
qualified as a "domestic" transaction under a 2010 Supreme Court
precedent, Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd, to justify
liability under U.S. securities laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester said: "We are pleased with the
decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman agreed in a July 2010 settlement with the SEC to pay
$550 million over Abacus, without admitting wrongdoing. Tourre
later began pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University

District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has agreed to settle two private lawsuits stemming from its relationship with convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff, according to a court filing on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will pay $218 million to resolve a class-action suit and $325 million to resolve claims by Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, the filing in Manhattan federal court shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlements, which must be approved by a judge, were announced just after the bank struck a deal with U.S. prosecutors and bank regulators to pay more than $2 billion to resolve charges that it failed to follow up on suspicious activity by Madoff, who was a client of the bank for more than two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank agreed to pay an additional $18 million to cover legal fees and expenses, also subject to court approval, the filing shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard has estimated that Madoff's Ponzi scheme cost investors $17.3 billion of principal. Madoff pleaded guilty in 2009 and is serving a 150-year prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Investment bankers working in London for many top U.S. and European groups face a major overhaul of their pay structure, as their recent bonuses have far exceeded new EU rules which will curb payouts to be made this time next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Bank of America (BAC.N), Barclays (BARC.L) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) paid bonuses to leading staff which ranged from 3.3 to 5.4 times their fixed pay for 2012, according to data disclosed by the banks and Reuters calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big changes will therefore have to be made to meet the European Union rules which cap bonuses at the same level as fixed pay, or double if the bank's shareholders approve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers' bonuses remain a hot topic among politicians and the public. Many blame their high levels for encouraging reckless risk-taking that led to the 2008/09 financial crisis and a series of mis-selling and misconduct scandals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks usually pay staff bonuses in January or February based on their performance the previous year. So while the EU curbs came into force this month, they will be applied first to bonuses for 2014 to be handed out early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major banks continued to reward their top risk-taking staff heavily on performance in bonuses for 2012, their regulatory disclosures have showed in the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid its top 115 UK staff an average of $4.67 million each for 2012, an increase of three-quarters from the average for 2011 and the highest of the major banks. The bank's earnings and revenues jumped in 2012 from 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $350 million of Goldman's total salary bill for these bankers was paid in bonuses, or 5.2 times what it gave in fixed pay - jumping from a ratio of 2.2 times in 2011 - according to Reuters calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks are expected to increase fixed pay and reduce bonuses to meet the new rules, although Barclays (BARC.L), HSBC (HSBA.L) and others are coming up with innovative ways to cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays plans to give its senior bankers additional monthly payments. The new "role-based pay" element - on top of base salary and variable bonuses - will be for employees occupying specific risk-taking roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of this will be in cash, although top-up payments to members of its executive committee may be in shares, following discussions with shareholders, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC plans to hand new share awards to about 1,000 of its top staff, an industry source said, adding that the plan would have characteristics of variable pay but qualify as fixed pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A LOT OF CREATIVITY"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and others are considering similar shifts to Barclays and HSBC to keep some flexibility on pay and meet the bonus rules, industry sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears there's a lot of creativity going on," said Peter Hahn from London's Cass Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 10,000 staff are expected to be covered by the rules. Bankers earning more than 500,000 euros a year will be affected, although the EU banking watchdog watered down requirements last month and said some staff earning that amount could be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of other banks also bust the new rules for 2012, according to data released for their UK "code staff", which covers all people in significant risk-taking positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan paid 126 code staff an average of 2.09 million pounds ($3.4 million), and variable pay was 5.4 times fixed pay. Bank of America paid its code staff an average of 1.5 million pounds, with variable pay 5.4 times fixed pay. Its senior managers received 12 times more in variable pay than salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British government is fighting the rule in Europe's highest court and many banks in London have opposed the cap, saying it will force up fixed salaries, provide less scope to claw back pay and encourage staff to move to banks in the United States or Asia which are not constrained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other leading banks, top UK staff at Credit Suisse earned an average of $2.28 million in 2012, up 8 percent from 2011, and bonuses were 3.3 times fixed pay, according to data released just before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure for British-based Nomura (9716.T) bankers was an average of $2.37 million each in the year to March 2013, and bonuses amounted to 3.1 times fixed pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays had previously disclosed it paid its 393 code staff an average of 1.37 million pounds each in 2012, and variable pay was 4.3 times fixed pay, while HSBC paid its code staff an average of $1.68 million each in 2012, and variable pay was 2.7 times fixed pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hahn at Cass said it was "disappointing" that overall pay levels were not coming down, as returns for shareholders at many banks are still lagging the cost of equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an industry that still needs to deal with cost cutting...it's still an industry that appears to be paying as if it's a high return business, and it isn't," Hahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks either declined to comment, could not immediately be reached, or said they were considering their options in regard to future pay structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rules cover pay for 2014, but will not affect bonuses for 2013 that will be handed out in the next two months. Bonus details will start coming out from U.S. banks reporting results from next week, and are expected to be flat to slightly higher across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over 3,500 bankers in Europe earned 1 million euros or more last year, and more than three-quarters of those were based in Britain, partly reflecting London's dominance as a financial hub and the European hub for global banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(editing by David Stamp)&lt;/p&gt;

and a series of mis-selling and misconduct scandals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks usually pay staff bonuses in January or February based
on their performance the previous year. So while the EU curbs
came into force this month, they will be applied first to
bonuses for 2014 to be handed out early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major banks continued to reward their top risk-taking staff
heavily on performance in bonuses for 2012, their regulatory
disclosures have showed in the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid its top 115 UK staff an average of $4.67
million each for 2012, an increase of three-quarters from the
average for 2011 and the highest of the major banks. The bank's
earnings and revenues jumped in 2012 from 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $350 million of Goldman's total salary bill for these
bankers was paid in bonuses, or 5.2 times what it gave in fixed
pay - jumping from a ratio of 2.2 times in 2011 - according to
Reuters calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks are expected to increase fixed pay and reduce bonuses
to meet the new rules, although Barclays, HSBC 
and others are coming up with innovative ways to cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays plans to give its senior bankers additional monthly
payments. The new "role-based pay" element - on top of base
salary and variable bonuses - will be for employees occupying
specific risk-taking roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of this will be in cash, although top-up payments to
members of its executive committee may be in shares, following
discussions with shareholders, a person familiar with the matter
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC plans to hand new share awards to about 1,000 of its
top staff, an industry source said, adding that the plan would
have characteristics of variable pay but qualify as fixed pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A LOT OF CREATIVITY"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and others are considering similar shifts to
Barclays and HSBC to keep some flexibility on pay and meet the
bonus rules, industry sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears there's a lot of creativity going on," said
Peter Hahn from London's Cass Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 10,000 staff are expected to be covered by the rules.
Bankers earning more than 500,000 euros a year will be affected,
although the EU banking watchdog watered down requirements last
month and said some staff earning that amount could be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of other banks also bust the new rules for 2012,
according to data released for their UK "code staff", which
covers all people in significant risk-taking positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan paid 126 code staff an average of 2.09 million
pounds ($3.4 million), and variable pay was 5.4 times fixed pay.
Bank of America paid its code staff an average of 1.5 million
pounds, with variable pay 5.4 times fixed pay. Its senior
managers received 12 times more in variable pay than salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British government is fighting the rule in Europe's
highest court and many banks in London have opposed the cap,
saying it will force up fixed salaries, provide less scope to
claw back pay and encourage staff to move to banks in the United
States or Asia which are not constrained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other leading banks, top UK staff at Credit Suisse
earned an average of $2.28 million in 2012, up 8 percent from
2011, and bonuses were 3.3 times fixed pay, according to data
released just before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure for British-based Nomura bankers was an
average of $2.37 million each in the year to March 2013, and
bonuses amounted to 3.1 times fixed pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays had previously disclosed it paid its 393 code staff
an average of 1.37 million pounds each in 2012, and variable pay
was 4.3 times fixed pay, while HSBC paid its code staff an
average of $1.68 million each in 2012, and variable pay was 2.7
times fixed pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hahn at Cass said it was "disappointing" that overall pay
levels were not coming down, as returns for shareholders at many
banks are still lagging the cost of equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an industry that still needs to deal with cost
cutting...it's still an industry that appears to be paying as if
it's a high return business, and it isn't," Hahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks either declined to comment, could not immediately be
reached, or said they were considering their options in regard
to future pay structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rules cover pay for 2014, but will not affect
bonuses for 2013 that will be handed out in the next two months.
Bonus details will start coming out from U.S. banks reporting
results from next week, and are expected to be flat to slightly
higher across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over 3,500 bankers in Europe earned 1 million euros or
more last year, and more than three-quarters of those were based
in Britain, partly reflecting London's dominance as a financial
hub and the European hub for global banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAY FOR UK BANK STAFF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANK              NO. OF UK    AVG CODE    VARIABLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CODE STAFF   STAFF PAY   VS FIXED

			SIPA Trustee Announces Settlement Agreements Reached with JPMorgan 
      Chase in Madoff Fraud
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Two Agreements Recover Approximately $543 Million for Madoff Victims
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			
			
			Press release from the office of Irving H. Picard, Securities 
      Investor Protection Act (SIPA)&#160;Trustee for the liquidation of Bernard L. 
      Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BLMIS)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Irving H. Picard, SIPA Trustee for the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff 
      Investment Securities LLC, today filed two motions with the United 
      States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York seeking 
      approval of recovery agreements totaling approximately $543 million for 
      the benefit of BLMIS customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The motions seek court approval to settle the avoidance claims asserted 
      by the SIPA Trustee against JPMorgan for $325 million, as well as common 
      law claims brought separately by the SIPA Trustee and in a class action 
      lawsuit, which mirrored the claims developed by the SIPA Trustee&#8217;s legal 
      team, for $218 million. The SIPA Trustee&#8217;s original complaint was filed 
      in December 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Of the $325 million that JPMC will pay to the SIPA Trustee, $50 million 
      will be given to the joint liquidators of the Fairfield Sentry Funds for 
      distribution to the indirect investors in the Fairfield Sentry Funds, as 
      part of the cooperative agreement reached in May 2011 to share a 
      percentage of certain future recoveries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am extremely proud of both the legal and investigative work conducted 
      by David Sheehan, the legal team at BakerHostetler and our other 
      advisors in uncovering and documenting the facts about JPMorgan&#8217;s 
      relationship with Madoff,&#8221; said Mr. Picard.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Concurrently, the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern 
      District of New York announced a deferred prosecution agreement with 
      JPMorgan relating to Madoff, resulting in a $1.7 billion civil 
      forfeiture payment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I want to thank the Securities Investor Protection Corporation for 
      providing the financial support that allowed us to perform the extensive 
      investigations and legal work needed to unravel Madoff&#8217;s fraud and 
      develop our compelling claims,&#8221; said Mr. Picard. &#8220;Most importantly, 
      today&#8217;s settlement is a great step toward making a distribution in 2014.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The JPMorgan settlement monies for the BLMIS Customer Fund and the Class 
      Settlement Fund will become available once final, unappealable court 
      orders are reached for each of the settlements. Distributions from the 
      respective settlements will be made as soon as practicable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SIPA Trustee&#8217;s Bankruptcy Avoidance Claims
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan paid $325 million to settle the SIPA Trustee&#8217;s avoidance claims 
      as part of the compromise settlement. JPMorgan approached the SIPA 
      Trustee several months ago seeking a negotiated resolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      David J. Sheehan, Chief Counsel to the SIPA Trustee, said, &#8220;As always, 
      we must weigh the uncertainty, costs and risks of litigation versus the 
      benefits of settlement. This compromise with JPMorgan allows us to 
      sidestep those pitfalls while recovering additional, significant monies 
      for the BLMIS Customer Fund, which will flow as quickly as possible to 
      BLMIS customers with allowed claims.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This settlement brings the SIPA Trustee&#8217;s recoveries to date to 
      approximately $9.783 billion for the BLMIS Customer Fund, or 55.9 
      percent of the estimated $17.5 billion in principal that was lost in the 
      Ponzi scheme by BLMIS customers who filed claims.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Class Settlement Agreement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, JPMorgan has agreed to pay $218 million to settle common 
      law claims brought by the SIPA Trustee and in a related class action 
      lawsuit.&#160;These common law claims were developed by the SIPA Trustee and 
      set forth in his complaint against JPMorgan in December 2010. The class 
      action complaint alleged similar claims. The settlement of the common 
      law claims was jointly entered into by the SIPA Trustee and the class 
      action representatives, Paul Shapiro and Stephen and Leyla Hill, who 
      filed two related common law class actions against JPMorgan, which were 
      later consolidated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If approved by the District Court, the settlement class will consist of 
      BLMIS customers who had capital directly invested with BLMIS and had net 
      losses, regardless of whether they filed a claim in the SIPA proceeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Court rulings denying the SIPA Trustee&#8217;s standing to bring common law 
      causes of action led to the filing of the class action. Mr. Sheehan 
      noted that the SIPA Trustee appealed to the United States Supreme Court 
      on his right to bring common law claims against major financial 
      institutions on October 8, 2013. As part of the settlement, the SIPA 
      Trustee agreed to withdraw the petition in the JPMorgan case. Regardless 
      of the outcome of that appeal, he said, the SIPA Trustee&#8217;s bankruptcy 
      claims of approximately $3.5 billion remain outstanding against HSBC, 
      UBS and Unicredit. Absent additional settlements, those cases will 
      advance through the judicial process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Sheehan noted that, as part of the agreement, AlixPartners LLP will 
      be appointed Claims Administrator for the Class Settlement 
      Fund.&#160;AlixPartners serves as the SIPA Trustee&#8217;s claims agent in the SIPA 
      liquidation of BLMIS and has access to all updated information on 
      allowed claims and prior distributions made by the SIPA Trustee. Mr. 
      Sheehan also noted that the SIPA Trustee will make his documentation of 
      customers with allowed claims available to facilitate distribution of 
      the Class Settlement Fund and to vastly reduce potential administrative 
      costs. The Bankruptcy Court hearing for approval of the settlement 
      motions is scheduled for February 4, 2014 at 10 a.m.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to Mr. Sheehan, the SIPA Trustee acknowledges the 
      contributions of the BakerHostetler attorneys who worked on the 
      matter:&#160;Deborah Renner, Oren Warshavsky, Keith Murphy, Seanna Brown, and 
      Sarah Truong.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 7 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has
agreed to settle two private lawsuits stemming from its
relationship with convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff,
according to a court filing on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank will pay $218 million to resolve a class-action
suit and $325 million to resolve claims by Irving Picard, the
trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC,
the filing in Manhattan federal court shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlements, which must be approved by a judge, were
announced just after the bank struck a deal with U.S.
prosecutors and bank regulators to pay more than $2 billion to
resolve charges that it failed to follow up on suspicious
activity by Madoff, who was a client of the bank for more than
two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank agreed to pay an additional $18 million to cover
legal fees and expenses, also subject to court approval, the
filing shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard has estimated that Madoff's Ponzi scheme cost
investors $17.3 billion of principal. Madoff pleaded guilty in
2009 and is serving a 150-year prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

      As World Cup fever grips soccer fans across the globe, Coca-Cola is 
      giving young players the opportunity of a lifetime: the chance to win a 
      trip to the Copa Coca-Cola&#174; Soccer Camp in Brazil during the 2014 FIFA 
      World Cup&#8482;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Copa Coca-Cola is an international youth soccer tournament played in 60 
      countries around the world. The tournament, taking place in the U.S. 
      starting February 22, will allow more than 4,000 teens between the ages 
      of 13 and 15 to get active and take part in the excitement leading up to 
      the 2014 FIFA World Cup&#8482;. Four players from the national championship 
      teams (two boys and two girls) will have the opportunity to participate 
      in the Copa Coca-Cola Soccer Camp in Brazil, a unique experience with 
      more than 150 other young players from around the world, all Copa 
      Coca-Cola participants of their country&#8217;s national tournament.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Copa Coca-Cola is more than a game. It is an opportunity for teens to 
      be active while playing the sport they love. We want to keep inspiring 
      teens to lead active healthy lives, form lasting friendships and follow 
      their dreams. Through Copa Coca-Cola participants truly become part of 
      the FIFA World Cup&#8482; fervor. It&#8217;s an amazing experience that brings 
      people together from all over the world,&#8221; said Alba Adamo, Group 
      Director of Hispanic Marketing at The Coca-Cola Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The free tournament is made possible with help from official partners 
      including McDonald&#8217;s, Walgreens and the Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG&#174;), 
      the award-winning loyalty program from Starwood Hotels  Resorts 
      Worldwide, Inc. To participate, teens must sign-up for the tournament as 
      part of a five to seven-player team at www.copa.coca-cola.com 
      starting January 1 through February 16. The first 30 boys&#8217; teams and 30 
      girls&#8217; teams to register in each participating market will get the 
      opportunity to be part of Copa Coca-Cola.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am proud to join Coca-Cola in promoting physical activity through 
      soccer,&#8221; said Alex Morgan, U.S. Women&#8217;s Soccer Olympic Gold Medalist. 
      &#8220;Soccer has had a huge impact on my life and Copa Coca-Cola will allow 
      me to share my love and passion for the game with a whole new generation 
      of players. Coca-Cola is hosting the tournament in the U.S. at the 
      perfect time. The FIFA World Cup&#8482; brings people together through their 
      love of soccer and Copa Coca-Cola only adds to the excitement.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The tournament&#8217;s local phase, which begins February 22, will be held in 
      ten U.S. Cities: San Jose, Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, Dallas, San 
      Antonio, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta and New York. The winning teams from 
      each local tournament will travel to Los Angeles to compete in one 
      national tournament April 18 - 20.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Copa Coca-Cola national final will be a part of weekend-long 
      festivities, including the culmination of the global FIFA World Cup 
      Trophy Tour&#8482; at StubHub Center. In anticipation of the sport&#8217;s biggest 
      tournament, Coca-Cola and FIFA have taken the iconic FIFA World Cup 
      Trophy to 88 countries around the world, and are bringing it to its 89th 
      and final destination with stops in four cities across the United 
      States. The Tour has given more than one million people around the world 
      the chance to experience soccer&#8217;s most coveted prize in their own 
      communities, getting a taste of the celebration before it heads to 
      Brazil.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Eastwood Homes Switches From Sage Timberline to Microsoft Dynamics 
      NAV, Gaining Flexibility, Power, and Performance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			NAV Now Integrates with BuilderMT, Expanding Accounting Options for 
      WMS Users, Old and New
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BuilderMT, 
      the widely-acknowledged market share leader in workflow management 
      solutions for home builders, today announced that it recently worked 
      with implementation partner Western 
      Computer to switch Eastwood 
      Homes from Sage 
      300 CRE Accounting (Timberline) to Microsoft 
      Dynamics NAV. Eastwood Homes will continue to use BuilderMT, a 
      system they have depended on for years, while taking advantage of the 
      new integration between BuilderMT&#8217;s WMS and Microsoft Dynamics NAV.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Eastwood Homes will start more than 850 homes in 2013, and move to over 
      1,000 starts in 2014, when the Company will hit $200 million in 
      revenues. With 160 employees, including 60 jobsite superintendents, 
      Eastwood Homes operates in six divisions throughout North Carolina, 
      South Carolina, and Virginia. With operations of that size, Eastwood 
      Homes had clearly outgrown Sage 300 CRE Accounting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Sage does not have the reporting that we need. Timberline uses a 
      database from Pervasive Software, but our operations are in Microsoft 
      SQL,&#8221; explains Kevin Hutchins, Eastwood Homes&#8217; CFO. &#8220;Plus because of 
      technical limitations, Timberline simply doesn&#8217;t have the processing 
      power that other accounting packages can offer. We realized we had to 
      make a switch in our accounting package, especially now that we plan to 
      increase to 1,000 starts.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Why the choice of Microsoft Dynamics NAV? Eastwood was impressed by how 
      the Microsoft Dynamics NAV solution provides Dashboards, as well as 
      NAV&#8217;s ability to quickly see the timely and correct information to help manage 
      by exception and aid in improved decision making.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the new NAV solution, everything is updated in real time, which was 
      not possible with the old Sage solution. Microsoft Dynamics NAV also has 
      an excellent user experience with navigation and system speed. Plus, the 
      Microsoft Role Tailored experience provides only those reports 
      and applications relevant to each user, and that reduces confusion and 
      speeds up training.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Translation of our data from Timberline to NAV has not been a 
      challenge,&#8221; Hutchins added. &#8220;We get it all into a spreadsheet and 
      Western Computer works with us to get it into Microsoft Dynamics NAV. 
      The majority of the work required in the data migration is creating the 
      spreadsheet from the current system.&#8221;

			Entwistle  Cappucci LLP, Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Announce 
      Proposed Settlement of Claims Against JPMorgan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Co-Lead Counsel for the Class of BLMIS/Madoff customers have announced a 
      settlement (&#8220;Class Action Settlement&#8221;) of all potential claims against 
      JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates 
      (&#8220;JPMorgan&#8221;). The proposed Class Action Settlement will be 
      contemporaneously presented by motions for approval to both United 
      States District Court Judge McMahon and to Bankruptcy Court Judge 
      Lifland.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The settlement of this Class Action is one part of a multi-part 
      resolution of Madoff-related litigation against JPMorgan involving 
      simultaneous, separately negotiated settlements, which include the Class 
      Action Settlement in the amount of $218 million, the SIPA Trustee&#8217;s 
      Avoidance Action settlement in the amount of $325 million, and a 
      resolution with the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of 
      New York that includes a civil forfeiture in the amount of $1.7 billion. 
      The payments by JPMorgan in connection with these agreements will total 
      $2.243 billion and will benefit victims of Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Co-Lead Counsel for the customers, Andrew Entwistle of Entwistle  
      Cappucci LLP and Reed Kathrein of Hagens Berman, were especially pleased 
      with the settlement. Attorney Entwistle observed that: &#8220;It is 
      particularly appropriate that shortly after the 5th 
      anniversary of Madoff&#8217;s arrest these settlements with JPMorgan will 
      result in such substantial recoveries for Madoff victims.&#8221; Entwistle 
      also observed that &#8220;In negotiating the Class Action Settlement, Class 
      Counsel&#8217;s singular goal was to maximize the recoveries of 
      customer-victims of Madoff&#8217;s fraud. In our view, this goal has been 
      achieved in spectacular fashion.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Attorney Kathrein observed: &#8220;This settlement reflects the cooperative 
      efforts of our team and the Trustee and represents a favorable and 
      economically sound resolution to what would otherwise have been a costly 
      and protracted legal battle.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 7 (Reuters) - Fabrice Tourre, a former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc vice president found liable for
securities fraud over a failed mortgage transaction, has failed
to persuade a federal judge to dismiss the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission case against him or to set a new trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan on
Tuesday rejected Tourre's contention that his jury had erred in
finding him liable on six of the seven civil charges he faced
over the transaction, which the SEC said caused $1 billion of
investor losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pamela Chepiga, an attorney for Tourre, was not immediately

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN (Reuters) - Boxes filled with bananas and cocaine were delivered to five Berlin supermarkets in what police on Tuesday called a "logistical error" by drug smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supermarket staff discovered the containers with a total of 140 kg of cocaine on Monday shortly before the fruit went on sale to the public, police and customs investigators said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the largest discovery of cocaine in Germany's capital in about 15 years and has an estimated black market value of 6 million euros, according to police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were of course surprised," senior police officer Olaf Schremm, who heads the local drug investigation department, told reporters.

			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Jan 7, 2014) - SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCQB: SMME), a developer of patented biometric products, announced today that an expert witness has provided key evidence in support of the Company's patent infringement suit against Visa, Inc. and MasterCard International. The Company recently announced it has submitted a brief to the United States Federal Circuit Court for its $13.4 billion claim for damages and pre-paid royalties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Edward Gussin, an expert witness who specializes in electrical engineering, provided testimony that documents submitted to the court by Visa and MasterCard in their own defense, directly show they infringed. Mr. Gussin further shows that the defendants' EMVsystems technology contains all six elements of SmartMetric's independent claims in our patent," stated SmartMetric President and CEO Chaya Hendrick. "We look forward to further developments in this case, which are expected in the coming months." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Gussin is an electrical engineer with 30-plus years of experience. He has extensive expert witness testimony experience in the fields of electronics, computer hardware and software, video game technology, and electrical engineering. His expertise includes in-court testimony, strategy development, brief preparation, research in patent infringement litigation and Markman hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are excerpts pertaining to Mr. Gussin's expert findings submitted to the court in the court brief filed by SmartMetric, which can be found at: www.smartmetric.blogspot.com: &lt;/p&gt;
			
				"...Gussin identifies Defendants' own documents, produced by Defendants in this case, which show that Defendants' EMVsystems contain all 6 elements in SmartMetric's independent claims 1 and 14."
					
				
				"...Gussin's expert opinion that Defendants' EMVsystems include all six elements in the asserted claims, and therefore infringe, based on Defendants' own documents and deposition admissions."
					
				
				"...all evidence (A)-(C) was uncontroverted, because Defendants' witnesses did not claim to have reviewed Defendants' documents that Gussin's Declarations relied on as showing Defendants' infringement, did not contest what Gussin said, and did not file any Declarations, or any other evidence, rebutting Gussin's&#160;analysis."

			&lt;p&gt;Consumers Use Preva to Track Fitness Activity as Part of Their Complete Picture of Health&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;WOODINVILLE, WA and LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - Jan 7, 2014) - &#160;2014 International CES (South Hall 2 Booth #26923) -- Precor&#174;, the company that introduced the world to the elliptical fitness crosstrainer and other breakthrough exercise offerings, today announced workouts tracked in Preva&#174; can be automatically added into a person's Microsoft HealthVault record for viewing together with other important health and wellness information. Exercisers start by setting up a personal account using the touchscreen consoles of any Preva-enabled exercise machine (treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, etc.) located throughout the world in nearly 2,000 fitness facilities. After tracking completed workouts against goals on machines or via the Preva Mobile app, consumers connect their accounts to Microsoft HealthVault, a secure, web-based platform to store and maintain personal health and fitness information, to build a complete picture of health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal of HealthVault is to help every individual create a full picture of their overall health and wellbeing, and then use that information with tools and services that improve their lives," said Sean Nolan, Distinguished Engineer, Microsoft HealthVault. "Preva is a fantastic example of both of these -- they make it super-simple to track workouts in the gym or via their mobile app, and they provide motivation to exercisers through a unique rewards system that reminds them that their hard work is paying off. We're thrilled to have Precor as the first fitness equipment partner in our growing ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft HealthVault is a trusted place for people to gather, store, use and share health information online. With Microsoft HealthVault, the company's Preva solution joins a powerful ecosystem of connected apps and devices that help individuals create and use informative health and wellness records for themselves and their families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preva is the preferred choice across gyms, non-profit clubs, hotels, universities and more for helping consumers set, track and reach fitness goals. Upon creating an account on Preva-enabled exercise equipment (880 Line) or via the Preva Mobile app, exercisers set a weekly objective for number of workout days and an associated goal for calories, distance or duration. Each time a consumer completes a workout in the gym or outside, the activity is logged into the user's account. Microsoft HealthVault users can now add this same information to their wellness record online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumers are their own best advocates when it comes to managing their own personal or family health," said Brent Brooks, Precor Vice President of Networked Fitness. "Microsoft HealthVault is the place to create a complete picture of your health with you at the center. We're excited to tie so seamlessly into this platform, providing a transparent experience to consumers so that they can make goals, monitor progress and be inspired along the way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built on the principles of gamification, Preva keeps exercisers motivated with badge achievements. Fun and educational, these badges keep users engaged with their fitness goals, and milestones can be shared on leading social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. Users gain badges such as "Golden Gate," rewarded for burning 232 calories, the average equivalent of walking from one side of the Golden Gate Bridge to the other. The system's intuitive interface and fitness compass makes it easy for users to visually see their progress against predefined goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We already know that exercisers that set goals with Preva are proven to work out on average one day more per week in an exercise facility than those that don't," added Brooks. "We're excited to reach more consumers through this partnership and offer the inspiration they need to tackle the wellness goals they set for themselves."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft HealthVault gives consumers one place to access all of their health information online. Users add information and connect with data from health care providers. Connected apps help consumers put more into and get more out of HealthVault. Users can also choose to upload data directly from personal health devices, such as blood pressure monitors and pedometers. Consumers can choose to share parts of their health record with anyone, whenever they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Precor

&lt;p&gt;Jan 7 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co officials will
not be penalized as part of a settlement the bank is negotiating
with federal authorities to resolve suspicions that it ignored
signs of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people close to the talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is nearing a $2 billion settlement with the Justice
Department, media reports said on Monday. All fines will be paid
by the company as opposed to individuals, the Journal said. ()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment by
Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madoff was convicted in 2009 of defrauding thousands of
investors and is serving a 150-year prison sentence. JPMorgan
has been accused of ignoring warning signs that Madoff's
business was a fraud, often to win more fees and commissions for
services they provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer for Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade is seeking to postpone proceedings in a visa fraud case that has created tensions between the United States and India, citing the need to continue "meaningful discussions" with the prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to a federal magistrate judge in New York, Khobragade's lawyer requested an extension of the time by which the U.S. government must file an indictment or commence a preliminary hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawyer, Daniel Arshack, confirmed he filed the letter in court but would not comment about a possible resolution of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khobragade, who was deputy consul-general in New York, was arrested on December 12 and charged with one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements about how much she paid her housekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was adjourned until January 13 by which time the government must commence a preliminary hearing or file an indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arshack asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn to extend the deadline by 30 days to February 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Significant communications have been had between the prosecution and the defense and amongst other government officials and it is our strong view that the pressure of the impending deadline is counterproductive to continued communications," Arshack wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan whose office is handling the case, however responded saying the plea discussions can continue following the indictment in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government is not seeking an extension of the deadline for indictment and therefore there is no motion for the court to decide. At any rate, as the court knows, the timing under which the government seeks an indictment is in the discretion of the government, and the defendant cannot alter that," Bharara wrote in a letter to a federal magistrate judge in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bharara added that as recently as January 5, the government outlined "reasonable parameters" for a plea that could resolve the case, to which the defendant has not responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khobragade's arrest enraged India, which is demanding that all charges be dropped against her. On the day of her arrest, she was strip-searched. The arresting authority, the U.S. Marshals Service, said the strip search was a routine procedure imposed on any new arrestee at the federal courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khobragade was released on $250,000 bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of her arrest, India asked to transfer Khobragade to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said on Monday that India's application to transfer Khobragade's accreditation to the Indian mission at the United Nations, which was made before Christmas, was still under review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've received the request for change in accreditation, but the process is ongoing and no official decision has been made yet to do that. So there's no change in her status as of this point," she told a regular news briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian media have said the request to transfer Khobragade to the United Nations was aimed at ending the stand-off with the United States in the hopes that her new diplomatic status could allow New Delhi to bring her home without the prosecution proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to U.N. guidelines on diplomatic privileges and immunities, documents certifying diplomatic immunity, if approved, are usually issued by the U.S. Mission to the United Nations within two weeks of the initial request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A State Department official said there was no set time period for the process, and noted that the request had been filed just ahead of a period of government holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harf said the United States hoped to see the case resolved as soon as possible in the interest of the bilateral relationship between India and the United States, which has been strained by the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't want this to define our relationship going forward and don't think that it will," Harf said. "If you look throughout the region, if you look at Afghanistan, if you look at energy issues, economic issues, we have a whole host of things we work together on, and those are very important and shouldn't be derailed by this incident. ... (T)he relationship with India is incredibly important, it's vital, and that's what we're focused on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Leslie Adler and Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - Nauru, the tiny Pacific island that hosts a controversial Australian immigration detention centre, is hiking visa costs for foreign journalists by 40 times, fuelling concerns over secrecy surrounding Australia's asylum seeker policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steady flow of refugee boats is a hot political issue in Australia, polarising voters while stoking tension with neighbours such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka over border security policies criticised by the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nauru's decision to increase the cost of applying for a one-visit visa from A$200 ($180) to A$8,000 makes the rate one of the most expensive in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand the fee is for revenue purposes," government spokeswoman Joanna Olsson said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's conservative Liberal-led coalition is under fire for what critics call secrecy regarding its policies to deter asylum seekers making the perilous boat journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has refused to confirm reports that Australia last month turned a boat carrying asylum-seekers back to Indonesia, in line with its policy of not commenting on "operational matters".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) quoted boat passengers as saying they received only one meal a day during the five-day ordeal and Australian authorities used restraints and physical force against some passengers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition Labor Party lawmaker Anthony Albanese accused the government of running a "North Korean" style blackout over the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbott defended the secrecy, telling Macquarie Radio on Thursday, "The point is not to provide sport for public discussion, the point is to stop the boats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rights Group Amnesty International has criticised conditions at the detention centres on Nauru and Manus island in Papua New Guinea, where access to adequate medical facilities and housing have been a major concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of those held in Nauru and on Manus have fled from war-torn areas, including Afghanistan, Darfur, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see the logic of annoying the media," said James Jupp, an adjunct associate professor at the Australian National University in Canberra, adding that Abbott could be telling the public he was fulfilling his election promise of stopping the boats, but was refusing to do so.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Jill Priluck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 8 (Reuters) - Just a few weeks before federal
prosecutors announced a nearly $2 billion settlement with
JPMorgan Chase over Bernie Madoff's fraudulent accounts,
chairman and chief executive officer Jamie Dimon sat alongside
former Congressman and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel
at an Aspen Institute forum in the biology lab of Malcolm X
College to tout the embattled bank's five-year, $250 million,
multi-city investment in job training. The bank would commit $15
million for "workplace readiness and demand-driven training" in
Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is not alone in its quest to change how it is seen.
Goldman Sachs recently extended its 10,000 Small Businesses plan
to Detroit, the latest of a number of cities to receive cash
from the investment bank. There's a reason beyond the corporate
charity push for all the giving. The financial industry is
facing a sea change in electoral politics. It is increasingly
operating in a polarized political system that has placed a
premium on accountability. Populist and ideologically extreme
constituencies are needed for primaries and general elections in
which fewer middle-of-the-road voters participate. Loyalties
change quickly if pols don't sway the way their bases want.
Elected and would-be elected officials can rely on campaign cash
from super PACs and independent expenditures involving wealthy
contributors like Sheldon Adelson, George Soros and David Koch.
Campaigners don't have to rely as much on Wall Street as a unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians, especially Democrats, benefit from denouncing
financiers. As Ben White and Maggie Haberman reported in
Politico, "at both ends of the political spectrum, the titans of
American finance today find themselves alienated from politics
to a surprising degree." White and Haberman document an
environment in which President Obama labels them "fat cats," the
left demonizes and the Tea Party Republicans just shun. So when
someone like White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett
mentioned Goldman Sachs' 10,000 Small Businesses in an interview
with White, it shows the benefits an outfit like JPMorgan get
from courting charitable initiatives, even if they delve into
murky policy terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no accident that Dimon appeared with Emanuel, who is
perceived as a hands-on, connected public servant. More than
just a good will gloss, the bank's job training effort is a move
to make nice with a political and regulatory establishment that
denounces plutocrats. So what better way for JPMorgan Chase to
ingratiate itself with the public servant class than to play
policymaker in Chicago by throwing tax-deductible money to a
job-skills training effort run by a proven pragmatist with deep
Washington ties?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase won't say much about how the "New Skills at
Work" initiative was conceived or what it will entail. A
continuation of the bank's corporate responsibility arm that
funds non-profits and others, the push is clearly an effort to
change the bank's deteriorating public image following the $13
billion Department of Justice settlement, the Madoff case that
included a blocked probe, an "Ask JPMorgan" social media
campaign that yielded questions such as whether it is "ok to
outright lie cheat and steal" and a host of other
embarrassments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Skills at Work initiative is much more complicated.
Goldman Sachs' simple effort to award grants to upstarts
presented a pretty cheery proposition for both the little guy
and the bank. But the jobs conundrum is wonkier than funding
startups. It is politically sticky. It requires JPMorgan Chase
to collaborate with policymakers in New York, Los Angeles, Miami
and Chicago. It involves consulting with academics and
non-profit leaders to figure out what kind of manufacturing or
retail jobs are vacant, what the lacking skills are and how to
target populations that need the most training. JPMorgan is
wading into an unemployed workforce that may be overlooked not
because of a lack of skills, ultimately, but because of deeper
problems such as a cultural and socioeconomic dissonance with
employers, an inability to square work responsibilities with
family or healthcare pressures, and most importantly an economy
in transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a problem that can be solved simply by throwing
cash in its direction. While there are exceptions, job training
programs have been some of the biggest public policy failures of
the last generation. New Deal initiatives were policy coups that
helped the Depression-worn find jobs, but modern counterparts
have lacked resonance. In 1984, the libertarian Cato Institute
criticized federal efforts during the height of the Reagan era
and it's been downhill ever since. As recently as June, the
General Accounting Office reported that Obama's green jobs
initiative has been slow to reap rewards. It remains to be seen
whether the grants to states announced by Obama in September
will be any more of an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a $250 million expenditure over five years that
also happens to be a charitable tax deduction is not a hit to
the bottom line. But the willingness of JPMorgan Chase to expend
so much energy and reputational capital on what has been a
losing proposition for the last 30 or so years speaks to the
bank's dire circumstances in the age of Dodd-Frank, Basel III
and a renewed resilience in regulatory and enforcement circles
from the SEC to the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It probably won't hurt to school community college kids in
workplace culture, norms and tasks. Maybe a data-driven approach
will solve the problem of unemployment in Chicago, where 100,000
jobs are vacant. Or maybe it won't. But JPMorgan might have done
better if it expended its resources on a winning bet rather than
a problem that is far beyond the Band-Aid that a few hours of
training in front of a computer screen and a seminar on the
meaning of business casual can remedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the bank might have done better to fund
small businesses or create small upstarts in these cities and
hire the people they're training. That kind of innovation has
made policymakers and legislators and the public stand up and
take note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 8 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday
approved an agreement between JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and
U.S. prosecutors to settle charges that the bank violated
anti-money laundering laws by failing to alert authorities to
warning signs its employees encountered in dealings with
convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement, which deferred the criminal charges against
the bank until Jan. 8 2016, requires the bank to pay a $1.7
billion forfeiture and improve its anti-money laundering
controls. If it meets the terms by the appointed date,
prosecutors can chose to dismiss the charges against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN (Reuters) - Boxes filled with bananas and cocaine were delivered to five Berlin supermarkets in what police on Tuesday called a "logistical error" by drug smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supermarket staff discovered the containers with a total of 140 kg of cocaine on Monday shortly before the fruit went on sale to the public, police and customs investigators said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the largest discovery of cocaine in Germany's capital in about 15 years and has an estimated black market value of 6 million euros, according to police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were of course surprised," senior police officer Olaf Schremm, who heads the local drug investigation department, told reporters. "I don't know where the mistake was in the perpetrators' delivery chain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banana cartons, part of a consignment of 1,134 boxes, were brought by ship from Colombia to Hamburg and delivered to a fruit wholesaler in Berlin. Cocaine was found in seven of them, Schremm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boxes were eventually delivered to five supermarkets in the Berlin area, but investigators said the intended destination of the cocaine was unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masked officers in bulletproof vests showed the seized boxes to media. The cocaine will be stored and eventually destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs are often smuggled in container ships from South America to Europe, the police said, adding that it is very difficult to keep track of thousands of containers which are stored in the port of Hamburg for only a short time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the end of the day, it's beyond one's control," Schremm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German authorities say drug smugglers use air mail or couriers to import cocaine more often than ships. In 2012, investigators seized 1.26 metric tonnes of cocaine in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Thomas Seythal; Editing by Madeline Chambers and Mike Collett-White)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), the world's biggest dealer in over-the-counter metals derivatives, has added its metals futures brokerage to the sale of its physical commodities business, sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman initially declined to comment, but later said: "JP Morgan's metals futures brokerage is not up for sale and we continue to be committed to that business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources said the sale would include its London Metal Exchange (LME) open outcry floor trading team, one of the largest on the world's premier metals marketplace. A deal could come later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers and regulators have stepped up scrutiny of Wall Street's giants over their physical commodity operations, forcing banks including Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) to pull out or shrink their commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"U.S. regulations are already having a serious effect on the brokerage. It will get even worse when EU regulations come into effect," one source said. "It's starting to impact on the brokerage revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They had to sell the concentrate business and might be forced to lose the warehousing business and then logically number three is the brokerage business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan launched the sale of its physical commodities business in October, circulating offering documents to potential buyers and valuing the assets at $3.3 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time the futures brokerage, one of the biggest operators in world metals markets, was not part of the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had been trying to sell its Henry Bath metals warehousing unit since May but has yet to find a buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear whether the deal will result in an outright sale or a joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers and industry sources have said potential buyers could come from one of several areas: foreign banks such as Brazil's BTG Pactual or Macquarie that are not subject to Fed regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressures on banks have mounted over the past few years as regulators crack down on proprietary trading and new capital measures limit trading books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources said while the brokerage business was not under scrutiny by financial regulators, the cost of complying with regulations was mounting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where they have an issue is that they provide a lot of credit through their brokerage business which is kind of not really kosher under the new regulatory system," an industry source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LATE ENTRANT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As commodities prices surged over the last decade, JPMorgan was a relatively late entrant to large-scale commodity trading following its 2010 acquisition of metals and energy trading desks from RBS Sempra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its global commodity chief Blythe Masters still largely succeeded in her goal of surpassing Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) as the largest bank in commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the bank's metals business includes its ring-dealing seat on the LME, the global network of Henry Bath warehouses, a large physical metals trading book and a strong proprietary electronic commodities trading platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That empire has started to crumble, however. In 2012, it sold its metals concentrates business due to U.S. regulatory restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday JPMorgan agreed to pay $2.6 billion to the U.S. government and Bernard Madoff victims to settle allegations that the bank failed to tell authorities about its suspicions of fraud at Madoff's fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement is only the latest of JPMorgan's legal difficulties. In November, the bank agreed to a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the bank's mortgage bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank still faces at least eight other government probes, covering everything from its hiring practices in China to whether it manipulated the Libor benchmark interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After LIBOR they are worried about reputational risk in anything to do with pricing," a third source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 30 lawsuits allege that the LME and other defendants - including investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan and merchants Glencore Xstrata and Trafigura AG - manipulated the warehousing of aluminum in order to lift the price of the metal. The U.S. Justice Department is also investigating the matter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Melanie Burton in Singapore; editing by Keiron Henderson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculation over Microsoft Corp's succession plans refocused on internal choices on Wednesday, a day after the leading outside candidate, Ford Motor Co CEO Alan Mulally, took himself off the list of potential CEOs at the world's largest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A source close to the company said no appointment was likely until the last week of January or in February. The source asked not be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the process to select a successor to long-time CEO Steve Ballmer, who in August announced his plan to retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late January, many Microsoft executives will be focused on the company's earnings, which are scheduled to be released on January 23. Also, chairman Bill Gates, a key member of the search committee, will be at the World Economic Forum in Davos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For months, Microsoft watchers had pegged Mulally as the odds-on bet to succeed Ballmer as chief executive at the dominant producer of software for desktops and laptops, which has faltered in making the transition to the fast-growing mobile phone and tablet markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mulally formally pulled out of the running on Tuesday, telling the Associated Press he would remain at Ford through 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether Mulally's withdrawal from consideration was his decision or Microsoft's. While the company's intentions remained a guessing game, internal candidates now seemed the obvious ones, especially in light of comments by Microsoft about the importance of tech know-how for the top job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulally appeared to be the front runner in the latter part of last year and seemed to be interested in the job, but Microsoft never made him an offer, suggesting that the prevailing mood on the company's board was that he was not right for the job, two sources familiar with the process said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources have also told Reuters that Microsoft is down to a "handful" of candidates, including insiders Satya Nadella, executive vice president of the Cloud &amp; Enterprise group and Tony Bates, executive vice president of Business Development and Evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, a Microsoft veteran before moving to Nokia, whose mobile phone business Microsoft bought last year, has also been cited as a top candidate, as have one or more outsiders from the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former Microsoft executive who will soon rejoin the company when the takeover is complete, Elop was mentioned as now "front and center" of the CEO race in a research note from FBR analyst Daniel Ives, who cited his "previous Microsoft experience and demonstrable expertise in the mobile space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evercore analyst Kirk Materne saw it differently, naming Nadella and Bates as the leading internal candidates who "could potentially institute organizational change at a more rapid pace given their insider status."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares, which have gained 36 percent over the past year, were down 1.2 percent, while Ford shares gained about the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'DARK HORSE' IN THE RUNNING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nomura's Rick Sherlund labeled Mulally's withdrawal as "disappointing" in a research note, echoing the sentiment of some other investors and analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherlund said it was unclear who the board would turn to, saying he viewed Bates and Nadella as capable, but "more likely to take direction from Microsoft's board rather than redirect the board and take the company in a different direction as we prefer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the company does opt to go with an outsider, candidates could include Facebook Inc Chief Operator Officer Sheryl Sandberg, VMware Inc CEO Pat Gelsinger and Pivotal CEO Paul Maritz, Ives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherlund agreed that Microsoft could still look at a "dark horse" outsider but noted that some tech sector candidates, including Maritz, may have already declined to take the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a blog post on the company's website in December, Microsoft lead independent director John Thompson emphasized the need for a CEO with good tech bona fides and "an ability to lead a highly technical organization and work with top technical talent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson, who leads the four-member CEO search committee, said at the time he expected the panel to reach a decision "in the early part of 2014."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nadia Damouni; Editing by David Gregorio and Grant McCool)&lt;/p&gt;

"disappointing" in a research note, echoing the sentiment of
some other investors and analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherlund said it was unclear who the board would turn to,
saying he viewed Bates and Nadella as capable, but "more likely
to take direction from Microsoft's board rather than redirect
the board and take the company in a different direction as we
prefer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the company does opt to go with an outsider, candidates
could include Facebook Inc Chief Operator Officer Sheryl
Sandberg, VMware Inc CEO Pat Gelsinger and Pivotal CEO
Paul Maritz, Ives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherlund agreed that Microsoft could still look at a "dark
horse" outsider but noted that some tech sector candidates,
including Maritz, may have already declined to take the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a blog post on the company's website in December,
Microsoft lead independent director John Thompson emphasized the
need for a CEO with good tech bona fides and "an ability to lead
a highly technical organization and work with top technical
talent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson, who leads the four-member CEO search committee, 
said at the time he expected the panel to reach a decision "in
the early part of 2014."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Updates with JPMorgan denying metals brokerage sale)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Announcement on overall commodities business seen this
month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan's brokerage feels financial impact of regulation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Brokerage not under scrutiny by regulators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Susan Thomas and Veronica Brown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 8, (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, the
world's biggest dealer in over-the-counter metals derivatives,
has added its metals futures brokerage to the sale of its
physical commodities business, sources familiar with the matter
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman initially declined to comment, but
later said: "JP Morgan's metals futures brokerage is not up for
sale and we continue to be committed to that business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources said the sale would include its London Metal
Exchange (LME) open outcry floor trading team, one of the
largest on the world's premier metals marketplace. A deal could
come later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers and regulators have stepped up scrutiny of
Wall Street's giants over their physical commodity operations,
forcing banks including Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan
 to pull out or shrink their commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"U.S. regulations are already having a serious effect on the
brokerage. It will get even worse when EU regulations come into
effect," one source said. "It's starting to impact on the
brokerage revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They had to sell the concentrate business and might be
forced to lose the warehousing business and then logically
number three is the brokerage business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan launched the sale of its physical commodities
business in October, circulating offering documents to potential
buyers and valuing the assets at $3.3 billion, according to a
person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time the futures brokerage, one of the biggest
operators in world metals markets, was not part of the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had been trying to sell its Henry Bath metals
warehousing unit since May but has yet to find a buyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear whether the deal will result in an
outright sale or a joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers and industry sources have said potential buyers
could come from one of several areas: foreign banks such as
Brazil's BTG Pactual or Macquarie that are not subject to Fed
regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressures on banks have mounted over the past few years as
regulators crack down on proprietary trading and new capital
measures limit trading books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources said while the brokerage business was not under
scrutiny by financial regulators, the cost of complying with
regulations was mounting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where they have an issue is that they provide a lot of
credit through their brokerage business which is kind of not
really kosher under the new regulatory system," an industry
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LATE ENTRANT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As commodities prices surged over the last decade, JPMorgan
was a relatively late entrant to large-scale commodity trading
following its 2010 acquisition of metals and energy trading
desks from RBS Sempra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its global commodity chief Blythe Masters still largely
succeeded in her goal of surpassing Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley as the largest bank in commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the bank's metals business includes its ring-dealing
seat on the LME, the global network of Henry Bath warehouses, a
large physical metals trading book and a strong proprietary
electronic commodities trading platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That empire has started to crumble, however. In 2012, it
sold its metals concentrates business due to U.S. regulatory
restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday JPMorgan agreed to pay $2.6 billion to the U.S.
government and Bernard Madoff victims to settle allegations that
the bank failed to tell authorities about its suspicions of
fraud at Madoff's fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement is only the latest of JPMorgan's legal
difficulties. In November, the bank agreed to a $13 billion
settlement with the U.S. government over the bank's mortgage
bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank still faces at least eight other government probes,
covering everything from its hiring practices in China to
whether it manipulated the Libor benchmark interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After LIBOR they are worried about reputational risk in
anything to do with pricing," a third source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 30 lawsuits allege that the LME and other defendants -
including investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan and
merchants Glencore Xstrata and Trafigura AG - manipulated the
warehousing of aluminum in order to lift the price of the metal.
The U.S. Justice Department is also investigating the matter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Melanie Burton in Singapore; editing

			Viamet 
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a world leader in the development of 
      best-in-class therapies targeting metalloenzymes, announced today that 
      Robert Schotzinger, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of Viamet, will 
      present an overview of the Company at the 32nd Annual J.P. 
      Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, January 14, 
      beginning at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The presentation will be held in 
      the Elizabethan C Ballroom at the Westin St. Francis Hotel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We achieved significant clinical progress with our lead prostate cancer 
      compound, VT-464, and our lead antifungal compound, VT-1161, during 
      2013,&#8221; said Dr. Schotzinger. &#8220;It is an honor to be invited by J.P. 
      Morgan to provide an update on our programs and to discuss our clinical 
      plans for the coming year.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About VT-464
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      VT-464 is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of the bifunctional 
      metalloenzyme, CYP17. VT-464 is entering Phase 2 clinical development 
      for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Viamet 
      utilized the Company&#8217;s proprietary Metallophile&#8482; technology platform to 
      design VT-464 to be a lyase-selective inhibitor of CYP17. Due to its 
      high lyase selectivity, VT-464 is administered without concomitant 
      prednisone, unlike the approved CYP17 inhibitor, Zytiga&#8482;. Recent 
      preclinical studies have demonstrated robust VT-464 activity in prostate 
      tumor models that are resistant to Zytiga&#8482; or the androgen receptor 
      blocker, Xtandi&#8482;. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of VT-464 in 
      chemotherapy-na&#239;ve, castration-resistant prostate cancer patients is 
      currently ongoing. Additional clinical trials are planned for early 2014 
      in patients who have previously failed approved therapies including 
      Zytiga&#8482;, Xtandi&#8482; and chemotherapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About VT-1161
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      VT-1161 is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of the fungal 
      metalloenzyme, CYP51. VT-1161 is in Phase 2 clinical development for the 
      treatment of a range of human fungal infections. Viamet utilized its 
      proprietary Metallophile&#8482; technology platform to design VT-1161 to be 
      highly selective for the fungal CYP51 enzyme, while sparing human CYP 
      enzymes with the goal of reducing the significant toxicities observed 
      with CYP51 inhibitors currently on market. VT-1161 has shown robust 
      activity in multiple preclinical models of superficial, mucosal, and 
      invasive fungal infections. Oral VT-1161 demonstrated excellent safety, 
      pharmacokinetics and penetration into human skin and nail in Phase 1 
      studies. Phase 2a studies of oral VT-1161 are currently ongoing in 
      patients with interdigital tinea pedis and in patients with acute 
      vulvovaginal candidiasis. Pending the successful completion of these 
      studies, the Company expects to initiate Phase 2b trials of oral VT-1161 
      in patients with onychomycosis and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 8 (Reuters) - Speculation over Microsoft
Corp's succession plans refocused on internal choices
on Wednesday, a day after the leading outside candidate, Ford
Motor Co CEO Alan Mulally, took himself off the list of
potential CEOs at the world's largest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, Microsoft watchers had pegged Mulally as the
odds-on bet to succeed Steve Ballmer as chief executive at the
dominant producer of software for desktops and laptops, which
has faltered in making the transition to the fast-growing mobile
phone and tablet markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mulally formally pulled out of the running on Tuesday,
telling the Associated Press he would remain at Ford through
2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether Mulally's withdrawal from
consideration was his decision or Microsoft's. While the
company's intentions remained a guessing game, internal
candidates now seemed the obvious ones, especially in light of
comments by Microsoft about the importance of tech know-how for
the top job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources familiar with the process have told Reuters that
Microsoft is down to a "handful" of candidates, including
insiders Satya Nadella and Tony Bates. Former Nokia CEO Stephen
Elop, a Microsoft veteran before moving to Nokia, whose mobile
phone business Microsoft bought last year, has also been cited
as a top candidate, as have one or more outsiders from the tech
industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former Microsoft executive who will soon rejoin the
company when the takeover is complete, Elop was fingered in as
now "front and center" of the CEO race in a research note from
FBR analyst Daniel Ives, who cited his "previous Microsoft
experience and demonstrable expertise in the mobile space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evercore analyst Kirk Materne saw it differently, naming
Nadella and Bates as the leading internal candidates who "could
potentially institute organizational change at a more rapid
pace given their insider status."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares, which have gained 36 percent over the past
year, were down 1.2 percent, while Ford shares gained about the
same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'DARK HORSE' IN THE RUNNING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nomura's Rick Sherlund labeled Mulally's withdrawal as
"disappointing" in a research note, echoing the sentiment of
some other investors and analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherlund said it was unclear who the board would turn to,
saying he viewed Bates and Nadella as capable, but "more likely
to take direction from Microsoft's board rather than redirect
the board and take the company in a different direction as we
prefer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the company does opt to go with an outsider, candidates
could include Facebook Inc Chief Operator Officer Sheryl
Sandberg, VMware Inc CEO Pat Gelsinger and Pivotal CEO
Paul Maritz, Ives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherlund agreed that Microsoft could still look at a "dark
horse" outsider but noted that some tech sector candidates,
including Maritz, may have already declined to take the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a blog post on the company's website in December,
Microsoft lead independent director John Thompson emphasized the
need for a CEO with good tech bona fides and "an ability to lead
a highly technical organization and work with top technical
talent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson, who leads the four-member CEO search committee
that includes Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates, said
at the time he expected the panel to reach a decision "in the
early part of 2014."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When JP Morgan paid its record $13 billion fine for problems with its mortgage securitizations, the bank came out of the experience surprisingly unscathed, in large part because Wall Street reckoned that the real guilt lay mainly in the actions of companies that JP Morgan had bought (Bear Stearns and WaMu) rather than in any actions undertaken on its own watch. There was a feeling that the bank was being unfairly singled out for punishment &#8212; a feeling which, at least in part, was justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest $2 billion fine, however, which also comes with a deferred prosecution agreement, is entirely on JP Morgan&#8217;s shoulders &#8212; and still, as Peter Eavis reports, it&#8217;s being &#8220;taken in stride&#8221; by the giant bank. It really seems that CNBC is right, and that profits really do cleanse all sins. How is it that a $450 million fine sufficed to defenestrate the CEO of Barclays, but that Jamie Dimon, overseeing some $20 billion of fines plus a deferred prosecution agreement just in the space of one year, seems to be made of teflon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer that question it&#8217;s worth looking at the details of what exactly JP Morgan did wrong in this case. The key part of the Deferred Prosecution Packet is Exhibit C, the Statement of Facts, all of which have been &#8220;admitted and stipulated&#8221; by JP Morgan itself. And it certainly lays out some jaw-dropping behavior on the part of the bank, which oversaw Madoff&#8217;s main bank account for more than 20 years: between 1986 and 2008, account #140-081703 received a jaw-dropping $150 billion in total deposits and transfers, and showed a balance of $5.6 billion in August 2008. Even when you&#8217;re as big as JP Morgan, that&#8217;s a bank account you notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except, maybe, not so much:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to JPMC&#8217;s requirement that a client relationship manager certify that the client relationship complied with all &#8220;legal and regulatory-based policies, a JPMC banker (&#8220;Madoff Banker 1&#8221;) signed the periodic certifications beginning in or about the mid-1990s through his retirement in early 2008&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his tenure at JPMC, Madoff Banker 1 periodically visited Madoff&#8217;s offices&#8230; Madoff Banker 1 believed that the 703 account was primarily a Madoff Securities broker-dealer operating account, used to pay for rent and other routine expenses. Madoff Banker 1 also believed that the average balance in Madoff Securities&#8217; demand deposit account was &#8220;probably [in the] tens of millions.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is sheer unmitigated &#8212; and, yes, probably criminal &#8212; incompetence. It takes a very special kind of banker to not notice that an account has more than a billion dollars in it, for a period of roughly four years, from 2005 through most of 2008. As Matt Levine says, &#8220;Madoff Banker 1 is like the one banker on earth who underestimated his clients business by a factor of 100 or so. Boss, Ive made the firm thousands of dollars this year, he probably said, and I deserve a bonus of at least $200.&#8217;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incompetence doesn&#8217;t stop there. At the beginning of January 2007, the account &#8212; which, remember, JP Morgan officially considered to be used for rent and other routine expenses&#8221; &#8212; saw inflows of $757.2 million in one day. This tripped all manner of automated red flags, but the investigation into those red flags consisted of &#8212; get this &#8212; visiting the Madoff website. That&#8217;s it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was there other suspicious activity in this account? Of course there was: lots of it. As far back as December 2001, a client of JP Morgan&#8217;s private bank, who also held a huge amount of money with Madoff, moved an astonishing $6.8 billion in and out of that 703 account. In one month. You just can&#8217;t do that without generating all manner of suspicious activity reports from JP Morgan to bank regulators. And yet, somehow, impossibly, no such report was generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in 2007, JP Morgan&#8217;s private bank conducted due diligence on Madoff &#8212; after all, many of its clients wanted in on Madoff&#8217;s amazing funds &#8212; and concluded that the numbers &#8220;didn&#8217;t add up&#8221;. And still no hint of running any problems up the chain to either JP Morgan&#8217;s regulators or Madoff&#8217;s. The same thing happened again in 2008, at an entity called Chase Alternative Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then in late 2008, shortly before the whole Madoff enterprise imploded, JP Morgan bankers in London became so suspicious of the whole enterprise that they sent two different reports to the UK&#8217;s Serious Organized Crime Agency. Yet none of this information made it to US regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levine has a relatively benign explanation for all this: he says that JP Morgan comprises &#8220;more or less independent&#8221; businesses, which naturally don&#8217;t speak to each other, or inform each others&#8217; regulators when they smell something suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes the different bits of JP Morgan did talk: for instance, in June 2007 there was a meeting about Madoff in Manhattan, which included the investment bank&#8217;s chief risk officer; the Hedge Fund Underwriting Committee (which included &#8220;executives from various of JPMC&#8217;s lines of business&#8221;); the London Equity Exotics Desk (which later examined Madoff in detail and concluded he was probably a fraud); the investment banks&#8217;s Global Head of Equities; executives from the broker-dealer; and other people who had direct credit relationships with Madoff. The meeting concluded that JP Morgan wasn&#8217;t going to do a big deal with Madoff based simply on Madoff saying &#8220;trust me&#8221;, and not allowing any direct due diligence. But while JP Morgan was careful with its own investments, and ultimately took out most of the money it had with Madoff before the firm collapsed, once again it saw no reason to tell regulators about its suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And specifically, there&#8217;s one individual within JP Morgan, identified as the &#8220;Senior IB Compliance Officer&#8221;, who had all of the information from London, who was responsible for passing suspicions on to US regulators, and who ended up doing nothing beyond having &#8220;an impromptu conversation in a hallway&#8221; with a few colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government doesn&#8217;t show &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t need to show &#8212; that if JP Morgan had done what it was supposed to do, then US regulators would have cracked down on Madoff before the Ponzi scheme collapsed under its own weight. The point is that regulators can only do their job if they&#8217;re given the information they&#8217;re required by law to receive &#8212; and JP Morgan (not Bear Stearns, not Washington Mutual, but JP Morgan itself) utterly failed, over many years, to provide them with that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, to Eavis&#8217;s point, JP Morgan is now effectively untouchable by the government. Sure, it can be fined billions of dollars; it can even be slapped with a deferred prosecution agreement. But the fines just come out of the pot of money devoted to paying such things &#8212; it&#8217;s known as legal reserves&#8221; &#8212; and so long as the bank can show that it makes good profits after reserving for fines, Wall Street seems happy for the bank to make few if any major changes. Jamie Dimon remains as CEO, answering to a board chaired by himself; the bank remains one of the biggest in the world; and while prosecutors are winning countless battles against the bank, it&#8217;s abundantly clear that the bank is going to win the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When did JP Morgan effectively become too big to regulate? How is it that Jamie Dimon and his starry-eyed shareholders have been able to see off forces which toppled many other banks and CEOs? That&#8217;s an article I&#8217;d love to read &#8212; the story of how, with some combination of luck and aggression, Dimon held on to his position as the most powerful bank CEO in the world &#8212; even as other banks, and other CEOs, fell steadily by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of a determined regulatory onslaught over the past 18 months, from mortgage-related prosecutions to the Volcker Rule, JP Morgan&#8217;s share price has gone steadily up and to the right, almost doubling over that period. In the view of Wall Street, that share price is Dimon&#8217;s vindication, and his ultimate shield. The lesson of yesterday&#8217;s news cycle is that no one can pierce it. Not even the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;CUA and Pfizer Canada Award Clinical Fellowships in Incontinence&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Researchers Daniel Yanko, MD  Rahul Bansal, MBBS, MS, MCh are recipients of inaugural fellowship program&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;KIRKLAND, QUEBEC--(Marketwired - Jan 8, 2014) -  Two Canadian researchers have been awarded the first-ever Canadian Urological Association and Pfizer Canada Clinical Fellowship in Incontinence. With this funding, Alberta's Dr. Daniel Yanko and Ontario's Dr. Rahul Bansal will conduct new projects to improve support, education and treatment for Canadian patients with incontinence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paediatric Pilot Program &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McMaster University and University of Toronto researcher Rahul Bansal has been awarded one of two grants under the program, for a project that is focused on studying the impacts of providing more comprehensive, supportive treatment options for pediatric urology patients. In particular, Dr. Bansal's research will look at the treatment outcomes on condition, emotional health and quality of life for a group of children diagnosed with nonneurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. The study will evaluate outcomes for children who participate in a one-hour group interactive session, involving video teaching that will be shared with families - compared to children who receive standard individual urotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the need is growing, there is very little research involving the special needs of children who suffer from urological and incontinence symptoms," explains Dr. Bansal. "To ensure successful treatment, our hypothesis is that children may need a more engaging, teaching-oriented approach and that doesn't always fit within the traditional urology clinic appointment." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overactive Bladder Registry Study &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Daniel Yanko of Vesia [The Alberta Bladder Centre at the University of Calgary] earned a grant for its innovative pilot study to develop an anonymous, encrypted Registry of Overactive Bladder patients. The voluntary registry will track patient outcomes from a physical and quality of life perspective in the hopes that sharing the information will help advance treatment and care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overactive bladder is more common as people age, and untreated, it can have a negative impact on quality of life - and even, in some cases, cause depression," explains Dr. Yanko. "At Vesia, we have a multi-disciplinary treatment model that combines urology, family medicine, nursing and physiotherapy all in one setting, so we hope that tracking richer data about our patient's experiences and quality of life, will help other researchers and physicians." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the CUA/Pfizer Canada Clinical Fellowship in Incontinence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Urological Association (CUA) and Pfizer Canada's fellowship program was created to provide support and funding for Canadian urological researchers. The fellowship is focused on advancing urological research and improving care for patients with incontinence. The partnership awards $120,000 per year in the form of two grants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The burden of urological disorders in Canada is growing.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Jan. 8, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ChemoCentryx, Inc. (Nasdaq:CCXI), today announced that Thomas J. Schall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer, will present at the 32nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Wednesday, January 15, 2014, at 3:30 p.m. Pacific Time. The conference will be held at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	A live audio webcast of the presentation can be accessed through the Investors section of the Company's website at www.ChemoCentryx.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on the Company's website for two weeks following the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About ChemoCentryx&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	ChemoCentryx, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing orally-administered therapeutics that target the chemokine and chemoattractant systems in order to treat autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer. The chemokine system is a biological network that regulates inflammation via a collection of secreted chemokine molecules, or ligands, and their specific cell surface receptors. Based on its proprietary drug discovery and drug development platform, ChemoCentryx has generated multiple clinical and preclinical-stage programs, each targeting distinct chemokine and chemoattractant receptors with different small molecule compounds. CCX140, a CCR2 inhibitor, has been shown to be safe and well tolerated while demonstrating clinical activity on glycemic indices in a Phase II clinical trial in type 2 diabetics, and is now in Phase II clinical development for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. CCX168, a C5aR inhibitor, has recently completed the first two steps in an ongoing Phase II trial for the treatment of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated renal vasculitis (AARV). CCX168 appears to be safe, well tolerated and successful in allowing both reduction and elimination of high-dose corticosteroids, part of standard of care for AARV patients, without compromising efficacy or safety during a 12-week treatment period. Vercirnon (also known as Traficet-EN or CCX282) is a specific CCR9 inhibitor for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Other clinical programs include CCX872, a next generation CCR2 inhibitor, and CCX507, a next generation CCR9 inhibitor, both of which are in Phase I clinical testing and CCX354, a CCR1 inhibitor which successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. ChemoCentryx also has several programs in advanced preclinical development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			About Civitas Therapeutics
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Civitas Therapeutics is a privately-held biopharmaceutical company 
      focused on developing a robust pipeline of inhaled&#160;therapeutics with the 
      clinically-proven ARCUS(TM) dry powder pulmonary delivery 
      platform. The company&#8217;s lead program, CVT-301, is being developed as 
      adjunctive PRN therapy to provide Parkinson&#8217;s disease patients with 
      rapid and reliable relief from intermittent debilitating motor 
      fluctuations (OFF episodes). OFF episodes result from the unreliability 
      of current medications -- a problem impacting about half of all 
      Parkinson&#8217;s disease patients. In April 2013, Civitas announced positive 
      results for CVT-301 in a Phase 2 dose-ranging study. The company is 
      currently conducting a Phase 2b study to evaluate the efficacy and 
      safety of CVT-301 in treating emergent OFF episodes during one month of 
      continued use. The Company&#8217;s pipeline also includes products for 
      respiratory disease, central nervous system disorders and infectious 
      disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ARCUS(TM) platform is a proprietary dry powder and device 
      combination with a unique ability to deliver a large, precise dose 
      independent of inspiratory flow rate from a simple, breath actuated 
      device and is protected by a large intellectual property estate. The 
      technology has successfully delivered more than one million doses to 
      patients and the manufacturing technology has been scaled to accommodate 
      a significant commercial launch. The Company is financed by leading 
      investors including Alkermes plc, Bay City Capital, Canaan Partners, 
      Fountain Healthcare Partners, Longitude Capital and RA Capital. For 
      further information on Civitas, please visit www.civitastherapeutics.com.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Intersect ENT, Inc., an innovator in treatment solutions for ear, nose 
      and throat clinicians and their patients, today announced that the 
      company will present next week at the 32nd Annual J.P. Morgan 
      Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lisa Earnhardt, Intersect ENT&#8217;s president and chief executive officer, 
      will provide a company overview on Tuesday, January 14, 2014 at 7:30 
      a.m. PT in room Elizabethan C at the Westin St. Francis Hotel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Intersect ENT&#8217;s PROPEL&#174; and PROPEL&#174; mini implants 
      are the first and only drug-eluting stents for patients with chronic 
      sinusitis. The products release mometasone furoate, an advanced steroid 
      with anti-inflammatory properties, directly into the sinus lining, then 
      dissolve. Use of PROPEL maintains the open passages created in surgery 
      leading to reduced need for oral medication and additional surgical 
      procedures. The company is also studying a novel in-office solution for 
      patients suffering from chronic sinusitis in a randomized clinical trial 
      called the RESOLVE Study.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chronic sinusitis is a condition in which patients&#8217; sinuses become 
      swollen and inflamed, leading to difficulty breathing, facial pain or 
      headache, and reduced sense of smell and taste. The condition is common, 
      affecting 31 million people in the U.S., and greatly impacts quality of 
      life. Chronic sinusitis often requires a complex combination of surgical 
      and medical treatments. Each year, 500,000 patients undergo sinus 
      surgery to treat the condition.

			&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--(Marketwired - Jan 8, 2014) - &#160;Hansen Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: HNSN), a global leader in intravascular robotics, today announced that President and CEO Bruce Barclay is scheduled to present at the 32nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. The conference is being held January 13 - 16, 2014 at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, California. Hansen Medical is scheduled to present on Thursday, January 16, 2014 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hansen Medical will provide a live webcast of the audio presentation. Interested parties may access the live webcast by visiting the investor relations section of Hansen Medical's web site at www.hansenmedical.com. A replay of the webcast will be available at the site after the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Hansen Medical, Inc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hansen Medical, Inc., based in Mountain View, California, is a global leader in intravascular robotics, developing products and technology designed to enable the accurate positioning, manipulation and control of catheters and catheter-based technologies. The Company's Magellan&#8482; Robotic System, 9Fr Magellan&#8482; Robotic Catheter and related accessories, which are intended to facilitate navigation to anatomical targets in the peripheral vasculature and subsequently provide a conduit for manual placement of therapeutic devices, have undergone both CE marking and 510(k) clearance and are commercially available in the European Union, and the U.S. In the European Union, the Company's Sensei&#174; X Robotic Catheter System and Artisan&#174; and Artisan Extend&#174; Control Catheters are cleared for use during electrophysiology (EP) procedures, such as guiding catheters in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), and the Lynx&#174; Robotic Ablation Catheter is cleared for the treatment of AF. This robotic catheter system is compatible with fluoroscopy, ultrasound, 3D surface map and patient electrocardiogram data. In the U.S., the Company's Sensei X Robotic Catheter System and Artisan and Artisan Extend Control Catheters are cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for manipulation and control of certain mapping catheters in EP procedures. In the U.S., the Sensei X Robotic Catheter System is not approved for use in guiding ablation procedures; this use remains experimental. The U.S. product labeling therefore provides that the safety and effectiveness of the Sensei X Robotic Catheter System and Artisan and Artisan Extend Control Catheter for use with cardiac ablation catheters in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, including AF, have not been established. Additional information can be found at www.hansenmedical.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forward-Looking Statements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hansen Medical's presentation will contain forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, statements relating to goals, plans, objectives, milestones and future events. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including statements containing the words "plan," "expects," "potential," "believes," "goal," "estimate," "anticipates," and similar words.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements are described in the "Risk Factors" section of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2013 filed with the SEC on November 8, 2013 and the risks discussed in our other reports filed with the SEC. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on the Company's forward-looking statements. Hansen Medical undertakes no obligation to revise or update its forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances in the future, even if new information becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hansen Medical, Heart Design (Logo), Hansen Medical (with Heart Design), Sensei and Lynx are registered trademarks, and Magellan and NorthStar are trademarks of Hansen Medical, Inc. in the United States and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Top banks paid up to 5.4 times fixed salary in bonuses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* EU to cap bonus at maximum two times fixed salary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Top Goldman staff paid $4.67 million each for 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Some banks seek "creative solutions"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Steve Slater&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Investment bankers working in
London for many top U.S. and European groups face a major
overhaul of their pay structure, as their recent bonuses have
far exceeded new EU rules which will curb payouts to be made
this time next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America
, Barclays and Credit Suisse paid
bonuses to leading UK staff which ranged from 3.3 to 5.4 times
their fixed pay for 2012, according to data disclosed by the
banks and Reuters calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big changes will therefore have to be made to meet the
European Union rules which cap bonuses at the same level as
fixed pay, or double if the bank's shareholders approve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers' bonuses remain a hot topic among politicians and
the public. Many blame their high levels for encouraging
reckless risk-taking that led to the 2008/09 financial crisis
and a series of mis-selling and misconduct scandals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks usually pay staff bonuses in January or February based
on their performance the previous year. So while the EU curbs
came into force this month, they will be applied first to
bonuses for 2014 to be handed out early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major banks continued to reward their top risk-taking staff
heavily on performance in bonuses for 2012, their regulatory
disclosures have showed in the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid its top 115 UK staff an average of $4.67
million each for 2012, an increase of three-quarters from the
average for 2011 and the highest of the major banks. The bank's
earnings and revenues jumped in 2012 from 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About $350 million of Goldman's total bill for these bankers
was paid in bonuses, or 5.2 times what it gave in fixed pay -
jumping from a ratio of 2.2 times in 2011 - according to Reuters
calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks are expected to increase fixed pay and reduce bonuses
to meet the new rules, although Barclays, HSBC 
and others are coming up with innovative ways to cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays plans to give its senior bankers additional monthly
payments. The new "role-based pay" element - on top of base
salary and variable bonuses - will be for employees occupying
specific risk-taking roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of this will be in cash, although top-up payments to
members of its executive committee may be in shares, following
discussions with shareholders, a person familiar with the matter
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC plans to hand new share awards to about 1,000 of its
top staff, an industry source said, adding that the plan would
have characteristics of variable pay but qualify as fixed pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A LOT OF CREATIVITY"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and others are considering similar shifts to
Barclays and HSBC to keep some flexibility on pay and meet the
bonus rules, industry sources have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears there's a lot of creativity going on," said
Peter Hahn from London's Cass Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 10,000 staff are expected to be covered by the rules.
Bankers earning more than 500,000 euros a year will be affected,
although the EU banking watchdog watered down requirements last
month and said some staff earning that amount could be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of other banks also bust the new rules for 2012,
according to data released for their UK "code staff", which
covers all people in significant risk-taking positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan paid 126 code staff an average of 2.09 million
pounds ($3.4 million), and variable pay was 5.4 times fixed pay.
Bank of America paid its code staff an average of 1.5 million
pounds, with variable pay 5.4 times fixed pay. Its senior
managers received 12 times more in variable pay than salary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British government is fighting the rule in Europe's
highest court and many banks in London have opposed the cap,
saying it will force up fixed salaries, provide less scope to
claw back pay and encourage staff to move to banks in the United
States or Asia which are not constrained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other leading banks, top UK staff at Credit Suisse
earned an average of $2.28 million in 2012, up 8 percent from
2011, and bonuses were 3.3 times fixed pay, according to data
released just before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure for British-based Nomura bankers was an
average of $2.37 million each in the year to March 2013, and
bonuses amounted to 3.1 times fixed pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays had previously disclosed it paid its 393 code staff
an average of 1.37 million pounds each in 2012, and variable pay
was 4.3 times fixed pay, while HSBC paid its code staff an
average of $1.68 million each in 2012, and variable pay was 2.7
times fixed pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hahn at Cass said it was "disappointing" that overall pay
levels were not coming down, as returns for shareholders at many
banks are still lagging the cost of equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an industry that still needs to deal with cost
cutting...it's still an industry that appears to be paying as if
it's a high return business, and it isn't," Hahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks either declined to comment, could not immediately be
reached, or said they were considering their options in regard
to future pay structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rules cover pay for 2014, but will not affect
bonuses for 2013 that will be handed out in the next two months.
Bonus details will start coming out from U.S. banks reporting
results from next week, and are expected to be flat to slightly
higher across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over 3,500 bankers in Europe earned 1 million euros or
more last year, and more than three-quarters of those were based
in Britain, partly reflecting London's dominance as a financial
hub and the European hub for global banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAY FOR UK BANK STAFF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANK              NO. OF UK    AVG CODE    VARIABLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CODE STAFF   STAFF PAY   VS FIXED

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N)-owned miner Colombian National Resources (CNR) has halted coal exports from Colombia after the country introduced a new environmental law that CNR is not yet able to comply with, a company source told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colombia's coal exports are expected to tumble by a third or more in the first few months of this year after a new law that took effect on January 1 banned the old crane and barge method of loading ships that has been outlawed because of the pollution it causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government of the world's fourth biggest coal exporter on Wednesday ordered its No. 2 miner, U.S.-based Drummond, to halt loading until it installs a now legally required conveyor belt loader. That decision will cut shipments by about a third until Drummond's equipment is ready around March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNR, wholly owned by Goldman Sachs and with two mines in Colombia, its own port and a share in the joint-venture coal railway Fenoco, will only start building its conveyor in the next few weeks and will need 16 to 18 months to finish it, the source, who was not authorized to speak on the issue, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source said the company was looking into the only viable alternative to continue exports - to pay nearby rival Prodeco, owned by Glencore, to use capacity at its port which is already equipped with legally compliant conveyor belt infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are seeing what is best regarding coal prices and what they are offering. No decision has been taken," said the source, who could not ascertain what contact had taken place between the two companies or at what level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNR produced about 3.5 million tones of coal in 2013, only about 4 percent of the 82 million tones the mining ministry estimates was produced during the year. That means market impact from the loss of its output is likely to be minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loading coal by crane onto barges and then onto ships offshore causes some lumps of coal and dust to fall into the sea, polluting the water - a problem fully enclosed conveyor belts are expected to eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNR's El Hatillo mine will keep producing for now and until on-site storage capacity is used up, the source said without being able to specify roughly how long it could keep running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's other mine, La Francia, had reopened again late last year the source said, but it was producing a minimal amount in anticipation of disruption from the new loading law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mine had been shut down since January 2013 when the contractor running it on CNR's behalf walked away from the project and it had to be drained of water before the new operator could begin mining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both mines have a capacity to produce 3 million tones each per year when operating normally, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHOCK FOR MARKET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia's order on Wednesday that Drummond suspend loading took the coal market by surprise and pushed prices higher. The government said in December Drummond would be able to keep loading in violation of the new law by paying a daily fine for the privilege before making an unexplained U-turn on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coal prices in Europe, where most of Colombia's exports are consumed, saw rises of more than $3 during trade on Wednesday and Thursday as the market factored in a tightening of supplies from the Andean nation for the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government may have backtracked in light of negative press coverage highlighting a foreign company's flouting of local laws despite Drummond having agreed to pay penalties for continuing to load coal temporarily using the banned method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flaws of barge and crane loading, which the government first announced it would ban around 2007, caught the public's attention a year ago when a Drummond barge flipped in rough weather and spilled a load of coal into the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNR's Rio Cordoba port, that of Drummond and Glencore's Prodeco are neighboring facilities in the municipality of Cienaga in Magdalena province on a Caribbean stretch of Atlantic coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia's biggest miner, joint venture Cerrejon, is unaffected by the new law as it has used conveyor belt loading at its own private port since its origins in the country in the 1980s. It mines in the far northern province of Cesar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cerrejon is jointly owned by Anglo American Plc (AAL.L), BHP Billiton (BHP.AX)(BLT.L) and Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN.L). In 2012, it carried 32.7 million tones of coal from its mine in La Guajira province to its own port, Puerto Bolivar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia is likely to forgo around 4.2 billion pesos ($2.17 million) in royalty and tax income per day by shutting off Drummond's exports, a heavy cost for a country where many still live in poverty and one in urgent need of better infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Adler, Matthew Lewis and Jonathan Oatis)&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms JPM 2006-CIBC17
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 19 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp (JPMCC) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2006-CIBC17. A detailed list of rating actions 
      follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are due to relatively stable performance of the 
      remaining pool as well as no significant change in modeled losses. Fitch 
      modeled losses of 18.5% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the 
      original pool balance total 18.4%, including $42.6 million (1.7% of the 
      original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 
      50 Fitch Loans of Concern (43.9%), which includes 17 specially serviced 
      assets (21.6%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the December 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 9.5% to $2.3 billion from $2.54 
      billion at issuance. No loans are defeased. Interest shortfalls are 
      currently affecting classes D through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses continues to be the 
      specially-serviced Bank of America Plaza (11.5% of the pool), a 1.3 
      million square foot (sf), class A office property located in downtown 
      Atlanta, GA. The largest tenants are Trautman Sanders, LLC (25%) and 
      Bank of America (14%) with lease expirations in 2022. The loan was 
      transferred to special servicing in February 2011 and is currently real 
      estate owned (REO). The property has suffered declining occupancy since 
      2011 resulting from tenant's vacating and downsizing space, in addition 
      to challenging market conditions. The property was 51% occupied as of 
      November 2013. The special servicer is currently working on stabilizing 
      the asset by launching a new website and marketing campaign in addition 
      to several planned improvements, which once completed should increase 
      leasing momentum at the property. Per REIS, as of 3rd quarter (3Q) 2013, 
      the Atlanta office market vacancy is 20.3% with asking rents $21.64 sf.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is the Westfield 
      Shoppingtown Independence loan (4.8%), which is secured by a 1,014,971 
      sf (493,432 sf of collateral) regional mall located in Wilmington, NC. 
      The non-owned anchors include Sears, Belk, and Dillard's. The largest 
      tenants include JC Penney 22.7% lease expiration Aug. 31, 2016, Life 
      Community Church (2.9%), expiration June 30, 2014, College of Wilmington 
       Day Spa (2.8%) expiration April 30, 2020. The fiscal year end June 30, 
      2013 debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) is 0.80x with mall occupancy at 
      95.22%( occupancy representing the collateral is 88% as of June 30, 
      2013). Per the master servicer, 31% of the leases roll within the next 
      six months, of which 16% has renewed, 11% has or will be vacating, and 
      the intentions of the remaining 5% are unknown. Although occupancy has 
      remained stable, income continues to decline year over year due to lower 
      base rents for new and renewing tenants. Per REIS as of 3Q'13, the 
      Wilmington Metro Retail market vacancy is 15.9% with asking rents $15.77.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is the 
      specially-serviced City View Portfolio (2.5%), seven multifamily 
      properties consisting of 2,226 units located in the Greenspoint section 
      of Houston, TX. The loan was transferred to special servicing in 
      February 2010 due to imminent default and is currently REO. The decline 
      in portfolio performance is due to a significant fire at one of the 
      properties, in addition to an increase in expenses at another property 
      with significant crime issues. As of December 2013, the portfolio is 88% 
      occupied; 94% excluding the down units.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlooks on classes A-3 through A-1A remain Stable due to 
      increasing credit enhancement and continued paydown. The rating outlook 
      on class A-M remains Negative due to declines in performance of some of 
      the larger loans of concern.

      class NR certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the 
      interest-only class X certificates.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, forecast a fourth-quarter profit on Thursday that likely will miss Wall Street's expectations, as production sags around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its interim update for the fourth quarter, Chevron said it expects profit to be "comparable" with third-quarter results, when it posted net income of $4.95 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet analysts, on average, expect the San Ramon, California-based company to post fourth-quarter net income of $5.69 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which competes heavily with Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and other international energy firms, said production fell due to maintenance at facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, Australia and Angola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average U.S. oil-equivalent production of oil and gas from wells fell to 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) in October and November from an average of 655,000 for the entire second quarter, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's average realized U.S. price for crude and related products was $90.17 per barrel in the first two months of the fourth quarter, down from $97.18 in the third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, the company produced 2.56 million bpd in the first two months of the fourth quarter, down from 2.59 million in the third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude-input volumes at its U.S. refineries jumped as the El Segundo, California refinery resumed normal operations after planned maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter earnings include foreign exchange gains of $200 million to $300 million, in contract with losses of about $300 million in the third quarter, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares fell about 0.5 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday.

&lt;p&gt;By Ernest Scheyder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp, the second-largest
U.S. oil company, forecast a fourth-quarter profit on Thursday
that likely will miss Wall Street's expectations, as production
sags around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its interim update for the fourth quarter, Chevron said
it expects profit to be "comparable" with third-quarter results,
when it posted net income of $4.95 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet analysts, on average, expect the San Ramon,
California-based company to post fourth-quarter net income of
$5.69 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which competes heavily with Exxon Mobil 
and other international energy firms, said production fell due
to maintenance at facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, Australia
and Angola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average U.S. oil-equivalent production of oil and gas from
wells fell to 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) in October and
November from an average of 655,000 for the entire second
quarter, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's average realized U.S. price for crude and
related products was $90.17 per barrel in the first two months
of the fourth quarter, down from $97.18 in the third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, the company produced 2.56 million bpd in the
first two months of the fourth quarter, down from 2.59 million
in the third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude-input volumes at its U.S. refineries jumped as the El
Segundo, California refinery resumed normal operations after
planned maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter earnings include foreign exchange gains of
$200 million to $300 million, in contract with losses of about
$300 million in the third quarter, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares fell about 0.5 percent in after-hours
trading on Thursday. The stock has gained about 12 percent in
the past 52 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full quarterly results are due on Jan. 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp, the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said on Thursday its oil and gas production
fell slightly last quarter from third-quarter levels as the

			Chevron Issues Interim Update for Fourth Quarter 2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today reported in its interim update that 
      earnings for the fourth quarter 2013 are expected to be comparable with 
      third quarter 2013 results. Upstream earnings for the fourth quarter are 
      projected to be lower than the prior quarter, while downstream earnings 
      are expected to be higher. The interim update contains industry and 
      company operating data for the first two months of the fourth quarter. 
      Readers are advised that the commentary below compares results for the first 
      two months of the fourth quarter 2013 to full 
      third quarter 2013 results, unless indicated otherwise.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. net oil-equivalent production was lower, primarily due to planned 
      downtime across multiple assets in the Gulf of Mexico. International net 
      oil-equivalent production was lower compared to the third quarter, 
      reflecting maintenance activity in Australia and downtime at the LNG 
      facility in Angola.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      U.S. refinery crude-input volumes were higher mainly due to the absence 
      of planned maintenance activity in the third quarter at the El Segundo, 
      California refinery. International refinery crude-input volumes were 
      down slightly compared to the third quarter.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This interim update of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking 
      statements relating to Chevron&#8217;s operations that are based on 
      management&#8217;s current expectations, estimates and projections about the 
      petroleum, chemicals and other energy-related industries. Words such as 
      &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; 
      &#8220;projects,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;schedules,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;budgets,&#8221; 
      &#8220;outlook&#8221; and similar expressions are intended to identify such 
      forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of 
      future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and 
      other factors, many of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control and are 
      difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ 
      materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking 
      statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these 
      forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this 
      interim update. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no 
      obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as 
      a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing 
      crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and 
      chemical margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of 
      exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness 
      of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological 
      developments; the results of operations and financial condition of 
      equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company&#8217;s 
      joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development 
      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company&#8217;s 
      production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation 
      networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe 
      weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the 
      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability 
      for remedial actions or assessments required by existing or future 
      environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or 
      product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes, 
      regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other 
      pending or future litigation; the company&#8217;s future acquisition or 
      disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or 
      impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, 
      industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on 
      scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with 
      the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally 
      accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and 
      the factors set forth under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; on pages 28 
      through 30 of the company&#8217;s 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 
      addition, such results could be affected by general domestic and 
      international economic and political conditions. Other unpredictable or 
      unknown factors not discussed in this interim update could also have 
      material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

Theravance intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Examples of such statements include statements relating to: plans for executing the separation of Theravance into two independent companies, the expected timing of the separation, expectations for the amount and estimated duration of the funding of Theravance Biopharma at the time of the separation, the strategies, plans and objectives of the two companies following the separation, expectations related to the staffing of the two companies, the timing, manner and amount of anticipated potential returns of capital to stockholders if the separation is consummated, the possible tax effects of the separation, the status and timing of clinical studies, data analysis and communication of results, the potential benefits and mechanisms of action of product candidates, the enabling capabilities of Theravance's approach to drug discovery and its proprietary insights, expectations for product candidates through development and commercialization, and the timing of seeking regulatory approval of product candidates.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements include, among others, risks related to: delays in preparing audited financial statements for Theravance Biopharma, difficulties in effecting the registration of Theravance Biopharma as a public company, failure to obtain necessary consents from third parties, changes in the development or operations of Theravance prior to the separation that could affect the plans for the separation or the cash available for the initial funding of the independent companies, delays encountered in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (should Theravance seek to effect the separation on a tax-free basis), the anticipated separation of Theravance into two independent companies or the intended return of capital to stockholders, the potential that results from clinical or non-clinical studies indicate product candidates are unsafe or ineffective, Theravance's dependence on third parties to conduct Theravance's clinical studies, delays or failure to achieve regulatory approvals for product candidates, risks of collaborating with third parties to discover, develop and commercialize products and risks associated with establishing distribution capabilities for telavancin with appropriate technical expertise and supporting infrastructure. Other risks affecting Theravance are described under the heading "Risk Factors" contained in Theravance's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 1, 2013 and the risks discussed in Theravance's other periodic filings with the SEC.

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N)-owned miner Colombian National Resources (CNR) has halted coal exports from Colombia because CNR cannot comply with a new environmental law governing port operations, a company source told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source said the company, a small producer in Colombia, will need between 16 and 18 months to build a conveyor belt that can stretch far offshore to load waiting ships to comply with a new law that took effect on January 1. It is expected to slash shipments from the world's No. 4 exporter in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNR, wholly owned by Goldman Sachs and operating two mines in Colombia, is exploring the possibility of exporting its coal through the nearby and legally compliant facilities of rival Prodeco but it was not clear if this would be viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are seeing what is best regarding coal prices and what they are offering. No decision has been taken," said the source, who could not ascertain the degree of contact between the two companies or at what level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no other facilities in Colombia that it would be viable for the company to approach, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia's government on Wednesday suspended the loading rights at the port of its second-biggest coal miner, U.S.-based Drummond, as it had continued to load coal by the now-banned crane and barge method. The former method caused lumps of coal and dust to fall into the sea while the new conveyor belts are fully enclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government's decision is set to cut Colombia's coal exports by about a third until March when Drummond expects to have finished construction of its own enclosed conveyor belt loader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coal prices in Europe, where most of Colombia's coal is consumed, rose sharply on Wednesday and Thursday as the market factored in a tightening of supplies from the Andean nation for the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNR produced about 3.5 million tones of coal in 2013, only about 4 percent of the 82 million tones the mining ministry expects was produced during the year. That means the impact of the company's inability to load is likely to be minimal compared with that of Drummond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Adler and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch to Rate JPMCC Mortgage Securities Trust 2014-FBLU; Presale Issued
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on J.P. Morgan Chase 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2014-FBLU.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$205,000,000 class A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$340,000,000* class X-CP 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$340,000,000* class X-EXT 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$77,000,000 class B, 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$58,000,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$76,000,000 class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$119,000,000 class E 'NR'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      * Interest-only classes X-CP X-EXT are equal to the notional balance of 
      classes A, B and C.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Jan. 3, 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, the 
      primary asset of which is one loan having an aggregate principal balance 
      of approximately $535 million as of the cutoff date and secured by the 
      Fontainebleau Miami Beach, a 1,594 room luxury resort hotel located 
      along the beach in Miami, FL. The loan was originated by JP Morgan Chase 
      Bank, National Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Single-Asset Concentration: The transaction is secured by a single hotel 
      property and therefore more susceptible to single event risk related to 
      the market. Hotel performance is considered to be more volatile due to 
      their operating nature.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moderate Trust Leverage: Fitch Ratings' stressed DSCR and LTV for the 
      trust component of the debt are 1.30x and 81.0%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Asset Quality and Market Positioning: The Fontainebleau Resort is a 
      class A luxury resort located in Miami Beach, FL with an irreplaceable 
      location directly along the Atlantic Ocean and first-class amenities 
      including over 200,000 sf of meeting and event space, a 40,000-sf spa, 
      12 swimming pools and multiple dining and entertainment options. The 
      property consistently ranks among the top conference hotels in the 
      region and is a dominant property in its primary competitive set.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upward Trending Performance: Revenue per available room (RevPAR) as of 
      the trailing twelve months (TTM) ended November 2013 reflected an 
      increase of 9.0% over year-end (YE) 2012 and a 16.2% increase over YE 
      2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Volatility of Food and Beverage Revenue: Approximately 45.5% of revenue 
      at the property is derived from food and beverage (FB) revenue, which 
      is considered more volatile than room revenue. Although the overall 
      level of FB is high, it is spread among multiple venues and sources 
      such as restaurants, banquet functions and lounges. The property's 
      signature restaurants and LIV nightclub serve as draws for non-hotel 
      guests as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 84.0% decline in value and 
      an approximately 73.1% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to the 'AAAsf' rated class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings for class A and a 30.0% 
      decline in Fitch NCF would result in a one category downgrade, while a 
      51.0% decline would result in a downgrade to below investment grade. The 
      Rating Sensitivity section in the presale report includes a detailed 
      explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report. The presale report is available to all 
      investors on Fitch's web site 'www.fitchratings.com'.

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to JPMCC 
      2014-FBLU
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of 
      preliminary ratings for the JPMCC 2014-FBLU transaction (see ratings 
      list below). JPMCC 2014-FBLU is a CMBS single borrower transaction that 
      is collateralized by a $535.0 million first mortgage floating rate loan 
      that was originated by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association on 
      December 6, 2013. The loan, which has an initial two-year term, provides 
      for three, one-year extension options and requires monthly interest-only 
      payments based on one month LIBOR plus an initial spread of 2.15%. A 
      third-party interest rate cap agreement is in place with Commonwealth 
      Bank of Australia &#8220;AA-&#8220;. Should the loan be extended, a replacement 
      interest rate cap agreement covering the extended loan term must be 
      procured.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loan is secured by the borrower&#8217;s fee simple and leasehold interest 
      in The Fontainebleau Miami Beach, a 1,594 key luxury full-service resort 
      located in Miami Beach, Florida. The Fontainebleau Miami Beach is an 
      iconic asset that is a popular destination for leisure and group 
      travelers as it has 1,250 linear feet of ocean frontage with direct 
      beach access and a number of amenities which including 12 swimming pools 
      as well as a 40,000 sf health spa with 31 treatment rooms, a fitness 
      center, six retail outlets, and a 23-slip marina. It also features 
      several restaurants, night life an entertainment venues, and 204,000 sf 
      of indoor/outdoor banquet and meeting space.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The property is situated within Millionaire&#8217;s Row on Collins Avenue, the 
      main beachfront thoroughfare in Miami Beach. Miami Beach, and the 
      subject, have the ability to draw visitors from the Northern United 
      States and Europe during its winter months, and South American tourists 
      during its summers, who seek to escape winter in the southern 
      hemisphere. Overall, a record 13.9 million estimated visitors stayed at 
      least one night in the Greater Miami and Beaches area in 
      January-December 2012, the third year in a row with a record number of 
      overnight visitors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction included a detailed evaluation of the 
      resort&#8217;s cash flows using our CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines, and 
      the application of our CMBS Single Borrower  Large Loan Rating 
      Methodology. The results of the analysis produced an individual KNCF for 
      each property. We applied KBRA capitalization rates to each property&#8217;s 
      KNCF to arrive at KBRA value. The analysis produced an aggregate KNCF 
      and KBRA value for the property of $73.3 million and $718.3 million, 
      respectively. The resulting KLTV is 74.5%. In our analysis of the 
      transaction, we also reviewed and considered third party engineering and 
      environmental reports, as well as our own on-site inspections of the 
      properties and the competition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      release could result in the assignment of final ratings that differ from 
      the preliminary ratings.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) plans to sell or exit over time its business of issuing prepaid cards for corporate payrolls and government tax refunds and benefits, the company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cards, which had been offered with cash and treasury services to companies and governments, had become a headache of risks in operations and regulations, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month JPMorgan warned some 465,000 holders of the cards that their personal data may have been accessed by computer hackers who attacked its network in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company mailed incorrect replacement cards to some 4,000 people receiving payments from the state of Connecticut. The state treasurer blasted the bank for its "obvious lack of attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government regulators are focusing on whether corporate payroll programs that use the cards have sufficient safeguards against burdening employees with fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent letters to more than 20 companies asking for details on how they use payroll cards. [ID:nL2N0F916H] The probe was started after complaints from workers and advocacy groups about fees bank charge for using the cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers have said that they offer the cards to employees as an option along with paper paychecks and direct deposits to bank accounts. Even with the fees, they can be cheaper than check-cashing services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there have been complaints that direct deposit choices are hard to exercise and a lawsuit was filed against a McDonald's franchisee by an employee who claimed she was required to use a JPMorgan Chase payroll card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank was not sued in that case, but the complaint was bad for the Chase brand name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in September issued a bulletin to reiterate that laws and rules on electronic funds transfers apply to payroll cards. The bulletin specifically noted that the CFPB has authority over banks providing payroll cards, which raised the possibility that banks might be expected to make sure corporate clients were following rules when paying employees with cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan became a target for law enforcers and regulators after the biggest bank in the United States by assets lost $6.2 billion in a derivatives bet in 2012 out of its London offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the company agreed to pay $2.6 billion to settle government and private claims against it for not reporting suspicions of fraud by convicted Ponzi-schemer Bernie Madoff, its long-time client. And, it agreed last year to pay $13 billion to settle government claims over mortgage-related instruments sold before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, JPMorgan has been moving to simplify its operations after its risk controls and guards against money laundering were found deficient by regulators. Critics have also said the bank is too big to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan decided last summer to exit its physical commodities business after concluding potential returns were not worth the regulatory hassle. It is also getting out of lending to students, as well as scaling back on international transactions that carry heightened risks of money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to JPMorgan's statement, the bank "will explore a full range of options for its prepaid card business, including a sale." In the meantime, it will continue to support current clients and cardholders, but will not take on new business. The decision does not affect Chase customers holding credit, debit or prepaid "Liquid" cards, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business contributes too little toward JPMorgan's nearly $100 billion in annual revenue to have to be disclosed in its income statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Phil Berlowitz and David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta and DENVER, Jan. 9, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On Dec. 18, Microsoft announced that Long View (longviewsystems.com), one of North America's foremost providers in IT consulting, outsourcing solutions, and cloud services, has again been selected as a Microsoft Licensing Solution Provider (LSP) moving forward &#8212; an achievement that will continue to position Long View as a trusted partner of the international software giant.
			
	The announcement is also extremely significant for the future, says Long View's Chief Executive Officer Gord Mawhinney, in the transformational age of cloud.
			
	"Being a Microsoft Licensing Solutions Provider is an important element of our ability to reduce complexity, while also ensuring greater alignment around successful adoption and integration of Microsoft technology in their environments," says Mawhinney.

	Microsoft's move to Office 365 and Azure represents the beginning of a long-term service delivery shift. Long View shares a vision of this future by understanding the opportunities that will be available to its clients, says Bill Evelyn, Long View's Microsoft Practice Director.

&lt;p&gt;* Jobless claims fall more than expected in latest week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Intercept Pharma drug meets goal in trial, shares triple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Family Dollar drag retailers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Indexes off: Dow 0.39 pct, S 0.29 pct, Nasdaq 0.47 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dipped on Thursday,
weighed by Exxon Mobil and retailers, as an earlier boost from
upbeat labor market data lost steam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S retail index declined 0.7 percent, pulled
lower by a 13.2 percent tumble in Bed, Bath and Beyond Inc
 to $69.14 and a 6.9 percent drop in Family Dollar
Stores Inc to $61.76.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bed Bath &amp; Beyond lowered its fourth quarter and full-year
earnings estimates after the close on Wednesday while Family
Dollar reported a weaker quarterly profit on Thursday as
it discounted more than it had planned to win holiday shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp lost 1 percent to $99.71 as the
biggest drag on the S 500 after Citigroup cut its rating on
the oil company to "neutral" from "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After a number of years where the macro events meant the
stocks traded pretty similarly, now we are beginning to see more
differentiation," said Kate Warne, investment strategist at
Edward Jones in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While there are still broad macro questions that will move
the market as a whole, right now we are beginning to see
investors try to parse through the data to say which companies
will continue to make gains and which ones will disappoint as
they can't continue the progress from last year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indexes had opened in positive territory, aided by initial
jobless claims data which showed the number of Americans filing
new claims for unemployment benefits last week fell more than
expected to a seasonally adjusted 330,000, pointing to an
economy that was continuing to gain steam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank said last month it would begin
trimming its stimulative monthly bond purchases, and minutes
from the Fed's most recent meeting showed its top officials were
keen to steer a delicate path and many of them stressed that
future decisions were not set in stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average fell 65.03 points or
0.39 percent, to 16,397.71, the S 500 lost 5.24 points
or 0.29 percent, to 1,832.25 and the Nasdaq Composite 
dropped 19.56 points or 0.47 percent, to 4,146.052.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline put the S on track for its fifth drop in six
sessions so far in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macy's was a bright spot for retailers, as shares
jumped 7.5 percent to $55.74 a day after the department store
operator reported strong holiday sales and gave a preliminary
forecast for 2014 that suggests it will continue to outpace its
rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many U.S. retailers had ramped up promotions as
shoppers continued to watch their spending during the holiday
season, hitting profits at several chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare sector stocks continued to shine as one of only
two of the major S indexes in positive territory. U.S. drugs
wholesaler McKesson added 3 percent to $174.89 after it
raised its offer for German peer Celesio, persuading
a hedge fund that had been blocking the multi-billion dollar
deal to agree to sell some of its shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc rocketed more than
280 percent to $277.82 after it said an analysis by an
independent safety committee showed its liver disease drug met
the main goal of a mid-stage trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 9 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
plans to sell or wind down its business of issuing prepaid cards
for corporate payrolls and government tax refunds and benefits,
the company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product, which has been offered with cash and treasury
services to companies and governments, had become a headache of
risks in operations and regulations, according to a person
familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak
publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month JPMorgan warned some 465,000 holders of the cards
that their personal data may have been accessed by computer
hackers who attacked its network in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government regulators are focusing on whether corporate
payroll programs that use the cards have sufficient safeguards
against burdening employees with fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past year the company has been moving to simplify
its operations after its risk controls and guards against money
laundering were found deficient by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to JPMorgan's statement, the bank "will explore a
full range of options for its prepaid card business, including a
sale." In the meantime, it will continue to support current
clients and cardholders. The decision does not affect Chase
customers holding credit, debit or prepaid "Liquid" cards, the
company said.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4322 Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4322 'AA/F1', Stable Outlook; DRIVERs, Series 4322 
      'AA', Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4322 
      PUTTERs and series 4322 DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch has 
      assigned to the The Indianapolis Local Public Improvement Bond Bank 
      Bonds, Series 2013F (rated 'AA', Stable Outlook) that have been 
      deposited in the series 4322 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4322 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (rated 
      A+/F1', Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs will 
      expire on June 5, 2014, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, 
      unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculation over Microsoft Corp's succession plans refocused on internal choices on Wednesday, a day after the leading outside candidate, Ford Motor Co CEO Alan Mulally, took himself off the list of potential CEOs at the world's largest software maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A source close to the company said no appointment was likely until the last week of January or in February. The source asked not be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the process to select a successor to long-time CEO Steve Ballmer, who in August announced his plan to retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late January, many Microsoft executives will be focused on the company's earnings, which are scheduled to be released on January 23. Also, chairman Bill Gates, a key member of the search committee, will be at the World Economic Forum in Davos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For months, Microsoft watchers had pegged Mulally as the odds-on bet to succeed Ballmer as chief executive at the dominant producer of software for desktops and laptops, which has faltered in making the transition to the fast-growing mobile phone and tablet markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mulally formally pulled out of the running on Tuesday, telling the Associated Press he would remain at Ford through 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether Mulally's withdrawal from consideration was his decision or Microsoft's. While the company's intentions remained a guessing game, internal candidates now seemed the obvious ones, especially in light of comments by Microsoft about the importance of tech know-how for the top job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mulally appeared to be the front runner in the latter part of last year and seemed to be interested in the job, but Microsoft never made him an offer, suggesting that the prevailing mood on the company's board was that he was not right for the job, two sources familiar with the process said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources have also told Reuters that Microsoft is down to a "handful" of candidates, including insiders Satya Nadella, executive vice president of the Cloud &amp; Enterprise group and Tony Bates, executive vice president of Business Development and Evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, a Microsoft veteran before moving to Nokia, whose mobile phone business Microsoft bought last year, has also been cited as a top candidate, as have one or more outsiders from the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former Microsoft executive who will soon rejoin the company when the takeover is complete, Elop was mentioned as now "front and center" of the CEO race in a research note from FBR analyst Daniel Ives, who cited his "previous Microsoft experience and demonstrable expertise in the mobile space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evercore analyst Kirk Materne saw it differently, naming Nadella and Bates as the leading internal candidates who "could potentially institute organizational change at a more rapid pace given their insider status."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares, which have gained 36 percent over the past year, were down 1.2 percent, while Ford shares gained about the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'DARK HORSE' IN THE RUNNING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nomura's Rick Sherlund labeled Mulally's withdrawal as "disappointing" in a research note, echoing the sentiment of some other investors and analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherlund said it was unclear who the board would turn to, saying he viewed Bates and Nadella as capable, but "more likely to take direction from Microsoft's board rather than redirect the board and take the company in a different direction as we prefer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the company does opt to go with an outsider, candidates could include Facebook Inc Chief Operator Officer Sheryl Sandberg, VMware Inc CEO Pat Gelsinger and Pivotal CEO Paul Maritz, Ives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherlund agreed that Microsoft could still look at a "dark horse" outsider but noted that some tech sector candidates, including Maritz, may have already declined to take the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a blog post on the company's website in December, Microsoft lead independent director John Thompson emphasized the need for a CEO with good tech bona fides and "an ability to lead a highly technical organization and work with top technical talent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson, who leads the four-member CEO search committee, said at the time he expected the panel to reach a decision "in the early part of 2014."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nadia Damouni; Editing by David Gregorio and Grant McCool)&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Affirms J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., 
      Ser 2001-CIBC1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed six classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp. series 2001-CIBC1 commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates. A detailed listing of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 16.0% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 6.2%, including $58.3 million (5.8% of 
      the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has 
      designated four loans (46.2%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 
      one specially serviced asset (10.4%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the December 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 97.2% to $28.9 million from $1 
      billion at issuance. Nine of the original 165 loans remain. Six loans 
      (85.1%) have anticipated repayment dates, with final maturity dates 
      ranging from 2026 through 2030. Three loans (14.9%) have maturity dates 
      between 2015 and 2020. One loan (1.6%) is currently defeased. Interest 
      shortfalls are currently affecting classes H through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to Fitch's modeled losses is a 45,000 square 
      foot (sf) retail property (10.4%) located in Akron, OH. The property was 
      previously 100% occupied by Dicks Sporting Goods which vacated the 
      property upon their lease expiration in November 2013. The property 
      remains completely vacant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating on the class G notes may be subject to further downgrades as 
      losses are realized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$24.7 million class G notes at 'CCCsf'; RE 90%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.6 million class H notes at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class J notes at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class K notes at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class L notes at 'Dsf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$0 class M notes at 'Dsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A-1, A-2, A-3, B, C, D, E, F, and X2 notes have paid in full. 
      Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only class X1 
      certificates.

			SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This news release may contain forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of the federal securities laws, including but not limited to, 
      statements regarding future events, developments, the Company's future 
      performance, as well as management's expectations, beliefs, intentions, 
      plans, estimates or projections relating to the future (including, 
      without limitation, statements concerning revenue, net income and 
      earnings per share). Risks and uncertainties exist that may cause the 
      results to differ materially from those set forth in these 
      forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause the anticipated 
      results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements 
      are set forth in Part I, Item A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 
      10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, including but not limited 
      to: the volume and timing of systems sales and installations; length of 
      sales cycles and the installation process; the possibility that products 
      will not achieve or sustain market acceptance; seasonal patterns of 
      sales and customer buying behavior; impact of incentive payments under 
      The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on sales and the ability of 
      the Company to meet continued certification requirements; the 
      development by competitors of new or superior technologies; the timing, 
      cost and success or failure of new product and service introductions, 
      development and product upgrade releases; undetected errors or bugs in 
      software; product liability; changing economic, political or regulatory 
      influences in the health-care industry; changes in product-pricing 
      policies; availability of third-party products and components; 
      competitive pressures including product offerings, pricing and 
      promotional activities; the Company's ability or inability to attract 
      and retain qualified personnel; possible regulation of the Company's 
      software by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; changes of accounting 
      estimates and assumptions used to prepare the prior periods' financial 
      statements; and general economic conditions. A significant portion of 
      the Company's quarterly sales of software product licenses and computer 
      hardware is concluded in the last month of a fiscal quarter, generally 
      with a concentration of such revenues earned in the final ten business 
      days of that month. Due to these and other factors, the Company's 
      revenues and operating results are very difficult to forecast. A major 
      portion of the Company's costs and expenses, such as personnel and 
      facilities, are of a fixed nature and, accordingly, a shortfall or 
      decline in quarterly and/or annual revenues typically results in lower 
      profitability or losses. As a result, comparison of the Company's 
      period-to-period financial performance is not necessarily meaningful and 
      should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance. The 
      Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking 
      statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or 
      otherwise.

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS/GUATEMALA CITY Jan 12 (Reuters) - Guatemalan
authorities have found half a tonne of cocaine on a plane from
Venezuela in the latest high-profile drugs haul in the region,
authorities said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two people were also arrested during Saturday's capture, the
Venezuelan Attorney-General's Office said in a brief statement
announcing an investigation into the affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guatemala's President Otto Perez said on Saturday: "We are
on alert and we will be reviewing processes to make sure these
planes don't enter Guatemala."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guatemala's security ministry said it was not yet clear
which cartel the delivery was supposed to reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuela's location on South America's Caribbean and
Atlantic seaboards has made it a popular point for smuggling
Colombian cocaine to U.S. and European markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Nicolas Maduro's government says it is catching
criminals in record numbers, but critics allege military and
customs authorities are often taking part in the trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an embarrassing case for Venezuela, some two dozen people
- including a handful of soldiers - were arrested in September
in connection with the smuggling of 1.3 tonnes of cocaine on an
Air France flight from Caracas to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan authorities gave no further details about the
Guatemalan case.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS Jan 12 (Reuters) - French online music group Deezer
is studying a commercial and industrial agreement with Korean
electronics group Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which
might also take a stake in its capital, a French weekly said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le Journal du Dimanche also reported that French
video-sharing website Dailymotion, owned by French telecoms
operator Orange, is in talks with software maker
Microsoft about a stake in its capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two French firms were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privately-held Deezer, created in 2006, says it has more
than 12 million users worldwide and a catalog of 30 million
songs, to which users can get free, unlimited access for 12
months. It also sells paying subscriptions, which offer ad-free,
unlimited music streaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is one of the main competitors of Swedish online
music group Spotify, which in November raised 250 million
dollars from private investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orange Chief Executive Stephane Richard said last month that
Dailymotion was close to signing a partnership in the United
States and was working on another in Asia to help it to take on
market leader YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he did not name the companies, Richard said the
potential U.S. partner is "a major player" in the digital
economy and described the Asian company as "a significant
regional operator".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orange had been in talks with United States-based web portal
Yahoo last year to sell a 75 percent stake in
Dailymotion, but the deal foundered in May after France's
industry minister slammed the idea of one of the country's most
visible start-ups being "devoured" by Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO, Jan. 13, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- REVA Medical, Inc. (ASX:RVA) ("REVA" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has completed enrollment in the clinical trial of the ReZolve2 drug-eluting bioresorbable scaffold. A total of 112 patients have been enrolled in the trial to provide the data needed to apply for European CE Marking. The Company anticipates that it will file the CE Mark application before the end of 2014, as previously announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Commenting on the conclusion of enrollment, REVA's SVP of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs, Jeff Anderson stated, "Patient enrollment of the ReZolve2 scaffold at clinical sites on three continents went smoothly and represents an important milestone for the Company. We are encouraged by the positive early clinical data reported previously from this trial and look forward to providing an update on data from these patients at the Paris Course on Revascularization (EuroPCR), which will be held in May in Paris, France."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Company is also pleased to announce that its Chairman and CEO, Bob Stockman, is scheduled to present at the 32nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference at 12:30 p.m. US PST on Thursday, January 16, 2014. The conference is being held January 13 through 16 at The Westin St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, California.

			About REVA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	REVA is a development stage medical device company incorporated in Delaware, USA, that is focused on the development and eventual commercialization of its proprietary bioresorbable stent products. The ReZolve&#174; product family, which is in a clinical study phase, combines REVA's proprietary stent design with a proprietary polymer that is metabolized and cleared from the body. REVA's anticipated initial commercial product, the ReZolve2 scaffold, is designed to offer full x-ray visibility, clinically relevant sizing, and a controlled and safe resorption rate. In addition, by early encapsulation of the stent in the artery tissue coupled with the loss of scaffold structure over time, the ReZolve2 scaffold may reduce the incidence of late forming blood clots or otherwise reduce long-term disease progression, potential benefits of bioresorbable scaffolds that have yet to be proven. REVA will require clinical results and regulatory approval before it can begin selling the ReZolve2 scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Barani Krishnan
    NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Gold hit one-month highs on
Monday, extending gains from last week driven by weak U.S. jobs
data, even as influential market voice Goldman Sachs predicted a
losing year for bullion and other commodities such as copper and
soybeans.
    The spot price of gold rose about half a percent to
above $1,255 an ounce, its highest since Dec. 12, joining a
broad run-up in the commodities complex on Monday as the dollar
stumbled and U.S. stocks eased.   
    Goldman on Monday forecast a year-end price target of $1,050
for gold that puts the shiny metal on course for a 15 percent
loss from current levels.
    A similar percentage loss in copper for 2014 was
predicted by the Wall Street bank and commodities trader. Copper
futures rose slightly to close at $7,329 a tonne in London but
was still down about 1 percent on the year. 
    In soybeans, Goldman saw a "significant downside"
through the year due to expectations for record South American
output. On Monday, soybeans rallied 1.2 percent to above $12.94
a bushel in Chicago, rebounding from the 6-week low hit in early
January. For the year, soy is little changed. 
 
    Goldman said it was neutral on commodities near-term and
underweight over the longer term, forecasting a 3 percent return
over a 3-month period and negative 3 percent over 12 months.   
    "The uncertainty about oil supplies due to geopolitical
risks in Libya and South Sudan keeps us from taking a stronger
view near term," it said. While it saw a structural bear market
in the distant future, Goldman still recommended holding
commodities in 2014 "from an asset allocation perspective".
    The 19-commodity Thomson Reuters/Core Commodity Index
 rose a modest 0.3 percent on Monday and is down nearly
1.5 percent on the year.
    Oil prices fell, with U.S. crude down nearly 1
percent at $91.80 a barrel while benchmark Brent oil 
slipping about half a percent to below $107. 
    Gold prices surged on Friday after U.S. jobs data for
December showed employers hiring the fewest workers in nearly
three years. Gold traders and investors saw the data as a sign
that the Federal Reserve will take longer to taper bond-buying
and raise interest rates than previously thought.
    Gold, a favorite hedge against the weak dollar and economic
uncertainty, hit record highs above $1,900 in 2011 as the Fed
accelerated its monetary expansion after the financial crisis.
Last year, after a 12-year rally, it fell for the first time,
plunging nearly 30 percent, and the Fed moved to roll back its
stimulus measures. This year so far, it has risen 4 percent.
    Some believe the rebound can continue.
    "If gold prices can sustain the $1,200 key support level,
the majority of the 2014 year could very well remain within the
$1,200-$1,400 range," London-based ETF Securities said in an
report.
    Natural gas and nickel were among the largest gainers on the
CRB on Monday.
    Natgas futures rose over 5 percent in New York
trading, reaching at above $4.26 per million British thermal
units, as cold weather forecasts returned to the northeastern
United States after a brief respite last week. 
    Nickel gained over 2 percent, adding to Friday's
near 4 percent rise, and reached a 2-week high of above $14,215
a tonne, as a ban on unprocessed ore exports from top exporter
Indonesia came into effect.

      Research and Markets: United States Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) 
      Market Report 2014-2018: Citrix, Microsoft, Oracle  VMware Dominate
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/x8h9n6/virtual_desktop) 
      has announced the addition of the "United 
      States Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Market Research  Forecast 
      Report 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers is the need for remote access interfaces to 
      enterprise applications and data. With the adoption of virtual desktop 
      infrastructure solutions, enterprises and end-users are able to easily 
      access the applications and data from any location using their handheld 
      devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloud computing and cloud-based applications and services are witnessing 
      increasing adoption from enterprises and end-users. With increasing 
      bandwidth support being provided by the communication service providers, 
      there is a rapid increase in the access of enterprise data and 
      application by end-users is using smartphones, tablets, and other 
      handheld devices. Virtual desktop infrastructure images are being stored 
      in the data centers and accessed over the cloud infrastructure which is 
      decreasing the operational costs considerably. Further, with the 
      cloud-based virtual desktop solutions finding increasing adoption, there 
      are many applications being supported on the cloud which are being 
      accessed over the virtual desktop infrastructure solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the 
      concern for the huge capital expenditure required for restructuring the 
      enterprise network to support the virtualized applications and services. 
      Enterprises are required to procure the virtualization software and 
      supporting applications which form the base for enterprises to deploy 
      the applications for their end-users.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prime money market funds parked $72 billion with the Federal Reserve in December as the central bank ramped up its testing of a program aimed to help the central bank achieve its targeted interest rate when it eventually begins raising rates, a report by J.P. Morgan Securities released on Monday showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount placed by prime money funds in the Fed's fixed-rate reverse repurchase agreement program last month was up from $68 billion in November, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed's reverse repo test has involved money funds, banks and government-sponsored enterprises placing fund with the central bank overnight in exchange for Treasuries. These counterparties earn interests on the reverse repos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of reverse repos that prime money funds held at the end of December was equivalent to 5 percent of their $1.5 trillion in total assets, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 31, the Fed awarded a record $197.8 billion worth of fixed-rate reverse repos, paying an interest rate of 0.03 percent to 102 bidders, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve, which doesn't offer details on bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year-end spike in money funds' allocation into the Fed's reverse repo program "was not surprising given the typical tight supply conditions going into year-end as banks and dealers manage their balance sheets, while cash investment needs typically increase," J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funds' increased holdings of reverse repos came at the expense of their ownership of European bank debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their exposure to the euro zone fell by about $36 billion to $227 billion at the end of 2013. For the year, their euro zone debt holdings grew by $24 billion, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their exposure in British, Swiss and Nordic banks also fell at year-end. Those holdings declined by about $36 billion to $197 billion, resulting in an annual drop of $17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

			Seattle 
      Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SGEN) today highlighted several anticipated 
      2014 milestones related to ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) and its 
      antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) pipeline programs in a presentation at the 
      32nd J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Monday, January 13, 
      2014 at 9:30 a.m. Pacific Time. Highlights include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The company announced that it has aligned with collaborator Takeda 
        Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda), as well as with the U.S. Food 
        and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Union regulators, on a 
        protocol amendment to unblind the phase 3 AETHERA clinical trial in 
        the second half of 2014.
      
			
        Under the collaboration with Takeda, ADCETRIS recently received 
        marketing authorization in Australia and Singapore, and regulatory 
        approvals are being pursued in multiple other countries globally 
        during 2014, including Japan.
      
			
        ADCETRIS was recently added to the National Comprehensive Cancer 
        Network (NCCN) guidelines for the treatment of relapsed CD30-positive 
        peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).
      
			
        Seattle Genetics reviewed anticipated 2014 data presentations and 
        program milestones from its portfolio of ADC programs, including a 
        broad clinical development program evaluating ADCETRIS for the 
        treatment of CD30-positive malignancies and progress with ADC 
        candidates SGN-CD19A, SGN-CD33A and SGN-CD70A.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our leadership in the field of antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, is 
      exemplified by our substantial progress in developing and 
      commercializing ADCETRIS and advancing our pipeline of five other ADC 
      candidates in clinical trials,&#8221; said Clay B. Siegall, Ph.D., President 
      and Chief Executive Officer at Seattle Genetics. &#8220;We anticipate 
      significant milestones during 2014, including data from the ADCETRIS 
      phase 3 AETHERA clinical trial as well as from phase 2 clinical trials 
      in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and salvage Hodgkin lymphoma 
      (HL). We also anticipate reporting additional data from phase 1 clinical 
      trials evaluating SGN-CD19A in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as the first clinical data from a phase 1 
      clinical trial evaluating SGN-CD33A in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 
      Lastly, we anticipate advancing SGN-CD70A, our sixth ADC pipeline 
      program, into clinical evaluation during 2014.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ADCETRIS 2014 Milestones
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ADCETRIS is being evaluated in more than 30 ongoing clinical trials, 
      including four phase 3 trials, designed to establish it as the 
      foundation of therapy for CD30-positive malignancies. The phase 3 
      AETHERA trial is evaluating ADCETRIS versus placebo for the treatment of 
      patients at high risk of residual HL following autologous stem cell 
      transplant (ASCT) to determine if ADCETRIS can extend progression-free 
      survival in a consolidation or maintenance-type setting for these 
      post-ASCT HL patients. Based on current estimates of progression events 
      from pooled, blinded data from the ongoing trial, the study has been 
      amended to enable a time point-driven progression-free survival analysis 
      after patients have completed all required scans, which is anticipated 
      to occur in the second half of 2014. The AETHERA trial is not being 
      conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement from the 
      FDA and has not been designated as a confirmatory trial to convert 
      either accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorization to 
      regular approval. This trial will provide drug safety data analyses that 
      fulfill one of the company&#8217;s FDA post-approval requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, data presentations from several ongoing ADCETRIS studies 
      are expected at medical forums in 2014, including data from:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        a phase 1/2 study in combination with bendamustine in second-line HL;
      
			
        clinical trials in relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including 
        DLBCL; and
      
			
        follow-up from a phase 2 trial in frontline HL patients age 60 and 
        above.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      ADCETRIS is currently approved for only two indications: (1) the 
      treatment of patients with HL after failure of ASCT or after failure of 
      at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are 
      not ASCT candidates, and (2) the treatment of patients with systemic 
      anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (sALCL) after failure of at least one 
      prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ADC Pipeline Program 2014 Milestones
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Seattle Genetics has a robust pipeline of ADC programs in ongoing 
      clinical trials, including SGN-CD19A, SGN-CD33A, SGN-LIV1A, ASG-22ME and 
      ASG-15ME.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SGN-CD19A is an ADC targeting CD19, a protein expressed uniformly on 
      most B-cell malignancies, which is being evaluated in phase 1 clinical 
      trials for the treatment of ALL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Data presented 
      at the 55th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual 
      Meeting in December 2013 demonstrated encouraging early antitumor 
      activity and a generally well-tolerated safety profile among heavily 
      pretreated patients with ALL. In addition, multiple complete remissions 
      have been observed in a parallel phase 1 study evaluating SGN-CD19A in 
      aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Additional data from both ongoing phase 
      1 clinical trials are expected to be presented in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SGN-CD33A is a novel CD33-directed ADC utilizing Seattle Genetics&#8217; next 
      generation technology. The CD33 antibody is attached to a highly potent 
      cytotoxic agent called a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer via a 
      proprietary site-specific conjugate technology to a monoclonal antibody 
      with engineered cysteines (EC-mAb). SGN-CD33A is being evaluated in a 
      phase 1 clinical trial for patients with AML. The first presentation of 
      clinical data from SGN-CD33A is expected during 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Seattle Genetics is also advancing SGN-LIV1A, ASG-22ME and ASG-15ME in 
      ongoing phase 1 clinical trials for a variety of solid tumor types.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company also plans to advance SGN-CD70A, a novel CD70-directed ADC 
      utilizing its proprietary PBD dimer and EC-mAb technologies, into phase 
      1 clinical trials during 2014. SGN-CD70A will be the company&#8217;s sixth ADC 
      pipeline program currently in clinical evaluation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About ADCs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are monoclonal antibodies that are 
      designed to selectively deliver cytotoxic agents to tumor cells. This 
      approach is intended to spare non-targeted cells and thus reduce many of 
      the toxic effects of traditional chemotherapy while enhancing antitumor 
      activity. ADCETRIS is an ADC directed to CD30, a defining marker of 
      classical HL and known to be expressed in some types of non-Hodgkin 
      lymphoma.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About ADCETRIS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) is an ADC comprising an anti-CD30 
      monoclonal antibody attached by a protease-cleavable linker to a 
      microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), utilizing 
      Seattle Genetics&#8217; proprietary technology. The ADC employs a linker 
      system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release 
      MMAE upon internalization into CD30-expressing tumor cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ADCETRIS for intravenous injection received accelerated approval from 
      the FDA and approval with conditions from Health Canada for two 
      indications: (1) the treatment of patients with HL after failure of ASCT 
      or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens 
      in patients who are not ASCT candidates, and (2) the treatment of 
      patients with sALCL after failure of at least one prior multi-agent 
      chemotherapy regimen. The indications for ADCETRIS are based on response 
      rate. There are no data available demonstrating improvement in 
      patient-reported outcomes or survival with ADCETRIS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ADCETRIS was granted conditional marketing authorization by the European 
      Commission in October 2012 for two indications: (1) for the treatment of 
      adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive HL following 
      autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), or following at least two prior 
      therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment 
      option, and (2) the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
      refractory sALCL. ADCETRIS has received marketing authorization by 
      regulatory authorities in more than 35 countries. See important safety 
      information below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Seattle Genetics and Takeda are jointly developing ADCETRIS. Under the 
      terms of the collaboration agreement, Seattle Genetics has U.S. and 
      Canadian commercialization rights and Takeda has rights to commercialize 
      ADCETRIS in the rest of the world. Seattle Genetics and Takeda are 
      funding joint development costs for ADCETRIS on a 50:50 basis, except in 
      Japan where Takeda will be solely responsible for development costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BOXED WARNING
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): JC virus infection 
      resulting in PML and death can occur in patients receiving ADCETRIS.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Contraindication:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Concomitant use of ADCETRIS and bleomycin is contraindicated due to 
      pulmonary toxicity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Warnings and Precautions:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Peripheral neuropathy: ADCETRIS treatment causes a peripheral 
        neuropathy that is predominantly sensory. Cases of peripheral motor 
        neuropathy have also been reported. ADCETRIS-induced peripheral 
        neuropathy is cumulative. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, 
        such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a 
        burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness and institute dose 
        modifications accordingly.
      
			
        Infusion reactions: Infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis, 
        have occurred with ADCETRIS. Monitor patients during infusion. If an 
        infusion reaction occurs, interrupt the infusion. If anaphylaxis 
        occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue the infusion.
      
			
        Hematologic toxicities: Grade 3 or 4 anemia, thrombocytopenia and 
        prolonged (&#8805;1 week) severe neutropenia can occur with ADCETRIS. 
        Febrile neutropenia has been reported with ADCETRIS. Monitor complete 
        blood counts prior to each dose of ADCETRIS and consider more frequent 
        monitoring for patients with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Closely monitor 
        patients for fever. If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia develops, manage by 
        G-CSF support, dose delays, reductions or discontinuation.
      
			
        Serious infections and opportunistic infections: Infections such as 
        pneumonia, bacteremia and sepsis/septic shock (including fatal 
        outcomes) have been reported in patients treated with ADCETRIS. 
        Closely monitor patients during treatment for the emergence of 
        possible bacterial, fungal or viral infections.
      
			
        Tumor lysis syndrome: Closely monitor patients with rapidly 
        proliferating tumor and high tumor burden.
      
			
        Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): JC virus infection 
        resulting in PML and death has been reported in ADCETRIS-treated 
        patients. In addition to ADCETRIS therapy, other possible contributory 
        factors include prior therapies and underlying disease that may cause 
        immunosuppression. Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient 
        presenting with new-onset signs and symptoms of central nervous system 
        abnormalities. Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, 
        consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture or 
        brain biopsy. Hold ADCETRIS if PML is suspected and discontinue 
        ADCETRIS if PML is confirmed.
      
			
        Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS): SJS has been reported with ADCETRIS. 
        If SJS occurs, discontinue ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical 
        therapy.
      
			
        Embryo-fetal toxicity: Fetal harm can occur. Advise pregnant women of 
        the potential hazard to the fetus.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Adverse Reactions:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ADCETRIS was studied as monotherapy in 160 patients in two Phase 2 
      trials. Across both trials, the most common adverse reactions (&#8805;20%), 
      regardless of causality, were neutropenia, peripheral sensory 
      neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, 
      diarrhea, pyrexia, rash, thrombocytopenia, cough and vomiting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Drug Interactions:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, or P-gp 
      inhibitors, has the potential to affect the exposure to MMAE.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Use in Specific Populations:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MMAE exposure is increased in patients with hepatic impairment and 
      severe renal impairment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. prime money market funds
parked $72 billion with the Federal Reserve in December as the
central bank ramped up its testing of a program aimed to help
the central bank achieve its targeted interest rate when it
eventually begins raising rates, a report by J.P. Morgan
Securities released on Monday showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount placed by prime money funds in the Fed's
fixed-rate reverse repurchase agreement program last month was
up from $68 billion in November, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed's reverse repo test has involved money funds, banks
and government-sponsored enterprises placing fund with the
central bank overnight in exchange for Treasuries. These
counterparties earn interests on the reverse repos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of reverse repos that prime money funds held at
the end of December was equivalent to 5 percent of their $1.5
trillion in total assets, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 31, the Fed awarded a record $197.8 billion worth of
fixed-rate reverse repos, paying an interest rate of 0.03
percent to 102 bidders, according to data from the New York
Federal Reserve, which doesn't offer details on bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year-end spike in money funds' allocation into the Fed's
reverse repo program "was not surprising given the typical tight
supply conditions going into year-end as banks and dealers
manage their balance sheets, while cash investment needs
typically increase," J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funds' increased holdings of reverse repos came at the
expense of their ownership of European bank debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their exposure to the euro zone fell by about $36 billion to
$227 billion at the end of 2013. For the year, their euro zone
debt holdings grew by $24 billion, J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their exposure in British, Swiss and Nordic banks also fell
at year-end. Those holdings declined by about $36 billion to
$197 billion, resulting in an annual drop of $17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. oil firm Chevron Corp
 will go ahead with the development of the Alder gas
field off the coast of Britain, helping to boost investment in
the region and adding to its future production outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron said on Monday it had reached its final investment
decision for the Adler field and received approval from the
British government to go ahead with the development in what a
spokeswoman said would be a "sizeable" investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alder, located in the central North Sea, is set to start
producing in 2016 with facilities designed to handle 110 million
cubic feet of gas and 14,000 barrels of condensate per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current high levels of investment in Britain's North Sea are
likely to continue to the end of 2015, energy consultancy Wood
Mackenzie forecast last week, adding that capital investment in
the region last year hit its highest level in real terms since
the mid-1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's oil and gas output has fallen by about two thirds
since 2000, posting particularly steep falls of 14.5 percent in
2012 and 18 percent in 2011, but big new investments have
fuelled hopes that some of the declines can be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New technologies made the development of Alder with its
high-pressure, high-temperature characteristics possible, said
Chevron, which holds a 74 percent stake in the field alongside
ConocoPhillips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, Chevron threw doubt on another of its projects
in the North Sea, Rosebank, a big development thought to cost
around $8 billion, saying it was not currently economically
attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said on Monday that no decision had been reached
on Rosebank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Rosebank joint venture participants continue to work
the front-end engineering and design work and are focusing their
efforts on developing an optimum development solution for
Rosebank," Chevron said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Delays could limit sale profits, scupper deals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Shell, Total, Eni, ConocoPhillips also divesting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Nigeria firms, partnered with foreign, bidding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Joe Brock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Chevron faces delays in
closing sales of oil blocks in Nigeria worth up to $1 billion
because of legal disputes involving potential buyers, industry
sources say, highlighting a risk other oil majors could face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is joining competitors ConocoPhillips, Royal
Dutch Shell, France's Total and Italy's Eni
 in disposing of stakes in onshore and shallow water
offshore fields in the Niger Delta region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC-member Nigeria has the potential to double its 2
million-2.5 million barrel per day oil output in the next five
years but problems with oil theft, pipeline sabotage and
regulatory uncertainty are putting off investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil majors want to keep hold of the biggest producing
fields, offshore assets and key pipelines and export terminals. 
But they are disposing of less profitable onshore blocks and 
fields that the government could strip from them if they remain
undeveloped for ten years, notably in the restive Niger Delta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has chosen its preferred bidders for the five blocks
it put up for sale in June but the deals have not closed because
rival firms have disputed its decision, with one taking the U.S.
company to court, sources close to the deals said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokeswoman said the company did not comment on
ongoing transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigerian firm Brittania-U, run by former Chevron executive
Catherine Uju Ifejika, was the highest bidder at over $1 billion
for the biggest cluster of blocks - OML 52, 53 and 55 - and
Chevron began discussions with the company over the sale, two
banking sources close to the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron decided to look at alternative bids after
Brittania-U did not show sufficient evidence it could muster the
amount promptly, banking and oil industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brittania-U did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron then agreed to sell the biggest block, OML 53, to
Seplat, which is partly owned by French oil explorer Maurel &amp;
Prom and Swiss-based commodity trader Mercuria, while
OML 52 would go to local firm Amni Petroleum and the smallest,
OML 55, to Belema Oil, run by a local Delta community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$1 BILLION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the companies responded to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nigerian federal high court issued an interim injunction
in December stopping Chevron from selling the blocks to Seplat
and others after Brittania-U brought action against the U.S.
major saying it had already agreed a deal to buy the assets,
court documents showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron could earn between $700 million and $900 million for
the three blocks, two sources involved in bids said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three blocks had proven reserves of 555 million barrels
of oil equivalent, with the biggest block OML 53 holding 310
million of those reserves, two oil industry sources said, citing
a Chevron memorandum given to bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court cases can drag on for years in Nigeria and the longer
the delay the less profit oil majors are likely to make from the
deals and the greater the chances the sales could fall through
altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such litigation also slows down the potential oil and gas
production increases that could be felt from new buyers
exploiting assets left undeveloped by oil majors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips has waited for more than a year to close a
$1.6 billion deal with Nigeria's biggest energy company, Oando
 , for its business in Africa's biggest oil
producer because the local firm has taken more than a year to
raise finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oando plans to raise $193 million in a share issue to help
finance the deal, banking sources said in December, and the
company has said the acquisition will be completed early this
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has also agreed to sell two smaller blocks - OML 83
and 85 - to Nigerian firm First Exploration and Production with
a bid of around $100 million but the deal has not been completed
and rival bidders are also considering disputing this deal, the
two banking sources said. They did not give details of which
companies might challenge the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First E's Chairman Henry Odein Ajumogobia is a former
foreign affairs minister and its Managing Director Ademola
Adeyemi-Bero spent five year working at BG Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron and First E declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell, Total and Eni are selling a combined 45 percent stake
in at least four more oil blocks with combined production of
around 70,000 barrels per day. Bids on these blocks are due next
month, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell, the biggest producer in Nigeria, has sold eight oil
blocks in the Niger Delta for a total $1.8 billion since 2010
and some industry sources believe the Anglo-Dutch major may have
the experience needed to get deals agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not about the highest bid, it's about which buyer has
the know-how and the connections to get the deals done," one
executive at a Nigerian company said.&lt;/p&gt;

			Merck Provides Update on Accelerated Strategic Actions for Growth at 
      32nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Initiates rolling submission of U.S. Biologics License Application 
        (BLA) for MK-3475, the company&#8217;s anti-PD-1 immunotherapy; expects to 
        complete application in first half of 2014.
      
			
        Prepares for 2014 regulatory actions for V503, vintafolide (EU), 
        vorapaxar, NOXAFIL IV, vaniprevir (Japan) and AIT-Grass and 
        AIT-Ragweed; anticipates filing odanacatib, suvorexant.
      
			
        Evaluates the role of Merck&#8217;s Animal Health and Consumer Care 
        businesses in the company&#8217;s strategy for long-term value creation; 
        expects conclusions to be reached and action, if any, to be taken in 
        2014.
      
			
        Divests assets, including a portion of the U.S. ophthalmics business, 
        SAPHRIS U.S. marketing rights and Sirna Therapeutics, Inc.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, 
      today will report on the strategic and operating actions it is taking to 
      drive short- and long-term growth, including sharpening its focus in 
      core markets and therapeutic areas, advancing its innovative pipeline 
      and unlocking the value in non-core areas of its business. In October 
      2013, Merck announced a multi-year initiative to resource opportunities 
      that offer the greatest potential return on investment, improve the 
      company&#8217;s performance in the short term and create long-term value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re taking significant and decisive action to make Merck a more 
      competitive company, better positioned to drive innovation and growth,&#8221; 
      said Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. 
      &#8220;We&#8217;re pleased with the solid progress we have already made against each 
      of our key areas of focus, and we are quickly moving ahead to build on 
      this momentum to make Merck a leaner, more agile company focused on the 
      best opportunities to create value and advance global health.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the initiative announced last 
      October, the company expects to realize a net reduction of annual 
      operating expenses of approximately $2.5 billion by the end of 2015 with 
      40 percent, or $1.0 billion, to be realized by the end of 2014. These 
      savings are off of the company&#8217;s full-year 2012 expense levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company continues to make progress on its innovative pipeline and in 
      2014 expects to complete its regulatory application for MK-3475, 
      the company&#8217;s anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, in patients with advanced 
      melanoma who have previously been treated with ipilimumab; as 
      well as applications for odanacatib for osteoporosis; and suvorexant for 
      insomnia. The company may also receive regulatory approvals for multiple 
      promising candidates, including V503, the company&#8217;s 9-valent HPV vaccine 
      candidate; vintafolide in the European Union for use in 
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer; vorapaxar for the reduction of 
      atherothrombotic events when added to standard of care in patients with 
      a history of heart attack and no history of stroke or transient ischemic 
      attack; NOXAFIL IV for fungal infections; vaniprevir in Japan for the 
      treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; and the allergy 
      immunotherapies AIT-Grass and AIT-Ragweed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Core Markets and Commercial Therapeutic Area 
      Focus
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company has taken steps to significantly sharpen its focus on select 
      core markets and commercial therapeutic areas. Progress since the 
      October announcement includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Increasing focus on the key markets of the United States, Japan, 
        France, Germany, Canada, United Kingdom, China, Brazil, Russia and 
        Korea.
      
			
        Intensifying its portfolio assessment process and recently announcing 
        the divestiture of a portion of the company&#8217;s U.S. ophthalmics 
        business and the sale of the U.S. marketing rights for SAPHRIS.
      
			
        Consistent with Merck&#8217;s new emphasis on its diabetes, acute hospital 
        care, vaccines and oncology businesses, the company established its 
        integrated oncology business unit and is recruiting external talent 
        with deep scientific and commercial experience in oncology to promote 
        Merck&#8217;s existing portfolio of products, as well as the future launch 
        of MK-3475.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Prioritized Pipeline in Focus
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Merck continues to prioritize its RD efforts and focus on candidates 
      that it believes represent breakthrough science that will make a 
      difference for patients and payers, with increased emphasis on 
      externally sourced programs. Progress since the October announcement 
      includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Initiated the rolling submission of a BLA in the U.S. for MK-3475 in 
        patients with advanced melanoma who have previously been treated with 
        ipilimumab. A rolling submission allows completed portions of the 
        application to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing 
        basis. Merck expects to complete its application in the first half of 
        2014.
      
			
        Started additional MK-3475 clinical trials and now has 10 trials in 
        more than 10 cancers, including a collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline 
        to evaluate MK-3475 in combination with pazopanib
				in advanced 
        renal cell carcinoma.
      
			
        Received Breakthrough Therapy designation for MK-5172/MK-8742, the 
        company&#8217;s chronic HCV combination regimen, and advanced the 
        combination into Phase IIB in a diverse range of chronic HCV patients.
      
		
		
			
        Filed vaniprevir (MK-7009), an investigational protease inhibitor for 
        the treatment of chronic HCV infection, in Japan.
      
			
        Initiated Phase III trials for its BACE inhibitor for Alzheimer&#8217;s 
        disease, MK-8931.
      
			
        Received priority review status for NOXAFIL IV.
      
			
        Plans to divest Sirna Therapeutics, Inc. to Alnylam.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Unlocking Value in Non-Core Areas
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company is continuing to evaluate all aspects of how it operates as 
      a business and has adopted a streamlined operating model to ensure 
      improved allocation of resources to the most critical business areas. 
      The company&#8217;s goal is for each of its priority business areas to be 
      industry leaders.&#160;The company assesses on an ongoing basis whether 
      particular assets are core to its strategy, if they provide strategic 
      advantage and whether they would generate greater long-term value as 
      part of the company, or not. Progress since the October announcement 
      includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Exploring strategic options for its Animal Health and Consumer Care 
        businesses to determine the most value-creating option for each and 
        could reach different decisions about the two businesses. The company 
        expects to complete the process and take action, if any, in 2014.
      
			
        Over the last four months of 2013, the company announced plans to 
        close or sell manufacturing operations at Swords, Ireland; La Vall&#233;e, 
        France; Arecibo and Barceloneta, Puerto Rico; and completed the sale 
        of its active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) operations at Oss, the 
        Netherlands; and announced closure of the Summit, N.J. site.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Jan. 13, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Portola Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq:PTLA) today announced that it has entered into a second clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) to study Portola's investigational Factor Xa inhibitor reversal agent, andexanet alfa* (PRT4445), with the oral Factor Xa inhibitor Eliquis&#174; (apixaban). The original agreement, announced in November 2012, covered the conduct of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study. Results of the Phase 2 study were presented at the 2013 Congress of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) and demonstrated andexanet alfa's ability to produce an immediate and either temporary or sustained reversal of the anticoagulation activity of Eliquis. The new clinical collaboration agreement will be in effect through Phase 3 studies with Eliquis and any potential U.S. and EU regulatory approval of andexanet alfa. The Phase 3 studies are expected to start in the first half of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Under this non-exclusive collaboration agreement, Portola will receive an upfront payment and is eligible to receive additional development and regulatory milestone payments. Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer will continue to provide development and regulatory guidance for the program. Portola retains full, worldwide commercial rights to andexanet alfa, which was designated as a breakthrough therapy by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2013 and for which Portola is pursuing an Accelerated Approval pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We are pleased to continue our collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, which has been instrumental in accelerating andexanet alfa's development as a potential agent to reverse the anticoagulation effect of Eliquis," said William Lis, chief executive officer of Portola. "The FDA's recent designation of andexanet alfa as a breakthrough therapy recognizes the medical need for this antidote as well as its attributes, which distinguish it from general procoagulant approaches. Andexanet alfa is the only agent that has been shown to reverse the anticoagulation effect of Factor Xa inhibitors in humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Currently, millions of patients are treated with Factor Xa inhibitors for short-term use or chronic conditions, and the anticoagulant market is expected to continue to grow with the adoption of novel oral anticoagulants. Clinical trial results suggest that, depending on their underlying medical condition, annually between 1 and 4 percent of these patients will experience uncontrolled bleeding, and an additional 1 percent will require emergency surgery.i Currently, there is no antidote or reversal agent approved for use against Factor Xa inhibitors. Leading clinicians have identified, and the FDA has recognized, the lack of an effective reversal agent for Factor Xa inhibitors as a significant unmet medical need.
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Andexanet Alfa*
				
			Andexanet alfa is a first-in-class recombinant, modified Factor Xa molecule being developed as a direct reversal agent (antidote) for patients receiving a Factor Xa inhibitor who suffer an uncontrolled bleeding episode or who require emergency surgery. Andexanet alfa acts as a Factor Xa decoy that targets and sequesters with high specificity both direct and indirect Factor Xa inhibitors in the blood. Once bound, the Factor Xa inhibitors are unable to bind to and inhibit native Factor Xa, thus allowing for the restoration of normal hemostatic processes.ii Through its mechanism of action, andexanet alfa has the potential to act as a universal antidote and address the direct cause of the patient's inhibited clotting activity without being prothrombotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Portola has entered into clinical collaboration agreements with all of the manufacturers of direct Factor Xa inhibitors, while retaining all rights to the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Portola has completed and reported data from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of andexanet alfa and Eliquis. Results showed that andexanet alfa produces immediate, dose-dependent and well-tolerated reversal of anti-Factor Xa activity. The reversal can be either temporary through the administration of an intravenous bolus or sustained by the addition of an extended infusion. This is critical in covering the multiple clinical scenarios in which a reversal agent would be needed, which could include patients suffering major uncontrolled bleeding from trauma or those needing emergency surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Portola has also reported data from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of andexanet alfa and XARELTO&#174; (rivaroxaban).&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Phase 2 studies, which have included more than 80 volunteers, have shown that andexanet alfa is well tolerated, with no thrombotic events, serious adverse events or antibodies to Factor Xa or Factor X observed.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Additional Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies with the direct Factor Xa inhibitors, betrixaban and SavaysaTM (edoxaban), and the indirect Factor Xa inhibitor, enoxaparin, are either planned or ongoing.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
			
	Portola Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in the areas of thrombosis and hematology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Betrixaban
				
			Portola's wholly-owned lead compound, betrixaban, is a novel, oral, once-daily Factor Xa inhibitor in Phase 3 development for extended-duration prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acute medically ill patients. Betrixaban's properties may be uniquely suited to potentially demonstrate efficacy without significantly increasing bleeding in this patient population. Currently, there is no anticoagulant approved for extended-duration VTE prophylaxis in acute medically ill patients. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Andexanet Alfa*
			
	Portola's second lead development candidate, andexanet alfa (PRT4445), has the potential to be a first-in-class universal antidote to directly reverse the effects of Factor Xa inhibitors in patients who suffer an uncontrolled bleeding episode or who require emergency surgery. Portola has entered into clinical collaboration agreements with all of the manufacturers of direct Factor Xa inhibitors, including Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer (Eliquis&#174; &#160;[apixaban]), Bayer HealthCare and Janssen Pharmaceuticals (XARELTO&#174; [rivaroxaban]), and Daiichi Sankyo (SavaysaTM [edoxaban]), while retaining all commercial rights to the program. Andexanet alfa has been designated as a breakthrough therapy by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Cerdulatinib* (PRT2070) and PRT2607
			
	Portola's third wholly-owned product candidate, cerdulatinib (PRT2070), is an orally available kinase inhibitor that uniquely inhibits two validated tumor proliferation pathways -- spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and janus kinase (JAK). It is currently being studied in patients with leukemias or lymphomas with a focus on genetically-defined subtypes, as well as in patients who have failed therapy due to relapse or acquired mutations. Portola's fourth program is partnered with Biogen Idec and is focused on the development of PRT2607, a selective Syk inhibitor. For more information, visit www.portola.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			Visa Launches &#8220;Everywhere You Want to Be,&#8221; a Corporate Platform That 
      Reconnects the Company to Its Heritage
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Integrated Platform Reinforces Visa&#8217;s Commitment to Engage All 
      Audiences in Relevant and Meaningful Ways by Expanding our Vision: &#8220;to 
      be the best way to pay and be paid&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. today launched &#8220;Everywhere you want to be,&#8221; a 
      multi-stakeholder communications platform that reflects our ambition to 
      deliver universal access to Visa&#8217;s secure, reliable and convenient 
      digital payments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For decades, Visa, the global digital payments network, has been driven 
      by a set of ideals anchored in our vision of being the &#8220;best way to pay 
      and be paid.&#8221; This has expanded in recent years to include &#8220;for 
      everyone, everywhere.&#8221; By evolving our famous tagline - &#8220;It&#8217;s everywhere 
      you want to be&#8221; - the company is recommitting to these ideals and vision 
      for consumers, merchants, governments, financial institutions and 
      employees with a unified message tailored to each audience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We recognized that, for the first time in Visa&#8217;s 55-year history 
      &#8216;everywhere&#8217; is now within reach of &#8216;everyone,&#8217;&#8221; said Antonio Lucio, 
      Visa&#8217;s chief brand officer. &#8220;New innovations, like mobile and 
      e-commerce, are extending the value and reach of secure Visa payments to 
      new people and places around the world. At this important inflection 
      point in Visa&#8217;s history, connecting to our heritage and vision was a 
      powerful and irresistible idea.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the 21st century, &#8220;everywhere&#8221; transcends card usage at 
      physical locations. It&#8217;s about realizing potential and achieving dreams. 
      &#8220;Everywhere&#8221; now is relevant for a farmer in Rwanda paying school fees 
      on his mobile phone, a jewelry designer in California selling to a 
      global online customer base or a government official in Brazil 
      rebuilding a village using a Visa prepaid card.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We will express our vision to each of our audiences in ways that are 
      directly meaningful to them,&#8221; Lucio said. &#8220;This platform speaks to our 
      dedication to change how we engage with all our partners, and helps 
      underscore the defining characteristics of our business: convenience, 
      reliability, security and access, that together deliver Visa&#8217;s true 
      value.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Visual Identity, Advertising
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With a new tagline, as well as a refreshed brand logo, Visa is 
      introducing a new visual identity for one of the most recognized and 
      powerful brands in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first external expression of the new platform debuts today with a 
      new Olympic-themed television commercial airing in the United States, 
      and then expanding to reach key audiences through variety of other 
      traditional and digital channels in the coming months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa&#8217;s first new spot under the &#8220;Everywhere you want to be&#8221; 
      tagline is entitled &#8220;Flying,&#8221; and features U.S. Olympic women&#8217;s ski 
      jumping hopeful and Team Visa athlete, Sarah Hendrickson. The new brand 
      platform will be brought to life in Visa&#8217;s Olympic-themed creative, and 
      via social and digital extensions, by spotlighting athletes&#8217; stories of 
      accomplishment to help inspire viewers to imagine their own 
      &#8220;everywhere.&#8221; Visa has been a proud Worldwide Partner of the Olympic 
      Games for more than 27 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The new platform is compelling because it encompasses strengths of 
      Visa, past, present and future,&#8221; continued Lucio. &#8220;&#8216;Everywhere&#8217; includes 
      the tens of millions of merchant locations that accept Visa today. It&#8217;s 
      also the new ways and places people want to pay, including mobile and 
      e-commerce. &#8216;Everywhere&#8217; is also a celebration of everyone&#8217;s 
      aspirations, from an athlete achieving her Olympic dream to a single 
      mother accessing her first bank account on a Visa card.&#8221;

			Chevron Makes Final Investment Decision on Alder Field in the United 
      Kingdom
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) announced today that its U.K. 
      subsidiary, Chevron North Sea Limited, has reached a final investment 
      decision and received approval from the U.K. government to proceed with 
      the development of the Alder Field in the Central North Sea. The project 
      has a planned design capacity of 110 million cubic feet of natural gas 
      and 14,000 barrels of condensate per day. First production is expected 
      in 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Alder Field development is an important milestone in support of our 
      strategic plan to profitably grow production and is among our solid 
      queue of major capital projects that will deliver value to 
      shareholders,&#8221; said Chevron vice chairman George Kirkland.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Alder project builds on Chevron&#8217;s already well-established presence 
      in the U.K. energy development sector,&#8221; said Todd Levy, president of 
      Chevron Europe, Eurasia and Middle East Exploration and Production. &#8220;For 
      more than 50 years Chevron has been active in the U.K.&#8217;s oil and gas 
      industry, and we will continue to play a role in developing the region&#8217;s 
      natural resources.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Discovered in 1975, development has recently been enabled by innovative 
      technologies to manage the high-pressure high-temperature gas condensate 
      field located in Block 15/29a, in a water depth of 492 feet (150 meters) 
      approximately 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the Scottish coastline and 
      37 miles (60 kilometers) from the U.K./Norway median line.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The field will be developed via a single subsea well tied back to the 
      existing Britannia Platform, a distance of 17 miles (28 kilometers).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron North Sea Limited operates the project and has a 73.684 percent 
      interest, with co-venturer ConocoPhillips (U.K.) Limited (26.316 
      percent).
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Announces Government Approval for Alder Field
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron North Sea Limited announced today that it has reached a final 
      investment decision and received approval from the U.K. Government to 
      proceed with the development of the Alder Field in the Central North 
      Sea. The project has a planned design capacity of 110 million cubic feet 
      of natural gas and 14,000 barrels of condensate per day. First 
      production is expected in 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our decision to proceed with this valuable asset was enabled by the 
      right combination of technology, commercial conditions and knowledge 
      sharing on high pressure high temperature experience. Field development 
      is also being assisted by the enhanced Small Field Allowance introduced 
      by the U.K. Government in 2012, which recognizes the importance of 
      developing small fields in a mature oil and gas basin,&#8221; said Craig May, 
      managing director of Chevron Upstream Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The U.K.&#8217;s Minister for Energy, Michael Fallon added: &#8220;This is one of 
      the most complex wells to be drilled in the North Sea. It has required 
      the application of extremely complex technology, the majority of which 
      is being provided by U.K. companies and is a showcase of British 
      excellence. Developments like Alder confirm the basin is still vibrant 
      with many opportunities; however the future needs companies of the 
      calibre of Chevron with the expertise and tenacity to drive these 
      projects forward.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The high pressure high temperature gas condensate field is located in 
      Block 15/29a, in a water depth of 150 meters, approximately 160 
      kilometers from the Scottish coastline, and 60 kilometers from the 
      U.K./Norway median line.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The field will be developed via a single subsea well tied back to the 
      existing Britannia Platform in Block 16/26, a distance of 28 kilometers, 
      and the well will be drilled with the Blackford Dolphin, which is 
      contracted to Chevron from mid-2015 for a multi-well programme.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Produced fluids will be processed at a new dedicated module to be 
      installed on the Britannia Bridge Linked Platform (BLP), which will be 
      constructed by ConocoPhillips acting as substitute operator on behalf of 
      Britannia Operator Limited. Gas is exported to the Scottish Area Gas 
      Evacuation (SAGE) terminal at St Fergus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Discovered in 1975, the Alder project has taken many years to bring to 
      economic development. The development of the field has been enabled by 
      innovative technology applications combining to meet the challenges of a 
      high pressure, high temperature reservoir and exporting fluids a 
      distance of 28 kilometers to the Britannia Platform. These include 
      Chevron&#8217;s first high temperature high pressure vertical mono-bore tree, 
      vacuum insulated tubing, a reeled 10&#8221;/16&#8221; pipe-in-pipe system and a High 
      Integrity Pressure Protection System.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Some 75 percent of the development work will be executed in the U.K. 
      Three major contracts valued at some &#163;200 million were awarded to U.K. 
      vendors during the course of 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Detailed engineering, procurement, installation and commissioning of 
        the complete subsea system, including the main subsea manifold, subsea 
        isolation valve manifold, 28 kilometers of pipe-in-pipe flow line, 
        umbilical and tie-in spools, awarded to Technip. This work will be 
        carried out in Aberdeen, Evanton and Newcastle.
      
			
        Design, manufacture and supply of two high pressure, high temperature 
        (HPHT) vertical, subsea monobore trees and wellheads, awarded to 
        OneSubsea UK Limited at their Leeds facility.
      
			
        Design, manufacture and supply of the subsea control system, including 
        the hydraulic and electrical components to be installed both at subsea 
        and on the Britannia Bridge Linked Platform (BLP), to Aker Solutions 
        at their Aberdeen facility.

      Chevron&#8217;s presence in the UKCS spans 50 years, with the company 
      continuing to contribute significant sums to the U.K. economy in terms 
      of base business expenditures, taxation, jobs and technology 
      development, as well as ongoing investments in new operated and 
      non-operated projects. Through this and its international and global 
      operations, which utilize U.K. design, engineering and manufacturing in 
      its worldwide projects, Chevron&#8217;s contribution to the U.K. economy is of 
      the order of &#163;10 billion in just the last five years.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ACOR) 
      today announced that AMPYRA&#174; (dalfampridine) Extended Release 
      Tablets, 10 mg unaudited net sales for the fourth quarter of 2013 were 
      $84 million, and unaudited AMPYRA 2013 full-year net sales were $302 
      million. These results are preliminary and subject to completion of the 
      Company&#8217;s year-end audit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company provided 2014 guidance for AMPYRA net sales revenue of 
      $328-$335 million. In prior years, AMPYRA sales have been variable 
      between quarters, with the first quarter lower than subsequent quarters. 
      AMPYRA has Orphan Drug Status until January 2017, and a broad patent 
      portfolio that extends exclusivity in the United States until 2027.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company also provided operating expense guidance for 2014. This 
      guidance excludes share-based compensation and costs associated with 
      expenditures related to the potential acquisition of new products or 
      other business development activities. Guidance for research and 
      development (RD) expense is $60-$70 million and sales, general and 
      administrative (SGA) expense is $180-$190 million. RD expense is 
      increasing based on advances in the Company&#8217;s pipeline. In 2014, the 
      Company expects to support at least four clinical trial programs for 
      products in various stages of development. SGA expense in 2014 includes 
      commercialization expenses for Diazepam Nasal Spray.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;More than 85,000 people with multiple sclerosis have tried AMPYRA since 
      launch, and thousands have experienced improvement in their walking. The 
      success of this valuable contribution to the treatment of MS has also 
      supported our investment in developing new neurological therapies. We 
      now have five active clinical programs, including one exploring the use 
      of AMPYRA in a new indication,&#8221; said Ron Cohen, M.D., Acorda&#8217;s President 
      and CEO. &#8220;This year, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial of a once-daily 
      formulation of dalfampridine in post-stroke deficits. We are also 
      preparing for the potential commercial launch of Diazepam Nasal Spray, a 
      treatment for people with epilepsy who experience cluster seizures. Our 
      commercial success, together with a deep pipeline and strong balance 
      sheet, are positioning Acorda for long-term growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company also provided 2014 guidance for Zanaflex&#174; 
      (tizanidine hydrochloride) and ex-U.S. FAMPYRA&#174; (prolonged-release 
      fampridine tablets) revenue of $25 million, which includes net sales of 
      branded Zanaflex products, royalties from ex-U.S. FAMPYRA and authorized 
      generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules sales, and $9.1 million in 
      amortized licensing revenue from the $110 million payment the Company 
      received from Biogen Idec in 2009 for FAMPYRA ex-U.S. development and 
      commercialization rights.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      President and CEO Ron Cohen, M.D. will provide a corporate overview 
      today at the 32nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference at 
      11:00 a.m. Pacific Time in San Francisco. The presentation is available 
      via webcast at www.acorda.com.

      This press release includes certain forward-looking financial measures 
      that were not prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
      generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Non-GAAP financial 
      measures are not an alternative for financial measures prepared in 
      accordance with GAAP. However, the Company believes the presentation of 
      these non-GAAP financial measures when viewed in conjunction with our 
      GAAP results, provide investors with a more meaningful understanding of 
      our ongoing and projected operating performance because they exclude 
      non-cash charges that are substantially dependent on changes in the 
      market price of our common stock. The Company believes these non-GAAP 
      financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the company's 
      business and are important in understanding projected operating 
      performance. Also, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to 
      establish budgets and operational goals, and to manage the company's 
      business and to evaluate its performance.

			AMPYRA Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Do not take AMPYRA if you have ever had a seizure, or have certain types 
      of kidney problems, or are allergic to dalfampridine (4-aminopyridine), 
      the active ingredient in AMPYRA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Take AMPYRA exactly as prescribed by your doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      You could have a seizure even if you never had a seizure before. Your 
      chance of having a seizure is higher if you take too much AMPYRA or if 
      your kidneys have a mild decrease of function, which is common after age 
      50.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Your doctor may do a blood test to check how well your kidneys are 
      working, if that is not known before you start taking AMPYRA.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) posted a 7.3 percent decline in quarterly profit on Tuesday, as legal woes and weak demand for investment banking services capped off a tough year for Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank had $1.1 billion of legal expenses in the fourth quarter, about $850 million of which was linked to a recent settlement for failing to report its suspicions of fraud at its client Bernard Madoff's fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank agreed to some $20 billion of legal settlements in 2013 - almost equal to a typical year's profit - which covered everything from mortgages it packaged into bonds before the financial crisis, to bad derivatives trades it made in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said some investigations into JPMorgan are just beginning, implying that legal issues are likely to dog the bank for some time, even if on a smaller scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal headaches aside, the bank faces headwinds in businesses ranging from debt underwriting to advising companies on mergers. Rising bond yields are cutting into demand for issuing debt, and new rules designed to make the financial system safer are also cutting into trading volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking fee revenue dropped 3 percent to $1.67 billion, and stock and bond trading revenue combined was unchanged before accounting adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan were up 0.3 percent at $57.86 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLUGFEST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from JPMorgan, the first of the major investment banks to report for the quarter, show the difficulties that rivals like Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to be a slugfest in 2014 to grow earnings," said Chris Mutascio, a bank analyst at KBW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, JPMorgan is hopeful about the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the bank added staff in investment banking and it won market share in most major businesses, including advising companies on mergers and underwriting stock offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But overall revenue in most Wall Street businesses is falling or barely growing. Merger volume, for example, fell 6 percent last year to the lowest level since 2009, Thomson Reuters data shows. Bond underwriting activity fell 2 percent to its lowest since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan posted net income of $5.28 billion, or $1.30 per share, for the quarter, compared with $5.69 billion, or $1.39 a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, the company earned $1.40 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.35, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The special items included a benefit of 21 cents per share from the sale of Visa shares and 8 cents from the sale of its building at One Chase Manhattan Plaza. It posted an expense of 27 cents from legal bills, including the Madoff settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months ago, JPMorgan posted its first quarterly loss under Dimon after recording after-tax expenses of $7.2 billion to settle government and private investigations. ID:L1N0I10HI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have been looking for reassurance from the company that the worst of its legal expenses is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIGHT SPOTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were bright spots in the quarter; for example, equity underwriting revenue soared 65 percent to $436 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But investment banking fees were pulled down by lower debt underwriting, where revenue declined 19 percent, and merger advisory fees, which fell 7 percent. Altogether, investment banking fees declined 3 percent to $1.67 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's market share in equity underwriting rose to 8.3 percent in 2013, moving it to second place in the industry from fourth. Goldman Sachs led with 11.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising mortgage rates hurt the bank's mortgage lending results, as fewer borrowers refinanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acknowledged that it was too slow to cut expenses in this business, and it lost $274 million, before taxes, from mortgage lending, compared with a year-earlier profit of $789 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co, (WFC.N) the fourth-largest U.S. bank, on Tuesday posted its lowest quarterly mortgage lending volume since the fourth quarter of 2008. But the bank posted an overall profit jump because it cut costs and dipped into money it had set aside to cover loan losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At JPMorgan, expenses excluding interest costs fell 3 percent to $15.55 billion during the quarter, while provisions for bad loans fell 84 percent to $104 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said its assets shrank to $2.42 trillion at the end of December from $2.46 trillion in the preceding quarter. It had $2.36 trillion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loans, excluding money set aside for bad loans, grew about 1.6 percent from the third quarter and 1.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(In this story a typo has been fixed in the third paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York and Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore; Additional reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Luke Swiderski in New York; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Lisa Von Ahn and Bernadette Baum)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - In 2010, senior executives at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) came to realize that interest rates, already at zero for more than a year, ultimately had only way to go: up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started retooling the bank's assets and operations to get ready for the day when rates started rising, people close to the bank said on Tuesday. Executives looked at the bank from top to bottom, and took steps ranging from adjusting its investment portfolio to finding ways to hang on to deposits when higher rates give customers an incentive to move money elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators encouraged them, but it was a massive undertaking entailing huge - and sometimes costly - shifts around the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then JPMorgan waited. And waited, and waited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It costs us a significant amount of current income to be positioned this way," JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon wrote in a letter to shareholders in April. "But we believe it is better to be safe than to be sorry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, in a little-noticed slide in a presentation to investors, JPMorgan said its efforts to position its investment portfolio for higher rates could begin to pay off as soon as the middle of this year, potentially adding hundreds of millions to its interest income in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing could not be better for JPMorgan. As the largest U.S. bank's legal problems start to recede after a year with $20 billion of settlements, investors are increasingly turning their focus to the performance of its main banking business, looking for how it would do in a rising rate environment and tepid U.S. economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yields on longer-term bonds started rising last year, as the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it was starting to cut back on its massive monetary stimulus program, called quantitative easing. But economic growth has not been strong enough to translate into stronger loan demand and higher revenue for banks. JPMorgan saw fourth-quarter profits fall 7.3 percent, in part due to its legal woes and weak demand for investment banking services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is hardly the only bank to be getting ready for rising rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and other regulators warned banks to prepare for the risk of rising interest rates, which can immediately hurt the value of bonds that suddenly pay below-market yields. Higher rates can also increase banks' funding costs, a key expense for lenders and traders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays, said all 25 banks he covers have said that they would benefit from rising rates, up from an average of 66 percent of those banks over the last 38 quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call on Tuesday, Wells Fargo &amp; Co's (WFC.N) Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said the bank was ready for rising rates, adding that the most likely scenario is longer-term bond yields rising in the near future, and shorter-term rates rising in the next year or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PREPPING THE PORTFOLIO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, JPMorgan started focusing its investment portfolio, where the bank invests funds that it could not otherwise economically lend out, on shorter-term securities instead of longer-term bonds. Shorter-term notes offer less income, but they also mature sooner, allowing the bank to re-invest money at higher rates once bond yields start rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yields did not start to rise until the summer of 2013, costing the bank hundreds of millions of dollars of income that it could have earned from higher-yielding securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With recent increases in longer-term yields, JPMorgan said by the middle of this year it will have invested enough at the new higher yields to be making money from interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When shorter-term rates also rise, the benefits to JPMorgan could ultimately prove to be substantial. In the third quarter, JPMorgan said that a 2 percentage point increase in short- and long-term rates would ultimately lift its pretax income by $4.09 billion a year. (The bank posted $25.9 billion in pre-tax profit in 2013.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of those gains would come from rising short-term rates, a change that is not expected until 2015. With rising short-term rates, banks can take deposits and invest them for a month or so with little risk, and earn more income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has estimated that higher short-term rates would deliver about two-thirds of the additional interest income it would expect from a 3 percentage point rise in both short and long rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAKING DEPOSITS STICK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People close to the bank say JPMorgan has also been preparing for a rise in rates across its myriad businesses, and not just its investment portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its retail banking unit, for example, deposits in the fourth-quarter were 10 percent higher than a year earlier, and amounted to about a fifth of total liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources said JPMorgan views deposits with caution, and recognizes that once rates rise even loyal customers will be quicker to shift any extra cash from checking accounts to higher yielding instruments such as money-market accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is hoping it can stem some of the expected deposit erosion by having superior customer service, so that some customers never consider taking money out of their accounts, or consider keeping more at JPMorgan than they would otherwise, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is focusing on customers who value the convenience of its mobile account access and branches that will likely help the bank retain balances, says Stephen Beck, founder and managing director of consulting firm cg42, which tracks customer loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beck said he found that JPMorgan's customers were significantly less likely last year to become frustrated and close their Chase accounts than they were two years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York Editing by Dan Wilchins and Kenneth Maxwell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has barred a U.S. journalist critical of President Vladimir Putin from the country for five years, in a move that could upset relations with the United States and has echoes of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moscow's treatment of David Satter could fuel concern about freedom of speech before the Winter Olympics in Sochi next month, although Putin has tried to appease critics by freeing former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and members of the Pussy Riot protest group in the run-up to the Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was expelled from the country," Satter wrote on his personal website. "This is an ominous precedent for all journalists and for freedom of speech in Russia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Satter, author of three books on Russia and the Soviet Union, had been prevented from returning to Russia last month after grossly violating visa regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a website entry, he dismissed the official version of events, saying he had followed all instructions, and he blamed the foreign ministry, which handles foreign journalists' media accreditation, for causing delays that led to his expulsion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, the State Department said it was disappointed that Russia had denied Satter a visa and had raised the issue with the authorities in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has raised our concerns on this case and the treatment of journalists and media organizations in general with Russian authorities," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told a daily briefing. "We'll continue to monitor the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satter said that he had flown to Kiev to receive a new letter of invitation but instead received only a statement read to him by a Russian diplomat there declaring him persona non grata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The competent organs have decided that your presence on the territory of the Russian Federation is undesirable. Your application for entry into Russia is denied," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such expulsions have been rare since the end of the Cold War and collapse of the communist Soviet Union in 1991. But the ministry dismissed suggestions by Western media that the move against Satter was politically motivated as "tendentious".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former Moscow correspondent for the Financial Times, Satter was back in the Russian capital last year and advising Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a broadcaster funded by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOOK ON BOMBINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of his books, "Darkness at Dawn", Satter accused the Federal Security Service (FSB), a successor of the Soviet-era KGB, of being responsible for bombings of Russian apartment buildings in 1999 which killed more than 300 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSB, which was headed by Putin before he became prime minister and then president, has denied the charge. Russian authorities blamed the attacks on separatists from Chechnya in the volatile North Caucasus. The crimes were never solved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Ministry in a statement said Satter had failed to report to the federal migration service as required when he last arrived in Russia on November 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In fact, from November 22 to November 26 this U.S. citizen stayed on Russian territory illegally," the ministry said, and a Moscow court had ruled on November 29 that he should be expelled. A court spokeswoman confirmed the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satter said the ministry had delayed giving him an invitation, causing him to go to court and pay a fine before flying to Kiev to start the visa process again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry said Satter had left Russia on December 4 and was refused a visa when he wanted to return. He was just one of about 500,000 foreigners barred from Russia for periods of three to 10 years for breaking the law, the ministry added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty said the U.S. embassy in Moscow had sought an explanation from the Russian authorities, without success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relations between Moscow and Washington improved during U.S. President Barack Obama's first-term push to "reset" ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they have deteriorated again amid disputes on Iran, Syria, human rights and Russia's decision to give temporary asylum to American fugitive spy contractor Edward Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia expelled a U.S. diplomat in Moscow last year, accusing him of working as a spy and trying to recruit a Russian agent for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public announcements of such expulsions have become rare since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satter is currently in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Thomas Grove and Vladimir Soldatkin, and Lesley Wroughton in Washington; editing by Andrew Roche and Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

			Forward-Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This press release includes forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and 
      Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All 
      statements regarding the Company&#8217;s expected future financial position, 
      results of operations, cash flows, financing plans, business strategy, 
      budgets, capital expenditures, competitive positions, growth 
      opportunities, plans and objectives of management and statements 
      containing the words such as &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;approximate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; 
      &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; 
      &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;may&#8221; and other similar expressions, are forward-looking 
      statements. Statements in this press release concerning the Company&#8217;s 
      business outlook or future economic performance, anticipated 
      profitability, revenues, expenses or other financial items, and product 
      or services line growth, together with other statements that are not 
      historical facts, are forward-looking statements that are estimates 
      reflecting the best judgment of the Company based upon currently 
      available information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and 
      stockholders and other potential investors must recognize that actual 
      results may differ materially from the Company&#8217;s expectations as a 
      result of a variety of factors, including, without limitation, those 
      discussed below. Such forward-looking statements are based upon 
      management&#8217;s current expectations and include known and unknown risks, 
      uncertainties and other factors, many of which the Company is unable to 
      predict or control, that may cause the Company&#8217;s actual results or 
      performance to differ materially from any future results or performance 
      expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These 
      statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed 
      below and detailed from time to time in the Company&#8217;s filings with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the factors set forth above, other factors that may 
      affect the Company&#8217;s plans, results or stock price include, without 
      limitation, (a) the impact of healthcare reform, which will initiate 
      significant changes to the United States healthcare system, including 
      potential material changes to the delivery of healthcare services and 
      the reimbursement paid for such services by the government or other 
      third party payors, including reforms resulting from the Patient 
      Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare Education and 
      Reconciliation Act (collectively, the &#8220;ACA&#8221;) or future deficit reduction 
      measures adopted at the federal or state level. Healthcare reform is 
      affecting each of the Company&#8217;s businesses in some manner. Potential 
      future efforts in the U.S. Congress to repeal, amend, modify or retract 
      funding for various aspects of the ACA create additional uncertainty 
      about the ultimate impact of the ACA on the Company and the healthcare 
      industry. Due to the substantial regulatory changes that will need to be 
      implemented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) 
      and others, and the numerous processes required to implement these 
      reforms, the Company cannot predict which healthcare initiatives will be 
      implemented at the federal or state level, the timing of any such 
      reforms, or the effect such reforms or any other future legislation or 
      regulation will have on the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, 
      results of operations and liquidity, (b) the impact of final rules 
      issued by CMS on August 1, 2012 which, among other things, will reduce 
      Medicare reimbursement to the Company&#8217;s Transitional Care (&#8220;TC&#8221;) 
      hospitals in 2013 and beyond by imposing a budget neutrality adjustment 
      and modifying the short-stay outlier rules, (c) the impact of final 
      rules issued by CMS on July 29, 2011 which significantly reduced 
      Medicare reimbursement to the Company&#8217;s nursing centers and changed 
      payments for the provision of group therapy services effective October 
      1, 2011, (d) the impact of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (as amended by 
      the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the &#8220;Taxpayer Relief Act&#8221;)) 
      which will automatically reduce federal spending by approximately $1.2 
      trillion split evenly between domestic and defense spending. An 
      automatic 2% reduction on each claim submitted to Medicare began on 
      April 1, 2013, (e) the impact of the Taxpayer Relief Act which, among 
      other things, reduces Medicare payments by 50% for subsequent procedures 
      when multiple therapy services are provided on the same day. At this 
      time, the Company believes that the rules related to multiple therapy 
      services will reduce the Company&#8217;s Medicare revenues by $25 million to 
      $30 million on an annual basis, (f) changes in the reimbursement rates 
      or the methods or timing of payment from third party payors, including 
      commercial payors and the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes 
      arising from and related to the Medicare prospective payment system for 
      LTAC hospitals, including potential changes in the Medicare payment 
      rules, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization 
      Act of 2003, and changes in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for the 
      Company&#8217;s TC hospitals, nursing centers, inpatient rehabilitation 
      hospitals and home health and hospice operations, and the expiration of 
      the Medicare Part B therapy cap exception process, (g) the effects of 
      additional legislative changes and government regulations, 
      interpretation of regulations and changes in the nature and enforcement 
      of regulations governing the healthcare industry, (h) the ability of the 
      Company&#8217;s hospitals to adjust to potential LTAC certification and 
      medical necessity reviews, (i) the costs of defending and insuring 
      against alleged professional liability and other claims (including those 
      related to pending whistleblower and wage and hour class action lawsuits 
      against the Company) and the Company&#8217;s ability to predict the estimated 
      costs and reserves related to such claims, including the impact of 
      differences in actuarial assumptions and estimates compared to eventual 
      Kindred Healthcare to Comment on Recent LTAC Legislation During J.P. 
      Morgan Healthcare Conference outcomes, (j) the impact of the Company&#8217;s 
      significant level of indebtedness on the Company&#8217;s funding costs, 
      operating flexibility and ability to fund ongoing operations, 
      development capital expenditures or other strategic acquisitions with 
      additional borrowings, (k) the Company&#8217;s ability to successfully 
      redeploy its capital and proceeds of asset sales in pursuit of its 
      business strategy and pursue its development activities, including 
      through acquisitions, and successfully integrate new operations, 
      including the realization of anticipated revenues, economies of scale, 
      cost savings and productivity gains associated with such operations, as 
      and when planned, including the potential impact of unanticipated 
      issues, expenses and liabilities associated with those activities, (l) 
      the Company&#8217;s ability to pay a dividend as, when and if declared by the 
      Board of Directors, in compliance with applicable laws and the Company&#8217;s 
      debt and other contractual arrangements, (m) the failure of the 
      Company&#8217;s facilities to meet applicable licensure and certification 
      requirements, (n) the further consolidation and cost containment efforts 
      of managed care organizations and other third party payors, (o) the 
      Company&#8217;s ability to meet its rental and debt service obligations, (p) 
      the Company&#8217;s ability to operate pursuant to the terms of its debt 
      obligations, and comply with its covenants thereunder, and its ability 
      to operate pursuant to its master lease agreements with Ventas, Inc. 
      (&#8220;Ventas&#8221;) (NYSE:VTR), (q) the condition of the financial markets, 
      including volatility and weakness in the equity, capital and credit 
      markets, which could limit the availability and terms of debt and equity 
      financing sources to fund the requirements of the Company&#8217;s businesses, 
      or which could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio, (r) 
      the Company&#8217;s ability to control costs, particularly labor and employee 
      benefit costs, (s) the Company&#8217;s ability to successfully reduce or 
      mitigate (by divestiture of operations or otherwise) its exposure to 
      professional liability and other claims, (t) the Company&#8217;s obligations 
      under various laws to self-report suspected violations of law by the 
      Company to various government agencies, including any associated 
      obligation to refund overpayments to government payors, fines and other 
      sanctions, (u) the potential for diversion of management time and 
      resources in seeking to transfer the operations of 60 non-strategic 
      nursing centers currently leased from Ventas, (v) national and regional 
      economic, financial, business and political conditions, including their 
      effect on the availability and cost of labor, credit, materials and 
      other services, (w) increased operating costs due to shortages in 
      qualified nurses, therapists and other healthcare personnel, (x) the 
      Company&#8217;s ability to attract and retain key executives and other 
      healthcare personnel, (y) the Company&#8217;s ability to successfully dispose 
      of unprofitable facilities, (z) events or circumstances which could 
      result in the impairment of an asset or other charges, such as the 
      impact of the Medicare reimbursement regulations that resulted in the 
      Company recording significant impairment charges in 2012 and 2011, (aa) 
      changes in generally accepted accounting principles or practices, and 
      changes in tax accounting or tax laws (or authoritative interpretations 
      relating to any of these matters), and (bb) the Company&#8217;s ability to 
      maintain an effective system of internal control over financial 
      reporting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Many of these factors are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. The Company 
      cautions investors that any forward-looking statements made by the 
      Company are not guarantees of future performance. The Company disclaims 
      any obligation to update any such factors or to announce publicly the 
      results of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to 
      reflect future events or developments.

&lt;p&gt;* Russia says journalist violated visa regulations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Satter says ministry statement is false&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Move echoes Cold War, precedes Winter Olympics   (Adds U.S. comment in paragraphs 6 and 7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Timothy Heritage and Gabriela Baczynska&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Russia has barred a U.S. journalist critical of President Vladimir Putin from the country for five years, in a move that could upset relations with the United States and has echoes of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow's treatment of David Satter could fuel concern about freedom of speech before the Winter Olympics in Sochi next month, although Putin has tried to appease critics by freeing former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and members of the Pussy Riot protest group in the run-up to the Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was expelled from the country," Satter wrote on his personal website. "This is an ominous precedent for all journalists and for freedom of speech in Russia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Satter, author of three books on Russia and the Soviet Union, had been prevented from returning to Russia last month after grossly violating visa regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a website entry, he dismissed the official version of events, saying he had followed all instructions, and he blamed the foreign ministry, which handles foreign journalists' media accreditation, for causing delays that led to his expulsion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, the State Department said it was disappointed that Russia had denied Satter a visa and had raised the issue with the authorities in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has raised our concerns on this case and the treatment of journalists and media organizations in general with Russian authorities," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told a daily briefing. "We'll continue to monitor the case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satter said that he had flown to Kiev to receive a new letter of invitation but instead received only a statement read to him by a Russian diplomat there declaring him persona non grata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The competent organs have decided that your presence on the territory of the Russian Federation is undesirable. Your application for entry into Russia is denied," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such expulsions have been rare since the end of the Cold War and collapse of the communist Soviet Union in 1991. But the ministry dismissed suggestions by Western media that the move against Satter was politically motivated as "tendentious".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former Moscow correspondent for the Financial Times, Satter was back in the Russian capital last year and advising   Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a broadcaster funded by the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOOK ON BOMBINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of his books, "Darkness at Dawn", Satter accused the Federal Security Service (FSB), a successor of the Soviet-era KGB, of being responsible for bombings of Russian apartment buildings in 1999 which killed more than 300 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSB, which was headed by Putin before he became prime minister and then president, has denied the charge. Russian authorities blamed the attacks on separatists from Chechnya in the volatile North Caucasus. The crimes were never solved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Ministry in a statement said Satter had failed to report to the federal migration service as required when he last arrived in Russia on Nov. 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In fact, from Nov. 22 to Nov. 26 this U.S. citizen stayed on Russian territory illegally," the ministry said, and a Moscow court had ruled on Nov. 29 that he should be expelled. A court spokeswoman confirmed the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satter said the ministry had delayed giving him an invitation, causing him to go to court and pay a fine before flying to Kiev to start the visa process again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry said Satter had left Russia on Dec. 4 and was refused a visa when he wanted to return. He was just one of about 500,000 foreigners barred from Russia for periods of three to 10 years for breaking the law, the ministry added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty said the U.S. embassy in Moscow had sought an explanation from the Russian authorities, without success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relations between Moscow and Washington improved during U.S. President Barack Obama's first-term push to "reset" ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they have deteriorated again amid disputes on Iran, Syria, human rights and Russia's decision to give temporary asylum to American fugitive spy contractor Edward Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia expelled a U.S. diplomat in Moscow last year, accusing him of working as a spy and trying to recruit a Russian agent for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public announcements of such expulsions have become rare since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satter is currently in London.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co posted a 7.3 percent decline in quarterly profit on Tuesday, as legal woes and weak demand for investment banking services capped off a tough year for Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank had $1.1 billion of legal expenses in the fourth quarter, about $850 million of which was linked to a recent settlement for failing to report its suspicions of fraud at its client Bernard Madoff's fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank agreed to some $20 billion of legal settlements in 2013 - almost equal to a typical year's profit - which covered everything from mortgages it packaged into bonds before the financial crisis, to bad derivatives trades it made in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said some investigations into JPMorgan are just beginning, implying that legal issues are likely to dog the bank for some time, even if on a smaller scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal headaches aside, the bank faces headwinds in businesses ranging from debt underwriting to advising companies on mergers. Rising bond yields are cutting into demand for issuing debt, and new rules designed to make the financial system safer are also cutting into trading volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking fee revenue dropped 3 percent to $1.67 billion, and stock and bond trading revenue combined was unchanged before accounting adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of JPMorgan were up 0.3 percent at $57.86 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLUGFEST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from JPMorgan, the first of the major investment banks to report for the quarter, show the difficulties that rivals like Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley are facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to be a slugfest in 2014 to grow earnings," said Chris Mutascio, a bank analyst at KBW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, JPMorgan is hopeful about the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the bank added staff in investment banking and it won market share in most major businesses, including advising companies on mergers and underwriting stock offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But overall revenue in most Wall Street businesses is falling or barely growing.

Altogether, investment banking fees declined 3 percent to $1.67 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's market share in equity underwriting rose to 8.3 percent in 2013, moving it to second place in the industry from fourth. Goldman Sachs led with 11.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising mortgage rates hurt the bank's mortgage lending results, as fewer borrowers refinanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acknowledged that it was too slow to cut expenses in this business, and it lost $274 million, before taxes, from mortgage lending, compared with a year-earlier profit of $789 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, on Tuesday posted its lowest quarterly mortgage lending volume since the fourth quarter of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry and Tanya Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co posted a 7.3
percent decline in quarterly profit on Tuesday, as legal woes
and weak demand for investment banking services capped off a
tough year for Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank had $1.1 billion of legal expenses in
the fourth quarter, about $850 million of which was linked to a
recent settlement for failing to report its suspicions of fraud
at its client Bernard Madoff's fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank agreed to some $20 billion of legal settlements in
2013 - almost equal to a typical year's profit - which covered
everything from mortgages it packaged into bonds before the
financial crisis, to bad derivatives trades it made in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said some investigations into JPMorgan are just
beginning, implying that legal issues are likely to dog the bank
for some time, even if on a smaller scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal headaches aside, the bank faces headwinds in
businesses ranging from debt underwriting to advising companies
on mergers. Rising bond yields are cutting into demand for

      Fitch: JPMorgan Chase Results Largely As Expected; Credit Trends Remain 
      Positive
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co.'s (JPM) net income of $5.3 billion for the fourth 
      quarter of 2013 (4Q'13), reflected a continuation of strong credit 
      trends and asset management performance, stable investment banking and 
      commercial banking results, weak mortgage production, and a variety of 
      significant items (including a new funding valuation adjustment [FVA]), 
      which netted to approximately $407 million of after-tax losses. Returns 
      on tangible common equity were 14% for the quarter compared to 15% a 
      year earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As previously announced, quarterly results included additional 
      litigation expenses, due largely to announced Madoff settlements. These 
      charges, in addition to negative DVA and FVA adjustments, were largely 
      offset with gains on the sale of Visa shares, a real estate gain, and 
      reserve releases in real estate and card services. Legal costs are 
      likely to remain elevated in coming quarters, but Fitch expects the 
      incremental impact to earnings will be manageable. Still, the emergence 
      of material and unexpected litigation losses could alter the agency's 
      view, particularly given where the firm's current capitalization ratios 
      compare to the broader peer group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Results for the Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) were relatively flat 
      year over year after adjusting for a $1.5 billion loss from implementing 
      a FVA framework for OTC derivatives and structured notes. DVA losses of 
      $536 million in the quarter were similar to a $567 million adjustment in 
      4Q'12. Investment banking fees experienced a mix shift, with declines in 
      debt underwriting being offset by strength in equities. The CIB average 
      VaR remained relatively low, at $42 million for the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income in the Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment, was up 
      from 4Q'12, as declines in provision expenses and non-interest costs 
      offset a drop in revenue, due largely to declines in mortgage. 
      Origination volume was down 54.5% year over year and 42.5% from the 
      prior quarter, which appears to be in-line with other large market 
      participants. Production income would have been marginally positive 
      without $404 million of non-MBS related legal expenses in the quarter, 
      but income is expected to be negative in 1Q'14 given the challenging 
      market conditions. The servicing business turned a modest profit and 
      expenses were close to the $600 million target, adjusting for an 
      addition to compensatory fee expense reserves. Credit trends in the real 
      estate portfolio remained on a positive trajectory, leading to $950 
      million of reserve reductions, including a $750 million reduction 
      related to purchased credit-impaired loans. Fitch expects additional 
      reserve releases in real estate in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The credit card business remains strong, with record sales volume and 
      what appears to be a bottoming of loan balances. Net charge-off and 
      delinquency rates improved modestly and supported a $300 million reserve 
      release. Fitch believes credit metrics are nearing a trough and expects 
      minimal reserve releases, if any, in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commercial Banking (CB) remains a very steady performer within JPM, and 
      had net income of $693 million in the quarter. Loan growth was solid in 
      the segment with end of period balance up 7% year-on-year and corporate 
      deposits were up about 3%. Credit quality remained very strong, with net 
      charge-offs of 0.07%. Asset Management (AM) generated strong results 
      with net income of $568 million. This reflects solid net inflows of $23 
      billion. Assets under management (AUM) reached $1.6 trillion during the 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bank's core net interest margin, which excludes the impact of CIB's 
      market-based activities, was up 4 basis points sequentially, to 2.64% 
      due to higher investment securities yields. JPM is forecasting 
      relatively stable NIM over the near term as stronger security yields are 
      offset by continued loan spread compression.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bank's liquidity profile remains sound, with $522 billion of high 
      quality liquid assets. Additional clarity regarding the direction of the 
      net stable funding ratio (NSFR) has been released in a consultative 
      document, and JPM believes the firm is currently compliant with 
      requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPM's Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio reached 9.5% at year-end; in-line 
      with the bank's target. Management expects this ratio to reach 10% by 
      year-end 2014, with a longer-term target in a 10%-10.5% range. The 
      supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) was 4.7% at year-end for the firm and 
      the bank. JPM expects this ratio to reach 5% at the firm level by 
      year-end 2014, with a 5.5% target longer-term. Fitch regards JPM's 
      capital levels to be consistent with its current ratings and would 
      expect the bank to achieve full compliance with all regulatory 
      requirements, well ahead of required implementation.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, January 14 (Fitch) JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s (JPM) net
income of $5.3 
billion for the fourth quarter of 2013 (4Q'13), reflected a

banking fees experienced a mix shift, with declines in debt
underwriting being 
offset by strength in equities. The CIB average VaR remained
relatively low, at 
$42 million for the quarter. 
Net income in the Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment,
was up from 
4Q'12, as declines in provision expenses and non-interest costs
offset a drop in 
revenue, due largely to declines in mortgage. Origination volume
was down 54.5% 
year over year and 42.5% from the prior quarter, which appears
to be in-line 
with other large market participants. Production income would
have been 
marginally positive without $404 million of non-MBS related
legal expenses in 
the quarter, but income is expected to be negative in 1Q'14
given the 
challenging market conditions. The servicing business turned a
modest profit and 
expenses were close to the $600 million target, adjusting for an
addition to 
compensatory fee expense reserves. Credit trends in the real
estate portfolio 
remained on a positive trajectory, leading to $950 million of
reserve 
reductions, including a $750 million reduction related to
purchased 
credit-impaired loans. Fitch expects additional reserve releases
in real estate 
in 2014.     
The credit card business remains strong, with record sales
volume and what 
appears to be a bottoming of loan balances. Net charge-off and
delinquency rates 
improved modestly and supported a $300 million reserve release.
Fitch believes 
credit metrics are nearing a trough and expects minimal reserve
releases, if 
any, in 2014. 
Commercial Banking (CB) remains a very steady performer within
JPM, and had net 
income of $693 million in the quarter. Loan growth was solid in
the segment with 
end of period balance up 7% year-on-year and corporate deposits
were up about 
3%. Credit quality remained very strong, with net charge-offs of
0.07%. Asset 
Management (AM) generated strong results with net income of $568
million. This 
reflects solid net inflows of $23 billion. Assets under
management (AUM) reached 
$1.6 trillion during the quarter.  
The bank's core net interest margin, which excludes the impact
of CIB's 
market-based activities, was up 4 basis points sequentially, to
2.64% due to 
higher investment securities yields. JPM is forecasting
relatively stable NIM 
over the near term as stronger security yields are offset by
continued loan 
spread compression.
The bank's liquidity profile remains sound, with $522 billion of
high quality 
liquid assets. Additional clarity regarding the direction of the
net stable 
funding ratio (NSFR) has been released in a consultative
document, and JPM 
believes the firm is currently compliant with requirements.     
JPM's Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio reached 9.5% at year-end;
in-line with the 
bank's target. Management expects this ratio to reach 10% by
year-end 2014, with 
a longer-term target in a 10%-10.5% range. The supplementary
leverage ratio 
(SLR) was 4.7% at year-end for the firm and the bank. JPM
expects this ratio to 
reach 5% at the firm level by year-end 2014, with a 5.5% target
longer-term. 
Fitch regards JPM's capital levels to be consistent with its
current ratings and 
would expect the bank to achieve full compliance with all
regulatory 
requirements, well ahead of required implementation.

      The presentation was made by Kirsten Drejer, CEO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pipeline update
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Symphogen has continued to expand its oncology pipeline to include 
      projects that simultaneously address targets on cancer cells along with 
      targets in the tumor microenvironment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sym004
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Symphogen&#8217;s lead oncology product, Sym004, which was out-licensed to 
      Merck KGaA in 2012, continues to produce new data. At ASCO in June 2013, 
      study results in patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) and 
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck Cancer (SCCHN) were 
      presented. The program is advancing towards investigational new drug 
      applications across a variety of indications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pan-HER
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Symphogen is accelerating its development plans for pan-HER and expects 
      to file an IND in 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Corporate update
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Symphogen&#8217;s Board was further strengthened in December 2013 by the 
      appointment of Annika Espander Jansson as a non-executive Director of 
      the Company. Annika brings strong financial acumen from her experience 
      both as a sell-side analyst in the healthcare sector and as an investor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Symphogen remains strongly financed. During 2013, the Company completed 
      a &#8364;141 equity financing from top-tier investors and has a current cash 
      position of &#8364;100 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first half of 2014, Symphogen will relocate to a new domicile 
      in Denmark where manufacturing facilities will enable the Company to 
      produce antibodies for early clinical development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 14 (IFR) - JP Morgan has recorded a US$1.5bn
loss as a result of implementing a framework for funding
valuation adjustments (FVA) in its derivatives and structured
notes portfolios, in a further sign of the growing prominence of
the controversial measure among the dealer community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks have been working behind the scenes for several years
on developing their own frameworks for calculating FVA - a
measure used to account for the cost of bank funding in
uncollateralised derivatives positions - in order to accurately
price and value transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marianne Lake, JP Morgan's CFO, noted on a call with
analysts today that there has been no broad consensus so far on
whether funding should be incorporated into valuation estimates
for derivatives. However, she said the firm believes market
practices have noticeably evolved over the course of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've now accumulated compelling evidence both from
transactions as well as industry pricing services that dealers
are pricing funding into uncollateralised derivatives with a
degree of consistency. This supports incorporating an FVA
framework this quarter," said Lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank indicated the sizeable quarterly loss would be a
one-off event as it incorporated the FVA framework into the
valuation of its portfolios. From now on, FVA will be factored
into derivatives valuations at the inception of a trade. This
should significantly reduce JP Morgan's sensitivity to funding
spreads going forward, Lake said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRESENT VALUING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan described FVA as a spread over Libor, which had
the effect of "present valuing" - in other words, marking to
market - a contract's funding costs rather than accruing these
costs over the lifetime of the derivative. FVA is only applied
to uncollateralised transactions; collateralised derivatives
effectively fund themselves using the collateral backing the
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FVA will vary depending on the size and tenor of the
transaction, as well as the bank's own cost of funding. By way
of example, Lake said if a bank held derivatives receivables net
of cash and securities collateral of approximately US$50
billion, applying an average duration of approximately five
years and a spread of approximately 50 basis points, that would
account for about a billion dollars plus or minus the
adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of adopting the new framework, JP Morgan expects
the volatility of profits and losses associated with FVA and
debit valuation adjustments (DVA) - another measurement that
overlaps with FVA - to be lower going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FVA has sparked a lively debate in the derivatives world.
Noted academic John Hull has argued that FVA should not be
included in valuing derivatives as it moves away from
risk-neutral pricing, while banks counter that it represents a
real cost of doing business, and a substantial one at that. RBS,
one of a handful of firms that has started making public
disclosures, mentioned an FVA of &#163;475m in its 2012 annual
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other industry professionals have criticised the lack of
transparency around factoring FVA into derivatives valuations,
and have called for the creation of a simplified market
standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For more from IFR Magazine, go to www.ifre.com)

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 14 (Reuters) - Credit card company Visa  has become the fifth major company to extend its World Cup sponsorship until 2022, FIFA said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, which is also an Olympic sponsor, became a FIFA partner in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It replaced rival MasterCard which won a $90 million legal settlement from soccer's ruling body FIFA after claiming it should have been given first refusal on a new deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial terms of the new contract with Visa were not disclosed. It will cover the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the tournament four years later in Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our association with the FIFA World Cup and the entire portfolio of FIFA events differentiates our brand and allows us to offer unique opportunities to our clients around the world," said Ricardo Fort who is responsible for global sponsorship and marketing at Visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard remains involved in soccer sponsorship through the European Champions League.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German sportswear company Adidas has signed up as a FIFA sponsor until 2030 while Coca-Cola, Hyundai-Kia and Anheuser-Busch InBev have renewed until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIFA generated $370 million from marketing in 2012, out of total revenues of $1.166 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

(NASDAQ: ALGN) and 3M ESPE (NYSE: MMM) today announced that Align Technology has qualified the 3M&#8482; True Definition scanner for use with Invisalign&#174; case submissions, which requires an intraoral scanner that can readily capture an accurate full arch digital impression.

Align supports an open systems approach to digital impressions and continues to work with intraoral scanning companies interested in developing interoperability for use with Invisalign treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to provide 3M True Definition customers with the option to submit digital impressions for Invisalign treatment," said John Graham, Align Technology vice president and chief marketing officer.

 (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Tanya Agrawal and David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co reported a
better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit as the biggest
U.S. bank kept a lid on costs and set aside less money to cover
bad loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank, which agreed last week to pay $2.6 billion to
settle government and private claims over its handling of
accounts of fraudster Bernie Madoff, said fourth-quarter net
income fell 7.3 percent to $5.28 billion, or $1.30 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusted for special items, the company earned $1.40 per
share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.35, according
to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results took into account gains from the sale of Visa
Inc shares and One Chase Manhattan Plaza and legal
expenses related to the Madoff settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which agreed to pay nearly $20 billion in 2013 to
settle assorted legal claims, had estimated that settlement of
the Madoff claims would subtract $850 million from
fourth-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was in the best interests of our company and
shareholders for us to accept responsibility, resolve these
issues and move forward,"  Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie
Dimon said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares, which have been trading this month at their
highest levels since 2000, were up 0.5 percent at $58 before the
opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock rose 33 percent in 2013, in line with the 35
percent rise in the KBW Bank index and slightly ahead of
the 29 percent gain in Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special items highlighted by the bank subtracted 10 cents
per share from fourth-quarter earnings, compared with a two-cent
boost in the same quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The special items included a benefit of 21 cents per share
from the sale of Visa shares and 8 cents from the sale of One
Chase Manhattan Plaza and an expense of 27 cents per share from
legal bills, including the Madoff settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months ago, JPMorgan reported its first quarterly loss
under Dimon after recording after-tax expenses of $7.2 billion
to settle government and private investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allegations involved, among other things, shoddy dealing
in mortgage instruments before the financial crisis, derivatives
trading in London and pricing in electric power markets, as well
as failing to report suspicions of wrongdoing by Madoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have been looking for reassurance from the company
that the worst of its legal expenses are behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASSETS SHRINK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noninterest expenses fell 3 percent to $15.55 billion during
the quarter, while provisions for bad loans fell 84 percent to
$104 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said its assets shrank to $2.42 trillion at the end
of December from $2.46 trillion three months before and $2.36
trillion a year earlier, but it remains the biggest U.S. bank by
that measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equity underwriting revenue soared 65 percent to $436
million. But investment banking fees were pulled down by lower
debt underwriting, where revenue declined 19 percent, and
advisory fees, which fell 7 percent. Altogether, investment
banking fees declined 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's market share in equity underwriting rose to 8.3
percent in 2013, moving it to second place in the industry from
fourth. Goldman Sachs Group Inc led with 11.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher interest rates on home mortgage loans weighed on
JPMorgan, like the rest of the banking industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan lost $274 million, pre-tax, making mortgage loans,
compared with a profit of $789 million a year earlier as margins
declined and as the company was unable to reduce expenses as
quickly as lending volumes declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it expected to lose money making mortgages
again in the first quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting a slowdown in loan refinancing, total U.S. home
mortgage borrowing was down 50 percent at the end of December
compared with a year earlier and down by a quarter from the end
of September, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan edges up after earnings; Wells Fargo due&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Retail sales data on tap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Google up in premarket trade after Nest buy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Futures up: Dow 30 pts, S 3.6 pts, Nasdaq 7.75 pts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures
advanced on Tuesday, a day after the S 500 suffered its
biggest drop in two months, as investors digested earnings from
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo and prepared for retail sales data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark S index fell 1.3 percent on Monday,
its worst decline Nov. 7, as investors exercised caution amid
mounting negative corporate outlooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 10 out of every 11 earnings pre-announcements for the
current earnings season from S 500 companies have lowered
estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data, which would be the
lowest on record if it continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No one wanted to commit until we get the flow of earnings
and today that is exactly what is going to start, so all eyes
are on JPMorgan and Wells Fargo," said Peter Cardillo, chief
market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co edged up 0.3 percent to $57.87
in choppy premarket trading after posting quarterly earnings.
 Wells Fargo fell 1.2 percent to $45 after
results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Federal Reserve has embarked on the winding down of
its stimulus, which was largely responsible for the 29.6 percent
climb in the S 500 last year, investors may be forced to
become more selective when it comes to stock valuations. The
forward price-to-earnings ratio for the index is at its highest
level in nearly seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market needs to now perform, not on the flow of money
entering the market from the bond buying program, but rather on
fundamentals. And certainly it's going to be more of individual
companies as opposed to following the leader as we saw last
year," Cardillo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in the week, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup
Inc, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are
among the financial companies scheduled to post results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S 500 futures rose 3.6 points and were above fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures gained 30
points and Nasdaq 100 futures added 7.75 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratasys Ltd dropped 4.6 percent to $124 before
the opening bell after the 3D printer maker, estimated full-year
adjusted profit way below Wall Street estimates, as it warned
expenses would rise significantly in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merger activity continues to be lively. Google Inc 
gained 1.4 percent to $1,138.26 in premarket trade after the
world's largest online search engine announced late Monday a
$3.2 billion deal to buy smart thermostat and smoke alarm maker
Nest Labs Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter Communications Inc on Monday formally
offered to acquire larger rival Time Warner Cable for
$37.3 billion, sparking what is likely to be a contentious
battle to control the No. 2 U.S. cable operator. Time Warner
gained 1.5 percent to $134.37 before the opening bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp shares fell 0.8 percent to $34.69 in
premarket trade after Citigroup cut the stock to "neutral" from
a "buy" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European shares fell as investors turned cautious after a
string of disappointing earnings and outlook statements on Wall
Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian shares came under pressure, with Japanese stocks
tumbling more than 3 percent as the yen hit a four-week high
against the dollar after last week's surprisingly weak jobs
report raised concerns about U.S. growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 14 - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) slightly raised its commodity trading risk for the first time since last spring in the fourth quarter, even as it exits the physical commodities trading business, its quarterly results showed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value-at-Risk (VaR) in commodities at JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, rose to $15 million in the fourth quarter, from $13 million, unchanged during the previous two quarters, and up $1 million from the fourth quarter of 2012. VaR is the most that can be lost on 95 percent of trading days within a given period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, typical of Wall Street banks, groups its commodities revenue under the fixed income category and does not break out the sector, often leaving VaR as one of its key risk-reward indicators that can measure commodities exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the fourth quarter, fixed income revenue was $3.2 billion, down from $3.4 billion in the third quarter and in line with the fourth quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said in July it would sell its physical commodities business, and expects to complete a sale in the first quarter of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it will retain its financial commodity trading business to serve client needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Louie Sussman; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 14 - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co slightly
raised its commodity trading risk for the first time since last
spring in the fourth quarter, even as it exits the physical
commodities trading business, its quarterly results showed on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value-at-Risk (VaR) in commodities at JPMorgan, the largest
U.S. bank, rose to $15 million in the fourth quarter, from $13
million, unchanged during the previous two quarters, and up $1
million from the fourth quarter of 2012. VaR is the most that
can be lost on 95 percent of trading days within a given period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, typical of Wall Street banks, groups its
commodities revenue under the fixed income category and does not
break out the sector, often leaving VaR as one of its key
risk-reward indicators that can measure commodities exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the fourth quarter, fixed income revenue was $3.2
billion, down from $3.4 billion in the third quarter and in line
with the fourth quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said in July it would sell its physical commodities
business, and expects to complete a sale in the first quarter of
2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it will retain its financial commodity trading
business to serve client needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan edges up after earnings; Wells Fargo due&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Retail sales data on tap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Google up in light premarket trade after Nest buy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Futures up: Dow 16 pts, S 2.5 pts, Nasdaq 3.25 pts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures
advanced on Tuesday, a day after the S 500 suffered its
biggest drop in two months, as investors prepared for retail
sales data and the first round of earnings from major banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The benchmark S index fell 1.3 percent on Monday,
its worst decline Nov. 7, as investors exercised caution amid
mounting negative corporate outlooks. Almost 10 out of every 11
earnings pre-announcements for the current earnings season from
S 500 companies have lowered estimates, according to Thomson
Reuters data, which would be the lowest on record if it
continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co was little changed in choppy
premarket trading after posting quarterly earnings. Wells Fargo
&amp; Co results are due later on Tuesday and will also be
monitored closely by investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Later in the week, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup
Inc, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are
among the financial companies scheduled to post results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S 500 futures rose 2.5 points and above fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures gained 16
points and Nasdaq 100 futures added 3.25 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* After the closing bell on Monday, Yum Brands Inc 
said December sales at established restaurants in China, its top
market, rose a smaller-than-expected 2 percent after weakness at
its Pizza Hut Casual Dining chain weighed on a recovery at KFC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Merger activity continues to be lively. Google Inc
 gained 1 percent in light premarket trade after the
world's largest online search engine announced late Monday a
$3.2 billion deal to buy smart thermostat and smoke alarm maker
Nest Labs Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Charter Communications Inc on Monday formally
offered to acquire larger rival Time Warner Cable for
$37.3 billion, sparking what is likely to be a contentious
battle to control the No. 2 U.S. cable operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Microsoft Corp shares fell 0.8 percent to $34.69
in premarket trade after Citigroup cut the stock to "neutral"
from a "buy" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc jumped 23.3
percent to $2.70 before the opening bell after Bank of America
Merrill Lynch boosted its rating on the stock to "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* European shares fell, taking their cue from Wall Street's
steep selloff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Asian shares came under pressure, with Japanese stocks
tumbling more than 3 percent as the yen hit a four-week high
against the dollar after last week's surprisingly weak jobs
report raised concerns about U.S. growth.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Adjusted for the significant items disclosed in our earnings press 
      releases this quarter and in the fourth quarter of 2012, EPS would have

      would have been 15% this year, flat compared with the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the 
      financial results: &#8220;We are pleased to have made progress on our control, 
      regulatory and litigation agendas and to have put some significant 
      issues behind us this quarter. We reached several important resolutions 
      &#8211; Global RMBS, Gibbs  Bruns, and Madoff. It was in the best interests 
      of our company and shareholders for us to accept responsibility, resolve 
      these issues and move forward. This will allow us to focus on what we 
      are here for: serving our clients and communities around the world. We 
      remained focused on building our four leading franchises, which all 
      continued to deliver strong underlying performance, for the quarter and 
      the year.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon continued, &#8220;The Corporate  Investment Bank was #1 in global IB 
      fees in 2013, with #1 positions in global debt and equity, syndicated 
      loans, and U.S. announced MA, and we gained share in Banking and 
      Markets. Consumer  Community Banking deposits were up 8% for the fourth 
      quarter of 2013; client investment assets were up 19%; and general 
      purpose credit card sales volume growth has outperformed the industry 
      for 23 consecutive quarters. Gross investment banking revenue3&#160;was 
      a record $1.7 billion for the year, up 5%. Asset Management also had 
      excellent performance with positive net long-term client flows of $90 
      billion for the full year 2013 and record loan balances, up 21%.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon added: &#8220;During the course of 2013, JPMorgan Chase continued to 
      make a significant positive impact on our communities. In 2013, the Firm 
      provided credit and raised capital of over $2.1 trillion for our 
      clients. The Firm has hired over 6,300 military veterans since 2011 as a 
      proud founding member of the 100,000 Jobs Mission.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon concluded: &#8220;I am proud of this Company, our employees and what we 
      do every day to serve our clients, customers and communities. We are 
      increasingly optimistic about the future of the U.S. economy and will 
      continue to do our part to support growth, economic development and the

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $2.4 billion, an increase of $383 million, or 19%, 
      compared with the prior year, due to lower provision for credit losses 
      and lower noninterest expense, largely offset by lower net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $11.3 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion, or 8%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.1 billion, down 
      $199 million, or 3%, driven by spread compression in Credit Card, lower 
      deposit margins and lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff, 
      partially offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was 
      $4.3&#160;billion, a decrease of $849 million, or 17%, driven by lower 
      mortgage fees and related income, partially offset by higher investment 
      sales revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $72&#160;million, compared with 
      $1.1&#160;billion in the prior year and a benefit of $267&#160;million in the 
      prior quarter.&#160;The current-quarter provision reflected a $1.2 billion 
      reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of 
      $1.3 billion. The prior-quarter provision reflected a $1.6&#160;billion 
      reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of 
      $1.3 billion. The prior-year provision reflected a $700&#160;million 
      reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of 
      $1.8 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $7.3&#160;billion, a decrease of $668&#160;million, or 8%, 
      from the prior year, driven by lower mortgage servicing expense, 
      partially offset by higher non-MBS related legal expense in Mortgage 
      Production and costs related to the control agenda.

        Deposits survey, Chase grew deposits more than any other bank for the 
        second year in a row, with a growth rate more than twice the industry 
        average2.
      
			
        Active mobile customers were up 26% over the prior year to 15.6 
        million, and Chase.com remains the #1 most visited banking portal in 
        the U.S.
      
			
        Record client investment assets were $188.8 billion, up 19% from the

		&lt;p&gt;
			Consumer  Business Banking&#160;net income was $780 million, an 
      increase of $49 million, or 7%, compared with the prior year, due to 
      higher net revenue, largely offset by higher noninterest expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% compared with the prior year. Net 
      interest income was $2.7&#160;billion, up 3% compared with the prior year, 
      driven by higher deposit balances, largely offset by lower deposit 
      margins. Noninterest revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 4%, driven 
      by higher investment sales revenue and debit card revenue, partially 
      offset by lower deposit-related fees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $108 million, compared with $110 
      million in the prior year and $104 million in the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $782 million2,

      losses due to continued improvement in delinquencies and home prices. 
      The prior year included a $700 million reduction in the allowance for 
      loan losses. Net charge-offs were $168 million, compared with $431

			Mortgage Production&#160;pretax loss was $274&#160;million, a 
      decrease of $1.1 billion from the prior year, reflecting lower volumes, 
      lower margins and higher legal expense, partially offset by lower 
      repurchase losses. Mortgage production-related revenue, excluding 
      repurchase losses, was $494 million, a decrease of $1.1&#160;billion, or 69%, 
      from the prior year, largely reflecting lower volumes and lower margins. 
      Production expense2was $989 million, an increase of 
      $113&#160;million from the prior year, due to higher non-MBS related legal 
      expense, partially offset by lower compensation-related expense. 
      Repurchase losses for the current quarter reflected a benefit of $221 
      million, compared with a benefit of $53 million in the prior year and a 
      benefit of $175 million in the prior quarter. The current quarter 
      reflected a $1.2 billion reduction in repurchase liability primarily as 
      a result of the settlement with the GSEs for claims associated with 
      loans sold to the GSEs from 2000 to 2008, compared with a $249 million 
      reduction in repurchase liability in the prior year and a $300 million 
      reduction in repurchase liability in the prior quarter.

			Mortgage Servicing&#160;pretax income was $2 million, 
      compared with a pretax loss of $913 million in the prior year, 
      reflecting lower expense and higher revenue. Mortgage net

      MSR risk management was a loss of $24 million, compared with income of 
      $42 million in the prior year. Servicing expense was $663 million, a 
      decrease of $910 million from the prior year, reflecting lower costs 
      associated with the Independent Foreclosure Review and lower servicing 
      headcount.

      Net revenue was $850 million, a decrease of $115&#160;million, or 12%, from

      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $783 million, compared

      losses, $750 million from the purchased credit-impaired allowance and 
      $200 million from the non credit-impaired allowance, reflecting 
      continued improvement in delinquencies and home prices. The prior-year

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $858&#160;million, down 57% compared with the prior year. 
      These results primarily reflected lower revenue and a lower benefit from 
      the provision for credit losses, partially offset by slightly lower 
      noninterest expense. Net revenue was $6.0 billion compared with $7.6 
      billion in the prior year. Net revenue included a $1.5 billion loss as a 
      result of implementing a funding valuation adjustment1&#160;(&#8220;FVA&#8221;) 
      framework for OTC derivatives and structured notes. This change reflects 
      an industry migration towards incorporating the cost or benefit of 
      funding into their valuation; the majority of this adjustment relates to 
      uncollateralized derivatives. Net revenue also included a $536 million 
      loss from debit valuation adjustments1&#160;(&#8220;DVA&#8221;) on structured 
      notes and derivative liabilities, compared with a loss from DVA of $567 
      million in the prior year. Excluding the impact of both FVA1&#160;and 
      DVA1, net income was $2.1 billion, down 11% compared with the 
      prior year, and net revenue was $8.0 billion, down 2% compared with the 
      prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Banking revenue was $3.0 billion, down 4% from the prior year. 
      Investment banking fees were $1.7 billion, down 3% from the prior year, 
      driven by lower debt underwriting fees of $801 million, down 19% from a 
      record prior year, and by lower advisory fees of $434&#160;million, down 7% 
      from the prior year. This was predominantly offset by higher equity 
      underwriting fees of $436 million, up 65% from the prior year, on strong 
      market issuance and improved market share. Treasury Services revenue was 
      $1.0 billion, down 7% compared with the prior year, driven by lower 
      trade finance revenue. Lending revenue was $373&#160;million, primarily 
      reflecting net interest income on retained loans, fees on 
      lending-related commitments, and gains on securities received from 
      restructured loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Markets  Investor Services revenue was $3.0 billion, down 33% from the 
      prior year. Combined Fixed Income and Equity Markets revenue was $4.1 
      billion, flat compared with the prior year. In the prior year, Fixed 
      Income Markets also included a modest loss from the synthetic credit 
      portfolio. Securities Services revenue was $1.0 billion, up 3% from the 
      prior year, primarily driven by higher custody and fund services 
      revenue, due largely to higher assets under custody and higher deposits. 
      Credit Adjustments  Other revenue was a loss of $2.1 billion, driven by 
      the impact of both FVA1&#160;and DVA1, compared 
      with a loss of $586 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by 
      DVA1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $19 million, compared 
      with a benefit of $445 million in the prior year. The prior year 
      included recoveries and a reduction in the allowance for credit losses, 
      both related to certain restructured nonperforming loans. The ratio of 
      the allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained was 1.15%, 
      compared with 1.19% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the 
      consolidation of Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade 
      finance loans, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period-end 
      loans retained1&#160;was 2.02%, compared with 2.52% in the prior 
      year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $4.9 billion, down 2% from the prior year, 
      primarily due to lower compensation expense. The compensation ratio&#160;was 
      27%, excluding the impact of FVA1&#160;and DVA1.

			Discussion of Results:

      Net income was $693 million, flat compared with the prior year, 
      reflecting an increase in noninterest expense and a higher provision for 
      credit losses, offset by higher net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $1.8&#160;billion, an increase of $102 million, or 6%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $1.2 billion, an 
      increase of $56 million, or 5%, compared with the prior year, reflecting 
      the one-time proceeds from a lending-related workout and higher loan and 
      liability balances, partially offset by loan spread compression and 
      lower purchase discounts recognized on loan repayments. Noninterest 
      revenue was $624&#160;million, an increase of $46 million, or 8%, compared 
      with the prior year, reflecting higher community development-related 
      revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $744 million, flat compared with 
      the prior year. Revenue from Corporate Client Banking was $488&#160;million, 
      flat compared with the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending 
      was $298&#160;million, a decrease of $14 million, or 4%, compared with the 
      prior year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $206&#160;million, an 
      increase of $93 million, or 82%, compared with the prior year, driven by 
      the one-time proceeds from a lending-related workout.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $43 million, compared with a benefit 
      of $3 million in the prior year. Net charge-offs were $25 million (0.07% 
      net charge-off rate), compared with net charge-offs of $50&#160;million 
      (0.16% net charge-off rate) in the prior year and net charge-offs of 
      $16&#160;million (0.05% net charge-off rate) in the prior quarter. The 
      allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained was 1.97%, down 
      from 2.06% in the prior year and down from 1.99% in the prior quarter. 
      Nonaccrual loans were $514&#160;million, down $159&#160;million, or 24%, from the 
      prior year, and down by $52 million, or 9%, from the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $653 million, up 9% compared with the prior 
      year, reflecting higher product- and headcount-related2&#160;expense.

      Net income was $568&#160;million, an increase of $85 million, or 18%, from

      noninterest expense.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $3.2&#160;billion, an increase of $426&#160;million, or 15%, from 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $2.6&#160;billion, up $393 million, 
      or 18%, from the prior year, due to net client inflows, higher 
      valuations of seed capital investments and the effect of higher market 
      levels. Net interest income was $585&#160;million, up $33&#160;million, or 6%, 
      from the prior year, due to higher loan and deposit balances, partially 
      offset by narrower loan spreads.

      Revenue from Private Banking was $1.6 billion, up 11% compared with the

      trillion, an increase of $172 billion, or 12%, from the prior year, due 
      to net inflows to long-term products and the effect of higher market 
      levels. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were 
      $745&#160;billion, up $76&#160;billion, or 11%, from the prior year, due to the 
      effect of higher market levels and custody inflows, partially offset by 
      brokerage outflows.

      The provision for credit losses was $21 million, compared with $19 
      million in the prior year.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $2.2 billion, an increase of $302 million, or 
      16%, from the prior year, primarily due to higher performance-based

        inflows of $7 billion to liquidity products.

      (*) Presented on a managed basis. See notes on pages 12 and 13 for 
      further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis 
      totaled $23,156 million, $23,117 million, and $23,653 million for the 
      fourth quarter of 2013, third quarter of 2013, and fourth quarter of 
      2012, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $5.3 billion, down $414 million from the prior year. The 
      decrease was driven by lower net revenue and higher taxes resulting from 
      non-deductible penalties incurred and a lower benefit related to tax 
      adjustments, which were partially offset by lower provision for credit 
      losses and lower noninterest expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $24.1 billion, down $266 million, or 1%, compared with 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $13.0 billion, flat compared 
      with the prior year. The current-quarter included a $1.5 billion loss as 
      a result of implementing a funding valuation adjustment1&#160;(&#8220;FVA&#8221;) 
      framework for OTC derivatives and structured notes, and a $536 million 
      loss from debit valuation adjustments1&#160;(&#8220;DVA&#8221;) on structured 
      notes and derivative liabilities. Net interest income was $11.1 billion, 
      down $203 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, reflecting the 
      impact of lower loan yields and lower trading and investment securities 
      balances, partially offset by higher investment securities yields and 
      lower financing costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $104 million, down $552 million from 
      the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $65 
      million, compared with $1.1 billion in the prior year. The 
      current-quarter provision reflected a $1.2 billion reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses, compared to a $700 million reduction in the 
      prior year, due to favorable delinquency trends and lower estimated 
      losses in mortgage and credit card portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs 
      were $1.3 billion, compared with $1.8 billion in the prior year, 
      resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.44% and 1.99%, respectively. The 
      decrease in consumer net charge-offs was primarily due to improved 
      delinquency trends. The wholesale provision for credit losses was an 
      expense of $39 million, compared with a benefit of $430 million in the 
      prior year. Wholesale net charge-offs were $22 million, compared with 
      net recoveries of $158 million in the prior year, resulting in a net 
      charge-off rate of 0.03% and a net recovery rate of 0.21%, respectively. 
      The Firm&#8217;s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1&#160;was 
      1.80%, compared with 2.43% in the prior year. The Firm&#8217;s nonperforming 
      assets totaled $9.7 billion, down from the prior quarter and prior year 
      levels of $10.4 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $15.6 billion, down $495 million, or 3%, 
      compared with the prior year, primarily driven by lower servicing 
      expense. The current quarter included approximately $847 million of 
      legal expense, compared with $1.2 billion of legal expense in the prior 
      year.

          The Firm presents below net income and earnings per share excluding 
          certain reported significant items. These measures should be viewed 
          in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Firm&#8217;s reported 
          results. Management believes this information helps investors 
          understand the effect of these items on reported results and 
          provides an additional presentation of the Firm's performance. The 
          tables below provide a reconciliation of reported results to these 
          non-GAAP measures.

          In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, 
          management reviews the Firm's consolidated results and the results 
          of the lines of business on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis, which is a non-GAAP 
          financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts 
          with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain 
          reclassifications to present total consolidated net revenue for the 
          Firm (and for each of the business segments) on a fully 
          taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. Accordingly, revenue from 
          investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is 
          presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
          securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows 
          management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both 
          taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact 
          related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. 
          These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income/(loss) 
          as reported by the Firm or on net income/(loss) as reported by the 
          lines of business.

          The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans 
          excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans 
          held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans; and the 
          allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, Real 
          Estate Portfolios net charge-offs and net charge-off rates exclude 
          the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to 
          the PCI portfolio totaled $4.2 billion at December 31, 2013, $5.0 
          billion at September 30, 2013, and $5.7 billion at December 31, 
          2012. In Corporate  Investment Bank, the ratio of the allowance for 
          loan losses to end-of-period loans is calculated excluding the 
          impact of trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered 
          multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to 
          provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB's allowance coverage.

          Tangible common equity (&#8220;TCE&#8221;), return on tangible common equity 
          (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;), tangible book value per share (&#8220;TBVS&#8221;), Tier 1 common 
          under Basel I and III rules, and the supplementary leverage ratio 
          (&#8220;SLR&#8221;) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the 
          Firm&#8217;s common stockholders&#8217; equity (i.e., total stockholders&#8217; equity 
          less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible 
          assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. 
          ROTCE measures the Firm&#8217;s earnings as a percentage of average TCE. 
          TBVS represents the Firm&#8217;s tangible common equity divided by 
          period-end common shares. Tier 1 common under Basel I and III rules, 
          and SLR are used by management, bank regulators, investors and 
          analysts to assess and monitor the Firm&#8217;s capital position and 
          liquidity. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVS are meaningful to the Firm, as well 
          as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm&#8217;s use of equity. 
          For additional information on Tier 1 common under Basel I and III, 
          see Regulatory capital on pages 117-119 of JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s 
          Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and 
          on pages 61-65 of the Firm&#8217;s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the 
          quarter ended September 30, 2013. All of the aforementioned measures 
          are useful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in 
          facilitating comparisons of the Firm with competitors.

          Asset Management pretax margin represents income before income tax 
          expense divided by total net revenue which is, in management's view, 
          a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring 
          earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is, 
          therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the 
          performance of Asset Management against the performance of its 
          respective peers.

          Basel 2.5 rules became effective on January 1, 2013. The 
          implementation of these rules in the first quarter of 2013 resulted 
          in an increase of approximately $150 billion in risk-weighted assets 
          compared with the Basel I rules. The implementation of these rules 
          also resulted in decreases of Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 
          1 common capital ratios by 140 basis points, 160 basis points and 
          120 basis points, respectively, at March 31, 2013. For further

&lt;p&gt;Jan 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co reported a
7.3 percent drop in quarterly profit after the biggest U.S. bank
by assets paid penalties to the government for not reporting
suspicions of fraud by Ponzi-schemer client Bernie Madoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to $5.28 billion, or $1.30 per share, in the
fourth quarter from $5.69 billion, or $1.39 per share in the
same quarter of 2012, JPMorgan said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest results took into account gains from the sale of
Visa Inc shares and One Chase Manhattan Plaza and legal
expenses related to the Madoff settlements.

		&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, MA--(Marketwired - January 14, 2014) -
 uTest, the in-the-wild app testing leader, today announced it has closed a $43 Million Series E round of funding, led by Goldman Sachs. The funding comes ahead of the company's previously announced plans to expand its offering and change its name to Applause, and brings its funding-to-date to more than $80 Million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the company rolls out its expanded Applause vision in the coming months, it will use this funding to:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Expand in-the-wild testing services. The company will invest heavily in its real-world software testing services, including significant commitments to further advancing its functional, usability, load and localization testing solutions.
            
				Bring 360&#176;
					app quality to brands around the world, ushering in a new era of App Quality Management. Applause will include a suite of tools and analytics related to holistic app quality. This combined solution will enable a company's stakeholders -- including developers, QA, product, marketers and CEOs -- to better understand users' wants and experiences, and to use that information to create apps that win.
            
				Grow distribution channels. The company is deep in talks with strategic partners to bring 360&#176; app quality into the offerings of the application lifecycle management (ALM) leaders. International expansion is planned through a recently announced reseller program -- particularly in the EU and Asia-Pacific markets.
            
				Broaden uTest. In addition to the larger Applause offering, the company will leverage the uTest brand as an open community that caters to testers and advances the profession of software testing. The uTest offering will expand beyond paid projects to include training, certifications, test tool reviews, career advice, job boards and events. 
			&lt;p&gt;"In-the-wild testing has become a critical part of launching great digital experiences -- from apps for web, mobile, wearables and beyond. Funding on this scale, and from a leader like Goldman Sachs, will help us broaden these services, and incorporate tools that enable companies to achieve 360&#176; app quality," said uTest CEO, Doron Reuveni. "We're positioned for a massive market opportunity, and to extend our lead as the one-stop solution for modern app quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The round had full participation from all of uTest's previous investors, including QuestMark Partners, Scale Venture Partners, Longworth Venture Partners, Mass Ventures, Egan-Managed Capital and Mesco Ltd. The company's previous round of funding was a $17 Million Series D round in December 2011. As part of the Series E investment, David Campbell, Goldman Sachs' Managing Director, Merchant Banking Division will join the uTest Board of Directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, customer-facing applications have become critically important for most businesses. And app quality is a key differentiator between winners and losers in this era of the always-connected, on-the-go, highly vocal user," added Campbell. "When you consider the complexity of creating truly great applications, uTest is uniquely positioned to help its customers win, and to build a large, lasting company in the process." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's news comes as companies are recognizing the full importance of App Quality Management. And as the apps economy grows ever-faster, these digital experiences have become the front door to brands, to the companies behind them, and to their top-line results.

		&lt;h1&gt;uTest Closes $43 Million Series E Round Led by Goldman Sachs&lt;/h1&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Ahead of Rebrand to 'Applause,' Funding Amplifies Company's Plans to Bring 360 Degrees App Quality to Startups and Enterprises Around the World&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, MA--(Marketwired - Jan 14, 2014) -  uTest, the in-the-wild app testing leader, today announced it has closed a $43 Million Series E round of funding, led by Goldman Sachs. The funding comes ahead of the company's previously announced plans to expand its offering and change its name to Applause, and brings its funding-to-date to more than $80 Million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the company rolls out its expanded Applause vision in the coming months, it will use this funding to:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Expand in-the-wild testing services. The company will invest heavily in its real-world software testing services, including significant commitments to further advancing its functional, usability, load and localization testing solutions.
            
				Bring 360&#176;
					app quality to brands around the world, ushering in a new era of App Quality Management. Applause will include a suite of tools and analytics related to holistic app quality. This combined solution will enable a company's stakeholders -- including developers, QA, product, marketers and CEOs -- to better understand users' wants and experiences, and to use that information to create apps that win.
            
				Grow distribution channels. The company is deep in talks with strategic partners to bring 360&#176; app quality into the offerings of the application lifecycle management (ALM) leaders. International expansion is planned through a recently announced reseller program -- particularly in the EU and Asia-Pacific markets.
            
				Broaden uTest. In addition to the larger Applause offering, the company will leverage the uTest brand as an open community that caters to testers and advances the profession of software testing. The uTest offering will expand beyond paid projects to include training, certifications, test tool reviews, career advice, job boards and events. 
			&lt;p&gt;"In-the-wild testing has become a critical part of launching great digital experiences -- from apps for web, mobile, wearables and beyond. Funding on this scale, and from a leader like Goldman Sachs, will help us broaden these services, and incorporate tools that enable companies to achieve 360&#176; app quality," said uTest CEO, Doron Reuveni. "We're positioned for a massive market opportunity, and to extend our lead as the one-stop solution for modern app quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The round had full participation from all of uTest's previous investors, including QuestMark Partners, Scale Venture Partners, Longworth Venture Partners, Mass Ventures, Egan-Managed Capital and Mesco Ltd. The company's previous round of funding was a $17 Million Series D round in December 2011. As part of the Series E investment, David Campbell, Goldman Sachs' Managing Director, Merchant Banking Division will join the uTest Board of Directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, customer-facing applications have become critically important for most businesses. And app quality is a key differentiator between winners and losers in this era of the always-connected, on-the-go, highly vocal user," added Campbell. "When you consider the complexity of creating truly great applications, uTest is uniquely positioned to help its customers win, and to build a large, lasting company in the process." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's news comes as companies are recognizing the full importance of App Quality Management. And as the apps economy grows ever-faster, these digital experiences have become the front door to brands, to the companies behind them, and to their top-line results. At the same time, the rise in social media and app store reviews has given users a larger voice than ever before.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Adjusted for the significant items disclosed in our earnings press

      would have been 15% this year, flat compared with the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the 
      financial results: &#8220;We are pleased to have made progress on our control, 
      regulatory and litigation agendas and to have put some significant 
      issues behind us this quarter. We reached several important resolutions 
      &#8211; Global RMBS, Gibbs  Bruns, and Madoff. It was in the best interests 
      of our company and shareholders for us to accept responsibility, resolve 
      these issues and move forward. This will allow us to focus on what we 
      are here for: serving our clients and communities around the world. We 
      remained focused on building our four leading franchises, which all 
      continued to deliver strong underlying performance, for the quarter and 
      the year.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon continued, &#8220;The Corporate  Investment Bank was #1 in global IB 
      fees in 2013, with #1 positions in global debt and equity, syndicated 
      loans, and U.S. announced MA, and we gained share in Banking and 
      Markets. Consumer  Community Banking deposits were up 8% for the fourth 
      quarter of 2013; client investment assets were up 19%; and general 
      purpose credit card sales volume growth has outperformed the industry 
      for 23 consecutive quarters. Gross investment banking revenue3 
      was a record $1.7 billion for the year, up 5%. Asset Management also had 
      excellent performance with positive net long-term client flows of $90 
      billion for the full year 2013 and record loan balances, up 21%.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon added: &#8220;During the course of 2013, JPMorgan Chase continued to 
      make a significant positive impact on our communities. In 2013, the Firm 
      provided credit and raised capital of over $2.1 trillion for our 
      clients. The Firm has hired over 6,300 military veterans since 2011 as a 
      proud founding member of the 100,000 Jobs Mission.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon concluded: &#8220;I am proud of this Company, our employees and what we 
      do every day to serve our clients, customers and communities. We are 
      increasingly optimistic about the future of the U.S. economy and will 
      continue to do our part to support growth, economic development and the 
      creation of new jobs around the world.&#8221;

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $2.4 billion, an increase of $383 million, or 19%, 
      compared with the prior year, due to lower provision for credit losses 
      and lower noninterest expense, largely offset by lower net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $11.3 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion, or 8%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.1 billion, down 
      $199 million, or 3%, driven by spread compression in Credit Card, lower 
      deposit margins and lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff, 
      partially offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was 
      $4.3&#160;billion, a decrease of $849 million, or 17%, driven by lower 
      mortgage fees and related income, partially offset by higher investment 
      sales revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $72&#160;million, compared with 
      $1.1&#160;billion in the prior year and a benefit of $267&#160;million in the 
      prior quarter.&#160;The current-quarter provision reflected a $1.2 billion 
      reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of 
      $1.3 billion. The prior-quarter provision reflected a $1.6&#160;billion 
      reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of 
      $1.3 billion. The prior-year provision reflected a $700&#160;million 
      reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of 
      $1.8 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $7.3&#160;billion, a decrease of $668&#160;million, or 8%, 
      from the prior year, driven by lower mortgage servicing expense, 
      partially offset by higher non-MBS related legal expense in Mortgage 
      Production and costs related to the control agenda.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Banking net income was $562 million, an increase of $144 
      million, or 34%, compared with the prior year, driven by lower 
      noninterest expense and provision for credit losses, predominantly 
      offset by lower net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $2.2 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion compared with 
      the prior year. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $58 
      million, or 5%, driven by lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff. 
      Noninterest revenue was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $1.0&#160;billion, driven 
      by lower mortgage fees and related income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $782 million2, 
      compared with a benefit of $269 million in the prior year. The current 
      quarter reflected a $950 million reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses due to continued improvement in delinquencies and home prices. 
      The prior year included a $700 million reduction in the allowance for 
      loan losses. Net charge-offs were $168 million, compared with $431 
      million in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $2.1 billion, a decrease of $809 million, or 
      28%, from the prior year, due to lower servicing expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Production pretax loss was $274&#160;million, a 
      decrease of $1.1 billion from the prior year, reflecting lower volumes, 
      lower margins and higher legal expense, partially offset by lower 
      repurchase losses. Mortgage production-related revenue, excluding 
      repurchase losses, was $494 million, a decrease of $1.1&#160;billion, or 69%, 
      from the prior year, largely reflecting lower volumes and lower margins. 
      Production expense2 was $989 million, an increase of 
      $113&#160;million from the prior year, due to higher non-MBS related legal 
      expense, partially offset by lower compensation-related expense. 
      Repurchase losses for the current quarter reflected a benefit of $221 
      million, compared with a benefit of $53 million in the prior year and a 
      benefit of $175 million in the prior quarter. The current quarter 
      reflected a $1.2 billion reduction in repurchase liability primarily as 
      a result of the settlement with the GSEs for claims associated with 
      loans sold to the GSEs from 2000 to 2008, compared with a $249 million 
      reduction in repurchase liability in the prior year and a $300 million 
      reduction in repurchase liability in the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mortgage Servicing pretax income was $2 million, compared 
      with a pretax loss of $913 million in the prior year, reflecting lower 
      expense and higher revenue. Mortgage net servicing-related revenue was 
      $689 million, an increase of $71 million. MSR risk management was a loss 
      of $24 million, compared with income of $42 million in the prior year. 
      Servicing expense was $663 million, a decrease of $910 million from the 
      prior year, reflecting lower costs associated with the Independent 
      Foreclosure Review and lower servicing headcount.

        Mortgage application volumes were $31.3 billion, down 52% from the 
        prior year and 23% from the prior quarter.
      
			
        Period-end total third-party mortgage loans serviced were $815.5 
        billion, down 5% from the prior year and 2% from the prior quarter.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Real Estate Portfolios pretax income was $1.2 billion, up 
      $410&#160;million from the prior year, due to a higher benefit from the 
      provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $850 million, a decrease of $115&#160;million, or 12%, from 
      the prior year. This decrease was due to lower noninterest revenue due 
      to higher loan retention and lower net interest income resulting from 
      lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $783 million, compared 
      with a benefit of $283&#160;million in the prior year. The current-quarter 
      provision reflected a $950 million reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses, $750 million from the purchased credit-impaired allowance and 
      $200 million from the non credit-impaired allowance, reflecting 
      continued improvement in delinquencies and home prices. The prior-year 
      provision included a $700 million reduction in the allowance for loan 
      losses from the non credit-impaired allowance. Net charge-offs were 
      $167&#160;million, compared with $417 million in the prior year. Home equity 
      net charge-offs were $179&#160;million (1.21% net charge-off rate1), 
      compared with $257 million (1.49% net charge-off rate1) in 
      the prior year. Subprime mortgage net recoveries were $6&#160;million (0.33% 
      net recovery rate1), compared with net charge-offs of 
      $92&#160;million (4.35% net charge-off rate1). Net recoveries 
      of prime mortgage, including option ARMs, were $8&#160;million (0.06% net 
      recovery rate1), compared with net charge-offs of $66 million 
      (0.63% net charge-off rate1).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $411&#160;million, a decrease of $25&#160;million, or 6%, 
      compared with the prior year.

			Card, Merchant Services  Auto net income was $1.0 billion, 
      an increase of $190 million, or 23%, compared with the prior year, 
      driven by lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower 
      net revenue.

      Net revenue was $4.7 billion, down $140 million, or 3%, compared with 
      the prior year. Net interest income was $3.3&#160;billion, down $222 million 
      compared with the prior year, primarily driven by spread compression in 
      Credit Card. Noninterest revenue was $1.4&#160;billion, up $82 million 
      compared with the prior year, primarily driven by higher net interchange 
      income, auto lease income and merchant servicing revenue, partially 
      offset by lower revenue from an exited non-core product.

      The provision for credit losses was $746 million, compared with 
      $1.3&#160;billion in the prior year and $673&#160;million in the prior quarter. 
      The current-quarter provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a 
      $300&#160;million reduction in the allowance for loan losses reflecting 
      improved delinquency trends and a decrease in restructured loan volume.

      The Credit Card net charge-off rate1 was 2.85%, down from 
      3.50% in the prior year and 2.86% in the prior quarter; the 30+ day 
      delinquency rate1 was 1.67%, down from 2.10% in the prior 
      year and 1.68% in the prior quarter. The Auto net charge-off rate was 
      0.39%, up from 0.36% in the prior year and 0.35% in the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $2.2 billion, up $59 million, or 3% from the 
      prior year, driven by higher marketing expense, payments to customers 
      required by a regulatory consent order and higher auto lease 
      depreciation, predominantly offset by the write-off of intangible assets

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $858&#160;million, down 57% compared with the prior year. 
      These results primarily reflected lower revenue and a lower benefit from 
      the provision for credit losses, partially offset by slightly lower 
      noninterest expense. Net revenue was $6.0 billion compared with $7.6 
      billion in the prior year. Net revenue included a $1.5 billion loss as a 
      result of implementing a funding valuation adjustment1 
      (&#8220;FVA&#8221;) framework for OTC derivatives and structured notes. This change 
      reflects an industry migration towards incorporating the cost or benefit 
      of funding into their valuation; the majority of this adjustment relates 
      to uncollateralized derivatives. Net revenue also included a $536 
      million loss from debit valuation adjustments1 (&#8220;DVA&#8221;) on 
      structured notes and derivative liabilities, compared with a loss from 
      DVA of $567 million in the prior year. Excluding the impact of both FVA1 
      and DVA1, net income was $2.1 billion, down 11% compared with 
      the prior year, and net revenue was $8.0 billion, down 2% compared with 
      the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Banking revenue was $3.0 billion, down 4% from the prior year. 
      Investment banking fees were $1.7 billion, down 3% from the prior year, 
      driven by lower debt underwriting fees of $801 million, down 19% from a 
      record prior year, and by lower advisory fees of $434&#160;million, down 7% 
      from the prior year. This was predominantly offset by higher equity 
      underwriting fees of $436 million, up 65% from the prior year, on strong 
      market issuance and improved market share. Treasury Services revenue was 
      $1.0 billion, down 7% compared with the prior year, driven by lower 
      trade finance revenue. Lending revenue was $373&#160;million, primarily 
      reflecting net interest income on retained loans, fees on 
      lending-related commitments, and gains on securities received from 
      restructured loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Markets  Investor Services revenue was $3.0 billion, down 33% from the 
      prior year. Combined Fixed Income and Equity Markets revenue was $4.1 
      billion, flat compared with the prior year. In the prior year, Fixed 
      Income Markets also included a modest loss from the synthetic credit 
      portfolio. Securities Services revenue was $1.0 billion, up 3% from the 
      prior year, primarily driven by higher custody and fund services 
      revenue, due largely to higher assets under custody and higher deposits. 
      Credit Adjustments  Other revenue was a loss of $2.1 billion, driven by 
      the impact of both FVA1 and DVA1, compared with a 
      loss of $586 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by DVA1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $19 million, compared 
      with a benefit of $445 million in the prior year. The prior year 
      included recoveries and a reduction in the allowance for credit losses, 
      both related to certain restructured nonperforming loans. The ratio of 
      the allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained was 1.15%, 
      compared with 1.19% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the 
      consolidation of Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade 
      finance loans, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period-end 
      loans retained1 was 2.02%, compared with 2.52% in the prior 
      year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $4.9 billion, down 2% from the prior year, 
      primarily due to lower compensation expense. The compensation ratio
			was 
      27%, excluding the impact of FVA1 and DVA1.

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $693 million, flat compared with the prior year, 
      reflecting an increase in noninterest expense and a higher provision for 
      credit losses, offset by higher net revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $1.8&#160;billion, an increase of $102 million, or 6%, 
      compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $1.2 billion, an 
      increase of $56 million, or 5%, compared with the prior year, reflecting 
      the one-time proceeds from a lending-related workout and higher loan and 
      liability balances, partially offset by loan spread compression and 
      lower purchase discounts recognized on loan repayments. Noninterest 
      revenue was $624&#160;million, an increase of $46 million, or 8%, compared 
      with the prior year, reflecting higher community development-related 
      revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $744 million, flat compared with 
      the prior year. Revenue from Corporate Client Banking was $488&#160;million, 
      flat compared with the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending 
      was $298&#160;million, a decrease of $14 million, or 4%, compared with the 
      prior year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $206&#160;million, an 
      increase of $93 million, or 82%, compared with the prior year, driven by 
      the one-time proceeds from a lending-related workout.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $43 million, compared with a benefit 
      of $3 million in the prior year. Net charge-offs were $25 million (0.07% 
      net charge-off rate), compared with net charge-offs of $50&#160;million 
      (0.16% net charge-off rate) in the prior year and net charge-offs of 
      $16&#160;million (0.05% net charge-off rate) in the prior quarter. The 
      allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained was 1.97%, down 
      from 2.06% in the prior year and down from 1.99% in the prior quarter. 
      Nonaccrual loans were $514&#160;million, down $159&#160;million, or 24%, from the 
      prior year, and down by $52 million, or 9%, from the prior quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $653 million, up 9% compared with the prior 
      year, reflecting higher product- and headcount-related2 
      expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $568&#160;million, an increase of $85 million, or 18%, from 
      the prior year, reflecting higher net revenue, largely offset by higher 
      noninterest expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $3.2&#160;billion, an increase of $426&#160;million, or 15%, from 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $2.6&#160;billion, up $393 million, 
      or 18%, from the prior year, due to net client inflows, higher 
      valuations of seed capital investments and the effect of higher market 
      levels. Net interest income was $585&#160;million, up $33&#160;million, or 6%, 
      from the prior year, due to higher loan and deposit balances, partially 
      offset by narrower loan spreads.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue from Private Banking was $1.6 billion, up 11% compared with the 
      prior year. Revenue from Institutional was $806 million, up 11%. Retail 
      was $770&#160;million, up 32%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Client assets were $2.3 trillion, an increase of $248&#160;billion, or 12%, 
      compared with the prior year. Assets under management were $1.6 
      trillion, an increase of $172 billion, or 12%, from the prior year, due 
      to net inflows to long-term products and the effect of higher market 
      levels. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were 
      $745&#160;billion, up $76&#160;billion, or 11%, from the prior year, due to the 
      effect of higher market levels and custody inflows, partially offset by 
      brokerage outflows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $21 million, compared with $19 
      million in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $2.2 billion, an increase of $302 million, or 
      16%, from the prior year, primarily due to higher performance-based 
      compensation, higher headcount-related2 expense and costs 
      related to the control agenda.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Key Metrics and Business Updates:(All 
      comparisons refer to the prior-year quarter except as noted)

      (*) Presented on a managed basis. See notes on pages 12 and 13 for 
      further explanation of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis 
      totaled $23,156 million, $23,117 million, and $23,653 million for the 
      fourth quarter of 2013, third quarter of 2013, and fourth quarter of 
      2012, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Discussion of Results:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income was $5.3 billion, down $414 million from the prior year. The 
      decrease was driven by lower net revenue and higher taxes resulting from 
      non-deductible penalties incurred and a lower benefit related to tax 
      adjustments, which were partially offset by lower provision for credit 
      losses and lower noninterest expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenue was $24.1 billion, down $266 million, or 1%, compared with 
      the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $13.0 billion, flat compared 
      with the prior year. The current-quarter included a $1.5 billion loss as 
      a result of implementing a funding valuation adjustment1 
      (&#8220;FVA&#8221;) framework for OTC derivatives and structured notes, and a $536 
      million loss from debit valuation adjustments1 (&#8220;DVA&#8221;) on 
      structured notes and derivative liabilities. Net interest income was 
      $11.1 billion, down $203 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, 
      reflecting the impact of lower loan yields and lower trading and 
      investment securities balances, partially offset by higher investment 
      securities yields and lower financing costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The provision for credit losses was $104 million, down $552 million from 
      the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $65 
      million, compared with $1.1 billion in the prior year. The 
      current-quarter provision reflected a $1.2 billion reduction in the 
      allowance for loan losses, compared to a $700 million reduction in the 
      prior year, due to favorable delinquency trends and lower estimated 
      losses in mortgage and credit card portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs 
      were $1.3 billion, compared with $1.8 billion in the prior year, 
      resulting in net charge-off rates of 1.44% and 1.99%, respectively. The 
      decrease in consumer net charge-offs was primarily due to improved 
      delinquency trends. The wholesale provision for credit losses was an 
      expense of $39 million, compared with a benefit of $430 million in the 
      prior year. Wholesale net charge-offs were $22 million, compared with 
      net recoveries of $158 million in the prior year, resulting in a net 
      charge-off rate of 0.03% and a net recovery rate of 0.21%, respectively. 
      The Firm&#8217;s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained1 
      was 1.80%, compared with 2.43% in the prior year. The Firm&#8217;s 
      nonperforming assets totaled $9.7 billion, down from the prior quarter 
      and prior year levels of $10.4 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Noninterest expense was $15.6 billion, down $495 million, or 3%, 
      compared with the prior year, primarily driven by lower servicing 
      expense. The current quarter included approximately $847 million of 
      legal expense, compared with $1.2 billion of legal expense in the prior 
      year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The Firm presents below net income and earnings per share 
            excluding certain reported significant items. These measures 
            should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the 
            Firm&#8217;s reported results. Management believes this information 
            helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported 
            results and provides an additional presentation of the Firm's 
            performance. The tables below provide a reconciliation of reported 
            results to these non-GAAP measures.

          In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, 
          management reviews the Firm's consolidated results and the results 
          of the lines of business on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis, which is a non-GAAP 
          financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts 
          with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain 
          reclassifications to present total consolidated net revenue for the 
          Firm (and for each of the business segments) on a fully 
          taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. Accordingly, revenue from 
          investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is 
          presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
          securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows 
          management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both 
          taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact 
          related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. 
          These adjustments have no impact on consolidated net income/(loss) 
          as reported by the Firm or on net income/(loss) as reported by the 
          lines of business.

            The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans 
            excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and 
            loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans; and 
            the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans. Additionally, 
            Real Estate Portfolios net charge-offs and net charge-off rates 
            exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses 
            related to the PCI portfolio totaled $4.2 billion at December 31, 
            2013, $5.0 billion at September 30, 2013, and $5.7 billion at 
            December 31, 2012. In Corporate  Investment Bank, the ratio of 
            the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans is calculated 
            excluding the impact of trade finance loans and consolidated 
            Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related 
            allowances, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB's 
            allowance coverage.

            Tangible common equity (&#8220;TCE&#8221;), return on tangible common equity 
            (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;), tangible book value per share (&#8220;TBVS&#8221;), Tier 1 common 
            under Basel I and III rules, and the supplementary leverage ratio 
            (&#8220;SLR&#8221;) are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the 
            Firm&#8217;s common stockholders&#8217; equity (i.e., total stockholders&#8217; 
            equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable 
            intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax 
            liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm&#8217;s earnings as a percentage of 
            average TCE. TBVS represents the Firm&#8217;s tangible common equity 
            divided by period-end common shares. Tier 1 common under Basel I 
            and III rules, and SLR are used by management, bank regulators, 
            investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm&#8217;s capital 
            position and liquidity. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVS are meaningful to the 
            Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm&#8217;s 
            use of equity. For additional information on Tier 1 common under 
            Basel I and III, see Regulatory capital on pages 117-119 of 
            JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year

            Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 
            2013. All of the aforementioned measures are useful to the Firm, 
            as well as analysts and investors, in facilitating comparisons of 
            the Firm with competitors.

          Basel 2.5 rules became effective on January 1, 2013. The 
          implementation of these rules in the first quarter of 2013 resulted 
          in an increase of approximately $150 billion in risk-weighted assets 
          compared with the Basel I rules. The implementation of these rules 
          also resulted in decreases of Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 
          1 common capital ratios by 140 basis points, 160 basis points and 
          120 basis points, respectively, at March 31, 2013. For further 
          discussion of Basel 2.5, see Regulatory capital on pages 61-65 of

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), Actavis Plc (ACT.N) and Mylan Inc (MYL.O) have all expressed interest in buying Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) branded generics business, but no active discussions are going on at this time, according to three people close to the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "established products" unit, which makes off-patent drugs, had global sales of $7 billion in the first nine months of 2013, accounting for 18 percent of Pfizer's revenue. Pfizer said in July it planned to separate its commercial operations into three units -- two mainly for patent-protected brands and the third for generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the people close to the matter, Pfizer is aware of each of the companies' interest but is not yet ready to entertain a deal as it prepares the groundwork for a potential separation of the generics business. It has said the review could take three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, Valeant, Actavis and Mylan all declined to comment. All the sources asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal for the business -- which houses medicines that have lost market exclusivity, as well as mature, patent-protected products that are expected to lose exclusivity through 2015 -- could catapult a buyer like Valeant into the ranks of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, but several hurdles remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer generics business is far bigger than the three pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valeant had $3.7 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2013, while Mylan and Actavis posted revenues of $5.10 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structuring a deal would also be a challenge because a sale could incur heavy taxes for Pfizer. One way to reduce the tax bill would be to use a structure known as a Reverse Morris Trust, according to the people close to the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that structure, a company spins off a unit that it wants to divest and that unit merges with a smaller company, with the smaller company running the combined entity. Overall, the transaction allows a parent company to sell a subsidiary in a tax-free manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear whether Pfizer would entertain such a deal structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge for potential buyers is the lack of historical financial information for the generics business, as Pfizer's efforts to split its commercial operations is a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, such a deal could be attractive, as it could immediately boost the buyer's earnings and increase its presence outside of North America, most importantly in emerging markets where many companies need to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valeant has kept no secret of its desire to grow through acquisitions. Its chief executive officer, Michael Pearson, said this month that the company wants to become one of the world's top five pharmaceutical companies by market capitalization by the end of 2016, largely through acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pearson also said that Valeant, which bought contact lens maker Bausch &amp; Lomb Holdings Inc for $8.7 billion in August, is looking at a merger of equals as well as smaller deals. He said it will look this year to pull off one acquisition of a similar size as its Bausch purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valeant also held talks with Actavis about a potential combination last year, although those discussions did not lead to a deal, according to media reports at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Actavis completed a $8.5 billion deal to buy Warner Chilcott Plc in October, months after rejecting a takeover offer from Mylan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nadia Damouni, Jessica Toonkel and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Jan 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is

as a possible successor to outgoing CEO Steve Ballmer, Bloomberg
cited sources briefed on the software giant's executive search

Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have discussed potential candidates ranging from
company insiders Satya Nadella and Tony Bates to several
outsiders. But speculation refocused on internal choices this
month after leading external candidate, Ford Motor Co CEO
Alan Mulally, took himself off the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters could not immediately verify Bloomberg's report, and
Ericsson was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined comment. A source close to the company

      Fitch: Walter Energy Analysis Reveals Potential Value, Headwinds
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the wake of a depressed coal market and collapsing earnings of coal 
      companies, Fitch Ratings conducted an analysis on one of the largest 
      pure-play North American metallurgical coal producers, Walter Energy 
      Inc. The report summarizes our view of the credit profile and highlights 
      critical issues surrounding the company's operations and focuses on the 
      company's response to a weak global metallurgical coal market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After a massive drop in hard coking coal benchmark prices from $235 per 
      tonne (/t) in the third quarter of 2012 to $172/t in the second quarter 
      of 2013, prices have continued to fall, at $143/t as of the first 
      quarter of 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite a slight increase in the fourth quarter of 2013, Fitch does not 
      expect a meaningful near-term rebound as demand is still feeble and 
      Australian supply is expanding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe Walter may struggle with upcoming covenant compliance and 
      2015 debt repayment without a material rebound in coal prices. Fitch 
      estimates a benchmark in at least the mid-$160s/t is needed for the 
      company to be free cash flow positive. Even then, it will have to 
      contend with the 8.0x senior secured leverage covenant in June 30, 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      That said, we believe potential value still exists. The company's value 
      is supported by its solid asset base of high-quality coal reserves. As 
      of the end of 2012, Walter had 358 million tonnes (mt) of proven coal 
      reserves, including 192 mt in Alabama, 40 mt in West Virginia and 124 mt 
      in Canada. The company has also been aggressive in its cost-cutting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Profiles Players such as BP Plc and ExxonMobil Corporation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ssnzbh/global_natural) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Natural Gas Industry" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The countries of North America constitute a very integrated and mature 
      market for natural gas. The North American natural gas market is almost 
      self-sufficient. The liberalization process in natural gas market 
      started as early as the seventies in Canada and United States, and they 
      are the countries who have gone furthest in opening the market to 
      competition. The reserves of natural gas in Western Europe are limited, 
      accounting for less than 5% of global resources. At present, the 
      European market is under structural changes resulting from the 
      liberalization process that is taking place. Main producing countries 
      are Netherlands, Norway and United Kingdom.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Natural gas accounts for almost a quarter of world's energy consumption 
      and its being brought into use considerably in the last 30 years. The 
      Russian Federation is the largest gas producing country and the world 
      leading exporting country. Natural gas is the predominant fuel in 
      Russia, accounting for nearly half of the country's domestic 
      consumption. It is followed closely by Iran. Other major producing 
      countries are Canada, United Kingdom, Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, 
      Netherlands, Norway and Uzbekistan. Most LNG trade takes place in 
      Asia-Pacific, with Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia as exporting 
      countries and Japan as the main importing country. Algeria and Qatar are 
      also major exporters of LNG.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Major players in the market are Saudi Arabian Oil Company, Gazprom, 
      National Iranian Oil Company, Petroleos de Venezuela.S.A., Sonatrach, 
      ExxonMobil Corporation, BP Plc, amongst others. As natural gas is 
      essentially irreplaceable (at least with current technology), it is 
      important to have an idea of how much natural gas is left in the ground 
      for us to use. However, this becomes complicated by the fact that no one 
      really knows exactly how much natural gas exists until it is extracted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The focus on the Global Natural Gas Industry explores this niche market 
      globally and focuses on the happenings of this industry. Analyzing the 
      global trends, the growth drivers, the strengths and weaknesses of this 
      industry, industry statistics and forecast, trends in natural gas 
      transportation and storage, import/export situation, etc. The report 
      covers the complete developments in the natural gas industry.

			Net 
      Element, Inc. (NASDAQ:NETE), a technology-driven group specializing 
      in mobile payments and value-added transactional services in emerging 
      countries and in the United States, is pleased to announce today that Aptito, 
      LLC (&#8220;Aptito&#8221;), has achieved Visa Ready status for their mPOS 
      solution. Aptito is a next generation, cloud-based point of sale 
      payments platform, operated through TOT Group, Inc. (&#8220;TOT&#8221;) the mobile

      The Visa Ready Partner Program is designed to provide innovators a path 
      to ensure that devices, software and solutions used to initiate or 
      accept Visa payments are compatible with Visa's requirements, which may 
      vary by country. It also provides a framework for the collaboration with 
      Visa, as well as guidance and best practices to access the power of the 
      Visa network. Mobile point-of-sale acceptance (mPOS) providers, mobile 
      NFC-enabled device manufacturers, as well as chip and platform providers 
      are among the stakeholders that are already playing a critical role in 
      enabling new ways to pay and that will benefit from the Visa Ready 
      Partner Program.

      any restaurant to deploy mobile ordering tied to the mPOS. Aptito&#8217;s Self 
      Ordering Apple&#174; iPad&#174;-based kiosk allows operators 
      to increase sales by providing an automated ordering system which gives 
      customers the speed and convenience that has been lacking in many areas 
      of food industry including Quick Service Restaurants (&#8220;QSR&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;

			New Sonus Session Border Controller Features Deliver Advanced Quality 
      of Experience, Simplified Management in Microsoft&#174; Lync&#174; Voice 
      Environments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Release 3.1 of Sonus SBC 1000 and SBC 2000 Session Border Controllers 
      Generally Available
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Key Takeaways:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Sonus is the first to natively enable Session Border Controllers 
        (SBCs) to conduct quality monitoring for an entire Microsoft Lync 
        call, allowing network engineers to proactively monitor and 
        troubleshoot quality of experience (QoE) issues for the whole call 
        flow.
      
			
        Sonus SBC 1000 and SBC 2000 Session Border Controllers are now 
        integrated into the Sonus Element Management System (EMS), delivering 
        one common network management solution across the complete Sonus SBC 
        product portfolio.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sonus 
      Networks, Inc. (Nasdaq: SONS), a global 
      leader in SIP communications, today introduced new software 
      enhancements to the Sonus SBC 1000 and SBC 2000 Session Border 
      Controllers, designed to help customers increase quality of experience 
      (QoE) in Microsoft Lync Enterprise Voice environments as well as easily 
      manage and scale enterprise Unified Communications (UC) networks. Sonus 
      helps enterprises optimize Microsoft Lync Enterprise Voice deployments 
      by securing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking services at the 
      network border and by providing a more seamless flow of SIP-based 
      multivendor media for UC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Accelerating the Pace for Microsoft Lync Integration
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft&#8217;s Quality of Experience (QoE) technology gives network 
      operators the ability to monitor and troubleshoot media quality for Lync 
      calls. Using diagnostics and statistics collected by the Lync Monitoring 
      Server, network operators can be alerted to abnormal media quality 
      conditions and can determine where call problems occurred.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Previously, SBCs did not report statistics for the entire call path to 
      the Lync Monitoring Server, leaving network operators with an incomplete 
      view of the total call flow. Sonus is the first company to natively 
      enable media quality monitoring for the entire Lync call, including the 
      SIP trunk portion. The SBC 1000 and SBC 2000 gather information about 
      delay, jitter and packet loss, enabling network engineers to proactively 
      monitor and troubleshoot call quality of experience issues for the 
      entire session.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While alternative providers offer their own monitoring tools, they 
      require network administrators in Lync environments to manage another 
      tool or pane of glass to implement, monitor and maintain. With Sonus, 
      having QoE integrated into the SBC can save customers both time and 
      money when managing Microsoft Lync voice environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sonus was the first vendor to wirelessly enable Microsoft Lync presence 
      survivability in the event of wide area network (WAN) loss. With Release 
      3.1, Sonus can now dynamically monitor available bandwidth over the 
      back-up link and direct calls over either the public switched telephone 
      network (PSTN) or, depending on bandwidth availability, a 3G/4G, digital 
      subscriber line (DSL) or other alternate connection.

			Simplified Unified Communications Management
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the rapid adoption of Lync and other advanced UC technologies, 
      management of communications networks is becoming increasingly complex. 
      Sonus simplifies network management for customers by bringing the SBC 
      1000 and SBC 2000 under the Sonus Element Management System (EMS), 
      delivering one solution across the complete Sonus SBC service provider 
      and enterprise portfolio. Inclusive of the Sonus SBC 5000 and SBC SWe 
      Session Border Controller series as well, Sonus customers can now 
      centrally manage the impact of communications on overall business 
      performance from the branch office to the data center, resulting in 
      reduced operating costs, better user experience, optimized investments 
      and maximized network performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For enterprises and managed service providers with their own management 
      applications, the SBC 1000 and SBC 2000&#8217;s representational state 
      transfer (REST) Web services application programming interface (API) 
      provides a complete provisioning and management interface &#8211; including 
      the SBC, network interface and Survivable Branch Appliance (SBA). Sonus 
      also offers a safe, lock-down configuration that can be shipped to the 
      customer site and plugged into the management network, automatically 
      enabling remote provisioning and management via the REST interface to 
      provide significant improvements in deployment times.

		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;For Lync Enterprise Voice it is essential to have integrated 
      insight into the quality of all media paths; real-time media hardware 
      without reported QoE is like driving a car without a dashboard. All 
      gateways, SBCs and IP phones designed for Lync should have native QoE 
      reporting into the Lync Monitoring Server,&#8221; said Matt Landis, industry 
      consultant and chief executive officer, Landis Computer. &#8220;QoE should be 
      a requirement for Microsoft Lync qualified SBCs, gateways or endpoints, 
      so it is good to see Sonus further its Lync-related innovation by 
      delivering this essential functionality in the SBC 1000 and SBC 2000 
      Session Border Controllers.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CiRBA&#8217;s Automated Capacity Control Now Supports Microsoft Hyper-V
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CiRBA Version 8 balances infrastructure supply and demand in 
      multi-hypervisor environments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CiRBA, 
      a leading provider of Automated Capacity Control software, today 
      announced the availability of CiRBA Version 8. With this release, CiRBA 
      adds support for Microsoft&#174; Hyper-V&#174; to its award-winning Control 
      Console, which enables organizations to maximize efficiency and minimize 
      risk in virtual and cloud infrastructure. This new capability is a key 
      addition to CiRBA&#8217;s already strong platform support, which includes 
      VMware&#174; ESX&#174;, IBM&#174; PowerVM&#174;, and Red Hat&#174; Enterprise Virtualization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Also now shipping in Version 8 is CiRBA&#8217;s new Reservation Console, 
      announced last fall, which automates the entire process of selecting the 
      optimal hosting environment for new workloads and reserving compute and 
      storage capacity. The Reservation Console combines with CiRBA&#8217;s 
      cross-platform support to enable CiRBA customers to automate &#8220;fit for 
      purpose&#8221; placements for new workloads across multi-hypervisor, 
      multi-SLA, multi-site virtual and cloud environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The shift toward cloud is placing less emphasis on the specific 
      hypervisor technology, and more on the capabilities it provides,&#8221; said 
      Andrew Hillier, CTO and co-Founder of CiRBA. &#8220;Having a scientific way to 
      make hosting decisions across all hypervisors and hosting platforms 
      really opens up the playing field, and allows organizations to focus on 
      the bigger picture of enterprise-level supply and demand.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Concerns about vendor lock-in and hypervisor costs are driving more and 
      more organizations toward multi-hypervisor adoption. In fact,&#160;according 
      to research by Torsten Volk of EMA, 82% of organizations plan to adopt 
      more than one hypervisor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multi-hypervisor adoption, particularly within private clouds, can 
      present a significant management challenge for organizations in 
      determining which workloads should be hosted on each respective 
      platform. In order to help combat the complexity, organizations need to 
      change how they make workload placement decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We currently leverage CiRBA from a cross-platform capacity control 
      perspective. As we seek to automate and more closely balance 
      infrastructure supply with the demands of the business, the capabilities 
      found in CiRBA Version 8, and specifically coverage of even more 
      hypervisor technologies, will be a welcome addition,&#8221; said Matt 
      McCarter, server engineering lead of McKesson Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CiRBA&#8217;s Hyper-V&#174; support spans the entire scope of CiRBA functionality. 
      Within the Control Console, organizations use it to achieve daily 
      operational control over VM placements, and create predictive, forward 
      looking views incorporating capacity reservations for new workloads 
      providing unmatched accuracy in forecasting requirements. Within the new 
      Reservation Console, the addition of Hyper-V&#174; can have a significant 
      impact on workload routing decisions, and clearly exposes the relative 
      advantages of different hypervisors from a cost and fit for purpose 
      perspective.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Organizations are keeping their options open, and our new release 
      removes a lot of the barriers that would prevent multiple hypervisors 
      and cloud technologies from being adopted,&#8221; continued Hillier. &#8220;We are 
      very excited to bring this new level of operational control and 
      automation to Hyper-V&#174; infrastructure, making it an even more viable 
      option.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - IBM Corp said it will invest more than $1.2 billion to build up to 15 new data centers across five continents to expand its cloud services and reach new clients and markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new cloud centers will be in Washington D.C., Mexico City, Dallas, China, Hong Kong, London, Japan, India and Canada, with plans to expand in the Middle East and Africa in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said the investment will bring up its data center count to 40 this year and double cloud capacity for SoftLayer, which leases online storage space to companies and was acquired by IBM last year for $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This global expansion is aimed at accelerating into new markets based on growing client demand for high-value cloud," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said the global cloud market is estimated to grow to $200 billion by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More companies are opting for cloud computing, which lets them rent computing power, storage and other services from data centers shared with other customers, which is typically cheaper and more flexible than maintaining their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also said it will use web hosting technology from SoftLayer for the delivery of its cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said since its acquisition of Dallas-based SoftLayer, the business has added 2,400 new clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bangalore and Nicola Leske in New York; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 16 (Reuters) - IBM Corp said it will invest more
than $1.2 billion to build up to 15 new data centers across five
continents to expand its cloud services and reach new clients
and markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new cloud centers will be in Washington D.C., Mexico

with plans to expand in the Middle East and Africa in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said the investment will bring up its data center count
to 40 this year and double cloud capacity for SoftLayer, which
leases online storage space to companies and was acquired by IBM
last year for $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This global expansion is aimed at accelerating into new
markets based on growing client demand for high-value cloud,"
the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said the global cloud market is estimated to grow to
$200 billion by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More companies are opting for cloud computing, which lets
them rent computing power, storage and other services from data
centers shared with other customers, which is typically cheaper
and more flexible than maintaining their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also said it will use web hosting technology from
SoftLayer for the delivery of its cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said since its acquisition of Dallas-based SoftLayer,
the business has added 2,400 new clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Citigroup Inc suffered a steep drop in bond trading revenue in the fourth quarter, a stinging blow for two banks long seen as stalwarts of fixed income markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two banks performed worse in fixed income than rivals JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Bank of America Corp, showing that even as bond market trading volume suffers from falling prices, some banks will endure more pain than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to be nimble to trade the debt markets these days. If you make a bad bet, it will show up in results, and profits will be harder to earn in 2014," said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager and banking analyst at Bahl &amp; Gaynor Investment Counsel, which manages about $11 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's profit fell 21 percent, as revenue from bond trading dropped 11 percent after adjusting for an accounting charge, it reported on Thursday. The bank's shares closed down 2 percent at $175.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, which also reported on Thursday, said bond trading revenue slid 15 percent in the fourth quarter to $2.33 billion in what it called a "challenging trading environment." Its shares fell 4.3 percent to $52.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading results for the two banks contrasted with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's, whose bond trading revenue rose 1 percent, and Bank of America Corp's, where it jumped 16 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, a bank's declining bond trading revenue can be a sign of discipline if markets are mispricing assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an analyst on a Goldman Sachs conference call asked about other banks evidently gaining ground in bond trading, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said, "(W)e're always going to prioritize the risk management over things like market share."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Chief Executive Michael Corbat noted that the bank had decided to take less risk in emerging markets as the Federal Reserve starts scaling back its bond buying stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our desks decided in latter parts of the year to de-risk," Corbat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the weak results in the fourth quarter could raise questions about why banks such as Goldman and Citigroup are not moving faster to prune their bond trading operations in areas including fixed income, currency, and commodities. The business is the target of many of the new regulations put in place after the financial crisis, including the Dodd-Frank financial reform law in the United States and Basel III global rules on capital and leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves are designed to make markets safer after Wall Street's excesses helped bring the financial system to the brink of collapse in 2007 and 2008. But they also cut into profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VERY COMFORTABLE" WITH FIXED INCOME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many fixed-income, currency and commodity trading businesses are complex and rely on large amounts of capital. For years, the operations supercharged Wall Street's profits as banks borrowed extensively and minimized the capital they had locked up in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its peak in 2009, for example, fixed income trading revenue accounted for 48 percent of Goldman's total revenue. In the fourth quarter of 2013, it was 25.3 percent, including accounting charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks see those declines as reason to make big changes to their fixed income businesses. Swiss banks UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG, under more pressure by their regulators, have taken the lead in paring down. UBS largely exited fixed income, while Credit Suisse has consolidated and exited operations to bring the number of product areas in its bond sales and trading unit to 80 from 120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others, such as Morgan Stanley, are relying more heavily on units such as wealth management for growth and as a source of steady revenues. That business is expected to be a bright spot for Morgan Stanley, when it reports fourth-quarter results on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But consultants and bankers said many on Wall Street are still refraining from cutting their trading operations. They are waiting to see which rivals scale back. For those that stay, they hope less competition makes bond trading profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman CFO Schwartz said on the conference call that the bank was "very comfortable" in fixed income, and hopes to benefit as competitors exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bond markets may be going through a soft patch, but they are hardly going away. Investors will demand fixed-income products for years to take care of a wide range of needs, including income for insurance companies and retirees, said Larry Fink, Chairman and Chief Executive of asset manager BlackRock Inc on a conference call Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIGHT SPOTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As fixed income trading comes under sustained pressure, other operations such as equities trading, and asset and wealth management, are helping to counter the headwinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its equities business, Goldman's revenue from client stock trading fell 22 percent to $598 million, even as stocks hit new highs. But equity underwriting revenue doubled to $622 million as more companies tapped the market for capital. Revenue from its own equity investments jumped 25 percent to $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market resurgence also helped Goldman's investment management business, which provides advisory services to wealthy clients and manages money through funds. Revenue increased 5 percent to $1.60 billion in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Citigroup, equity underwriting revenue rose 73 percent to $282 million, and merger advisory revenue rose 29 percent to $266 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's overall profit rose 21 percent, after adjusting for items, as it cut costs and dipped into funds set aside for bad loans, but the results missed analysts' estimates in large part because of weakness in the bond trading business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, BlackRock reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, benefiting from strong markets and a flow of new money into exchange-traded funds and its retail business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Paritosh Bansal; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Jeffrey Benkoe and Nick Zieminski)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) were hit hard by a sharp fall in bond trading revenues in the fourth quarter, a stinging blow for two banks long seen as stalwarts of fixed income markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two banks performed worse in fixed income than rivals JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp, (BAC.N) showing that even as bond market trading volume suffers from falling prices, some banks will endure more pain than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Softer markets are only the beginning of the trouble with trading bonds, which include fixed income, currency, and commodities products, at investment banks. Regulators are boosting capital requirements and making many derivatives markets more transparent for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves are designed to make markets safer after Wall Street's excesses helped bring the financial system to the brink of collapse in 2007 and 2008. But they also cut into profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's profit fell 21 percent, as revenue from fixed income trading dropped 11 percent after adjusting for an accounting charge, it reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, which also reported on Thursday, said fixed income revenue slid 15 percent to $2.33 billion in what it called a "challenging trading environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit at Citi, the third-largest U.S. bank, rose 21 percent, after adjusting for items, as it cut costs and released dipped into funds set aside for bad loans, but the results missed analysts' estimates in large part because of weakness in the bond trading business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At rival JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) bond trading revenue rose 1 percent, while at Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), it jumped 16 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares fell 2.3 percent to $174.65, while Citi was off 4.2 percent to $52.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many fixed-income, currency and commodity trading businesses are complex and rely on large amounts of capital. For years, the operations supercharged Wall Street's profits as banks borrowed extensively and minimized the capital they had locked up in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weak results in the fourth quarter could raise questions about why banks such as Goldman and Citigroup are not moving faster to prune their bond trading operations. The business is the target of many of the new regulations put in place after the financial crisis, including the Dodd-Frank financial reform law in the United States and Basel III global rules on capital and leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VERY COMFORTABLE" WITH FIXED INCOME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its peak in 2009, for example, fixed income trading revenue accounted for 48 percent of Goldman's total revenue. In the fourth quarter of 2013, it was 25.3 percent, including accounting charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Goldman's overall return on equity, which measures how much profit it wrung out of its balance sheet, was 11 percent for 2013, well below the 30 percent returns that the bank generated before the crisis despite some improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some banks are making big changes to fixed income. Swiss banks UBS AG (UBSN.VX)(UBS.N) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.VX)(CS.N), under more pressure by their regulators, have taken the lead in paring down. UBS largely exited the fixed income business, while Credit Suisse has consolidated and exited operations to bring the number of product areas in its bond sales and trading unit to 80 from 120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others such as Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are relying more heavily on businesses such as wealth management for growth and as a source of steady revenues. The unit is expected to be a bright spot for Morgan Stanley, when it reports fourth-quarter results on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But consultants and bankers said many on Wall Street are still holding out on cutting their fixed income businesses. They are waiting to see which rivals scale back. For those that stay, they hope less competition makes bond trading profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call with analysts, Goldman Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said the bank was "very comfortable" in fixed income, and hopes to benefit as competitors exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIGHT SPOTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As fixed income trading comes under sustained pressure, other operations such as equities trading, and asset and wealth management, are helping counter some of the headwinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its equities business, Goldman's revenue from client stock trading fell 22 percent to $598 million, even as stocks hit new highs. But equity underwriting revenue doubled to $622 million as more companies tapped the market for capital. Revenue from its own equity investments jumped 25 percent to $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market resurgence also helped Goldman's investment management business, which provides advisory services to wealthy clients and manages money through funds. Revenue increased 5 percent to $1.60 billion in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Citigroup, equity underwriting revenue rose 73 percent to $282 million, and merger advisory revenue rose 29 percent to $266 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world's largest money manager, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, benefiting from strong markets and a flow of new money into its exchange-traded funds and retail business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Paritosh Bansal, Editing by Dan Wilchins and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) reaffirmed its intent to remain in the commodities trading business, deeming it "too important" to clients to exit, a top executive said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank's restated determination to retain its vaunted J. Aron trading business, even as some rivals shed physical trading operations, comes one day after lawmakers at a U.S. Senate hearing pressed the Federal Reserve to quicken efforts to crack down on what they see as risky business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz told analysts on its fourth-quarter earnings conference call that Goldman sees "certainly no change in strategy" for its commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is just too important of a business for our clients," he said, reiterating comments last year from both Goldman President Gary Cohn and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, both alumni of J. Aron, the commodities trading operation that Goldman bought over three decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comment underscored the difficulty the Fed may face in trying to dislodge some banks from their involvement in trading physical commodities like oil and aluminum, which has deepened over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was an early participant in the physical commodities business through J. Aron. Its commodities activities are statutorily authorized by a clause grandfathered into the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which has tied the Fed's hands as it seeks to tighten limits on banks' commodities trading in the face of political and public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Louie Sussman in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Leff and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      With Card Data Security such a key component to the continued success of 
      today&#8217;s merchants, it&#8217;s vital for transaction processing systems to 
      maintain strict security levels and keep current on the compliance 
      requirements set by the Security Council that governs the Payments 
      Industry. eProcessing Network, LLC (ePN), the leading independent 
      payment gateway and software development company in the Electronic 
      Payment Processing Industry, understands the necessity, and announced 
      today that it has achieved Payment Application Data Security Standard 
      (PA-DSS) 2.0 certification from the PCI Council for its payment 
      application, ePNPlugIn for QuickBooks&#174;, an application 
      which allows merchants the ability to conduct real-time transaction 
      processing directly within the QuickBooks suite of products. In 
      addition, ePN received 2.0 certification for ePNJPOS, a Point of Sale 
      terminal application that allows merchants to accept payments from the 
      consumer and process via ePN&#8217;s Secure Payment Gateway.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      eProcessing Network has successfully met all of the comprehensive 
      requirements for 2.0 as detailed in the PA-DSS specifications and 
      enforced by card associations. The latest version of PA-DSS reflects the 
      growing maturity of standards as a strong framework for protecting 
      cardholder data and will help merchants manage evolving risks and 
      threats and improve overall flexibility with data. As a result of this 
      certification, the PCI Council has listed both applications on its

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a 21 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday as revenue from fixed-income trading fell in what Chief Executive Lloyd C. Blankfein described as "a somewhat challenging environment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank's bond trading revenue slid 11 percent, adjusted for an accounting charge, and was greater than those of competitors that have already posted fourth-quarter results. It is also a blow to a bank that counts bond trading, including fixed income, currency, and commodities, as one of its biggest businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman is still a big player in bond markets, fixed-income trading revenue fell to 25.3 percent of total revenue in 2013 from 48 percent at its peak in 2009, including accounting charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bond market began to soften in the middle of last year as investors prepared for the U.S. Federal Reserve to scale back on its bond-buying stimulus, and longer-term yields started rising. Trading income across Wall Street has been hurt by the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even accounting for the difficult environment, Goldman's bond-trading results lagged peers. Bank of America Corp's fixed-income trading revenue rose 16 percent in the fourth quarter to a level 10 percent higher than Goldman's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business has also been under pressure from new financial regulations, forcing many banks to re-evaluate which of the various fixed income, currencies and commodities units they should keep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call with analysts, Goldman executives said there appeared to be "excess capacity" across the industry in fixed-income staffing. They added that the bank was well-positioned to benefit if any rivals exit businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also said there was no change in the bank's strategy in commodities, as others such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Morgan Stanley pull back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also said it had created a "Volcker implementation team," made up of senior executives from its control and business operations. The team is working to make sure the bank is following the requirements of the rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule, required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, prohibits banks from making speculative bets with their own money and restricts their investments in certain funds. The rule was finalized in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you boil it all down, the 2013 environment is just one where the world took two steps forward followed by one step back, a dynamic which you could see reflected in both price movements in the markets, and client activity," Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said on a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To sum it up, while we wouldn't characterize the last two years as a normal cyclical environment ... it shouldn't be lost on us that the long-term trend is slowly and steadily improving," Schwartz added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's shares fell 2.1 percent to $174.92 in mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weak trading results had a real effect on results. On Thursday, Goldman reported net income for common shareholders fell to $2.25 billion, or $4.60 per share, in the fourth quarter, from $2.83 billion, or $5.60 per share, in the same quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expected earnings of $4.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding an accounting adjustment linked to changes in the value of debt the bank issued, Goldman's bond trading revenue fell 11 percent to $1.89 billion. Total revenue for the bank including the adjustment fell 5 percent to $8.78 billion from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of compensation and benefits rose 11 percent to $2.19 billion during the quarter, when Wall Street banks make final decisions about bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the year, compensation and benefits expenses fell 3 percent to $12.61 billion. Goldman paid out 36.9 percent of its revenue to employees in 2013, the lowest level since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its return on equity, which measures how much profit it wrung out of its balance sheet, was 11 percent for 2013, higher than the 10 percent minimum that analysts say banks must produce to meet their cost of capital, but well below the 30 percent returns that Goldman generated before the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIXED RESULTS FOR EQUITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's equity businesses turned in mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from client stock trading fell 22 percent to $598 million, even as stocks hit new highs, while equity underwriting revenue doubled to $622 million as more companies tapped the market for capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's own equity investments delivered a 25 percent increase in revenue to $1.40 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market resurgence also helped Goldman's investment management business, which provides advisory services to wealthy clients and manages money through funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business reported a 5 percent increase in revenue to $1.60 billion in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was ranked No. 1 in all major equity underwriting categories in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It led the high-profile initial public offering of Twitter Inc in the fourth quarter, which alone delivered an estimated $23 million in underwriting fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from advising on mergers and acquisitions rose 15 percent to $585 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall M activity declined in 2013, but there has been a resurgence in recent weeks. Other Wall Street banks have reported healthy backlogs of activity, signaling the business may be turning the corner after several years of decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anil D'Silva in Bangalore and Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Editing by Ted Kerr and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

on its bond-buying stimulus, and longer-term yields started
rising. Trading income across Wall Street has been hurt by the
move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even accounting for the difficult environment, Goldman's
bond-trading results lagged peers. Bank of America Corp's
 fixed-income trading revenue rose 16 percent in the
fourth quarter to a level 10 percent higher than Goldman's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business has also been under pressure from new financial
regulations, forcing many banks to re-evaluate which of the
various fixed income, currencies and commodities units they
should keep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call with analysts, Goldman executives said
there appeared to be "excess capacity" across the industry in
fixed-income staffing. They added that the bank was
well-positioned to benefit if any rivals exit businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also said there was no change in the bank's strategy in
commodities, as others such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and
Morgan Stanley pull back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also said it had created a "Volcker implementation
team," made up of senior executives from its control and
business operations. The team is working to make sure the bank
is following the requirements of the rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule, required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law,
prohibits banks from making speculative bets with their own
money and restricts their investments in certain funds. The rule
was finalized in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you boil it all down, the 2013 environment is just one
where the world took two steps forward followed by one step
back, a dynamic which you could see reflected in both price
movements in the markets, and client activity," Chief Financial
Officer Harvey Schwartz said on a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To sum it up, while we wouldn't characterize the last two
years as a normal cyclical environment ... it shouldn't be lost
on us that the long-term trend is slowly and steadily
improving," Schwartz added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's shares fell 2.1 percent to $174.92 in mid-day
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weak trading results had a real effect on results. On
Thursday, Goldman reported net income for common shareholders
fell to $2.25 billion, or $4.60 per share, in the fourth
quarter, from $2.83 billion, or $5.60 per share, in the same
quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expected earnings of $4.22 per share, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding an accounting adjustment linked to changes in the
value of debt the bank issued, Goldman's bond trading revenue
fell 11 percent to $1.89 billion. Total revenue for the bank
including the adjustment fell 5 percent to $8.78 billion from
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of compensation and benefits rose 11 percent to
$2.19 billion during the quarter, when Wall Street banks make
final decisions about bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the year, compensation and benefits expenses fell 3
percent to $12.61 billion. Goldman paid out 36.9 percent of its
revenue to employees in 2013, the lowest level since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its return on equity, which measures how much profit it
wrung out of its balance sheet, was 11 percent for 2013, higher
than the 10 percent minimum that analysts say banks must produce
to meet their cost of capital, but well below the 30 percent
returns that Goldman generated before the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIXED RESULTS FOR EQUITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's equity businesses turned in mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from client stock trading fell 22 percent to $598
million, even as stocks hit new highs, while equity underwriting
revenue doubled to $622 million as more companies tapped the
market for capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's own equity investments delivered a 25 percent
increase in revenue to $1.40 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market resurgence also helped Goldman's investment
management business, which provides advisory services to wealthy
clients and manages money through funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business reported a 5 percent increase in revenue to
$1.60 billion in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was ranked No. 1 in all major equity underwriting
categories in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It led the high-profile initial public offering of Twitter
Inc in the fourth quarter, which alone delivered an
estimated $23 million in underwriting fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from advising on mergers and acquisitions rose 15
percent to $585 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall M activity declined in 2013, but there has been a
resurgence in recent weeks. Other Wall Street banks have
reported healthy backlogs of activity, signaling the business
may be turning the corner after several years of decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Anil D'Silva and Lauren Tara LaCapra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a
21 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday as revenue from
fixed-income trading fell in what Chief Executive Lloyd C.
Blankfein described as "a somewhat challenging environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's bond trading revenue slid 11 percent, adjusted
for an accounting charge, and was greater than those of
competitors that have already posted fourth-quarter results. It
is also a blow to a bank that counts bond trading, including
fixed income, currency, and commodities, as one of its biggest
businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bond market began to soften in the middle of last year
as investors prepared for the U.S. Federal Reserve to scale back
on its bond-buying stimulus, and longer-term yields started
rising. Trading income across Wall Street has been hurt by the
move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even accounting for the difficult environment, Goldman's
bond-trading results lagged peers. Bank of America Corp's
 fixed-income trading revenue rose 16 percent in the
fourth quarter to a level 10 percent higher than Goldman's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bond trading had arguably been Goldman's strongest business
in the decade leading up to the financial crisis as it raked in
billions of dollars from the credit boom and bust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman is still a big player in bond markets,
fixed-income trading revenue fell to 25.3 percent of total
revenue in 2013 from 48 percent at its peak in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Goldman Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz
sounded cautiously optimistic about the long-term trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you boil it all down, the 2013 environment is just one
where the world took two steps forward followed by one step

			FINRA Bars J.P. Morgan Vice President and Broker Friend in Insider 
      Trading Scheme
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FINRA Previously Barred Westrock Advisors Broker for Failing to 
      Provide Testimony
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced today that 
      it has barred David Michael Gutman, a Vice President in the conflicts 
      office of J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC, and Christopher John Tyndall, a 
      former registered representative at Meyers Associates, L.P., from the 
      securities industry for their roles in an insider trading scheme. Gutman 
      and Tyndall were longtime close personal friends who grew up together on 
      Long Island. FINRA&#8217;s investigation found that Gutman improperly shared 
      material, non-public information&#160;with Tyndall during conversations that 
      took place between March 2006 to October 2007 regarding at least 15 
      pending corporate merger and acquisition transactions.&#160;Tyndall then used 
      the information to trade ahead of at least six of the corporate 
      announcements using personal and family accounts over nearly a two-year 
      period, and also recommended the stocks to his customers and friends. 
      Also in connection with its investigation, FINRA barred 
      a third broker, Joseph Critelli - also a friend of Tyndall and a 
      registered representative at Westrock Advisors, Inc. at the time - in 
      January 2013 for failing to appear for testimony related to his trading 
      activity in this scheme.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gutman learned about the pending merger transactions through his work in 
      J.P. Morgan&#8217;s conflicts office, which reviews all investment banking 
      transactions for potential conflicts of interest for the firm.&#160;The 
      inside information that Gutman improperly shared with Tyndall included 
      details surrounding the acquisitions of American Power Conversion 
      Corporation announced on October 30, 2006, Genesis HealthCare 
      Corporation announced on January 16, 2007, First Data Corporation 
      announced on April 2, 2007, SLM Corporation (Sallie Mae) announced on 
      April 13, 2007, Alliance Data Systems Corporation announced on May 17, 
      2007, and Cytyc Corporation announced on May 20, 2007.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cameron K. Funkhouser, Executive Vice President of FINRA&#8217;s Office of 
      Fraud Detection and Market Intelligence, said, "David Gutman had the 
      keys to the kingdom through his position at J.P. Morgan as a gatekeeper 
      with special access to material, non-public information.&#160;Gutman secretly 
      gave inside information to his longtime friend, Christopher Tyndall, who 
      exploited it for personal gain and passed it on to others. This case 
      demonstrates that attempts to conceal illicit activity may delay but 
      will not deter FINRA from ultimately uncovering the truth."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In concluding these settlements, Gutman and Tyndall neither admitted nor 
      denied the charges. Gutman consented to the entry of FINRA&#8217;s findings 
      that he violated NASD Rule 2110 in failing to comply with his obligation 
      to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable 
      principles of trade.&#160;Tyndall consented to the entry of FINRA&#8217;s findings 
      that he violated NASD Rules 2110 and 2120, and Section 10(b) of the 
      Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder for his role in the 
      scheme.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FINRA's investigation was jointly conducted by the Office of Fraud 
      Detection and Market Intelligence and the Department of Enforcement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      than 2012, due to strong net revenues in both equity and debt 
      underwriting. Net revenues in equity underwriting were significantly

      strong net revenues in equity underwriting. Net revenues in equity 
      underwriting were more than double the amount in the fourth quarter of 
      2012, reflecting an increase in client activity, particularly in initial 
      public offerings. Net revenues in debt underwriting were lower compared 
      with a strong fourth quarter of 2012, primarily reflecting lower net 
      revenues from investment-grade activity.

      Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution 
      were $8.65&#160;billion for 2013, 13% lower than 2012, reflecting 
      significantly lower net revenues in interest rate products compared with 
      a solid 2012, and significantly lower net revenues in mortgages compared 
      with a strong 2012. In addition, net revenues in currencies were 
      slightly lower, while net revenues in credit products and commodities 
      were essentially unchanged compared with 2012. Fixed Income, Currency 
      and Commodities Client Execution operated in a generally challenging 
      environment during much of 2013, as macroeconomic concerns and 
      uncertainty led to challenging market-making conditions and generally 
      lower levels of activity.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Net revenues in Equities were $7.07&#160;billion for 2013, 14% lower compared

      2012. Net revenues in equities client execution (excluding net revenues 
      from the firm&#8217;s Americas reinsurance business) were higher compared with 
      2012, including significantly higher net revenues in cash products, 
      partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in derivatives. 
      Commissions and fees were slightly higher compared with 2012. Securities 
      services net revenues were significantly lower compared with 2012, 
      primarily due to the sale of the firm&#8217;s hedge fund administration 
      business in 2012. During 2013, Equities operated in an environment 
      characterized by a significant increase in global equity prices,

      revenues in credit products, which include a gain on the sale of the 
      firm&#8217;s European insurance business, were higher compared with the fourth 
      quarter of 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2013, Fixed Income,

      of the firm&#8217;s Americas reinsurance business, and a decrease in 
      depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily reflecting lower 
      impairments and lower operating expenses related to consolidated 
      investments. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in 
      other expenses, due to higher net provisions for litigation and 
      regulatory proceedings, and higher brokerage, clearing, exchange and

      permanent benefits. The rate decreased from 33.3% for 2012 to 31.5% for

      uncertain and outside of the firm&#8217;s control. It is possible that the

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Statements about the firm&#8217;s investment banking transaction backlog also 
      may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject 
      to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that 
      they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any,

      possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors 
      that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a 
      transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting 
      transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic 
      conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities

          Assets under supervision (AUS) include assets under management and 
          other client assets. Assets under management include client assets 
          where the firm earns a fee for managing assets on a discretionary 
          basis. Other client assets include client assets invested with 
          third-party managers, private bank deposits and advisory 
          relationships where the firm earns a fee for advisory and other 
          services, but does not have investment discretion. Long-term AUS 
          represents AUS excluding liquidity products. Liquidity products 
          represents money markets and bank deposit assets.

            Tangible common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' 
            equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible 
            assets. Tangible book value per common share is computed by 
            dividing tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity by the number of 
            common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units 
            granted to employees with no future service requirements. 
            Management believes that tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity and 
            tangible book value per common share are meaningful because they 
            are measures that the firm and investors use to assess capital 
            adequacy. Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity and tangible book 
            value per common share are non-GAAP measures and may not be 
            comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. 
            The table below presents the reconciliation of total shareholders' 
            equity to tangible common shareholders' equity:

            The Tier&#160;1 capital ratio equals Tier&#160;1 capital divided by 
            risk-weighted assets (RWAs). The Tier&#160;1 common ratio equals Tier&#160;1 
            common capital divided by RWAs. As of December&#160;31,&#160;2013, Tier&#160;1 
            capital was $72.47&#160;billion and Tier&#160;1 common capital was 
            $63.25&#160;billion (Tier&#160;1 capital less $9.22&#160;billion of perpetual 
            non-cumulative preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to 
            trusts and other adjustments). The firm&#8217;s RWAs under the Board of 
            Governors of the Federal Reserve System&#8217;s risk-based capital 
            requirements were approximately $433&#160;billion as of 
            December&#160;31,&#160;2013, under Basel&#160;I and also reflecting the revised 
            market risk regulatory capital requirements which became effective 
            on January&#160;1,&#160;2013. Management believes that the Tier&#160;1 common 
            ratio is meaningful because it is one of the measures that the 
            firm, its regulators and investors use to assess capital adequacy. 
            The Tier&#160;1 common ratio is a non-GAAP measure and may not be 
            comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is considering Ericsson Chief Executive Hans Vestberg as a possible successor to outgoing CEO Steve Ballmer, Bloomberg reported, citing sources briefed on the software giant's executive search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic 48-year-old Swede fits the bill as a media-savvy technology fanatic, but his emergence as a leading candidate for the U.S. company will still come as a surprise to many on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vestberg, a former elite-level handball player, worked his way through the ranks at the world's largest mobile telecoms equipment maker, with stints in China, Brazil, Mexico and the United States en route to becoming chief financial officer before taking the top job in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he has struggled to convince investors that Ericsson can maintain its lead in mobile networks in the face of stiff competition from rivals such as China's Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Vestberg took the helm, the company's shares have underperformed the sector. Though the share price has risen 19 percent, in line with Microsoft, that compares with a leap of nearly 60 percent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Technology Index over the same period and a 41 percent rise for Sweden's blue-chip index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Microsoft and Ericsson declined to comment on Bloomberg's report, though a source close to the U.S. company has said that no CEO appointment is likely until the last week of January at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Microsoft might prefer a candidate with more experience in consumer products as it tries to take the fight to market leaders Apple and Samsung in handsets and tablets after its purchase of Nokia's mobile phone business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vestberg was in charge of Ericsson's exit from its handset joint venture with Sony two years ago, ending the company's association with consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it's very likely that they will choose Vestberg," said Bengt Nordstrom, head of Swedish telecoms consultancy Northstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more logical that they will find a U.S. leader, from their network of owners, board members and experienced CEOs with a software, enterprise and media background.

&lt;p&gt;* Swede Hans Vestberg would be surprise choice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Ericsson shares have underperformed sector&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* List of potential candidates is thin -sources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Edwin Chan and Sven Nordenstam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/STOCKHOLM, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp
 is considering Ericsson Chief Executive Hans
Vestberg as a possible successor to outgoing CEO Steve Ballmer,
Bloomberg reported, citing sources briefed on the software
giant's executive search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dynamic 48-year-old Swede fits the bill as a media-savvy
technology fanatic, but his emergence as a leading candidate for
the U.S. company will still come as a surprise to many on Wall
Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vestberg, a former elite-level handball player, worked his
way through the ranks at the world's largest mobile telecoms
equipment maker, with stints in China, Brazil, Mexico and the
United States en route to becoming chief financial officer
before taking the top job in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he has struggled to convince investors that Ericsson can
maintain its lead in mobile networks in the face of stiff
competition from rivals such as China's Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Vestberg took the helm, the company's shares have
underperformed the sector. Though the share price has risen 19
percent, in line with Microsoft, that compares with a leap of
nearly 60 percent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Technology Index

Bloomberg's report, though a source close to the U.S. company
has said that no CEO appointment is likely until the last week
of January at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Microsoft might prefer a candidate with more
experience in consumer products as it tries to take the fight to
market leaders Apple and Samsung in
handsets and tablets after its purchase of Nokia's 
mobile phone business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vestberg was in charge of Ericsson's exit from its handset
joint venture with Sony two years ago, ending the company's
association with consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it's very likely that they will choose
Vestberg," said Bengt Nordstrom, head of Swedish telecoms
consultancy Northstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more logical that they will find a U.S. leader, from

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several large U.S. banks have set aside extra money to pay for potential legal costs in part because of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's massive $13 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over bad mortgages, according to two sources familiar with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the JPMorgan settlement, which the government called the largest in U.S. history, led many banks to realize that the cost of resolving some of their own legal problems was likely to be higher than they had initially believed, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Department officials have said in public statements they want to use the JPMorgan settlement as a template for deals with other banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley all added hundreds of millions of dollars to funds they have set aside to pay for the cost of litigation, including legal fees, fines and settlements. All four banks are facing mortgage-related investigations by federal prosecutors located in different parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in such funds impacted the fourth quarter results of the banks published this week, surprising many analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total amount of the four banks' increases in litigation reserves could not be determined because the banks reported them in different formats. A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule says companies must only reserve funds for losses that are "probable and estimable," but does not require companies to disclose how the reserves match their specific expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen at all four banks declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additions to legal reserves show how cases related to practices that sometimes date back to before the financial crisis are likely to continue to cause pain to the U.S. banking industry. U.S. and European regulators fined banks record amounts last year, imposing penalties and settlements of more than $43 billion as authorities work more closely across borders to clean up the financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government's Residential Mortgage Backed Securities Working Group, a network of federal and state prosecutors and investigators set up in 2012, has been poring over records and testimony relating to residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). Many of these assets were stuffed with home loans that were badly underwritten and issued in the years leading up to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where the industry thought they were at the tail end of it there's reason to wonder whether there's a whole new round of broader suits that may be brought," said Joshua Rosner, a managing partner at Graham Fisher &amp; Co, an independent research consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said its net provisions for legal expenses in 2013 amounted to $962 million, up from the $448 million it reserved throughout 2012. Bank of America said it had added $2.3 billion to its reserves during the fourth quarter, up from $1.1 billion in the third quarter. Citi added $809 million in the fourth quarter after adding $677 million in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley added $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter to its litigation reserves, and specifically cited investigations "related to residential mortgage-backed securities and the credit crisis" as the motivation for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said in a conference call with analysts to discuss quarterly earnings that he expected the bank's legal expenses relating to its "legacy assets" would "remain elevated." Legacy assets include mortgage-backed securities that the bank packaged and sold before the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's driven by the higher level of litigation-related activity throughout the industry," Gerspach said on Thursday, adding that Citi's consideration of the landscape had included "things that you've seen hit the press as far as the industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Peter Rudegeair in New York and Aruna Viswanatha in Washington; editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

they want to use the JPMorgan settlement as a template for deals

of dollars to funds they have set aside to pay for the cost of

      Fitch: Goldman 4Q'13 Revenues Rebound From a Weak 3Q'13, But Flat on a 
      Full Year Basis
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s (Goldman) net revenues for fourth 
      quarter 2013 (4Q'13) were stronger for the quarter but flat for the full 
      year benefiting from an improvement in fixed income, currency and 
      commodities trading, following a weak 3Q'13, and strong investment 
      banking revenues. Results for 4Q'13 were dampened by elevated 
      non-compensation expenses primarily due to higher legal and regulatory 
      matters. Return on equity (ROE) of 11% for 2013 is below Goldman's 
      historical average but generally favorable relative to peers and their 
      cost of capital.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The firm reported quarterly net revenues of $8.8 billion, an increase of 
      31% from a weak 3Q'13, driven by higher client activity and slightly 
      improved macroeconomic conditions. On a full year basis, net revenues 
      remained flat at $34.2 billion. Full year 2013 net earnings of $8 
      billion were 8% higher than 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Compensation expenses continued to decline in 4Q'13, down 8% 
      sequentially, and represented 36.9% of net revenues for the year. 
      Non-compensation expenses, however increased 40% quarter over quarter 
      (QoQ) driven by higher provisions for legal (primarily mortgage-related) 
      and regulatory matters; and de minimis impairment charges. The increase 
      in litigation expenses is not unique to Goldman, and is an area Fitch is 
      watching for the industry, although Goldman's smaller mortgage 
      activities relative to banking peers suggest the impact may more limited.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For Institutional Client Services, net revenues (excluding DVA impact, 
      and the sale of the reinsurance and hedge fund businesses) increased 23% 
      sequentially, but were down slightly from 4Q'12. Fixed income improved 
      from a weak 3Q'13, supported by tighter credit spreads although market 
      activity was relatively subdued. For 2013, fixed income net revenues 
      (excluding DVA impact) were 13% lower than 2012, primarily due to 
      sharply lower net revenues in interest rate products and mortgages. 
      Equities increased 5% sequentially, and increased 12% from 4Q'12 
      (excluding the sale of Goldman's reinsurance business and hedge fund 
      businesses). Trading VaR declined modestly from the prior quarter and on 
      a full year basis, reflecting a lower contribution from interest rates 
      and currencies partially offset by a higher contribution from equity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investment banking revenues of $1.7 billion were 47% higher than 3Q'13 
      driven by a robust market for IPOs and increased MA activity. 
      Underwriting revenues were strong, with equities up more than two-fold 
      QoQ and year over year (YoY) due to higher client activity. Debt 
      underwriting revenues were up 9% from 3Q'13, however down 14% from 
      4Q'12. The backlog for investment banking remains strong and Goldman 
      should benefit from increased activity. On a full year basis, investment 
      banking revenues increased 22% to $6 billion. Total underwriting 
      revenues were a record $4 billion, due to positive momentum from both 
      debt and equity underwriting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investment and lending revenues increased significantly QoQ due to 
      mark-to-market gains in private equity investments and higher net 
      interest income on fixed income securities. Asset management revenues 
      were 31% higher than the prior quarter. Assets under supervision reached 
      a record high of $1.04 trillion, driven by substantial net inflows and 
      market appreciation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's liquidity profile remains solid with $184 billion (20% of 
      assets) of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. Over the 
      past several years, liquidity has been consistently maintained at 
      conservative levels, which is consistent with Goldman's current ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman estimated that its Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III 
      advanced approach was 9.8%, unchanged from the prior quarter. The ratio 
      continues to be above the 8.5% minimum and above Goldman's target of 
      9.5%. Goldman estimated that its supplementary leverage ratios (under 
      the Federal Reserve's methodology) were approximately 5% and 6% at the 
      holding company and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, respectively. Both continue 
      to be in line with proposed regulatory requirement. As part of Goldman's 
      share repurchase program, during 4Q'13 and full year 2013, $1.4 billion 
      and $6.2 billion of common shares were repurchased, respectively. Fitch 
      views this level of share repurchase activity as manageable given 
      current capital levels.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, January 17 (Fitch) The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s
(Goldman) net 
revenues for fourth quarter 2013 (4Q'13) were stronger for the
quarter but flat 
for the full year benefiting from an improvement in fixed
income, currency and 
commodities trading, following a weak 3Q'13, and strong 
investment banking 
revenues.  Results for 4Q'13 were dampened by elevated
non-compensation expenses 
primarily due to higher legal and regulatory matters.  Return on
equity (ROE) of 
11% for 2013 is below Goldman's historical average but generally
favorable 
relative to peers and their cost of capital.  
The firm reported quarterly net revenues of $8.8 billion, an
increase of 31% 
from a weak 3Q'13, driven by higher client activity and slightly
improved 
macroeconomic conditions.  On a full year basis, net revenues
remained flat at 
$34.2 billion. Full year 2013 net earnings of $8 billion were 8%
higher than 
2012.  
Compensation expenses continued to decline in 4Q'13, down 8%
sequentially, and 
represented 36.9% of net revenues for the year. Non-compensation
expenses, 
however increased 40% quarter over quarter (QoQ) driven by
higher provisions for 
legal (primarily mortgage-related) and regulatory matters; and
de minimis 
impairment charges. The increase in litigation expenses is not
unique to 
Goldman, and is an area Fitch is watching for the industry,
although Goldman's 
smaller mortgage activities relative to banking peers suggest
the impact may 
more limited. 
For Institutional Client Services, net revenues (excluding DVA
impact, and the 
sale of the reinsurance and hedge fund businesses) increased 23%
sequentially, 
but were down slightly from  4Q'12.  Fixed income improved from
a weak 3Q'13, 
supported by tighter credit spreads although market activity was
relatively 
subdued.  For 2013, fixed income net revenues (excluding DVA
impact) were 13% 
lower than 2012, primarily due to sharply lower net revenues in
interest rate 
products and mortgages.  Equities increased 5% sequentially, and
increased 12% 
from 4Q'12 (excluding the sale of Goldman's reinsurance business
and hedge fund 
businesses).  Trading VaR declined modestly from the prior
quarter and on a full 
year basis, reflecting a lower contribution from interest rates
and currencies 
partially offset by a higher contribution from equity. 
Investment banking revenues of $1.7 billion were 47% higher than
3Q'13 driven by 
a robust market for IPOs and increased M activity. 
Underwriting revenues were 
strong, with equities up more than two-fold QoQ and year over
year (YoY) due to 
higher client activity.  Debt underwriting revenues were up 9%
from 3Q'13, 
however down 14% from 4Q'12.  The backlog for investment banking
remains strong 
and Goldman should benefit from increased activity.  On a full
year basis, 
investment banking revenues increased 22% to $6 billion. Total
underwriting 
revenues were a record $4 billion, due to positive momentum from
both debt and 
equity underwriting.   
Investment and lending revenues increased significantly QoQ due
to 
mark-to-market gains in private equity investments and higher
net interest 
income on fixed income securities.  Asset management revenues
were 31% higher 
than the prior quarter.  Assets under supervision reached a
record high of $1.04 
trillion, driven by substantial net inflows and market
appreciation.
Goldman's liquidity profile remains solid with $184 billion (20%
of assets) of 
unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. Over the past
several years,

slipped on Friday, as declines in Intel and General Electric
more than offset a rally in American Express shares in the wake
of quarterly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Intel Corp slid 3.5 percent to $25.60 and
weighed on each of the three major U.S. stock indexes a day
after the chipmaker's fourth-quarter earnings missed
expectations by a penny due to weak spending on servers. Intel
gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Electric Co shares dropped 2.6 percent to
$26.49. The conglomerate reported a slightly
better-than-expected increase in revenue on Friday, propelled by
its businesses selling oil pumps and jet engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bucking the session's slight downtrend was American Express
Co, which reported quarterly results late on Thursday.
Its strong numbers also boosted its peer Visa. Both were
the top gainers in the Dow Jones industrial average, which
outperformed the S 500 and the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AmEx shares jumped 4.7 percent to $91.88. Visa gained 3.2
percent to $228.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As earnings continue to trickle in, analysts expect the
market to get more clarity on the strength of Corporate America
and look for leadership to define the next move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market was teased in a good way by some of the first
earnings, tempered later with disappointing numbers, and it's
trying to make a sense of what the quarter is going to be," said
John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds
Management in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley rose 4.3 percent to $33.38 after
previously hitting $33.52, its highest since November 2009. The
bank reported a sharp drop in quarterly profit as it was hit by
legal bills, but adjusted earnings beat estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.32 points, or
0.37 percent, to 16,478.33. The S 500 fell 3.17 points,
or 0.17 percent, to 1,842.72. The Nasdaq Composite 
declined 13.82 points, or 0.33 percent, to 4,204.87&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the S 500's 30 percent surge in 2013, largely due to
stimulus from the Federal Reserve, the benchmark index started
the year on a weak note. But the S 500 recovered recently to
set a record closing high on Wednesday. For the year, the S
500 is down about 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy, expected to show further signs of recovery as
the Fed slowly withdraws its stimulus, gave reassuring signs.
Data showed U.S. industrial output rose at its fastest clip in
3-1/2 years in the fourth quarter as factory activity closed out
the year on a strong note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monthly housing starts posted their largest percentage
decline since April, but were coming off a six-year high reached
in November, and the decline was smaller than economists had
expected. The PHLX housing sector index lost 1.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary
reading on the consumer sentiment index slipped to 80.4 from
82.5 in December, weighed by lowered expectations among lower-
and middle-income families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Transportation Average dipped 0.2
percent, dragged down by a 1.1 percent drop in UPS Inc 
to $99.34 and a 2.5 percent decline in Con-Way to $40.37
after fourth-quarter outlooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NII Holdings jumped 19.6 percent to $2.87 after the
company said it had reached a deal to bring Apple's 
iPhone to its Nextel operation in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S.-traded shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev fell 1.9
percent to $101.52 after Reuters reported that the brewing giant
is in advanced discussions to buy South Korea's Oriental Brewery
from private equity owners KKR and Affinity Equity
Partners for more than $4.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan 17 (Reuters) - Australia's Macquarie Bank said
on Friday that it had not concluded a deal to buy the uranium
trading desk of Goldman Sachs after two trade sources
said that the transaction had been agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Macquarie denies the deal has been done," a spokesperson
for the Australian investment bank in London said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman put its uranium desk up for sale late last year. The
U.S. bank acquired the desk in 2009 as part of a deal to buy the
London-based trading operation of Constellation Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macquarie, which is expanding its commodity trading
operations, has emerged as the main candidate to buy the uranium
desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand that Goldman have sold their uranium business
to Macquarie," a senior trading source said, asking not to be
identified. A second trading source said the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian investment bank is also still in the running
to buy JPMorgan's physical commodity trading operations
competing with two other firms, trading house Mercuria and
private equity firm Blackstone, according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquiring JPMorgan's physical commodity business would
propel Macquarie into the top ranks of natural resources traders
among banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's role in physical commodity trading has come
under intense pressure in the last six months, as politicians in
the United States question whether banks back-stopped by the
government are taking undue risks by dealing in tankers of oil
and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, another Wall Street heavyweight, in December
announced a deal with Russian oil major Rosneft, which
is taking on the majority of the bank's physical oil trading
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uranium aside, Goldman has stood out amongst the top-tier
U.S. banks in commodities by saying it plans to continue to
operate in physical commodity markets as this is necessary to
support its clients in operations such as hedging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman held around $200 million worth of low-grade uranium
stocks late last year as part of its trading operation,
according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also has a marketing arrangement with AngloGold
Ashanti, South Africa's largest uranium producer, to

&lt;p&gt;Jan 17 (Reuters) - Australia's Macquarie Bank 
denied on Friday that it had bought the uranium trading desk of
Goldman Sachs after two trade sources said that the deal
had been completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Macquarie denies the deal has been done," a spokesperson
for the Australian investment bank in London said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman put its uranium desk up for sale late last year. The
U.S. bank acquired the uranium desk in 2009 as part of a deal to
buy the London-based trading operation of Constellation Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. investment bank held around $200 million worth of
low-grade uranium stocks late last year as part of its trading
operation, according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also has a marketing arrangement with AngloGold
Ashanti, South Africa's largest uranium producer, to
sell the uranium it produces as a by-product of its gold mining
activities.&lt;/p&gt;

			Statement from Pfizer Chief Medical Officer on the 50th Anniversary 
      of the First Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., Pfizer&#8217;s executive vice president and chief 
      medical officer, today issued a statement regarding the 50th Anniversary 
      of the First Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Fifty years ago, the United States Surgeon General issued a report that 
      increased the public&#8217;s understanding of the severe health risks of 
      smoking. I&#8217;m pleased that the Surgeon General&#8217;s report brought the 
      health risks of smoking to light and has helped create a major public 
      health effort on the part of governments, healthcare providers, 
      legislators and advocates, and that the Surgeon General and many others 
      continue to support this effort today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. The World 
      Health Organization estimates that tobacco use is the cause of death of 
      up to 6 million people every year, of whom more than 5 million are 
      direct tobacco users and more than 600,000 are nonsmokers exposed to 
      second-hand smoke.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;One of the best ways to prevent serious health problems such as 
      cardiovascular disease and cancer is to live tobacco-free. Pfizer is 
      determined to help solve the global tobacco epidemic by supporting 
      comprehensive tobacco control measures to help prevent the development 
      of future generations of smokers, and encourage smokers to quit smoking.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has been quietly moving thousands of jobs from pricey places like New York and London to cheaper cities like Salt Lake City in recent years, and executives said on Thursday those efforts are finally starting to show up in the bank's results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman posted a profit of $2.25 billion in the fourth quarter on Thursday, as lower compensation costs helped blunt some of the impact of weaker bond trading revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average pay per Goldman employee was $383,374 last year, down 4 percent from last year and less than two-thirds pre-crisis levels. Further, less of the bank's revenue is getting paid to employees: about 37 percent in 2013, down from some 38 percent in 2012 and almost half in 2008. That ratio is among the lowest in the bank's history as a public company, and it is possibly because of staff being moved, executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank added a net of 500 employees to its payroll of 32,900 in 2013, but it added many more than that to lower-cost cities and cut staffing in higher-cost cities, they said. Besides Salt Lake City, Goldman has also built staffing in cities like Dallas and Bangalore, India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been covering this company for 10 years, and I can't remember the last time they were cutting compensation at this level," said Tom Jalics, a senior investment analyst at Key Private Bank, whose clients own Goldman shares. "They're really ratcheting them down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting compensation costs is vital in a post-crisis world where intense regulation and less trading activity are weighing on revenue. At the same time, it also shows how Goldman employees, who have long been regarded as kings of Wall Street, may be losing power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With fewer dollars going into employees' pockets, more money goes to the bottom line. Goldman's revenue barely changed last year, meaning that if the bank had not reduced expenses, its profits would likely have been flat instead of up 6 percent for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're responding to revenue pressures in the business," said Frederick Cannon, a bank analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. "Goldman's making adjustments to ensure they remain profitable while revenues are under pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the growth in Goldman's far-flung offices has been driven by new rules and penalties that are forcing banks to staff up in compliance, legal and regulatory functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Goldman had only a handful of employees in Salt Lake City. Now it has about 1,800 employees, with nine of the bank's 11 divisions represented there, in functions ranging from research and credit analysis to trade settlement and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 30 people with global responsibilities are now based in the state capital of Utah, including a compliance team headed by Matthew Moore, a managing director who oversees regulatory audits and inquiries. A credit research team of more than 60 people who perform reviews of Goldman's counterparties is also based in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGH VALUE OR LOW COST?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The migration of jobs to lower-cost centers has created some tension between employees in New York and Salt Lake City, who get paid different amounts for similar jobs and are often culturally at odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New hires in Salt Lake City cost 30 percent less, on average, than employees in the same roles in New York, according to a consultant who has helped grow Goldman's Utah operation but was not authorized to talk to the press. A Goldman employee fresh out of college in Salt Lake City, for example, might earn about $45,754 a year, on average, while those in New York earn about $67,334, according to jobs website Glassdoor.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of living in Salt Lake is also lower: The median home value there is $256,800, while the median home value in New York is $502,600, according to a home value index from the real estate website Zillow.com. The site's rent index shows Salt Lake City at $1,337 per month, compared with $2,128 per month in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One former Salt Lake City employee recalled visits from senior executives touring the office that were filled with awkward banter about skiing or the Mormon religion, and an emphasis on how important the office was because of how cheap it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They call us 'high value,' but what they really mean is 'low cost'," said the employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank's senior executives are pleased with how their experiment in Salt Lake City is progressing, and hopeful that they can build it up further. Some believe that the bank can do a good deal more in Utah than it had originally conceived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman plans to add at least another 200 Salt Lake City employees in the near term, and is rethinking which jobs can move to places like Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Salt Lake City is becoming huge," said one person familiar with the bank's thinking. Other lower-cost offices are growing too, but the rate of growth could not be learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also working as an effective bogeyman to scare bankers that are early in their careers, an insider said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late at night, when junior bankers in New York complain about the long and grueling hours, they are jokingly reminded that their job can be moved to Salt Lake City, where people will happily pick up the slack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And suddenly, the whining stops, the insider said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dan Wilchins)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan 17 (Reuters) - Australia's Macquarie Bank said
on Friday that it had not concluded a deal to buy the uranium
trading desk of Goldman Sachs after two trade sources
said that the transaction had been agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Macquarie denies the deal has been done," a spokesperson
for the Australian investment bank in London said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman put its uranium desk up for sale late last year. The
U.S. bank acquired the desk in 2009 as part of a deal to buy the
London-based trading operation of Constellation Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macquarie, which is expanding its commodity trading
operations, has emerged as the main candidate to buy the uranium
desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand that Goldman have sold their uranium business
to Macquarie," a senior trading source said, asking not to be
identified. A second trading source said the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian investment bank is also still in the running
to buy JPMorgan's physical commodity trading operations
competing with two other firms, trading house Mercuria and
private equity firm Blackstone, according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquiring JPMorgan's physical commodity business would
propel Macquarie into the top ranks of natural resources traders
among banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's role in physical commodity trading has come
under intense pressure in the last six months, as politicians in
the United States question whether banks back-stopped by the
government are taking undue risks by dealing in tankers of oil
and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, another Wall Street heavyweight, in December
announced a deal with Russian oil major Rosneft, which
is taking on the majority of the bank's physical oil trading
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uranium aside, Goldman has stood out amongst the top-tier
U.S. banks in commodities by saying it plans to continue to
operate in physical commodity markets as this is necessary to
support its clients in operations such as hedging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman held around $200 million worth of low-grade uranium
stocks late last year as part of its trading operation,
according to industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also has a marketing arrangement with AngloGold
Ashanti, South Africa's largest uranium producer, to
sell the uranium it produces as a by-product of its gold mining
activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, Jan 20 (IFR) - JP Morgan has ceased working on
the proposed US$1bn IPO of Jinzhou-based Tianhe Chemicals amid
an ongoing investigation into its hiring practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank walked away after managers raised concerns over the
employment of Joyce Wei, the daughter of Tianhe chairman Qi Wei,
according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wei worked in the bank's corporate finance group and has
recently left for a European investment bank, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan had been discussing an overseas listing with
privately-owned Tianhe since at least 2011, when IFR first
reported that the chemical company planned to list in London. It
is not clear whether Tianhe signed any formal letter of
engagement before or after Wei joined the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan declined to comment. Joyce Wei, Qi Wei and Tianhe
Chemicals could not immediately be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While news of the exit does not suggest any wrongdoing, the
decision to pass over a major overseas listing of a privately
owned Chinese company underlines the bank's determination to
avoid attracting further suspicion at a time when its hiring
policies are under regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes only months after JP Morgan walked away from the
Hong Kong IPO of China Everbright Bank, a mid-sized Chinese
lender, following reports that US authorities had opened a
bribery investigation related to its hiring of the children of
powerful Chinese officials, often referred to as "princelings".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times in August reported that JP Morgan had won
several mandates from China Everbright Group after it hired Tang
Xiaoning, the son of Tang Shuangning, Everbright Group chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEB went on to raise HK$24.9bn (US$3.2bn) from its Hong Kong
share sale, the largest float in the city in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA FRANCHISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite losing out on the CEB deal, JP Morgan still ranked
fourth in China's equity and equity-linked league table in 2013,
according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, rivals are questioning the impact of the bank's
cautious policy on its China franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We heard the bank has been avoiding deals related to the
China railway sector, and hence it's not actively pitching for
the China CNR and China Railway Materials transactions," said a
banker at a rival bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC was also probing JP Morgan's hiring of Zhang Xixi,
the daughter of a now-disgraced Chinese of the Ministry of
Railways, the New York Times reported in its August article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai-listed China CNR Corp, one of China's biggest
train-makers, plans to raise about US$1.5bn in a Hong Kong float
this year. China Railway Materials, meanwhile, is looking at a
US$1bn deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tianhe had picked Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup,
JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley to arrange its London IPO, IFR
reported in July 2011. After wavering between a London and Hong
Kong float, the company is now focusing on Hong Kong and is
reshuffling its syndicate, according to two other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tianhe, which supplies grease to refiners including China
Petroleum and PetroChina, plans to raise about US$1bn in the
second quarter of the year at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS are at a good position
to win a leading role in the transaction, according to a source.
Morgan Stanley, through its private equity arm, made a US$300m
investment in Tianhe in March 2012.

				&#160;
				
				hand it off to development? Typically, development is manually contacted without the key
			
			
				
				&#160;
				
				information needed to recreate and resolve the problem. The manual sharing of information&#160;
			
			
				
				&#160;
				
				can prolong resolution time and increase application backlogs, both of which can be&#160;
			
			
				
				&#160;
				
				detrimental to the business. This is especially critical because technology failures are

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks mostly rose on Tuesday, with the S 500 snapping a two-session decline as the materials sector rallied, though the Dow fell on disappointing earnings by three of its components.&lt;/p&gt;

      "We continued to drive strong results across much of our portfolio and 
      again grew earnings per share in 2013. While we made solid progress in 
      businesses that are powering our future, in view of the company&#8217;s

      cash flow of $15.0 billion excluding Global Financing receivables, down 
      approximately $3.2 billion year over year. The company returned $17.9 
      billion to shareholders through $4.1 billion in dividends and $13.9

			Presentation of Information in this Press Release
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding 
      the company&#8217;s results as determined by generally accepted accounting 
      principles (GAAP), the company has also disclosed in this press release 
      the following non-GAAP information which management believes provides 
      useful information to investors:
    &lt;/p&gt;

      IBM results and expectations &#8211;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        presenting operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share amounts and related 
        income statement items;
      
			
        presenting non-global financing debt-to-capitalization ratio;
      
			
        adjusting for free cash flow;
      
			
        adjusting for currency (i.e., at constant currency);
      
			
        adjusting for workforce rebalancing.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rationale for management&#8217;s use of non-GAAP measures is included as 
      part of the supplementary materials presented within the fourth-quarter 
      earnings materials. These materials are available on the IBM investor 
      relations Web site at www.ibm.com/investor

		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global SaaS-based Expense Management market to grow at a CAGR of 
      19.20 percent over the period 2013-2018.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the need to 
      reduce expenses and operational costs. The Global SaaS-based Expense 
      Management market has also been witnessing the increased adoption of 
      end-to-end expense management solutions. However, the concern over data 
      security could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      End-to-end expense management solutions automate all components of 
      expense management processes such as travel booking, expense reporting, 
      employee reimbursement, and expense analysis. Thus, these automated 
      end-to-end processes cover the whole span of the expense-related 
      process, from travel booking plans to reporting and payments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      End-to-end expense management solutions allow the expense manager to 
      have greater control and reduce reporting errors. In addition, this 
      speeds up the process and improves the operational efficiency of the 
      company. With an end-to-end expense management solution in place, 
      companies can significantly lower their expense processing cost compared 
      to companies that do not use any such solution. In addition, end-to-end 
      solutions accelerate the process of reporting expenses, thus providing 
      cost benefits. Hence, to cater to the increasing demand, many vendors 
      are now offering end-to-end expense management solutions that not only 
      have the capability to track expenses, but can also perform historical 
      spend analysis, predictive analysis, and other similar functions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the concern over data security. In a SaaS-based model, there 
      is always a risk of information leakage, which could result in the 
      misuse or manipulation of organizational expense data. Concerns about 
      data security can be a significant barrier for deploying SaaS-based 
      expense management solutions. Also, placing a company's asset 
      information on a digital platform is a major concern unless security 
      mechanisms can be implemented and trusted by the enterprises.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Lenovo Group Ltd has resumed talks to buy International Business Machines Corp's (IBM) low-end server unit, a source familiar with the matter said, a purchase that would bolster its efforts to diversify beyond a shrinking PC market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal for IBM's x86 servers, which power corporate data centers, fits in with Lenovo's attempts to remold itself as a growing force in mobile devices and data storage servers. It also helps IBM's shift away from hardware towards software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies failed to reach an agreement last year after differing on pricing. Media reports then put IBM's hopes at between $4 billion to $6 billion for the unit, while Lenovo was said to be only willing to offer $2.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts now estimate the sale of the IBM unit to Lenovo could be worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. That would make it the biggest ever deal in China's IT sector, outpacing Badu Inc's acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc for $1.85 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody wins because even if IBM could double the profitability it's still not good enough for IBM. On the other hand, Lenovo doubling the server business margins is a good deal for Lenovo," said Alberto Moel, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo, the world's biggest PC maker, said on Tuesday it was in preliminary talks about an acquisition. It declined to name the seller but said it was making the statement in response to reports about its potential acquisition of a server business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that it had not entered into any definitive agreement and that no material terms had been agreed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IBM spokesman said on Monday the company wouldn't comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell Inc, which went private in a $25 billion deal last year, has also been cited in media reports as a potential suitor for the business. A Beijing-based spokesman for Dell declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EAGER SELLER, FLUSH BUYER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo's purchase of IBM's Thinkpad PC business in 2005 for $1.75 billion became the springboard for its leap to the top of global PC maker rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moel, who estimates IBM's low-end server business could be worth between $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion, said IBM was likely more eager now to do a deal than last year after several quarters of weak earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But any deal would also likely invite scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) as servers were more directly related to data security than PCs and phones, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo could finance the deal through a combination of cash, debt and converts, said Nicolas Baratte, a Hong Kong-based analyst with brokerage CLSA. The company has $3 billion in cash, and very little debt, and IBM is a very willing seller, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If IBM sells all its server business, except the top-end servers, the deal is worth $2.5 to $3 billion," Baratte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no financing problem for $3 billion, but I don't think it will be one hundred percent cash."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Lenovo, which has a market value of $13.7 billion, closed up 2.75 percent at HK$10.46 on Tuesday, while the benchmark Hong Kong share index was up 0.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its shares have surged 12 percent this year, and earlier this month marked their highest level in more than 13 years after an IDC report showed it managed to boost PC shipments 9 percent in the fourth quarter while industry shipments slid 5.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is due to report fourth-quarter earnings later on Tuesday. In the previous quarter, revenue missed expectations, hit by a 40 percent drop in China hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ryan Vlastelica, Devika Krishna Kumar, Paul Carsten, Donny Kwok and Denny Thomas; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Miral Fahmy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: Global Managed Security Services Market 2012-2016 
      with ATT Inc., Dell SecureWorks Inc., IBM Corp., and Symantec Corp 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/bpphml/global_managed) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Managed Security Services Market 2012-2016" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Managed Security Services market to 
      grow at a CAGR of 9.05 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key 
      factors contributing to this market growth is the need to increase the 
      quality of protection. The Global Managed Security Services market has 
      also been witnessing an increasing demand for cloud-based services. 
      However, high implementation costs could pose a challenge to the growth 
      of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this space include ATT Inc., Dell 
      SecureWorks Inc., IBM Corp., and Symantec Corp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other vendors mentioned in this report are Bell Canada Inc., BT 
      Global Services Ltd., CentraComm Communications Ltd, CGI Group Inc., 
      Computer Sciences Corporation, FishNet Consulting Inc., Fujitsu Ltd., 
      Getronics USA Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Integralis AG, Lockheed Martin 
      Corp., Solutionary Inc., Tata Communications Ltd., Trustwave Holdings 
      Inc., VeriSign Inc., Verizon Communication Inc., and Wipro Technology 
      Services Ltd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: Given the 
      several advantages of adopting cloud services, such as lower cost and 
      ease of installation and operations, SMEs prefer cloud services over 
      other security service offerings. Further, even large enterprises that 
      are already using CPE-based managed security services are switching to 
      the cloud model. Thus, seeing the increasing demand and popularity of 
      cloud-based offerings, many vendors in the Global Managed Security 
      Services market are offering cloud-based services. For example, 
      specialized cloud service providers such as MessageLabs (part of 
      Symantec), Postini (acquired by Google), and Zscaler provide 
      in-the-cloud security.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report also includes a discussion of the other vendors operating in 
      this market. The other vendors in the market are Verizon, Solutionary, 
      HP Corp., CSC, Bell Canada Inc., BT Global Services Ltd., and Trustwave.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Software suite adds contact center features to Lync Server for an 
      improved customer experience, enhanced collaboration, and simplified 
      deployment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interactive Intelligence Group Inc.&#8217;s (Nasdaq: ININ) all-in-one IP 
      communications software suite, Customer Interaction Center&#8482; 
      (CIC) version 4.0, has achieved Lync 2013 Qualification in the contact 
      center category, which demonstrates interoperability with Microsoft&#174; 
      Lync&#8482; Server 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The combined solution adds CIC&#8217;s wealth of contact center features to 
      Lync Server 2013 for an improved customer experience, enhanced 
      collaboration, and simplified deployment. Key features include the 
      following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Common CIC and Lync Server directory. Users on either system 
        can access employee contact information from within a single interface 
        and collaborate via IM, video, voice call, email, fax, or desktop 
        sharing.
      
			
				Synchronized presence. Real-time presence management shows the 
        status of employees across both systems, thus eliminating blind 
        transfers and reducing hold times.
      
			
				Direct SIP integration. Standards-based communications protocol 
        enables &#8220;click-to-call&#8221;, speeds deployment time, and eliminates the 
        need for third-party gateways for reduced costs.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Passing Lync Server interoperability testing means we offer customers a 
      combined solution that meets stringent requirements for installation, 
      configuration, documentation and support,&#8221; said Interactive Intelligence 
      senior director of global alliances, Michael Shrall. &#8220;Our paired 
      offering delivers a comprehensive solution for both the contact center 
      and the enterprise without customers undergoing costly and 
      time-consuming integration projects.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Microsoft interoperability testing is part of its Lync ISV 
      Qualification program, which helps ensure that qualified applications 
      meet customer expectations for specific scenarios. Testing covers 
      performance, reliability and SDK/API utilization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CIC, which can be deployed via the cloud or on-premises, gives 
      organizations of all sizes multichannel contact center, unified 
      communications, and business process automation functionality.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CIC applications include multichannel routing and queuing, interactive 
      voice response, call and screen recording, predictive dialing, workforce 
      management, real-time speech analytics, customer feedback management, 
      and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interactive Intelligence first received Lync Qualification for 
      interoperability in 2010. The company has been a Microsoft Gold ISV 
      partner since 2007.

			Skillsoft and IBM Research Collaborate to Harness Big Data in 
      Enterprise Learning
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Big data to drive next generation adaptive learning and integrated 
      development for improved user engagement and learning outcomes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Skillsoft 
      today announced a multi-phase joint development agreement with IBM 
      (NYSE: IBM) to leverage the power of big data in enterprise learning. 
      The goal of this collaboration is the development of an enhanced 
      adaptive learning experience for users with a focus on productive 
      data-driven learning outcomes. By combining IBM Research&#8217;s unrivaled big 
      data and customer experience analytics capabilities with content 
      interaction data from Skillsoft&#8217;s 50,000+ learning assets, new methods 
      of creating and assessing optimal learning experiences at an individual 
      level are possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Skillsoft is a pioneer in the field of technology-delivered learning 
      with a long history of innovation and delivering solutions for its 
      customers worldwide, ranging from global enterprises, government, and 
      education to mid-sized and small businesses. As the data analytics 
      market continues to experience exponential growth, companies seek new 
      ways to maximize performance using big data technology and analysis. In 
      2013, Gartner reported that 64 
      percent of organizations invested or planned to invest in big data 
      technology, a continual increase from previous years. The corporate 
      learning market provides an ideal application area for big data 
      analytics. As organizations continue to offer more online learning to 
      their employees, they need to analyze which learning experiences are the 
      most productive and apply that knowledge to continually improve business 
      outcomes. This combination of business need, data and technology 
      presents an industry landscape that is ripe for capitalizing on the full 
      value of what big data and analytics can bring.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Big data has the opportunity to transform corporate learning outcomes,&#8221; 
      said Anshul Sheopuri, Manager and IBM Master Inventor, IBM Research. &#8220;We 
      are pleased to work with Skillsoft to create new enterprise 
      learning-based big data techniques that will drive personalized user 
      interaction resulting in improved engagement. Our initial findings show 
      insights that can make the learning experience customized to users&#8217; 
      preferences and drive next generation adaptive learning and integrated 
      development.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first phase of the initiative not only identified the key drivers of 
      engagement but also demonstrated their connection to improved learning 
      outcomes for users as well as significant business benefits to 
      Skillsoft. In the second phase, the focus is on realizing these outcomes 
      by piloting and then deploying the big data models that are being 
      developed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are thrilled to explore new ways of leveraging data to boost 
      learning outcomes,&#8221; said John Ambrose, Senior Vice President, Strategy, 
      Corporate Development and Emerging Business, Skillsoft. &#8220;With IBM&#8217;s 
      research scientists and technology, we now have the ability to 
      holistically look at content interaction data and understand trends in 
      user interactions and drivers of engagement. Together, we look forward 
      to further harnessing the power of big data to define a more 
      personalized, adaptive enterprise learning experience.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first phase of the research initiative is complete. Skillsoft and 
      IBM will release future insights of data analysis and relevant findings 
      as the agreement progresses.

			Chase and Google Announce $3 Million in Grants and Trip to Google for 
      12 Small Businesses through the Mission Main Street&#8482; Grants Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chase and Google today announced twelve small businesses chosen to each 
      receive a $250,000 grant through Mission 
      Main Street Grants, a program that gives small businesses across the 
      nation the opportunity to receive a share of $3 million in grants from 
      Chase. In addition to the Chase grants, Google will host each business 
      for a marketing workshop at Google headquarters in California.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chase serves more than 4 million American small businesses, so we have 
      a first-hand appreciation of the important role they play in communities 
      across the country,&#8221; said Chase Business Banking CEO Scott Geller. &#8220;We 
      hope these twelve exceptional businesses take their innovative products 
      and creative approaches to new heights through their Mission Main Street 
      grant.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nearly 35,000 small businesses from all 50 states submitted applications 
      for consideration to receive a $250,000 grant from Chase and a trip to 
      Google headquarters. More than 1.7 million people showed their support 
      for those participating businesses by voting on MissionMainStreetGrants.com. 
      Applications submitted by businesses that received at least 250 votes 
      were eligible to continue onto the judging phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following twelve small businesses were chosen by a panel of experts 
      for their superiority in demonstrating a solid business plan, feasible 
      growth plan, overall passion for their business, the potential to make a 
      positive impact within their local community, and their likelihood to 
      succeed with a two-year time frame:

		&lt;p&gt;HARTLEY BAY, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jan 21, 2014) -  Arnold Clifton, Chief Councillor of the Gitga'at First Nation is reacting to Chevron Canada's recent announcement of an EPC contract with Fluor Corporation and JGC, for the Kitimat LNG project in Bish Cove, British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are disappointed that Chevron feels it can move forward with engineering, procurement and construction at a time when it has failed to consult meaningfully with our First Nation," says Clifton. "Chevron says that this is the most advanced of the proposed LNG projects in British Columbia but that is simply not the case when it comes to consulting with Gitga'at."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2006 Environmental Assessment process excluded the Gitga'at First Nation and consideration of any impacts in their territory. The Kitimat LNG Partnership was to have worked with Gitga'at to complete a full and comprehensive review of the project impacts on Gitga'at interests by the end of last year, but they have not even started that process with Gitga'at. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gitga'at territory encompasses approximately 7,500 square kilometres of land and water, including a major portion of Douglas Channel, which is the route LNG carriers would have to travel to get to and from the LNG terminal in Kitimat. The LNG carriers will travel right by the Gitga'at home community of Hartley Bay, through traditional fishing grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPC contract includes completion of the existing Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) as well as engineering and procurement services for the proposed initial phases of the Kitimat LNG project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consultation with the Gitga'at is a legal requirement," said Chief Councillor Clifton. "There is no way that this project is at an 'advanced' stage when consultation with one of the most directly affected First Nations has yet to really get off the ground." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Map of Gitga'at territory (free for use by media): http://ow.ly/sMbcm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, Jan 21 (IFR/Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has stopped working on a Chinese firm's initial public offering amid an investigation by U.S. authorities into its hiring practices in China, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the second time JPMorgan has stepped aside from a Chinese IPO candidate while U.S. securities regulators look into whether the bank violated federal laws in hiring the relatives of current or potential clients with the sole purpose of winning business from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has ended its IPO discussions with Tianhe Chemicals, the people said, as the supplier of lubricating oil additives to refiners such as China Petroleum and PetroChina was trying to move ahead with an around $1 billion deal. Thomson Reuters publication IFR said on Monday that Tianhe Chemicals hoped to launch the IPO in the second quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's exit was driven by concerns raised about the bank's employment of Joyce Wei, the daughter of Tianhe Chemicals Chairman Qi Wei, IFR reported, citing sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong securities license filings show that a Jiao Wei worked at JPMorgan from January 2012 to August 2013, and is now on the staff at UBS, joining the Swiss bank in October. Jiao is Joyce Wei's Chinese name, a person familiar with the matter told IFR, affirming also that she is Wei's daughter. Another source said UBS is mandated to work on the Tianhe Chemicals IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and UBS declined to comment. Efforts to reach Joyce Wei and Tianhe Chemicals were not successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had been discussing an overseas listing with privately-owned Tianhe since at least 2011, when IFR first reported the company planned to list in London. It is not clear whether Tianhe signed any formal letter of engagement before or after Wei joined JPMorgan. One source said on Tuesday the company - in which Morgan Stanley's Asia private equity unit invested $300 million for a minority stake in 2012 - planned to list in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice are investigating whether JPMorgan violated bribery laws by improperly hiring the relatives of well-connected Chinese officials. The investigation is ongoing and the bank has not been accused of any wrongdoing related to the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan earlier withdrew from a syndicate of underwriters working on a $3 billion listing by China Everbright Bank Co, Reuters reported in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Fiona Lau of IFR and Lawrence White, with additional reporting by Stephen Aldred and Elzio Barreto; Editing by Michael Flaherty and Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Dell Inc also likely to be interested - media reports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* IBM server unit value likely $2.5-$3 bln - analysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/HONG KONG, Jan 21 (Reuters) - China's Lenovo Group
Ltd has resumed talks to buy International Business
Machines Corp's (IBM) low-end server unit, a source
familiar with the matter said, a purchase that would bolster its
efforts to diversify beyond a shrinking PC market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal for IBM's x86 servers, which power corporate data
centers, fits in with Lenovo's attempts to remould itself as a
growing force in mobile devices and data storage servers. It
also helps IBM's shift away from hardware towards software and
services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies failed to reach an agreement last year
after differing on pricing. Media reports then put IBM's hopes
at between $4 billion to $6 billion for the unit, while Lenovo
was said to be only willing to offer $2.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts now estimate the sale of the IBM unit to Lenovo
could be worth between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. That would
make it the biggest ever deal in China's IT sector, outpacing
Baidu Inc's acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon
Websoft Inc for $1.85 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody wins because even if IBM could double the
profitability it's still not good enough for IBM. On the other
hand, Lenovo doubling the server business margins is a good deal
for Lenovo," said Alberto Moel, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo, the world's biggest PC maker, said on Tuesday it was
in preliminary talks about an acquisition. It declined to name
the seller but said it was making the statement in response to
reports about its potential acquisition of a server business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that it had not entered into any definitive
agreement and that no material terms had been agreed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IBM spokesman said on Monday the company wouldn't comment
on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell Inc, which went private in a $25 billion deal last
year, has also been cited in media reports as a potential suitor
for the business. A Beijing-based spokesman for Dell declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EAGER SELLER, FLUSH BUYER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo's purchase of IBM's Thinkpad PC business in 2005 for
$1.75 billion became the springboard for its leap to the top of
global PC maker rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moel, who estimates IBM's low-end server business could be
worth between $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion, said IBM was likely
more eager now to do a deal than last year after several
quarters of weak earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But any deal would also likely invite scrutiny from the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) as
servers were more directly related to data security than PCs and
phones, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo could finance the deal through a combination of cash,
debt and converts, said Nicolas Baratte, a Hong Kong-based
analyst with brokerage CLSA. The company has $3 billion in cash,
and very little debt, and IBM is a very willing seller, he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If IBM sells all its server business, except the top-end
servers, the deal is worth $2.5 to $3 billion," Baratte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no financing problem for $3 billion, but I don't
think it will be one hundred percent cash."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Lenovo, which has a market value of $13.7 billion,
closed up 2.75 percent at HK$10.46 on Tuesday, while the
benchmark Hong Kong share index was up 0.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its shares have surged 12 percent this year, and earlier
this month marked their highest level in more than 13 years
after an IDC report showed it managed to boost PC shipments 9
percent in the fourth quarter while industry shipments slid 5.6
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is due to report fourth-quarter earnings later on
Tuesday. In the previous quarter, revenue missed expectations,
hit by a 40 percent drop in China hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;

By Fiona Lau and Lawrence White
HONG KONG, Jan 21 (IFR/Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
has stopped working on a Chinese firm's initial public offering
amid an investigation by U.S. authorities into its hiring
practises in China, people with direct knowledge of the matter
told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the second time JPMorgan has stepped aside from a
Chinese IPO candidate while U.S. securities regulators look into
whether the bank violated federal laws in hiring the relatives
of current or potential clients with the sole purpose of winning
business from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has ended its IPO discussions with Tianhe
Chemicals, the people said, as the supplier of lubricating oil
additives to refiners such as China Petroleum and
PetroChina was trying to move ahead with an around
$1 billion deal. Thomson Reuters publication IFR said on Monday
that Tianhe Chemicals hoped to launch the IPO in the second
quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's exit was driven by concerns raised about the
bank's employment of Joyce Wei, the daughter of Tianhe Chemicals
Chairman Qi Wei, IFR reported, citing sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong securities license filings show that a Jiao Wei
worked at JPMorgan from January 2012 to August 2013, and is now
on the staff at UBS, joining the Swiss bank in
October. Jiao is Joyce Wei's Chinese name, a person familiar
with the matter told IFR, affirming also that she is Wei's
daughter. Another source said UBS is mandated to work on the
Tianhe Chemicals IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and UBS declined to comment. Efforts to reach Joyce
Wei and Tianhe Chemicals were not successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had been discussing an overseas listing with
privately-owned Tianhe since at least 2011, when IFR first
reported the company planned to list in London. It is not clear
whether Tianhe signed any formal letter of engagement before or
after Wei joined JPMorgan. One source said on Tuesday the
company - in which Morgan Stanley's Asia private equity
unit invested $300 million for a minority stake in 2012 -
planned to list in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the
Department of Justice are investigating whether JPMorgan
violated bribery laws by improperly hiring the relatives of
well-connected Chinese officials. The investigation is ongoing
and the bank has not been accused of any wrongdoing related to
the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan earlier withdrew from a syndicate of underwriters
working on a $3 billion listing by China Everbright Bank Co,
Reuters reported in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Jan 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said
on Tuesday its new hydrotreater has started operations and is
producing ultra-low sulphur diesel at its 592,000 barrels per
day (bpd) Singapore refinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new unit will increase the facility's daily low-sulphur
diesel capacity to 25 million litres or about 157,000 barrels.
Of that, about 36 percent or 57,000 bpd will meet ultra-low
sulphur diesel specifications, the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new unit, the refinery is able to produce both 50
and 10 parts per million (ppm) low sulphur diesel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-low sulphur diesel, commonly used to fuel vehicles and
equipment such as tractor trailers, buses and marine vessels, is
becoming a more commonly required fuel in Asian countries trying
to control air pollution and potentially hazardous emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil has put diesel hydrotreaters into its refineries
in Baytown and Baton Rouge in the United States, Antwerp in
Belgium, Sriracha in Thailand and Yanbu in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil major has invested more than $3 billion to expand
its ultra-low sulphur diesel production globally, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY Jan 23 (Reuters) - Australia's Santos Ltd 
expects a sharp boost in production and cash flow in the second
half of 2014 as liquefied natural gas begins flowing from the
Papua New Guinea gas project it has a stake in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santos, Australia's second-biggest oil and gas producer, on
Thursday posted record sales revenue of A$1.1 billion for the
fourth quarter of 2013 - driven by its highest oil production in
six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong oil prices and higher third-party sales volumes, also
played a role in boosting sales, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santos has a 13.5 percent interest in the $19 billion PNG
liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which it said was over 90
percent complete. The project is operated by Exxon Mobil
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santos is also developing the Gladstone LNG project in
Queensland state, one of seven under construction in Australia
to meet demand for gas in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That project is on track to start in 2015, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the second half of 2014 the first of these projects, PNG
LNG, is on track to commence LNG shipments to Asia, delivering a
significant boost in production and cashflow for the company,"
Chief Executive Officer David Knox said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For calendar 2013, Santos said it produced 51 million
barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), down 2 percent from 2012, and
in line with guidance issued in December. This was a revision
from an October forecast that it would produce at the low end of
a 52 million to 55 mmboe range.&lt;/p&gt;

European Union, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 22 (Reuters) - Trustees extended by two months
the deadline for them to decide whether to accept JPMorgan Chase
and Co's proposed $4.5 billion settlement with investors
who lost money on mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a notice dated Jan. 17, seven trustees overseeing the
securities said they had opted to extend a Jan. 15 deadline to
accept the offer. The notice, posted on a website run by the
trustees, said none of the trustees had made a determination
"regarding the reasonableness of, or the advisability of,
entering into the proposed settlement agreement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement with 21 institutional investors in 330
residential mortgage-backed securities trusts gave the trustees
60 days to accept the deal, with a right to extend it for
another 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase made the offer in November as it sought to
get past problems related to mortgage-backed securities issued
before the 2008 financial crisis by the bank and Bear Stearns,
which it bought during the crisis. At the same time, it was also
finalizing a separate $13 billion settlement with the U.S.
government over bad mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to make an
immediate comment on the extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathy Patrick, a lawyer for the institutional investors,
declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The institutional investors include BlackRock Inc,
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, and Bayerische Landesbank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, on Wednesday Fir Tree Partners, a private
investment firm, made a tender offer for two of the
mortgage-backed securities trusts subject to the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Holders will get their money now rather than waiting for
the settlement payout, which could potentially take months or
years, if it happens at all," Clinton Biondo, a managing
director at Fir Tree Partners, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar settlement was reached in 2011 between investors
in mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide Financial
and Bank of America Corp, which bought Countrywide in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That settlement, for $8.5 billion, is awaiting approval by a
New York state judge, Justice Barbara Kapnick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - A worker was injured on Wednesday after falling into a reactor while performing an overhaul on a shut gofiner unit at Exxon Mobil Corp's 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in Baytown, Texas, according to sources familiar with operations at the refinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worker, who is employed by a contractor hired by Exxon to overhaul the gofiner, sustained a knee injury and might have been further harmed by the high pressure maintained inside the reactor, the sources said. The worker was flown to a Houston hospital for evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man remained conscious throughout the incident and is expected to recover, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gofiner breaks down heavy crude oil feedstock for use in a fluidic catalytic cracking unit, which produces light-end products like gasoline. It also removes sulfur from the feedstock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon spokeswoman Connie Tilton said the company would investigate the incident to determine its cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tilton said there was no impact to production at the refinery from the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's Baytown refinery is the second largest in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) is telling employees this week about their 2013 bonuses, and most workers are not getting pay increases for the year thanks to the bank's massive legal bills, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

The additional legal expenses were responsible for all of the company's 9 percent increase in non-interest expenses. Net income in 2013 was $17.9 billion, down 16 percent from 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company-wide compensation expense was $30.8 billion for the year, up a fraction of one percent from 2012.

&lt;p&gt;* Volcker Rule allows up to 3 pct of Tier I capital to be
invested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Goldman CFO: There are going to be 3 percent funds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Steve Gelsi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 22 (Buyouts Magazine) - Goldman Sachs is expecting to
steer clients toward so-called "3 percent funds" as it takes aim
at its large private equity business, with about $15 billion in
assets on its balance sheet that come under Volcker Rule
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule, which took effect in December, led Wall Street
analysts to pose several questions to Goldman Sachs CFO
Harvey Schwartz on the firm's quarterly conference call on Jan.
16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays Capital, wondered if
the firm has enough clarity around all the rules to step up
investing if it sees opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The short answer is yes," Schwartz said. "The opportunity
set is going to be driven by what we see, working with our
clients and being very disciplined about returns, as we have in
the past. In terms of the rule set, gives a road map for
the various alternatives under which you can undertake the
activities. You can investclients in 3 percent funds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Schwartz said a top-level implementation team
is in place to work through Volcker rule requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges for banking entities will be figuring
how to deal with current, covered funds that they have
sponsored, said Bill Stern, partner at Goodwin Procter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is an exemption that allows banking entities to
organize and offer a covered fund to customers as part of an
asset management business, but it's not entirely clear how that
exemption can be applied to pre-existing funds," Stern said in
an email to Buyouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been working on direct investments with
investors and thus avoiding ownership restrictions covering
private equity funds, according to reports published last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the largest players in the private equity arena,
Goldman Sachs raised nearly $25 billion for its principal
investments in 2012-13, according to industry estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That effort came prior to the implementation of the Volcker
Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, aimed at separating private equity, investment
banking and proprietary trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

its market-friendly bond purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In general valuations are stretched, though there are still
areas of opportunity for investors who are able to be more
selective," aid Hooper, who helps oversee $436 billion in assets
under management. "Focusing on areas with more growth may be
worth paying up for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in earnings, Advanced Micro Devices Inc slumped
10.8 percent to $3.72 after forecasting a steeper-than-expected
fall in current quarter revenue, while Coach Inc tumbled
6 percent to $49.38 as the S's worst performer after it said
sales in North America fell further in the final quarter of
2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the upside, Norfolk Southern Corp jumped 4.7
percent to $94.39 after its earnings beat expectations, helping
lift the Dow Jones Transportation average to a record
high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuance Communications rose 8.4 percent to $16.15
after giving a first-quarter outlook, helping to boost the
Nasdaq. U.S.-listed shares of BlackBerry also buoyed
the tech-heavy index, jumping 5.5 percent to $10.47. Shares of
the smartphone maker are up more than 22 percent over the past
three sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud software maker VMWare Inc said it would buy
privately-held mobile security company AirWatch, in a deal
valued at about $1.54 billion, to tap into rising demand for
software security, sending its shares up 2.1 percent to $99.37.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Guillermo Parra-Bernal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO Jan 22 (Reuters) - Brazilian energy producer
Eneva SA named former Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
dealmaker Fabio Bicudo as chief executive officer, a source with
direct knowledge of the situation said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bicudo left Goldman Sachs this week after a four-year stint,
his second there, according to a memo obtained by Reuters. Last
March, he became co-chief of Goldman's investment banking unit
in Brazil alongside Antonio Pereira as part of a shakeup that
followed a capital injection and a shift toward higher-margin
products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eneva, formerly known as MPX Energia SA, is jointly
controlled by E.ON SE, Germany's largest utility, and
Brazilian investor Eike Batista. Goldman Sachs was the main
adviser for E.ON on its investment in MPX, which the German
company renamed Eneva after building a 37.9 percent stake
through a series of stock purchases from Batista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My work at Goldman Sachs was extremely gratifying because
it not only allowed me to work with large Brazilian companies
but also key multinationals," the memo quoted Bicudo as saying.
"One of those companies invited me to head its operations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eneva declined to comment. Efforts to reach Bicudo on his
mobile phone for comment were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will announce the move shortly, Bicudo said in
the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bicudo has extensive experience brokering deals in Brazil's
electricity sector. Among the deals he led at Goldman was
Electricit&#233; de France SA's sale of a stake in Light SA
. When Citigroup Inc hired him in 2006, he took
those clients and the deal with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.ON turned to Brazil for growth following the
implementation of tougher environmental rules at home and the
impact of Europe's economic crisis over the past five years. But
its bet on MPX and subsequently Eneva has proven costly: Shares
of the Rio de Janeiro-based company are down about 74 percent
since E.ON first bought a stake in January 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHALLENGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Eneva erased early gains and were unchanged at
3.28 reais late Wednesday afternoon. The stock is up 11 percent
this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bicudo's new job might be finding additional sources of
capital as well as restoring investor confidence. Batista faces
a dearth of new money after his Grupo EBX conglomerate of mining
and energy companies almost collapsed last year, and E.ON
reportedly is refusing to inject more money into Eneva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Eneva must contend with sluggish economic
growth in Brazil and potential caps on energy rates as the
government battles persistently high inflation. After a
decade-long boom, flagging investment and eroding business and
consumer confidence caused the nation's economy to shrink in the
third quarter, its first contraction since early 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect Eneva to post a net loss of 666 million
reais ($282 million) for 2013, according to Thomson Reuters
StarMine. The company operates 2,400 megawatts of installed
capacity, with another 524 MW under construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to
say when Bicudo starts at Eneva. Currently, Eduardo Karrer is
both CEO and head of investor relations at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bicudo's departure from Goldman comes after a flurry of top
executives left the Brazilian unit in the past year in the wake
of waning financial advisory activity. They include investment
banker Rodrigo Mello and wealth management executive Adriano
Koelle, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MADRID Jan 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday
it will place 5 percent of Spanish drug maker Almirall,
currently held by Grupo Plafin, through an accelerated book

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 22, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - Risk and uncertainty are rife in the EB-5 World; the terms 'no guarantee' and 'at-risk' are cited wide across the industry. However, Mainsail Lodging and Development of Tampa, Florida have come up with a new and unique approach to an EB-5 project with their latest development, the 'Epicurean Hotel'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The 137 room, $40 million Epicurean Hotel project, based in downtown Tampa, Florida is the first built-from-scratch hotel in the United States to join Marriott International's 'Autograph Collection' of boutique luxury hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Typical EB-5 projects face lengthy 18-24 month project development times, risks of the project not being completed on time, cost overruns, potential permitting issues and possible delays on returns until the project is operational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			Mainsail has a project that is now built and operating which mitigates some of this risk and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Mainsail Epicurean Hotel is a job creating enterprise in their EB-5 program. The Epicurean opened for business on December 18, 2013 &#8211; a developed and operating property and therefore likely reducing those concerns over development, build time, construction risks and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So how was this possible, the answer; 'Bridge-financing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The May 30, 2013 USCIS Policy Memorandum states that if an EB-5 project utilizes interim or bridge financing prior to the receipt of the EB-5 capital and subsequently replaces it with EB-5 capital, the new commercial enterprise may still receive credit for the job creation under the new guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	As such, Bridge or interim financing provides the opportunity for EB-5 project developers to take out short term financing to help construct and develop the project, then EB-5 capital as it is received may replace that short term financing yet still receive credit for creating jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Private equity group IK Investment Partners has hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to find a buyer for Germany-based fire extinguisher maker Minimax, two people familiar with the process told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT Jan 22 (Reuters) - Private equity group IK
Investment Partners has hired Goldman Sachs to find a

people familiar with the process told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened little
changed on Wednesday as corporate earnings provided investors
with little reason to buy in a stock market that has been unable
to find its footing after a strong rally last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of IBM weighed down the Dow after the world's biggest
technology services company missed revenue expectations for a
fourth straight quarter amid weakening demand, particularly in
growth markets like China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.7 points or
0.13 percent, to 16,392.74, the S 500 gained 1.57
points or 0.09 percent, to 1,845.37 and the Nasdaq Composite

&lt;p&gt;* IBM, Coach fall in premarket after earnings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* 26 companies scheduled to report on Wednesday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* El-Erian to step down from PIMCO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Futures: Dow off 18 pts, S up 0.5 pt, Nasdaq up 6.75 pts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set for a flat
open on Wednesday, as corporate earnings provide investors with
little reason to buy in a stock market that has been unable to
find its footing after a strong rally last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* IBM shares lost 3.9 percent to $181.10 before the
opening bell. The world's biggest technology services company
missed revenue expectations for a fourth straight quarter amid
weakening demand, particularly in growth markets like China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Fellow Dow component United Technologies Corp shed
0.04 percent to $114.94 in premarket trading after the world's
largest maker of elevators and air conditioners reported higher
fourth-quarter profit that topped Wall Street estimates,
although revenue fell shy of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Coach Inc tumbled 7.6 percent to $48.55 in
premarket trading after it said sales in North America fell
further in the final quarter of 2013, as it lost share in the
handbag business to fast-growing rivals such as Michael Kors
Holdings Ltd and Kate Spade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* After a 29.6 percent jump in the S 500 in 2013, the S
has edged down 0.2 percent so far in 2014 as investors look to
corporate profits for evidence of growth as the Federal Reserve
has begun to wind down its market-friendly economic stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* About eight companies have issued negative outlooks for
every positive one, which would mark the lowest ratio on record
should it continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* According to Thomson Reuters data, earnings for the fourth
quarter are expected to grow 7 percent over the prior year. Of
the 61 companies in the benchmark S index that have reported
so far, about 56 percent topped analyst expectations, below the
long-term average of 63 percent. About 71 percent have topped
revenue forecasts, above the long-term average of 61 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S 500 e-mini futures added 0.5 point and were
slightly above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by
taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to
expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures
 lost 18 points and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 6.75
point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Advanced Micro Devices Inc slumped 9.4 percent to
$3.78 in premarket after the chipmaker forecast a
steeper-than-expected fall in current quarter revenue, saying
sales of gaming consoles were not growing fast enough to offset
slowing PC sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* After the closing bell, earnings are expected from eBay
Inc, Netflix Inc, Varian Medical Systems Inc
 and F5 Networks Inc. A total of 26 S 500
companies are scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Merger and acquisition activity continued at a brisk pace,
as companies flush with cash look for ways to create growth.
Cloud software maker VMWare Inc said it would buy
privately held mobile security company AirWatch in a deal valued
at about $1.54 billion to tap into rising demand for software
security, sending its shares up 3 percent in premarket trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Mohamed El-Erian, heir apparent to Pimco co-founder Bill
Gross, will step down as chief executive and co-chief investment
officer, raising questions about the future course of Pacific
Investment Management Co, the world's largest bond fund manager.&lt;/p&gt;

			Company Working Toward 2015 Goal to Adopt More Energy-Efficient, 
      Natural Refrigeration for All New Cold-Drink Equipment Globally
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The 
      Coca-Cola Company today announced that it has installed its 1 
      millionth hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-free cooler using natural refrigerant 
      in the marketplace, preventing the emission of 5.25 million metric tons 
      of CO2 over 10 years. This milestone marks significant progress in the 
      Company&#8217;s effort to phase out the use of HFC refrigerant&#8212;a well-known 
      contributor to climate change&#8212;in Coca-Cola dispensers, vending machines 
      and coolers globally. Together with its bottling partners, the Coca-Cola 
      system has established a goal that all new cold-drink equipment will be 
      HFC-free by 2015. Achieving this goal will prevent the emission of more 
      than 50 million metric tons of CO2 over 10 years, an amount equivalent 
      to the annual emissions of more than 10 million passenger vehicles. 
      Coca-Cola has improved its cooling equipment energy efficiency by 40 
      percent since 2000; and eliminated 75 percent of direct greenhouse gas 
      (GHG) emissions by transitioning to HFC-free insulation foam for new 
      equipment.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			18% Increase in Online Spending with Visa Fuels Solid Growth for the 
      Business in the UK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Spend on Visa debit in the UK increased by 9.3%, exemplifying 
        consumers&#8217; increasing preference for electronic payments
			
			
				UK consumers continue to increase their partiality for online 
        purchases, with 25% of all spending with Visa now spent online
			
			
				Contactless transactions in the UK grew four fold annually as cash 
        displacement becomes a reality
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      UK consumers&#8217; preference for electronic payments continued to increase 
      in 2013 as Visa Europe announces that spending with UK Visa credit, 
      debit, commercial and prepaid cards increased by 9.2% to &#163;445bn. This is 
      according to Visa Europe&#8217;s annual results for the year to 30th 
      September 2013, which are announced today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Spending by UK cardholders with Visa debit increased by 9.3% on the 
      previous year. Debit payments account for over 80% of Visa Europe&#8217;s 
      business in the UK. More than &#163;1 in every &#163;3 spent in the UK is now 
      spent using Visa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Growth was also strong in other core areas of the Visa Europe business, 
      with spending on commercial cards increasing by 18.1% and on prepaid 
      cards by 42.8%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Continued uptake of new payments technologies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The UK&#8217;s partiality for online purchases was unabated in 2013 with 
      &#163;110bn spent at UK merchants in the year to September 2013, which 
      equates to &#163;3,488 being spent every second with a Visa card. This is an 
      increase of 18% on the previous year at UK merchants. Over 25% of Visa 
      Europe&#8217;s UK business now takes place online.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The well received launch of Visa Europe&#8217;s digital wallet, V.me by Visa, 
      in 2013 is testament to the increasing demand from consumers, retailers 
      and banks for safer, more convenient ways to pay online. To date, 4,000 
      UK retailers have signed up to offer V.me by Visa which is already 
      available from the Nationwide Building Society with more banks due to 
      launch in early 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      2013 was an exceptional year for the roll-out and take up of contactless 
      payments with Visa Europe exceeding its targets in the UK for the 
      distribution of contactless cards and the installation of terminals. 
      Some 30.3 million cards are now in circulation with 293,600 terminals 
      installed. Access to the payment infrastructure and education about 
      contactless meant that usage soared resulting in contactless 
      transactions increasing four fold in the year to September 2013, with 
      &#163;461.6 million spent with Visa contactless cards up from &#163;96.7 million 
      in the previous year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another key payment innovation development was RBS and NatWest making 
      Visa Personal Payments available to their UK customers. Allowing 
      person-to-person payments, the service enables anyone with a Visa card 
      to send payments to another Visa cardholder via a smartphone without the 
      need to share any account details. More than 3.1 million NatWest 
      customers have downloaded the updated mobile banking app to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This early mobile payment success, the growth of contactless and the 
      roll-out of V.me by Visa signifies that Visa Europe is on track to 
      realise its prediction that 50% of Visa transactions will made be made 
      through a mobile device by 2020.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Commenting on the results and his vision for Visa Europe, Chief 
      Executive Officer Nicolas Huss, who joined on 1st 
      October 2013, said: &#8220;I have joined a very successful business. We 
      have huge scale &#8211; as many Visa cards as people in Europe (500m) and &#8364;1 
      in every &#8364;6.50 spent in Europe is now spent on a Visa card.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is an excellent platform on which to build and I have four main 
      priorities for the future. We will scale-up our next generation payment 
      solutions to move in pace with the rapid adoption of new technologies 
      and, more particularly, the growth of mobile and digital commerce. We 
      will apply a disciplined commercial focus to operate a leaner, more 
      agile company. We will work constructively with regulators to arrive at 
      mutually beneficial solutions. And we will work more flexibly to meet 
      the needs of our customers and partners across Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As a membership organisation focused on European solutions for the best 
      interests of all parties in our four-party model, our continued success 
      is good for the European economy because electronic payments fuel 
      commerce, replace inefficient and expensive cash and fight the shadow 
      economy. It is good for banks, issuers and acquirers, because we invest 
      on their behalf to deliver payments innovations. It is good for 
      retailers and businesses because we enable them to do business quicker, 
      safer and more easily across any channel. And it is good for consumers 
      because it enables them to pay with ease, confidence and security.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			European results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are now 500m Visa cards in Europe. Additionally, &#8364;1 in every &#8364;6.50 
      being spent in Europe is now spent on a Visa card. In the year to 
      September 2013, the total expenditure on Visa cards reached &#8364;2 trillion 
      (&#8364;2,000,000,000,000), while point-of sale spend increased by 8.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      E-commerce continued to grow at exceptional speed in 2013, with a 20% 
      year-on-year rise. This coincides with Visa Europe&#8217;s launch of V.me by 
      Visa, the first pan-European digital wallet service to be offered by 
      banks and financial institutions, in four countries &#8211; France, Spain, 
      Poland and the UK.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Contactless has passed the tipping point in many markets and is growing 
      at lightning pace across Europe. Contactless payment is now available in 
      twice as many countries as this time last year while transactions have 
      nearly tripled and terminals almost doubled. At the same time, 62 mobile 
      contactless projects are now live or planned to launch across Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      There are 500m Visa cards in Europe, while &#8364;1 in every &#8364;6.50 spent in 
      Europe is on a Visa card. In the year to September 2013, total 
      expenditure on Visa cards reached &#8364;2 trillion, while point-of-sale spend 
      increased by 8.5% to &#8364;1.4 trillion. Annual online spending on Visa cards

&lt;p&gt;* CEO and team will give up incentive payments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Disappointing results will speed restructuring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Low-end hardware business on block with clients switching
to cloud

 (Adds comment on low-end server business, revenue figures,
China sales)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Supantha Mukherjee and Soham Chatterjee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 22 (Reuters) - IBM Corp missed revenue
expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter as the world's
biggest technology services company grappled with weakening
demand for its servers and storage equipment, particularly in
growth markets like China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the disappointing results, Chief Executive
Officer Ginni Rometty and her team will forego their annual
incentive payments for 2013 as IBM's total revenues fell 2
percent to $99.8 billion for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 fell 5 percent
to $27.7 billion, missing analysts expectation of $28.25
billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardware revenue plunged 26 percent, leading to a $750
million collapse in profit for that segment. IBM shares fell 3.5
percent to $181.68 in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's results are certain to accelerate the company's
restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we look forward to 2014, we will continue our
transformation," Martin Schroeter, IBM's chief financial
officer, told analysts. "We will acquire key capabilities, we
will divest businesses and we will rebalance our workforce as we
continue to return value to shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, which has been expanding its higher-margin services and
software businesses over the last decade, is expected to
relinquish more of its lower-margin hardware business. Revenue
in that business, which includes server and storage products,
fell for the ninth consecutive quarter as more companies
switched to the cloud from traditional infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'EVERYTHING BUT GROWTH'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging market sales dropped 6 percent, led by China, where
IBM reported a 23 percent collapse in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A backlash against U.S. government spying in emerging
economies and a move by Beijing to encourage state-owned
companies to buy domestically-branded products contributed to
plummeting demand, some analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their growth markets were everything but growth," Forrester
analyst Andrew Bartels said. "They have had quite a bit of
success with sales of hardware in these emerging markets, but
these markets are not doing well. They're facing competition in
those markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asia-Pacific revenue fell 16 percent, while that from
Brazil, Russia, India and China fell 14 percent in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China is going through a very significant economic set of
reforms," Schroeter said on the earnings call. "While they have
slowed, we don't think that this opportunity has gone away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schroeter said that revenue in the world's second-biggest
economy, which accounts for about 5 percent of IBM's sales, will
take several quarters to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not going to rebound immediately," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's China difficulties, coupled with the company's ongoing
weakness in hardware sales, may accelerate IBM's sale of the its
low-end servers business to Lenovo Group Ltd, said
Steve Zhang, a senior technology analyst at Macquarie Bank in
Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources said IBM and China's Lenovo have revived discussions
about a sale of the company's low-end server unit, but
executives did not mention that on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Theoretically, if IBM does sell is low-end hardware
business, there should be some upside because they will be able
to sell into government agencies and state-owned enterprises,"
Zhang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM will be "on a trajectory to growth" in emerging markets
by the end of the year, Schroeter said. "We're comfortable that
we get back to mid-single digits across the growth market
regions by the end of the year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM forecast that full-year 2014 adjusted profit would beat
analysts' expectations and also affirmed its 2015 target for
operating EPS of at least $20 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson told Reuters the company
would need solid performance in software and services to meet
its target, since expectations are that hardware will not
contribute to profit in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Assuming a normalized tax rate, this doesn't leave a lot of
room for error," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO INCENTIVE PAYMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In view of the company's overall full-year results, my
senior team and I have recommended that we forgo our personal
annual incentive payments for 2013," CEO Rometty said in a
statement. For 2013, her base pay was $1.5 million and annual
incentive payment target was $4 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from IBM's system and technology unit, which
includes servers and storage, fell 26.1 percent to $4.26
billion. Revenue from global technology services, its largest
business, fell 3.6 percent to $9.92 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software revenue was the only bright spot. It grew 2.8
percent to $8.14 billion in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM and rivals such as Oracle and SAP are
racing to meet surging demand for web-based software products,
better known as cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving to the cloud allows businesses to cut costs by
ditching bulky servers for network-based software and using
remote data centers run by technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global cloud services market last year grew by almost a
fifth to an estimated $131 billion, according to research firm
Gartner. IBM Markets Intelligence estimates the market could be
as big as $200 billion by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income for the fourth quarter rose to $6.2 billion, or
$5.73 a share, from $5.8 billion, or $5.13 per share a year
earlier. It got help though from a lower tax rate of 11.2
percent in the fourth quarter, down 14.3 points from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On an adjusted basis, it earned $6.13 per share, above
analysts' estimates of $5.99 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before its after-hours decline, the stock closed at $188.43
on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. It has gained about 2
percent since it reported third-quarter results in October.

      Fourth-quarter net income, which includes benefits from tax audit 
      settlements, was $6.2 billion compared with $5.8 billion in the fourth 
      quarter of 2012, an increase of 6 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) net 
      income was $6.6 billion compared with $6.1 billion in the fourth quarter 
      of 2012, an increase of 8 percent.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We continued to drive strong results across much of our portfolio and 
      again grew earnings per share in 2013. While we made solid progress in 
      businesses that are powering our future, in view of the company&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;Jan 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc may stop
traders from using certain chat messaging services to protect
internal conversations that are lately being subjected to
intense regulatory scrutiny, the Wall Street Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per a new policy, Goldman will not allow person-to-person
instant messaging services offered by Bloomberg LP, Yahoo Inc
, AOL Inc and other third-party providers
including Pivot Inc, a unit of CME Group Inc, the
Journal said, citing a draft of a memo. (link.reuters.com/kar36v)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes after Goldman, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
and Deutsche Bank banned their dealers from using
online chatrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatrooms have been a focus for regulators investigating
possible rigging in foreign exchange market and a key interest
rate known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which
has already cost banks billions of dollars in settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders at banks and financial institutions often
communicate with each other online via third-party services
including Bloomberg LP and Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Goldman, JPMorgan and six other banks have agreed
to join a new instant messaging network from Markit and Thomson
Reuters to connect disparate messaging systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman could not immediately be reached for comment by
Reuters outside of regular U.S. business hours.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd has agreed to buy International Business Machine Corp's low-end server business for $2.3 billion in what would be China's biggest technology deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-expected acquisition comes nearly a decade after Lenovo bought IBM's money-losing ThinkPad business for $1.75 billion, eventually becoming the world leader in personal computers in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of the low-end server operation - which still needs U.S. government approval - would allow IBM to focus on its decade-long shift to more profitable software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would increase Lenovo's share in the server market to 14 percent from 2 percent, said Peter Hortensius, a senior vice-president at Lenovo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal needs clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which protects U.S. national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies faced the most scrutiny over their U.S. acquisitions in 2012, according to a CFIUS report issued in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo's purchase of IBM's notebook division faced scrutiny before approval, and this time will be easier, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's fair to say that this deal is more likely to get through CFIUS without major problems than the 2005 transaction," said John Reynolds, a partner at law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell in Washington, D.C. who has handled CFIUS issues for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reynolds saw relatively little national security risk in the deal, noting that Lenovo was well-known in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybank Kim Eng analyst Warren Lau noted that the System X server, among the systems to be bought by Lenovo, is based on commoditized technology and components from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deal is likely also to win U.S. antitrust approval, perhaps within weeks, said Jonathan Lewis, an antitrust partner with Baker &amp; Hostetler LLP. "Given that Lenovo is likely to take advantage of its lower-cost manufacturing base in China, this deal is likely to be viewed as pro-competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares edged 0.2 percent lower to $182.27 at mid-afternoon Thursday. Trading in Lenovo shares was halted before the close in Hong Kong ahead of the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEVEN QUARTERS OF LOSSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal with Lenovo marks another step in IBM's switch away from hardware to software and services. IBM said this month it would spend more than $1.2 billion to build up to 15 data centers on five continents to expand its cloud services and reach new clients and markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it would invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson - the supercomputer system that beat humans on the TV quiz show "Jeopardy" - to offer cloud services to businesses and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Lenovo's PC business under siege from powerful smartphones and super-fast tablets, the company is remodeling itself as a force in mobile devices and data storage servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would not be easy for Lenovo turn around the server unit, however. IBM's low-margin server business has posted seven quarters of losses as clients move to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To generate costs synergy, Lenovo will need to move most of the manufacturing from IBM's existing facility in Virginia to Asia while keeping some R in the U.S.," Lau said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server business being sold by IBM, which produced low-cost x86 servers, competes with Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell but lags both in market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM dominates the higher-end server market with a 57 percent share, according to research firm Canalys. IBM will retain its higher-margin server systems and continue to develop software and applications for the x86 platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following closure of the deal, Lenovo will offer jobs to 7,500 IBM employees and assume customer service and maintenance operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will do a variety of things - improve products, drive improved costs, and couple it with the scale we have and our PC business to improve go-to-market," said Lenovo's Hortensius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said Lenovo would likely find it easier than IBM to sell the x86 servers to Chinese companies as Beijing tries to localize its IT purchases in the wake of revelations about widespread U.S. electronic snooping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIGGEST TECH DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo said it expected demand for computing power and recovery of global enterprise spending to further drive growth in the x86 server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo has agreed to pay $2.07 billion in cash and the rest with stock of the Hong Kong-listed PC maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal surpasses Baidu Inc's $1.85 billion acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc last year, according to Thomson Reuters data, and underscores the clout of China's technology firms as they expand overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit posted a loss of $26.4 million after tax for the 12 months ended December 31, compared with a profit of $187 million in the 12 months ended March 2013. The x86 unit has annual revenue of $4.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between IBM and Lenovo fell apart last year due to differences over pricing, with media reports at the time suggesting IBM wanted as much as $6 billion for the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the sale may have been accelerated by IBM's problems in China following revelations of U.S. electronic spying and ongoing weakness in hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest technology services company posted a 23 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue from China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo's purchase of IBM's PC business in 2005 became the springboard for its leap to the top of global PC maker rankings, and the market is betting Lenovo will enjoy similar success with its latest acquisition, which is partly reflected in a 9.44 percent rise in its shares this year. The Hang Seng stock index is down 2.5 percent in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's server business is the world's second-largest, with a 22.9 percent share of the $12.3 billion market in the third quarter of 2013, according to technology research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard is the biggest player, while Lenovo does not appear in the top five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo said it was advised by Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Denny Thomas, Stephen Coates, Ryan Woo, Ted Kerr and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by strong sales of its software and services for businesses, a solid holiday season for its new Xbox game console and Surface tablets, and a slightly lower tax bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company did not say anything about its five-month search for a new chief executive to replace Steve Ballmer, who said in August he would retire within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company co-founded by Bill Gates 39 years ago was central to the personal computer revolution, and its Windows and Office products still dominate business desktops, but it lost its way with consumers in the last decade under Ballmer as Apple Inc and Google Inc stormed ahead in mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quarter may well be the last full one for Ballmer, and it at least showed some positive momentum for the Surface tablet, Microsoft's long-delayed attempt to knock Apple's iPad off its perch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a good print to ride off into the sunset with, for the current CEO," said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. "There's still the over-arching question for this company: who's going to be the new CEO, and what direction they take."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources have said the search is down to a handful of candidates, including internal and external executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XBOX, SURFACE RISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new Xbox One console, launched in November, helped the top line, contributing more than half to the 7.4 million unit sales in the quarter, up from 5.9 million a year ago. That said, Sony's cheaper PlayStation 4 appears to be winning the latest video game showdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of the second generation of Surface tablets jumped to $893 million in the key holiday shopping quarter, more than the whole of the previous fiscal year. But making and selling the machines cost $932 million, meaning Microsoft is not making a profit on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At prices ranging from $450 to $1,800, the sales figure suggests Microsoft sold no more than 2 million Surface units. By comparison, Apple is expected to announce sales of more than 20 million iPads for the holiday quarter next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Xbox is definitely a feather in Microsoft's cap, they defied the skeptics," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. "But Surface continues to be the Mount Everest of uphill battles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not say much about Windows Phones, its other great push into the mobile computing arena, which will gain force when it completes a $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia's handset business in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said overall phone revenues, which include license fees from Nokia and royalty payments from other handset makers using Google's Android system, jumped 50 percent to just over $1 billion in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that increase mostly reflects a low starting base for Windows in the year-ago quarter and runaway sales of Android smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worryingly for Microsoft, Nokia earlier in the day announced sales of only 8.2 million Lumia smartphones, which was almost double the same quarter a year ago, but down from the 8.8 million it sold in the previous quarter, suggesting that the new phones lost momentum in the crucial holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Microsoft reported a fiscal second-quarter profit of $6.56 billion, or 78 cents per share, compared with $6.38 billion, or 76 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That easily beat Wall Street's average estimate of 68 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, lifting Microsoft shares 3.4 percent in after hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall revenue rose 14 percent to $24.5 billion, also beating Wall Street's forecast of $23.7 billion, helped by higher sales of Microsoft's perennially strong business offerings, including server software, the Office suite of applications and quickly growing 'cloud,' or Internet-based, computing services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months analysts slightly raised revenue estimates, but reduced them for net income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Edwin Chan in San Francisco, and Ritsuko Ando and Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki.; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal by the Republican governor would have to be implemented by the federal government at a time when immigration reform is one of the most contentious political issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder hopes that a pool of talented workers would encourage companies to bring new jobs by relocating to the financially struggling city, which has seen its population decline to about 700,000 from a peak of 1.8 million in 1950.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EB-2 visas would be aimed at individuals with advanced degrees and exceptional skills in fields such as the auto industry, information technology, healthcare and life sciences, Snyder said at an event announcing the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EB-2 visas allow individuals with special talents to enter the country without a job offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no precedent for special visas to be issued for a specific geographic area, Snyder said, but he envisions the immigrants being required to live and work in Detroit for a certain period of time. He compared the program to a current one that grants visas to physicians who agree to work in under-served areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detroit has struggled to provide basic services to residents and filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history in July with more than $18 billion in debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move forward with his plan, Snyder would need the support of Democratic President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder, who will be in Washington on Friday, said he would meet privately with Obama administration officials. Snyder said he hoped the administration would be able to act unilaterally without requiring legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really taking up the offer of the federal government that they want to help more," Snyder told reporters. "Again, they made it clear they don't have dollar resources to necessarily help, but isn't this a great way that doesn't involve large-scale financial contributions from the federal government to do something dramatic in Detroit?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor was joined by Detroit's Democratic Mayor Mike Duggan and Detroit city council members to announce the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder is asking that 5,000 visas be issued in the first year, with 10,000 in each of the next three years, and 15,000 in the fifth year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program would target individuals looking to move to the United States as well as immigrants already in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where else in the U.S. could you find a house or a lot for the prices you're going to find here? It's a good deal," Snyder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homes have sold for as little as $500 in Detroit where one-fifth of the housing stock is considered abandoned and blighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan would make for "a dramatic increase nationally" in the number of foreign high-skilled workers, said Jeff Hauser, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO, the largest organized labor group in the United States, but he said "this is not a practical proposal in any sense of the term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that states cannot expand the quota on their own, Hauser added, "And you cannot limit immigrants to a specific city and say that they have no rights to leave that city once they come" to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph Lichterman in Detroit; Additional reporting by Richard Cowan in Washington.; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adds comment from AFL-CIO spokesman)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Joseph Lichterman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DETROIT Jan 23 (Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder on
Thursday called for the U.S. government to set aside 50,000
special visas over the next five years to attract highly skilled
immigrants to live and work in the bankrupt city of Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal by the Republican governor would have to be
implemented by the federal government at a time when immigration
reform is one of the most contentious political issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder hopes that a pool of talented workers would encourage
companies to bring new jobs by relocating to the financially
struggling city, which has seen its population decline to about
700,000 from a peak of 1.8 million in 1950.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EB-2 visas would be aimed at individuals with advanced
degrees and exceptional skills in fields such as the auto
industry, information technology, healthcare and life sciences,
Snyder said at an event announcing the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EB-2 visas allow individuals with special talents to enter
the country without a job offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no precedent for special visas to be issued for a
specific geographic area, Snyder said, but he envisions the
immigrants being required to live and work in Detroit for a
certain period of time. He compared the program to a current one
that grants visas to physicians who agree to work in
under-served areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detroit has struggled to provide basic services to residents
and filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history in
July with more than $18 billion in debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move forward with his plan, Snyder would need the support
of Democratic President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder, who will be in Washington on Friday, said he would
meet privately with Obama administration officials. Snyder said
he hoped the administration would be able to act unilaterally
without requiring legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really taking up the offer of the federal government
that they want to help more," Snyder told reporters. "Again,
they made it clear they don't have dollar resources to
necessarily help, but isn't this a great way that doesn't
involve large-scale financial contributions from the federal
government to do something dramatic in Detroit?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor was joined by Detroit's Democratic Mayor Mike
Duggan and Detroit city council members to announce the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder is asking that 5,000 visas be issued in the first
year, with 10,000 in each of the next three years, and 15,000 in
the fifth year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program would target individuals looking to move to the
United States as well as immigrants already in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where else in the U.S. could you find a house or a lot for
the prices you're going to find here? It's a good deal," Snyder
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homes have sold for as little as $500 in Detroit where
one-fifth of the housing stock is considered abandoned and
blighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan would make for "a dramatic increase nationally" in
the number of foreign high-skilled workers, said Jeff Hauser, a
spokesman for the AFL-CIO, the largest organized labor group in
the United States, but he said "this is not a practical proposal
in any sense of the term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that states cannot expand the quota on their own,
Hauser added, "And you cannot limit immigrants to a specific
city and say that they have no rights to leave that city once
they come" to the United States.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by strong sales of its Office software to businesses, a solid holiday season for its new Xbox game console and Surface tablets, and a slightly lower tax bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company did not say anything about its unexpectedly long five-month search for a new chief executive to replace Steve Ballmer, who said in August he would retire within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company co-founded by Bill Gates 39 years ago was central to the personal computer revolution, but lost its way in the last decade under Ballmer as Apple Inc and Google Inc stormed ahead in mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quarter may well be the last full one for Ballmer, and it at least showed some positive momentum for the Surface tablet, Microsoft's long-delayed attempt to knock Apple's iPad off its perch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a good print to ride off into the sunset with, for the current CEO," said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. "There's still the over-arching question for this company: who's going to be the new CEO, and what direction they take."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new Xbox One console, launched in November, helped the top line, contributing more than half to the 7.4 million unit sales in the quarter, up from 5.9 million a year ago. That said, Sony's cheaper PlayStation 4 appears to be winning the latest video game showdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of the second generation of Surface tablets jumped to $893 million in the key holiday shopping quarter, more than the whole of the previous fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, at prices ranging from $450 to $1,800, that figure suggests Microsoft sold no more than 2 million Surface units. By comparison, Apple is expected to announce sales of more than 20 million iPads for the holiday quarter next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Xbox is definitely a feather in Microsoft's cap, they defied the skeptics," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. "But Surface continues to be the Mount Everest of uphill battles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Microsoft reported a fiscal second-quarter profit of $6.56 billion, or 78 cents per share, compared with $6.38 billion, or 76 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That easily beat Wall Street's average estimate of 68 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, lifting Microsoft shares 3.4 percent in after hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall revenue rose 14 percent to $24.5 billion, also beating Wall Street's forecast of $23.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months analysts slightly raised revenue estimates, but reduced them for net income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Edwin Chan; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd has agreed to buy International Business Machine Corp's low-end server business for $2.3 billion in what would be China's biggest technology deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-expected acquisition comes nearly a decade after Lenovo bought IBM's money-losing ThinkPad business for $1.75 billion, eventually becoming the world leader in personal computers in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of the low-end server operation - which still needs U.S. government approval - would allow IBM to focus on its decade-long shift to more profitable software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would increase Lenovo's share in the server market to 14 percent from 2 percent, said Peter Hortensius, a senior vice-president at Lenovo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal needs clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which protects U.S. national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies faced the most scrutiny over their U.S. acquisitions in 2012, according to a CFIUS report issued in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo's purchase of IBM's notebook division faced scrutiny before approval, and this time will be easier, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's fair to say that this deal is more likely to get through CFIUS without major problems than the 2005 transaction," said John Reynolds, a partner at law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell in Washington, D.C. who has handled CFIUS issues for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reynolds saw relatively little national security risk in the deal, noting that Lenovo was well-known in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybank Kim Eng analyst Warren Lau noted that the System X server, among the systems to be bought by Lenovo, is based on commoditized technology and components from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deal is likely also to win U.S. antitrust approval, perhaps within weeks, said Jonathan Lewis, an antitrust partner with Baker &amp; Hostetler LLP. "Given that Lenovo is likely to take advantage of its lower-cost manufacturing base in China, this deal is likely to be viewed as pro-competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares edged 0.2 percent lower to $182.27 at mid-afternoon Thursday. Trading in Lenovo shares was halted before the close in Hong Kong ahead of the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEVEN QUARTERS OF LOSSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal with Lenovo marks another step in IBM's switch away from hardware to software and services. IBM said this month it would spend more than $1.2 billion to build up to 15 data centers on five continents to expand its cloud services and reach new clients and markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it would invest more than $1 billion to establish a new business unit for Watson - the supercomputer system that beat humans on the TV quiz show "Jeopardy" - to offer cloud services to businesses and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Lenovo's PC business under siege from powerful smartphones and super-fast tablets, the company is remodeling itself as a force in mobile devices and data storage servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would not be easy for Lenovo turn around the server unit, however. IBM's low-margin server business has posted seven quarters of losses as clients move to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To generate costs synergy, Lenovo will need to move most of the manufacturing from IBM's existing facility in Virginia to Asia while keeping some R in the U.S.," Lau said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server business being sold by IBM, which produced low-cost x86 servers, competes with Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell but lags both in market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM dominates the higher-end server market with a 57 percent share, according to research firm Canalys. IBM will retain its higher-margin server systems and continue to develop software and applications for the x86 platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following closure of the deal, Lenovo will offer jobs to 7,500 IBM employees and assume customer service and maintenance operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will do a variety of things - improve products, drive improved costs, and couple it with the scale we have and our PC business to improve go-to-market," said Lenovo's Hortensius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said Lenovo would likely find it easier than IBM to sell the x86 servers to Chinese companies as Beijing tries to localize its IT purchases in the wake of revelations about widespread U.S. electronic snooping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIGGEST TECH DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo said it expected demand for computing power and recovery of global enterprise spending to further drive growth in the x86 server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo has agreed to pay $2.07 billion in cash and the rest with stock of the Hong Kong-listed PC maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal surpasses Baidu Inc's $1.85 billion acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc last year, according to Thomson Reuters data, and underscores the clout of China's technology firms as they expand overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit posted a loss of $26.4 million after tax for the 12 months ended December 31, compared with a profit of $187 million in the 12 months ended March 2013. The x86 unit has annual revenue of $4.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between IBM and Lenovo fell apart last year due to differences over pricing, with media reports at the time suggesting IBM wanted as much as $6 billion for the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the sale may have been accelerated by IBM's problems in China following revelations of U.S. electronic spying and ongoing weakness in hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest technology services company posted a 23 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue from China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo's purchase of IBM's PC business in 2005 became the springboard for its leap to the top of global PC maker rankings, and the market is betting Lenovo will enjoy similar success with its latest acquisition, which is partly reflected in a 9.44 percent rise in its shares this year. The Hang Seng stock index is down 2.5 percent in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's server business is the world's second-largest, with a 22.9 percent share of the $12.3 billion market in the third quarter of 2013, according to technology research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard is the biggest player, while Lenovo does not appear in the top five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo said it was advised by Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Denny Thomas, Stephen Coates, Ryan Woo, Ted Kerr and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

panel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Paul Carsten and Soham Chatterjee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 23 (Reuters) - Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd
 has agreed to buy International Business Machine
Corp's low-end server business for $2.3 billion in what
would be China's biggest technology deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-expected acquisition comes nearly a decade after
Lenovo bought IBM's money-losing ThinkPad business for $1.75
billion, eventually becoming the world leader in personal
computers in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale of the low-end server operation - which still needs
U.S. government approval - would allow IBM to focus on its
decade-long shift to more profitable software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would increase Lenovo's share in the server market
to 14 percent from 2 percent, said Peter Hortensius, a senior
vice-president at Lenovo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal needs clearance from the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which protects U.S.
national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies faced the most scrutiny over their U.S.
acquisitions in 2012, according to a CFIUS report issued in
December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo's purchase of IBM's notebook division faced scrutiny
before approval, and this time will be easier, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's fair to say that this deal is more likely to get
through CFIUS without major problems than the 2005 transaction,"
said John Reynolds, a partner at law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell
in Washington, D.C. who has handled CFIUS issues for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reynolds saw relatively little national security risk in the
deal, noting that Lenovo was well-known in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybank Kim Eng analyst Warren Lau noted that the System X
server, among the systems to be bought by Lenovo, is based on
commoditized technology and components from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This deal is likely also to win U.S. antitrust approval,
perhaps within weeks, said Jonathan Lewis, an antitrust partner
with Baker &amp; Hostetler LLP. "Given that Lenovo is likely to take
advantage of its lower-cost manufacturing base in China, this
deal is likely to be viewed as pro-competitive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares edged 0.2 percent lower to $182.27 at
mid-afternoon Thursday. Trading in Lenovo shares was halted
before the close in Hong Kong ahead of the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEVEN QUARTERS OF LOSSES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal with Lenovo marks another step in IBM's switch away
from hardware to software and services. IBM said this month it
would spend more than $1.2 billion to build up to 15 data
centers on five continents to expand its cloud services and
reach new clients and markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it would invest more than $1 billion
to establish a new business unit for Watson - the supercomputer
system that beat humans on the TV quiz show "Jeopardy" - to
offer cloud services to businesses and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Lenovo's PC business under siege from powerful
smartphones and super-fast tablets, the company is remodelling
itself as a force in mobile devices and data storage servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would not be easy for Lenovo turn around the server unit,
however. IBM's low-margin server business has posted seven
quarters of losses as clients move to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To generate costs synergy, Lenovo will need to move most of
the manufacturing from IBM's existing facility in Virginia to
Asia while keeping some R in the U.S.," Lau said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server business being sold by IBM, which produced
low-cost x86 servers, competes with Hewlett-Packard Co 
and Dell but lags both in market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM dominates the higher-end server market with a 57 percent
share, according to research firm Canalys. IBM will retain its
higher-margin server systems and continue to develop software
and applications for the x86 platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following closure of the deal, Lenovo will offer jobs to
7,500 IBM employees and assume customer service and maintenance
operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will do a variety of things - improve products, drive
improved costs, and couple it with the scale we have and our PC
business to improve go-to-market," said Lenovo's Hortensius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said Lenovo would likely find it easier than IBM to
sell the x86 servers to Chinese companies as Beijing tries to
localize its IT purchases in the wake of revelations about
widespread U.S. electronic snooping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIGGEST TECH DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo said it expected demand for computing power and
recovery of global enterprise spending to further drive growth
in the x86 server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo has agreed to pay $2.07 billion in cash and the rest
with stock of the Hong Kong-listed PC maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal surpasses Baidu Inc's $1.85 billion
acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc 
last year, according to Thomson Reuters data, and underscores
the clout of China's technology firms as they expand overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit posted a loss of $26.4 million after tax for the 12
months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $187 million in
the 12 months ended March 2013. The x86 unit has annual revenue
of $4.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between IBM and Lenovo fell apart last year due to
differences over pricing, with media reports at the time
suggesting IBM wanted as much as $6 billion for the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the sale may have been accelerated by IBM's 
problems in China following revelations of U.S. electronic
spying and ongoing weakness in hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest technology services company posted a 23
percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue from China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo's purchase of IBM's PC business in 2005 became the
springboard for its leap to the top of global PC maker rankings,
and the market is betting Lenovo will enjoy similar success with
its latest acquisition, which is partly reflected in a 9.44
percent rise in its shares this year. The Hang Seng stock
index is down 2.5 percent in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's server business is the world's second-largest, with a
22.9 percent share of the $12.3 billion market in the third
quarter of 2013, according to technology research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard is the biggest player, while Lenovo does not
appear in the top five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo said it was advised by Credit Suisse and Goldman
Sachs Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc must face a class-action lawsuit accusing it of defrauding investors to whom it sold $2 billion of risky debt linked to subprime mortgages that it was betting against before the 2008 financial crisis, a federal judge ruled on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in Manhattan rejected Goldman's argument that claims by investors, led by the hedge fund Dodona I LLC, over collateralized debt obligations known as Hudson Mezzanine Funding were too "rife with differences, idiosyncrasies and conflicts" to be pursued together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marrero said that to require individual lawsuits over the CDOs, which he once characterized as "Rube Goldberg-like," would "exponentially" raise costs and waste judicial resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Class certification can make it easier for plaintiffs to obtain larger recoveries at lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment.

protecting U.S. national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies faced the most scrutiny over their U.S.

security risk in the deal, adding that Lenovo was now a fairly
well-known corporate citizen compared with 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall also said he did not
anticipate significant regulatory hurdles in the United States
or China. "...Our seasoned China analyst believes the Chinese

last year, according to Thomson Reuters data, and underscores
the growing clout of China's technology firms as they look to
expand overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit posted a loss of $26.4 million after tax for the 12

the 12 months ended March 2013. The x86 unit has annual revenue

Lenovo does not appear in the top five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The acquisition presents a unique opportunity for the
company to gain immediate scale and credibility in this market,"
Lenovo said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo said it was advised by Credit Suisse and Goldman

U.S. stocks fell on Thursday, hurt by disappointing
manufacturing data in China and a mixed bag of recent U.S.
corporate earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average was
down 1.12 percent at 16,189.71, the S 500 was down 1.03
percent at 1,825.92 and the Nasdaq Composite was down

better-than-expected results for the second quarter on
Wednesday, helped by diversification in its customer base and
greater traction with original equipment manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fusion reported an adjusted loss of 6 cents per share on
revenue of $94.5 million. Analysts on average had expected a
loss of 10 cents per share on revenue of $89.3 million,

and lower fuel costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** JANUS CAPITAL GROUP INC, $11.99, -7.70 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The asset manager's fourth-quarter profit rose 23 percent
due to higher investment management fees, but outflows
continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, $56.34, -2.17 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lender's Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said government
legal cases, including those over mortgage securities the
company settled for more than $13 billion, were "unfair".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GATX CORP, $60.312, +16.37 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The railcar leasing company reported better-than-expected
results for the fourth quarter due to a strong demand for tank
cars in North America and high lease rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also said it expected 2014 earnings to be
$3.85-$4.05 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $3.61
per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GATX's board also authorized a $250 million share repurchase
program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** HERCULES OFFSHORE INC, $4.9201, -14.43 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least two brokerages cut their rating on the offshore
drilling contractor's stock, after the company's fleet status
report for January showed lower contracting activity for
shallow-water rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cowen and Co analysts noted that average backlog per rig had
fallen to 125 days from 210 days last July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** JA SOLAR HOLDINGS CO LTD, $9.31, -6.05 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** RENESOLA LTD, $3.77, -3.58 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** YINGLI GREEN ENERGY HOLDING CO LTD, $6.47, -5.13
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** TRINA SOLAR LTD, $15.39, -7.01 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chinese solar companies fell after a judge in the
United States ruled that Chinese units of the global "Big Four"
accounting firms should be suspended from auditing U.S.-listed
companies for six months, saying the auditors failed to give
regulators papers of certain Chinese companies under
investigation for accounting fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other than the headline risk from news from China, solar
stocks have been overstretched, Raymond James analyst Pavel
Molchanov said. "Against this backdrop, even a relatively small
piece of negative news, such as the Big Four news, can have an
outsized effect on the (Chinese solar) stocks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** TEXAS CAPITAL BANCSHARES INC,$58.985, -7.14 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank holding company reported weaker-than-expected
quarterly results as it set aside more money to cover soured
loans. Loan loss provision rose 20 percent in the fourth quarter
to $4.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** JEFFERSON BANCSHARES INC, $7.7645, +18.91 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HomeTrust Bancshares said it would buy the
Tennessee-chartered savings bank for about $51.2 million in a
cash and stock deal to enter the east Tennessee market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ARCTIC CAT INC,$43.19, -19.62 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which sells all-terrain vehicles and
snowmobiles under the Arctic Cat brand, cut its full-year sales
and earnings forecast after reporting a lower quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gross profit margins fell to 17.8 percent in the third
quarter from 23.3 percent a year earlier, mainly due to sales of
lower-margins Yamaha snowmobiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** HERBALIFE LTD, $64.06, -12.88 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Senator Edward Markey is asking for more
information about the business practices of the nutrition
company, which has been accused of running a pyramid scheme by
prominent hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markey sent letters to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and to Herbalife itself
to try an obtain more information, his office said in a news
release on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** SANTANDER CONSUMER USA HOLDING INC, $25.87, +7.79
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the consumer finance unit of Spanish bank

market debut. The Spanish lender said earlier on Thursday that
it planned to increase the equity of its U.S. holding company by
up to $2 billion to back growth plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** NETFLIX INC, $385.498, +15.51 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company added more than 2.3 million U.S. customers in
the fourth quarter and said it was testing different pricing
plans for its monthly TV and movie streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** LOGITECH INTERNATIONAL SA, $16.1, +21.79 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computer-mouse maker raised its forecast for
the full year after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter
results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** POLYCOM INC, $11.98, +1.78 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reported better-than-expected quarterly results
due to higher sales of its desktop video-conferencing devices,
and said it would cut 6 percent of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ARIAD PHARMACEUTICALS INC, $7.45, +11.03 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least three pharmaceutical companies, Eli Lilly and Co
, Shire Plc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc, have
approached Ariad's board to buy the company, and were prepared
to pay up to $20 per share in cash, according to a report on the

weaker-than-expected results for the first quarter, hurt by
falling sales in North America, the Middle East and Latin
America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also forecast full-year earnings below analysts'
estimates and said it would cut 350 jobs, or 5 percent of its
workforce, to reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** WESTERN DIGITAL CORP, $87.37, -0.81 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's No. 1 hard-disk drive maker forecast a tepid
third quarter as it expects cautious spending and a decline in
the PC market to hit sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** F5 NETWORKS INC, $103.81, +6.49 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network gear maker forecast current-quarter revenue
above Wall Street estimates, helped by strong sales of its data
traffic management products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** SANDISK CORP, $71.41, -1.08 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company posted higher fourth-quarter profits but gave a
revenue outlook that fell short of some analysts' expectations
and said memory chip prices would fall more this year than in
2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ENDEAVOUR SILVER CORP, $4.518, +4.58 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at BMO Capital Markets raised their price target on
the Canadian silver miner's stock to C$5.50 from
C$4.75, citing the company's forecast of higher silver output

Hanson, would leave the company in a surprising move at a time
when U.S. teen apparel retailers are struggling to attract
shoppers and boost sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** NOKIA, $6.972, -9.45 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company reported a 22 percent fall in sales
at its core NSN network equipment division, highlighting the
problems facing management once it completes the sale of its
former flagship phones business to Microsoft for 5.4
billion euros ($7.4 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** COBALT INTERNATIONAL ENERGY INC, $17.38, +3.21
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. oil and gas producer said on Wednesday it
discovered oil at its Bicuar 1A well, offshore Angola. The well,
drilled in partnership with Angola's national oil company
Sonangol, reached its total depth in 59 days, about 63 days
before schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bicuar area may bring about $644.5 million, or $1.58 per
share, for Cobalt, Global Hunter Securities analyst Curtis
Trimble wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BIOLINERX, $3.0601, +4.44 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug developer said the U.S. health regulator granted an
orphan drug status to its experimental drug candidate, BL-8040,
as a stem cell therapy for certain cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The orphan drug status is granted to drugs that aim to treat
rare diseases affecting not more than 200,000 people in the
United States and gives the drugmaker a seven-year marketing
exclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BL-8040 mobilizes stem cells from the bone marrow to the
peripheral blood in patients suffering from hematologic cancers,
a type that affects blood, bone marrow and lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CLEVELAND BIOLABS INC, $0.7489, -33.73 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biotechnology company said the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services terminated negotiations related to the
development of its anti-radiation treatment, citing a lack of
funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ACCELERON PHARMA INC, $51.92, -8.43 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company priced on Wednesday a public offering of 2.4
million shares of its common stock at $50 per share. The price
represents a 12 percent discount to the stock's closing price on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GLOBAL BRASS AND COPPER HOLDINGS INC, $17.12,
-3.49 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The copper and brass products processor said an affiliate of
its largest shareholder, KPS Capital Partners LP, would begin a

the company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PRECISION CASTPARTS CORP, $259.29, -4.21 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which makes forgings and fasteners for
aerospace and industrial gas turbine applications, reported
third-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates as customers
postponed delivery schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Precision Castparts books revenue only after the products
have been delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** UNION PACIFIC CORP, $173.32, +2.86 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company posted a bigger quarterly profit as it raised
prices and saw demand in overall shipments grow, Union Pacific
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MCKESSON, $172.13, +1.44 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority shareholder behind German drugs distributor

			Nuix Expands Intelligent Migration Business with Microsoft Office 365 
      Channel Exec Dave Huth
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nuix, a worldwide provider of information management technologies, today 
      announced it has expanded its Intelligent Migration business by 
      appointing experienced Microsoft Office 365 channel executive Dave Huth 
      to oversee its rapidly growing partner network.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prior to joining Nuix, Huth held senior positions managing the Microsoft 
      alliances and Office 365 partner programs for LiveOffice, Proofpoint and 
      Symantec. He brings extensive experience building profitable channels in 
      hosted Microsoft Exchange and email archiving services since 2007.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Email archives are a major challenge for organizations migrating email 
      to the cloud,&#8221; said Huth. &#8220;Nuix Intelligent Migration is playing a 
      leading role in eliminating this barrier to Office 365 migration with 
      technology that transfers legacy archive data five to ten times faster 
      than other tools. I am excited I have the opportunity to play a key part 
      in expanding the Nuix Intelligent Migration business, and to offer my 
      expertise to support the Office 365 partner community.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the second half of 2013, Nuix added 50 new Intelligent Migration 
      partners around the world. Partners using Nuix Intelligent Migration to 
      accelerate Microsoft Office 365 migrations include Bishop Technologies, 
      Slalom Consulting, Planet Technologies, New Signature, IM Group and 
      Maureen Data Systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We see huge opportunities around migrating email archives to Office 
      365,&#8221; said Benjamin A. Tosado, Vice President of Professional Services 
      at Conquest Technology Services. &#8220;Nuix&#8217;s specialist technology solves 
      the obstacles that could prevent our customers from achieving the full 
      potential of their investment throughout the migration process. That&#8217;s 
      why Nuix is a key partner to our business.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nuix Intelligent Migration is the fastest, most scalable and most 
      cost-effective technology on the market for migrating data from legacy 
      archives to cloud platforms such as Microsoft Office 365. Nuix creates 
      multiple direct connections to the data in place and in its native 
      format, bypassing the archive&#8217;s slow, inefficient application 
      programming interface (API). This dramatically speeds up migration, 
      enables informed decisions about which data to migrate or leave behind, 
      and makes legacy data searchable at the start of the process.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Newest Release of the Unified Archive(R) Offers Expanded Compatibility With Unstructured Data Types, Empowering the Enterprise to Achieve Comprehensive Control Regardless of Email Platform&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - Jan 23, 2014) - &#160;&#160;ZL Technologies, Inc. (ZL), a global leader in managing unstructured Big Data for the large enterprise, will continue an established track record of IBM&#174; product compatibility with repeated attendance at this year's IBM Connect 2014 conference in Orlando, Florida. With the newest edition of the flagship product, the ZL Unified Archive&#174; (ZL UA) version 8.0 now officially available, customers with IBM data now have more options and power than ever before to harness unstructured content such as emails generated in the course of daily business. The event, scheduled from January 26-30, will feature ZL Technologies at location #221 on the Solutions Showcase floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZL's comprehensive governance platform, the ZL Unified Archive, has long provided large organizations an unparalleled ability to centrally manage all unstructured data from a single, scalable platform. By eliminating the disjointed "silos" of data that proliferate with an ad hoc approach to archiving, ZL UA allows the enterprise to consolidate control of hundreds of data types into one multipurpose repository for use in eDiscovery, records management, compliance, storage, and analytics. The result is a single-portal environment which is flexible enough to accommodate extremely diverse data types, yet scalable enough to provide a long-term data management strategy for even the largest of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an IBM partner, ZL Technologies has consistently been dedicated to delivering compatibility with IBM applications and unstructured data types as they continue to evolve. The newest developments in ZL UA 8.0 expand on these capabilities, offering updated support for IBM-based email servers and messages, collaborative suite content, instant messaging (IM) systems, and other social applications. With business becoming ever more fluid and dependent on real-time communication, the capacity to simultaneously ingest and manage multiple types of unstructured data within one searchable repository continues to grow enormously in importance. ZL UA's platform brings this ability to the forefront, and offers additional tools such as email platform migration support to help the enterprise strategically leverage its data even in the most rapidly-changing business environments.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About ZL Technologies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZL Technologies, Inc. makes Unified Archive&#174; software ("ZL UA") to enable large enterprises to manage all unstructured content such as e-mail and files, to satisfy corporate archiving needs for e-Discovery, records management, regulatory compliance, corporate governance, and storage management. It also enables the same unstructured content to become the organization's Corporate eMemory&#8482;
				for competitive advantage, such as sharing knowledge, experts, and history across the enterprise. ZL UA's unique differentiator is its unified architecture, which consolidates all applications and billions of documents under one platform, thus eliminating today's fractured data silos which significantly raise operating costs and legal risks. Demonstrating a proven track record with Global 500 customers and strategic partnerships with major players such as Oracle, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and SunGard, ZL has emerged as the technology leader in harnessing unstructured "Big Data" for strategic advantage.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4431 
      PUTTERs and series 4431A-C DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch 
      has assigned to the School District of Leon County, Florida Sales Tax

      deposited in the series 4431 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4431 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 
      'A+/F1', Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs will 
      expire on Dec. 31, 2014, the expiration date of the liquidity facility,

		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects headline and paragraph 1 to add "low-end")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Lenovo paying $2.07 bln in cash, rest in stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* IBM's unit made $26.4 mln loss after in 12 months ended
2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Deal subject to regulatory approval&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd has
agreed to buy IBM Corp's low-end server business for
$2.3 billion as the Chinese PC giant grabs another piece of the
computing world in a long-awaited deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition comes nearly a decade after Beijing-based
Lenovo bought International Business Machines's (IBM)
loss-making ThinkPad business for $1.75 billion, eventually
becoming the world leader in personal computers in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the PC business now under siege in the face of
powerful smartphones and super-fast tablets, Lenovo is
diversifying its revenue and remodelling itself as a force in
mobile devices and data storage servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of the IBM unit, still subject to approval
from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States
(CFIUS), would lift Lenovo's market share in the server market
to 14 percent from 2 percent currently, said Peter Hortensius,
senior vice-president at Lenovo and president of its Think
Business Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that happens, Lenovo has to turn the server unit
around. The low-margin business - which sells less powerful and
slower x86 servers than IBM's other higher-margin offerings -
has posted seven quarters of losses as more clients switch to
cloud storage from traditional infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will do a variety of things, improve products, drive
improved costs, and couple it with the scale we have and our PC
business to improve go-to-market," Hortensius told Reuters on
Thursday after the deal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say Lenovo will likely find it easier than IBM to
sell the x86 servers to Chinese companies as Beijing tries to
localise its IT purchases in the wake of revelations about U.S.
surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo said it expects demand for computing power and
recovery of global enterprise spending to further drive growth
in the x86 server market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo has agreed to pay $2.07 billion in cash and the rest
with stock of the Hong Kong-listed PC maker, in a deal set to be
China's biggest-ever technology M&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal surpasses Baidu Inc's $1.85 billion
acquisition of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc 
last year, according to Thomson Reuters data, and underscores
the growing clout of the country's technology firms as they look
to expand overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For IBM, the sale allows the company to focus on its
decade-long shift to more profitable software and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What the business is worth to IBM is no longer relevant.
The only thing that matters is what it's worth to Lenovo," said
Alberto Moel, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
"If Lenovo can improve the margins... that could offset any
continued revenue shrinkage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit posted a $26.4 million loss after tax for the 12
months ended Dec. 31, compared with a $187 million profit in the
12 months ended March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The x86 unit has annual revenues of $4.6 billion, Lenovo
told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGHER VALUATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between IBM and Lenovo fell apart last year due to
differences over pricing, with media reports at the time
suggesting IBM wanted as much as $6 billion for the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the sale may have been accelerated by IBM's
China woes and ongoing weakness in hardware sales, after the
world's biggest technology services company reported a 23
percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue from China on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo's purchase of IBM's PC business in 2005 became the
springboard for its leap to the top of global PC maker rankings,
and the market is betting Lenovo will enjoy similar success with
its latest acquisition, which is partly reflected in a 9.44
percent rise in its shares this year. The broader Hang Seng
 index is down 2.5 percent in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's server business was the world's second-largest, with a
22.9 percent share of the $12.3 billion market in the third
quarter of 2013, according to technology research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co is the biggest player, while
Lenovo does not appear in the top five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The acquisition presents a unique opportunity for the
company to gain immediate scale and credibility in this market,"
Lenovo said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs Group 
advised Lenovo, the PC maker said.

			Pfizer Reports Top-Line Results From ALO-02 Phase 3 Study
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today top-line results from a Phase 3 
      study of investigational agent ALO-02 (oxycodone hydrochloride and 
      naltrexone hydrochloride extended-release capsules) in patients with 
      moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain. In this study, ALO-02 met the 
      primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant 
      difference from placebo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized 
      withdrawal design efficacy and safety study in patients with 
      moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain. Patients who achieved a stable 
      and effective dose of ALO-02 (10-80 mg twice per day) during the 4-to-6 
      week, open-label titration period were randomized (n=281) to the 
      12-week, double-blind period in which they were either maintained on 
      their current dose regimen of ALO-02 (n=147) or were&#160;tapered to placebo 
      (n=134). The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was defined as the 
      difference between ALO-02 and placebo in the mean change in the daily 
      average pain numerical rating scale (NRS-Pain) scores from baseline 
      (just prior to randomization) to the final two weeks of the double-blind 
      treatment period. Pain was self-reported daily on an 11-point numeric 
      rating scale (daily NRS; 0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain). Mean 
      changes in the primary endpoint, NRS-Pain scores from baseline to the 
      final 2 weeks, were significantly different between ALO-02 and placebo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common adverse events with ALO-2 during the double-blind period 
      in this study were nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Results from this study will be submitted for presentation at upcoming 
      medical congresses and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed 
      journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About ALO-02
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ALO-02 contains pellets that consist of extended-release oxycodone 
      hydrochloride, an opioid agonist, that surrounds sequestered naltrexone 
      hydrochloride, an opioid receptor antagonist. When used as directed, the 
      naltrexone remains sequestered and patients receive oxycodone in an 
      extended release manner. When the pellets are crushed in an attempt to 
      misuse or abuse ALO-02, naltrexone is released and is designed to 
      counteract the effects of oxycodone.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Jan 23 (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd, the
world's largest PC maker, agreed to buy IBM Corp's 
low-end server business in a long-awaited deal valued at about
$2.3 billion, the biggest-ever tech acquisition by a Chinese
company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenovo will pay $2.07 billion in cash and the rest with
stock of the Beijing-based PC maker, the company said in a
statement to the Hong Kong exchange on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal surpasses Baidu Inc's acquisition of 91
Wireless from NetDragon Websoft Inc for $1.85 billion
last year, according to Thomson Reuters data, and underscores
the growing clout of the country's technology firms as they look
to expand overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition will allow Lenovo to diversify revenue away
from the shrinking PC business and remodel itself as a growing
force in mobile devices and data storage servers. Analysts said
Lenovo will likely find it easier than International Business
Machines (IBM) to sell the x86 servers to Chinese companies as
Beijing tries to localise its IT purchases in the wake of
revelations about U.S. surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale allows IBM to dump its low-margin x86 business -
which sells less powerful and slower servers than the company's
higher-margin offerings - and focus on the firm's decade-long
shift to more profitable software and services. The unit had
reported seven straight quarters of declining revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What the business is worth to IBM is no longer relevant.
The only thing that matters is what it's worth to Lenovo," said
Alberto Moel, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
"If Lenovo can improve the margins... that could offset any
continued revenue shrinkage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo's purchase of IBM's ThinkPad PC business in 2005 for
$1.75 billion became the springboard for its leap to the top of
global PC maker rankings. The market is betting Lenovo will
enjoy similar success with its latest acquisition, which is
partly reflected in a 9.44 percent rise in its shares this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs advised
Lenovo, PC maker said in its statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGHER VALUATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between IBM and Lenovo fell apart last year due to
differences on pricing, with media reports at the time
suggesting IBM wanted as much as $6 billion for the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the sale may have been accelerated by IBM's
China woes and ongoing weakness in hardware sales, after the
world's biggest technology services company reported a 23
percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue from China on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from its hardware business, including servers, fell
for the ninth consecutive quarter as more companies switched to
the cloud from traditional infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's server business was the world's second-largest, with a
22.9 percent share of the $12.3 billion market in the third
quarter of 2013, according to technology research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co is the biggest player, while
Lenovo does not appear in the top five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The acquisition presents a unique opportunity for the
company to gain immediate scale and credibility in this market,"
Lenovo said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The x86 unit has annual revenues of roughly $4 billion,
analysts estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

			Lenovo Plans to Acquire IBM's x86 Server Business
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lenovo (HKSE: 992) (ADR: LNVGY) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) have entered into a 
      definitive agreement in which Lenovo plans to acquire IBM&#8217;s x86 server 
      business. This includes System x, BladeCenter and Flex System blade 
      servers and switches, x86-based Flex integrated systems, NeXtScale and 
      iDataPlex servers and associated software, blade networking and 
      maintenance operations. The purchase price is approximately US$2.3 
      billion, approximately two billion of which will be paid in cash and the 
      balance in Lenovo stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM will retain its System z mainframes, Power Systems, Storage Systems, 
      Power-based Flex servers, and PureApplication and PureData appliances.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The agreement builds upon a longstanding collaboration that began in 
      2005 when Lenovo acquired IBM&#8217;s PC business, which included the ThinkPad 
      line of PCs. In the period since the companies have continued to 
      collaborate in many areas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM will continue to develop and evolve its Windows and Linux software 
      portfolio for the x86 platform. IBM is a leading developer of software 
      products for x86 servers with thousands of products and tens of 
      thousands of software developer and services professionals who build 
      software for x86 systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lenovo and IBM plan to enter into a strategic relationship which will 
      include a global OEM and reseller agreement for sales of IBM&#8217;s 
      industry-leading entry and midrange Storwize disk storage systems, tape 
      storage systems, General Parallel File System software, SmartCloud Entry 
      offering, and elements of IBM&#8217;s system software portfolio, including 
      Systems Director and Platform Computing solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the closing of the transaction, Lenovo will assume related 
      customer service and maintenance operations. IBM will continue to 
      provide maintenance delivery on Lenovo&#8217;s behalf for an extended period 
      of time, so customers should see little change in their maintenance 
      support.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Approximately 7,500 IBM employees around the world, including those 
      based at major locations such as Raleigh, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Taipei, 
      are expected to be offered employment by Lenovo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This agreement follows recent announcements by IBM that it will invest 
      more than $1 billion in the new IBM Watson Group, and $1.2 billion to 
      expand its global cloud computing footprint to 40 data centers worldwide 
      in 15 countries across five continents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This acquisition demonstrates our willingness to invest in businesses 
      that can help fuel profitable growth and extend our PC Plus strategy,&#8221; 
      said Yang Yuanqing, chairman and CEO, Lenovo. &#8220;With the right strategy, 
      great execution, continued innovation and a clear commitment to the x86 
      industry, we are confident that we can grow this business successfully 
      for the long-term, just as we have done with our worldwide PC business.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This divestiture allows IBM to focus on system and software innovations 
      that bring new kinds of value to strategic areas of our business, such 
      as cognitive computing, Big Data and cloud,&#8221; said Steve Mills, Senior 
      Vice President and Group Executive, IBM Software and Systems. &#8220;IBM has a 
      proven record of innovation and transformation, which has enabled us to 
      create solutions that are highly valued by our clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of regulatory 
      requirements, customary closing conditions and any other needed 
      approvals. Subsequent local closings will occur subject to similar 
      conditions, agreements and the information and consultation process in 
      applicable countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While the transaction is being completed, both companies expect no 
      change in their independent, existing server operations, including 
      customer service and product availability.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), got a 74 percent pay increase for 2013, when $20 billion of legal settlements weighed on the bank's income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEO received $20 million, including $18.5 million of restricted stock recently awarded, the company said in a public filing on Friday. Dimon's base salary is $1.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon was paid $11.5 million for 2012, half the $23 million compensation in each of the prior two years, according to company filings, after the company lost $6.25 billion on bets known as the "London Whale" derivatives trades. When those trades first came to light in April 2012, Dimon dismissed them as a "tempest in a teapot".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most employees at JPMorgan did not get pay increases for 2013 because profits declined as a result of high legal bills to settle government and private claims against the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, employed 251,196 people at year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank suffered a number of black eyes in 2013. In January of last year, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency imposed sanctions on the bank for weak risk and financial controls, as well as deficient safeguards against money laundering and violations of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, over the 2012 derivatives loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEGAL SETTLEMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the year, the bank agreed to a series of high-cost legal settlements, including $13 billion to resolve claims that it overstated the quality of the mortgages it was selling to investors before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those settlements cut into the bank's earnings for the year -- JPMorgan's income fell 16 percent for 2013 to $17.92 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new pay package, half of Dimon's restricted stock units will vest after two years and half after three years, which JPMorgan's statement said ties his compensation to the company's future performance, including progress meeting requirements from regulators to improve its risk controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. median household income was $51,017 in 2012, adjusted for inflation, according to the Census Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directors cited the 2012 pay cut as evidence that the board is independent from Dimon, who is its chairman. The board's independence became an issue at the company's annual meeting when some shareholders tried, but failed, to pass a referendum to separate the roles of board chairman and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders voted against that proposal after board members said that Dimon might leave if he did not retain his chairman title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported Friday that directors had decided to pay Dimon more for 2013 after a series of meetings that turned heated at times. JPMorgan spokesman Joseph Evangelisti said the Times' characterization of the director meetings was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry; Editing by Andrew Hay and Stephen Powell)&lt;/p&gt;

as a "tempest in a teapot".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most employees at JPMorgan did not get pay increases for

251,196 people at year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank suffered a number of black eyes in 2013. In January
of last year, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency imposed sanctions on the bank for
weak risk and financial controls, as well as deficient
safeguards against money laundering and violations of the U.S.
Bank Secrecy Act, over the 2012 derivatives loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEGAL SETTLEMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the year, the bank agreed to a series of
high-cost legal settlements, including $13 billion to resolve
claims that it overstated the quality of the mortgages it was
selling to investors before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those settlements cut into the bank's earnings for the year
-- JPMorgan's income fell 16 percent for 2013 to $17.92 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new pay package, half of Dimon's restricted stock
units will vest after two years and half after three years,

company's future performance, including progress meeting
requirements from regulators to improve its risk controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. median household income was $51,017 in 2012, adjusted
for inflation, according to the Census Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directors cited the 2012 pay cut as evidence that the board
is independent from Dimon, who is its chairman. The board's
independence became an issue at the company's annual meeting
when some shareholders tried, but failed, to pass a referendum
to separate the roles of board chairman and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders voted against that proposal after board members
said that Dimon might leave if he did not retain his chairman
title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported Friday that directors had
decided to pay Dimon more for 2013 after a series of meetings
that turned heated at times. JPMorgan spokesman
Joseph Evangelisti said the Times' characterization of the
director meetings was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 24 (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief
executive of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, got a 74 percent pay
increase for 2013, when $20 billion of legal settlements weighed
on the bank's income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO received $20 million, including $18.5 million of
restricted stock recently awarded, the company said in a public
filing on Friday. Dimon's base salary is $1.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon was paid $11.5 million for 2012, half the $23 million
compensation in each of the prior two years, according to
company filings, after the company lost $6.25 billion on bets
known as the "London Whale" derivatives trades. When those
trades first came to light in April 2012, Dimon dismissed them
as a "tempest in a teapot".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most employees at JPMorgan did not get pay increases for

			TVB CEO Steve Lanzano Presents 2014 Local Broadcast TV Advertising 
      Outlook at J.P. Morgan Advertising and Marketing Virtual Summit
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Steve Lanzano, President and CEO of the TVB (www.tvb.org), 
      the trade association of America&#8217;s commercial broadcast television 
      industry, today participated in the 15th Annual J.P. Morgan Advertising 
       Marketing Virtual Summit, and presented the 2014 Local Broadcast 
      Television Advertising Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Steve Lanzano commented on his participation, &#8220;J.P. Morgan&#8217;s Advertising 
      and Marketing Virtual Summit is a terrific annual forum for sharing our 
      perspectives and hard data on broadcast television which continues to 
      lead all media in terms of use and influence with consumers. This is 
      impressive given the explosion of new media and on-demand viewing 
      options which offer consumers a proliferation of choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With 182 of the top 200 shows in the 2012/2013 season airing on 
      broadcast TV and the medium&#8217;s ability to garner enormous audiences for 
      special programming such as the Golden Globes, The Super Bowl, the 
      Olympics and the Academy Awards, its natural for advertisers and brand 
      managers to look first to broadcast television as a reliable, proven 
      marketing solution.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The J.P. Morgan Advertising  Marketing Virtual Summit featured 
      discussions led by executives from eight trade organizations 
      representing the various advertising reliant media verticals and focused 
      on topics such as ad budgets, pricing trends, consumer usage patterns, 
      measurement, and the overall outlook for 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lanzano continued, &#8220;2014 is shaping up as another strong year for Spot 
      TV with the key drivers being strong political advertising, continued 
      growth in automotive advertising spending, the advent of the new 
      healthcare &#8216;Super Category&#8217; driven by the ACA, and an improving U.S. 
      economy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;According to recent SQAD 
      data, the Q1 comparisons show that Spot TV&#8217;s competitiveness with 
      Network scatter has improved year-to-year in the four key dayparts. In 
      addition, local TV broadcasters are continuing to effectively grow their 
      websites, mobile offerings and digital sub-channels, providing 
      advertisers creative ways to extend the content chain across multiple 
      media platforms. Finally, local broadcast television remains the most 
      powerful medium to reach mass audiences and the most influential 
      platform to increase awareness and engage consumers with brands and 
      products.&#8221;

			Regions Bank and Visa Inc. Team Up with Mark Ingram and Alabama State 
      Treasurer Young Boozer to Kick Off Financial Football
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Educational Video Game to Help Alabama Students Score Financial 
      Touchdowns
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Regions 
      Bank (NYSE:RF) and Visa Inc. joined with Mark Ingram, 2009 Heisman 
      Trophy winner, former Alabama Crimson Tide running back and current New 
      Orleans Saint; and Alabama State Treasurer Young Boozer today to tackle 
      the issue of improving financial literacy among Alabama teenagers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Together, they announced the statewide launch of Financial Football, 
      a free educational video game and classroom curriculum designed to help 
      high school and middle school students learn essential money management 
      skills. Developed by Visa Inc., Financial Football combines the 
      action of an NFL game with financial education questions based on 
      real-life scenarios.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Financial Football will be distributed by the Alabama State 
      Treasurer to every public middle school and high school in the state. Regions 
      Bank and Visa are working with the state treasurer to share the 
      financial information and skills with students.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Regions is a strong believer in promoting financial education and 
      helping teenagers understand the importance of making good financial 
      decisions,&#8221; said John Turner, South Region president for Regions Bank. 
      &#8220;By learning concepts such as how to set a budget, how to save for the 
      future and even how investments and credit work, students can develop 
      financial management skills that will last a lifetime. Regions is proud 
      to work with Visa and with Treasurer Boozer to support this program.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The campaign kicked off at Calera High School as Ingram and Treasurer 
      Boozer led teams of students in a hard-fought, high energy game of Financial 
      Football. The game is an online simulation that combines the 
      structure and rules of the NFL with financial concepts. Players gain 
      yards and score points by correctly answering questions of varying 
      difficulty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Financial Football is a wonderful way to get students interested 
      in personal finances, and it gives them a financial playbook they can 
      use the rest of their lives,&#8221; Treasurer Boozer said. &#8220;This is a valuable 
      program and a great partnership between my office, Regions, Visa and the 
      NFL.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Before the game, Ingram shared with students his personal experiences on 
      the importance of money management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Students need to learn to make smart money management decisions early 
      in life,&#8221; Ingram said. &#8220;It takes the combined efforts of parents, 
      teachers and mentors within the community to give teenagers a strong 
      background in personal finance.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Financial Football is available online at www.treasury.alabama.gov. 
      The game is accompanied by a classroom curriculum. Visa has also 
      released the game as a free iPhone 
      app on iTunes, along with an optimized HD iPad 
      version.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For over a decade, Visa has been committed to promoting financial 
      literacy, and we are proud to assist Regions and Treasurer Boozer in 
      their efforts to strengthen financial education,&#8221; said

      Sillin, Head of U.S. financial education, Visa Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The launch of the Financial Football program in Alabama coincides 
      with Regions&#8217; annual &#8220;Financial Fitness Fridays.&#8221; Throughout the month 
      of January, various Regions&#8217; branches across 16 states are hosting free 
      financial fitness events covering important topics such as budgeting, 
      borrowing, identity protection, investing and estate planning for 
      consumers and businesses. Regions&#8217; commitment to financial education is 
      year-round, and Regions offers a variety of free advice, guidance and 
      education services online at www.regions.com/advice.rf.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This launch is part of a national educational campaign with Visa, the 
      NFL and NFL PLAYERS, now in its seventh season. Since 2006, Visa has 
      reached agreements with 41 states and the District of Columbia to 
      distribute Financial Football to every high school and middle 
      school in those states.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Financial Football is part of Practical Money Skills for Life

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 24 (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO
of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, will be paid $20 million for his
work in 2013, restoring most of the $11.5 million cut directors
imposed a year earlier following the company's embarrassing
derivatives loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sum includes a base salary of $1.5 million, plus $18.5
million of restricted stock, the company said in a public filing
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon was paid $11.5 million for 2012, half of his $23
million compensation in each of the prior two years, according
to company filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The raise, decided by the board of directors, comes after
JPMorgan annual profits fell 16 percent in 2013 as the company
agreed to pay out some $20 billion to settle legal claims from
government agencies and private investors.&lt;/p&gt;

U.S. stocks fell on Friday in the wake of a selloff in emerging
market assets, as expectations grew that the Federal Reserve
will trim its market-friendly stimulus measures further next
week. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 1.12
percent at 16,016.58, the S 500 was down 1.31 percent
at 1,804.47 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.57
percent at 4,152.597.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MICROSOFT CORP, $36.67, +1.71 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit
on Thursday, boosted by strong sales of its software and
services for businesses, a solid holiday season for its new Xbox
game console and Surface tablets, and a slightly lower tax bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** COVIDIEN PLC, $68.95, +3.19 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical devices maker posted a quarterly profit above
analysts' estimates, helped by strong sales of its surgical
products, especially vessel sealing and stapling devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** FIRST NIAGARA FINANCIAL GROUP INC, $9.31, -9.96
pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lender posted a higher quarterly profit as it earned
more interest income, but the company also set aside more funds
to cover bad loans. First Niagara earned $78 million, or 20
cents per share in the fourth quarter, up from $61.1 million, or
15 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Niagara's provision for credit losses increased about
46 percent to $32 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** WALTER ENERGY INC, $11.45, -8.40 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo analysts cut their price target on the coal
producer's stock to "market perform" from "outperform," saying
coal prices would remain challenging in 2014, with China
potentially slowing again due to tightening credit. The analysts
also cited Walter's high debt and weak earnings as a reason for
the target cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CARE.COM INC, $22.18, +30.47 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family care website's shares rose as much as 35 percent
in their U.S. market debut a day after the company priced its
offering of 5.4 million shares at $17 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had expected to price the offering between $14
and $16 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PROSPERITY BANCSHARES INC, $65.78, +6.27 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Houston-based bank reported higher-than-expected
quarterly earnings as its loan book grew. Prosperity's net
income rose to $62.3 million, or 98 cents per share, in the
fourth quarter from $48.3 million, or 85 cents per share, a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts had expected the company to earn 91 cents per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** SVB FINANCIAL GROUP, $119.19, +8.10 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank reported a higher quarterly profit as it earned
more net interest income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandler O'Neill Partners raised the price target on
company's stock by $12 to $116, maintaining a "hold" rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PTC THERAPEUTICS INC, $25.1301, -4.16 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said a committee of the European Medicines
Agency recommended against a conditional approval to its drug
for the treatment of a rare muscular disorder, sending its
shares down nearly 30 percent in premarket trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BIODELIVERY SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL INC, $8.6,
+37.60 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker said its experimental drug to treat chronic
pain met its main goal in a late-stage trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least two brokerages raised their price target on the
drugmaker's stock on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** 3D SYSTEMS CORP, $79.53, -6.76 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short-seller Citron Research said the 3D printer maker's
stock was overvalued. Citron criticized 3D Systems for
aggressively acquiring companies that it alleged do not control
unique or transformative technology. The firm set a $56 price
target on the stock and said this could go even lower in the
long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many of these (acquired companies) synergize poorly, and
most were bought for 2x revenues, while DDD is now selling for
over 20x revenues," Citron said. (r.reuters.com/huw36v)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** XEROX CORP, $11.5, -2.21 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, best known as a maker of printers and copiers,
reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue as growth in its
services business stalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** EBAY INC, $54.42, -0.95 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activist investor Carl Icahn's stake in the e-commerce
company is more than previously reported at close to 2 percent,
a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. EBay said
this week that Icahn had taken a 0.82 percent interest in the
company earlier this month and made a non-binding proposal for
eBay to spin off its PayPal payments business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** GENERAL MOTORS, $36.93, -3.88 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is seeking to cut shifts by half at one of its
South Korean factories as it realigns global manufacturing in a
move that could affect about 1,100 jobs, a source with direct
knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** STARBUCKS CORP, $75.75, +3.22 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest coffee chain's quarterly sales at
established restaurants in its U.S.-dominated Americas region
cooled more than analysts expected as online shopping kept more
consumers at home and reduced their visits to its coffee bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the company boosted its fiscal 2014 earnings per
share forecast to a range of $2.59 to $2.67, from $2.55 to $2.65
previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC, $413.66, -5.77 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said on Thursday that it expected to sell fewer

returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN, $100.56, -14.26 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regional railroad operator missed fourth-quarter profit

including lower coal shipments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** SYNAPTICS INC, $60, +5.62 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chipmaker reported better-than-expected second-quarter
revenue on Thursday, helped by higher demand for its touchscreen
and touch pad chips. The company, whose chips are used in mobile
phones made by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Nokia
Oyj, also forecast third-quarter revenue largely
above estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least four brokerages raised their price targets on the
company's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ATOSSA GENETICS INC, $2.53, -20.94 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company priced a public offering of about $5.8 million

from the offering. The company will use the net proceeds of the

of its breast health device, which it said it would recall in
October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** BOEING CO, $137.23, -2.89 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reliability of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner is slowly

loss for the third quarter, helped by strong sales growth of its
device for treating an overactive bladder. The company forecast
a fourth-quarter revenue growth of 25-30 percent for the device
in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roth Capital Partners raised its price target on the stock
to $5 from $4.50, citing the strong quarterly results and
outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** RESMED INC, $43.94, -6.27 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical devices maker reported weaker-than-expected
quarterly results, hurt by declining sales in the U.S. market
due to competitive bidding in the Medicare program and increased
competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Blair cut its rating on the company's stock to
"market perform" from "outperform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jefferies cut its price target on the stock to $40 from $46,
saying ResMed is experiencing a hit to both volume and pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CO, $80.94, +3.45 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** KIMBERLEY CLARK CORP, $108.76, +3.17 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Procter &amp; Gamble, the world's largest household products
maker, said it expected organic sales, which strip out the
impact of currency changes as well as acquisitions and
divestitures, to rise 3-4 percent, and core earnings to rise 5-7
percent in 2014. However, the company reported lower quarterly
profit, hurt by unfavorable currency movements and lower gross
profit margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival Kimberley Clark said its organic sales rose 5 percent,
and forecast that they would rise 3-5 percent in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** CST BRANDS INC, $30.98, -5.29 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gas station operator and convenience merchandise

from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** ARCH COAL INC, $4.07, -4.01 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Clarkson Capital Markets cut their rating on the
coal producer's stock to "underperform" from "market-perform,"
saying they expected the company to generate a negative free
cash flow in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts also expressed concerns about declining
productivity at Arch Coal's flagship steel-making metallurgical
coal mine of Mountain Laurel, West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** MCKESSON CORP, $175.01, +1.53 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. drugs distributor succeeded in its second attempt

imports of certain solar power products from China and Taiwan,
following a complaint at the end of last year by the U.S. unit
of German solar manufacturer SolarWorld AG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company at the time said it was seeking to close a
loophole that enabled Chinese solar panel producers to evade

Martin's F-35 stealth fighter could delay the Marine Corps'
plans to start using its F-35 jets by mid-2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company forecast on Thursday higher earnings in 2014

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A third of Indian voters want Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi to be their next prime minister, placing him well ahead of his rivals in general elections due by May, according to the latest in a series of opinion polls that show rising support for the opposition candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey, conducted by pollsters CSDS for the CNN-IBN television channel, also forecast that Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would win 192-210 seats in the 543-seat assembly, while the ruling Congress party would only bag 92-108 seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given India's diverse and fragmented electorate, neither the BJP nor any other party is expected to win the 272 seats needed for an outright majority. The biggest party will seek to form a coalition with regional parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modi, who has presided over rapid economic growth during more than 12 years as the chief minister of Gujarat state, has been wooing voters by pointing to his track record as a leader who cuts red tape and attracts investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are looking forward to leadership, they think a strong leader will solve their problems," said CSDS director Sanjay Kumar. "They don't want a dictator, but they want someone who can take strong decisions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Congress has shied away from naming its prime ministerial candidate until after the polls, even though many party workers had wanted Rahul Gandhi, a scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that leads the party, to take on the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCANDALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a decade in power, Congress faces public anger over a string of corruption scandals, slow policymaking and economic growth hitting a decade-low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While 34 per cent of voters surveyed picked Modi as their first choice for prime minister, only 15 per cent chose Gandhi, according to the CSDS poll. Sonia Gandhi, Rahul's mother and Congress party chief, was in third place with five per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey's national-level forecasts were released on Friday, while state-level forecasts were released in stages earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another survey released on Thursday, conducted by pollsters CVoter for the India Today media group, found that almost half of respondents wanted Modi versus 15 per cent who backed Gandhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CVoter poll forecast that the BJP would win 188 seats in the election, more than double the expected tally for Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's diverse political landscape makes election results notoriously hard to forecast, particularly in terms of how many seats a party might win, versus the more straightforward calculation of a party's share of the overall vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSDS poll surveyed just under 18,600 voters in 18 states, with a margin of error that varied from state to state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVoter surveyed almost 21,800 respondents across all of India's 28 states, with a three percent margin of error at the national level and five percent margin at the state level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both surveys showed that the BJP has little or no presence in India's prosperous southern states, where at least one alliance will likely be needed to secure a national majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Frank Jack Daniel; Editing by Gareth Jones)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Former Microsoft Executive Turned Marijuana Entrepreneur Should Put Plandai Biotechnology on the Map&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Jan 24, 2014) -  Seattle is famous for its coffee and even more famous for Starbucks.&#160;That's the coffee chain no one ever imagined could blossom into a more than $50 billion business selling a cup of Joe.&#160;Well, don't look now but the city may soon be home to another retail chain that stakes its future on a single product, but this time it's marijuana and one man is trying to make that a reality.&#160;Former Microsoft exec Jamen Shively has become quite a recognizable name in the marijuana debate, and his recognition may very well be Planda&#237; Biotechnology's (OTCQB: PLPL) gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shively is no stranger to marijuana as the great-great grandson of Diego Pellicer, the former Vice Governor of the Philippine Island of Cebu and the largest grower of hemp in the world in the late 1800s.&#160;Diego Pellicer once supplied hemp rope to the Spanish Armada during the Spanish American War.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marijuana entrepreneur co-founded Diego Pellicer, Inc. to create the first retail brand of cannabis in the U.S. and eventually worldwide. Marijuana, both legal and black market, is a $100 billion a year industry in the U.S. alone, a number not lost on Shively, "It's a giant market in search of a brand. We would be happy if we get 40 percent of it worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was likely his Microsoft stint that made Shively a media darling of sorts after he announced his vision to become the leader in both medical and recreational cannabis.&#160;Since that proclamation, he's found his name in many national headlines and has been a guest on just about every news program from CNN to FOX Business to ABC News.&#160;Dope Magazine even suggested Shively might be the "Bill Gates of Cannabis."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shively also plans to launch a study of the effectiveness of concentrated cannabis oil in the treatment of cancer and other illnesses, and it's this desire to enter the medical side of marijuana that Planda&#237; hopes to capitalize on.&#160;Planda&#237; announced a week ago that it has partnered with Diego Pellicer, Inc. and Diego Pellicer Worldwide Inc. to use the Diego Pellicer name on its Phytofare&#8482; medical and pharmaceutical cannabis extracts.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a genius idea for both Planda&#237; and Shively because it allows the biotech firm to build brand recognition for its cannabis products while the industry continues to deal with legislation, legalization and growth; meanwhile, for Shively, it allows his brand to be associated with medical marijuana products.&#160;Shively said of the agreement, "We couldn't be happier with our partnership with Planda&#237;. Their Phytofare&#8482; technology appears to be years ahead of the competition as it relates to bioavailability and will help anchor the Diego brand as more states legalize cannabis for medical and/or recreational applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's face it no matter how controversial the debate, Jamen Shively has a platform and a rather large one at that, and it's that platform that should allow Diego Pellicer to become the brand at the tip of your tongue when you discuss cannabis. So, for Planda&#237;, that's not a bad ride to be on in what is the hottest debate in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Stock Market Media Group

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan's (JPM.N) board voted to raise Chief Executive Jamie Dimon's annual compensation for 2013, a turnaround from last year when it slashed his compensation by half in light of a trading debacle, the New York Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of meetings to formulate the pay package turned heated at times, with vocal minority of directors wanting to keep Dimon's compensation largely flat, citing about $20 billion in fines the bank paid in the last year to federal authorities, the paper said, citing several executives briefed on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there were other directors who argued that Dimon should be rewarded for his stewardship of the bank during such a difficult period, according to the paper. (link.reuters.com/ner36v)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the pay hike were not made public on Thursday, but could be disclosed in the coming days, possibly as soon as Friday, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is unlikely that Dimon will receive anything close to $23.1 million he got for 2011, when he was the highest-paid chief executive at a large bank, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the bank's board slashed Dimon's pay by half to $11.5 million after failures in the bank's chief investment office that led to $6.2 billion in trading losses -- an incident widely known as "London Whale trades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment to the newspaper.

      Coca-Cola Marks Underdog&#8217;s Crowning Moment in New Big Game Ad
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On Sunday, teams from Seattle and Denver won&#8217;t be the only ones trying 
      to go all the way. On game day, Coca-Cola will tell the story of a small 
      but determined high school football player who earns the confidence of 
      his team when he gets the game-time opportunity of a lifetime.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of two 60-second Big Game ads from Coca-Cola, &#8220;Going 
      All The Way&#8221; is an all-American tale of triumph over adversity. The 
      main character, Adrian, struggles to fit in and make his mark until the 
      opposing team fumbles the ball and it lands in his arms. That&#8217;s when 
      it&#8217;s Adrian&#8217;s time to shine. With support from his team and the crowd in 
      the stands, using sheer grit and determination, he breaks through, 
      perseveres and achieves unlikely greatness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Going All The Way&#8221; was shot in Ashwaubenon, a suburb of Green Bay, 
      Wis., with the final moments filmed at historic Lambeau Field. Most of 
      the ad&#8217;s cast 
      was made up of Green Bay-area residents, and the stadium&#8217;s actual 
      groundskeeper of 17 years has a featured role in the spot.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The
			commercial, set to House Of Pain&#8217;s &#8220;Jump Around,&#8221; traces 
      Adrian&#8217;s unlikely journey from benchwarmer to star of the game. After 
      scoring a touchdown, then running through the streets of Ashwaubenon, 
      his dreams are realized when he runs the length of Lambeau Field, 
      performs a touchdown dance and attempts his own Lambeau Leap in front of 
      a nearly empty stadium. He celebrates a moment of happiness and 
      accomplishment when a groundskeeper hands him an ice-cold Coca-Cola.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "'Going All The Way' is a story that celebrates a young man 
      accomplishing his dreams. It&#8217;s also a celebration of the amazing town of 
      Ashwaubenon, Wis. coming together and our wonderful partnership with the 
      city of Green Bay," said Katie Bayne, President, North America Brands, 
      Coca-Cola North America. "While Coca-Cola is a global brand, this ad 
      illustrates the deep roots it has in every community where it does 
      business. We are in every city and every town across the country, ready 
      to provide the kind of refreshing, uplifting moments of optimism Adrian 
      enjoys after his journey to Lambeau Field."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Going All The Way&#8221; will air during the second half of the Big Game. 
      Another 60-second advertisement from Coca-Cola will also be unveiled 
      during the second quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the eighth consecutive year Coca-Cola commercials will appear 
      during the Big Game broadcast. Coca-Cola worked with Wieden+Kennedy in 
      Portland, Ore. to create &#8220;Going All The Way.&#8221; The spot was directed by 
      Jake Scott and produced by RSA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Supporting Boys  Girls Clubs of America
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 127 years, Coca-Cola has been bringing people together to support 
      communities and organizations like Boys  Girls Clubs of America (BGCA).

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Representative Trey Radel, who was charged in November with buying cocaine, resigned from Congress on Monday, saying he could no longer effectively serve the people he represents in southern Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radel, 37, elected to the House of Representatives in 2012 backed by the conservative Tea Party movement, returned to Congress in January, six weeks after he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession and checked into a rehabilitation clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, some of my struggles had serious consequences. While I have dealt with those issues on a personal level, it is my belief that professionally I cannot fully and effectively serve as a United States Representative to the place I love and call home, Southwest Florida," he wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radel was charged with buying 3.5 grams of cocaine in Washington on October 29, in the presence of an undercover agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House Committee on Ethics in December said it would launch an investigation into whether Radel violated congressional rules or broke any other laws related to his responsibilities as a member of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radel had rebuffed calls for his resignation from the Republican Party of Florida and Governor Rick Scott as other Florida Republicans expressed interest in his seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I look forward to getting back to work next week, representing my neighbors in Southwest Florida as they face the burdens of Obamacare, a jobless recovery, and a federal government that continues to spend more than it takes in," Radel said in a statement in early January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent posting on his Twitter account was from January 3, when he said he took his son to his first movie. His last Facebook post, on January 15, discusses draft legislation he was working on targeting identity theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regardless of some personal struggles in 2013, this year has already been tremendously positive as I focus on my health, family and faith," Radel, who represents coastal areas such as Naples and Cape Coral in Florida's 19th district, wrote on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radel did not indicate what his plans were after leaving Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case against Radel stemmed from an investigation by FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration agents into cocaine trafficking in the Washington area, U.S. law enforcement officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radel was sentenced to one year of probation in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am so sorry to be here. I know I have let my constituents down, my country down and, most importantly, my family, including my wife and my 2-year-old, who doesn't know it yet," Radel told Judge Robert Tignor after pleading guilty to the misdemeanor charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Stephen Powell and Andrea Ricci)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Ransdell Pierson
    Jan 27 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Monday said one of
its experimental drugs had failed to meet its goals in two
late-stage studies among patients who had received prior
treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, the most
common form of the disease.
   Although Pfizer continues to test the drug, called
dacomitinib, in another Phase III study, hopes for its success
have now largely faded, according to ISI Group analyst Mark
Schoenebaum.
    "We believe consensus expectations (for the drug) will be
close to zero given today's readout" of unsuccessful trial
results, Schoenebaum said in a research note.
    In one of the failed trials, called ARCHER 1009, patients
given Pfizer's once-daily pill did not show improved survival
without the cancer worsening, compared with Roche Holding AG's
 widely used Tarceva (erlotinib). 
     Tarceva is the current standard of care in patients with
mutated forms of a protein called Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR). The protein plays a role in normal regulation
of cell growth, but when mutated is believed to cause cells to
proliferate and thereby help spur various types of cancer. 
    Dacomitinib is designed to block several types of Epidermal
Growth Factor receptors, while Tarceva and similar treatments
for lung cancer target only one type of receptor.         
    Cowen and Co had forecast annual sales of $500 million by
2020 for dacomitinib, if it were approved for lung cancer. That
would make it a moderate-sized product for Pfizer, the largest
U.S. drugmaker, which has annual revenue of $50 billion.
    Schoenebaum said there has been little investor interest in
the drug and that Wall Street had expected it to generate annual
sales of only $300 million by 2018.
    The second failed trial, named BR.26, involved patients that
previously had failed to benefit from chemotherapy as well as
from treatment with an EGFR inhibitor.
    Overall survival of patients taking the Pfizer drug was not
prolonged in the study, compared with patients given a placebo.
    Pfizer said adverse events seen with dacomitinib were
consistent with those seen in smaller earlier studies.
    In the meantime, Pfizer said dacomitinib is also being
tested in a third late-stage trial, called ARCHER 1050, among
patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have not
received prior treatment. The study will compare dacomitinib
with Iressa (gefitinib), an EGFR inhibitor sold by AstraZeneca
Plc. Results from that study are expected in 2015.
    Pfizer shares were little changed in morning trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;KIEV Jan 27 (Reuters) - The signing of a gas
production-sharing agreement between Ukraine and an
international consortium led by U.S. major Exxon Mobil 
has been postponed for the second time in a row, Ukraine's fuel
and energy minister said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We will sign it (the agreement) in February," Eduard
Stavytsky told reporters in brief remarks after an official
briefing. He did not give a reason for the fresh delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government orginally intended to sign the deal, which is
expected to bring Ukraine several billion cubic metres (bcm) of
gas per year, in November but Stavytsky postponed the decision
until January due to mass anti-government protests in Kiev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Ukraine selected a group of companies led by Exxon
Mobil to explore conventional gas deposits in the southern
Skifska area on the Black Sea shelf, which has a potential
output of 3 bcm of gas per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The postponed deal would have formalised a production
sharing agreement for these deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Russia agreed to cut gas prices for Ukraine by
a third after Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich walked away
from a trade agreement with Europe. Kiev said that a deal for
cheaper Russian gas would not affect its standing agreements
Western energy companies for shale gas exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAGOS Jan 27 (Reuters) - A Nigerian court upheld an order
on Monday barring Chevron from selling its onshore assets until
a legal dispute with local firm Brittania-U is resolved,
Brittania-U's lawyers said outside the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brittania-U alleges it had a deal with the U.S. oil major to
buy the assets, which Chevron denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The court upheld the interim order in favour of Brittania
to protect the assets while the substantive case is still being
determined," lawyer Rickey Tarfa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The judge said that the order needs to be in place until
the case is decided. The order restrains Chevron from
transferring the asset or doing anything with the assets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's lawyer at the Federal High Court in Lagos
declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nigerian firm, run by former Chevron executive Catherine
Uju Ifejika, was the highest bidder at over $1 billion for the
biggest cluster of blocks - OML 52, 53 and 55 - and Chevron
began discussions with the company over the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron decided to look at alternative bids after
Brittania-U failed to prove it could muster the sum promptly,
banking and oil industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the challenges being heard are whether or not the court
even has jurisdiction in the case.&lt;/p&gt;

      Card-linked offers stand at the unique intersection of the payments, 
      social media, advertising, and retail industries. As the &#8220;offers&#8221; space 
      has become more popular, consumers have often found it cumbersome to 
      take advantage of the variety and amount of offers available. 
      Card-linked offers help solve that problem by giving merchants and 
      advertisers the ability to deliver an offer or deal to consumers via 
      their credit, debit or other payment cards without having to use a paper 
      coupon, voucher or promotion code.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 27 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said its experimental
lung cancer drug failed to meet its goals in two late-stage

&lt;p&gt;The company said the drug, dacomitinib, did not show

compared with another non-small cell lung cancer drug. The
patients were previously treated with chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the drug did not prolong overall survival

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday that a China-based reporter for the New York Times broke rules on residence visas and would be leaving the country before the end of the week, in a case which could sour Beijing's relations with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

Chinese authorities then issued him a 30-day visa, valid until January 30, ostensibly to give him enough time to prepare to leave the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said Ramzy informed them in May that he was no longer working for Time magazine and he handed back his government-issued press card, which foreign reporters are required to have to report legally in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But Austin Ramzy did not, in accordance with Chinese regulations, apply to other Chinese departments to change his visa type and his residence permit type, which previously was for Time," Qin told a daily news briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regretfully, Austin Ramzy did not do this, and he continued to use his existing residence permit to come and go from China.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASTANA Jan 27 (Reuters) - Output from Chevron-led 
Tengizchevroil (TCO), Kazakhstan's largest oil producer, rose to
a record 27.1 million tonnes last year from 24.2 million in
2012, TCO General Director Tim Miller said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The huge Tengiz onshore field in western Kazakhstan is one
of the three main drivers of Kazakhstan's conservative plan to
raise oil output to at least 100 million tonnes by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output this year from the Central Asian nation, the
second-largest post-Soviet oil producer after Russia, is
forecast to rise to 83 million tonnes from 81.7 million in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2013, TCO achieved record production of 27.1 million
tonnes," Miller told a meeting of Kazakhstan's Oil &amp; Gas
Ministry. "Last year's TCO payments to Kazakhstan totalled just
under $15 billion. This, too, is a new record for TCO."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TCO makes payments to the government budget and to the
National Fund, which collects revenue from windfall oil exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TCO's future growth project for Tengiz, being implemented
now, will increase oil production at the field by about 12
million tonnes per year, Miller said, reiterating an earlier
estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He earlier had said the project would aim to start producing
more oil in 2018 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron holds 50 percent of TCO, while Exxon Mobil 
owns 25 percent, Kazakh state oil company KazMunaiGas 
20 percent and Lukarco, controlled by Lukoil, the
remaining 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides Tengiz, Kazakhstan plans to boost crude output by
developing the Kashagan offshore field in the Caspian and by an
expansion of the Karachaganak oil and gas condensate field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output at Kashagan, the world's biggest oil find in decades,
was launched in September but halted in early October after
leaks were detected in a gas pipeline running from the deposit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A consortium developing Kashagan expects to get the results
of pipeline tests next month and determine when output can be
resumed safely.&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Announces Top-Line Results From Two Phase 3 Trials Of 
      Dacomitinib In Patients With Refractory Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung 
      Cancer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			An Ongoing, Third Phase 3 Trial is Evaluating Dacomitinib in 
      First-Line in EGFR-Mutant NSCLC
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced top-line results from two 
      randomized Phase 3 studies of the irreversible pan-HER kinase inhibitor 
      dacomitinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Both trials evaluated dacomitinib in populations of previously treated 
      patients with advanced NSCLC. The ARCHER 1009 trial, which included 
      patients previously treated with chemotherapy (second/third line), did 
      not meet its objective of demonstrating statistically significant 
      improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with the 
      EGFR inhibitor erlotinib.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Separately, the NCIC CTG BR.26 trial, which included patients with 
      advanced NSCLC after standard therapy with both chemotherapy and an EGFR 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor had failed, did not meet its objective of 
      prolonging overall survival (OS) versus placebo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An ongoing, third Phase 3 trial, ARCHER 1050, is evaluating PFS of 
      dacomitinib in a different patient population than was studied in ARCHER 
      1009 and BR26. ARCHER 1050 compares dacomitinib versus gefitinib in 
      treatment-na&#239;ve (without prior treatment) patients with EGFR-mutant 
      advanced NSCLC. The results are expected in 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While we are disappointed in the results, lung cancer is a complex 
      disease, and the use of targeted agents to treat specific patient 
      populations continues to evolve,&#8221; said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice 
      president of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs and chief medical 
      officer for Pfizer Oncology. &#8220;We are analyzing the findings from both 
      ARCHER 1009 and BR.26 to better understand the effects of dacomitinib in 
      molecularly defined subgroups of patients with advanced NSCLC, including 
      those with EGFR mutations.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ARCHER 1009 trial evaluated dacomitinib versus erlotinib in two 
      co-primary populations of patients with advanced NSCLC previously 
      treated with at least one chemotherapy regimen &#8211; all patients and 
      patients with
			KRAS wild-type NSCLC. The study did not demonstrate 
      that dacomitinib improved PFS in either of the co-primary populations 
      compared to erlotinib.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The BR.26 trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study 
      evaluating dacomitinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
      NSCLC after prior treatment, which included at least one chemotherapy 
      regimen and one EGFR inhibitor treatment regimen. This study was 
      designed, conducted and led by NCIC Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to have had the opportunity to assess dacomitinib in the 
      BR.26 trial,&#8221; said Dr. Peter Ellis, BR.26 Study Chair and Associate 
      Professor in the Department of Oncology, McMaster University, and 
      medical oncologist at the Juravinski Cancer Centre, Hamilton, Ontario, 
      Canada. &#8220;While we are disappointed that the trial did not meet 
      its primary endpoint, we are supportive of Pfizer&#8217;s commitment to 
      continue to evaluate dacomitinib in the ARCHER 1050 trial.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In both studies, the adverse events observed for dacomitinib generally 
      were consistent with its known adverse event profile. Full efficacy and 
      safety data from ARCHER 1009 and BR.26 will be submitted for 
      presentation at an upcoming medical meeting.

			About Dacomitinib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dacomitinib is an oral, once-daily, irreversible pan-HER (pan-human 
      epidermal growth factor receptor) kinase inhibitor. 
      Dacomitinib&#160;irreversibly inhibits the kinase activity of HER1/EGFR, 
      HER2, and HER4 by binding covalently to the receptor tyrosine kinase 
      domains and preventing autophosphorylation, thereby inhibiting 
      downstream signaling and leading to tumor-growth inhibition and 
      apoptosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dacomitinib is an investigational compound and has not received 
      regulatory approval in any country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has entered into a collaborative development agreement with SFJ 
      Pharmaceuticals Group to conduct ARCHER 1050 across multiple sites in 
      Asia (including Japan) and Europe.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Jan 27 (Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry said on
Monday that a China-based reporter for the New York Times broke
rules on residence visas and would be leaving the country before
the end of the week, in a case which could sour Beijing's
relations with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of media freedom for foreign reporters in China
has attracted high-level concern in the United States,
especially over worries that the government is denying visas for
organisations that carry negative stories about China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden expressed concern,
while on a visit to Beijing, over China's efforts to restrict
the activities of foreign news organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither the New York Times Co nor Bloomberg News has
been given new journalist visas for more than a year after they
published stories about the wealth of family members of former
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and current President Xi Jinping,
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times applied for a journalist accreditation in
China for U.S. national Austin Ramzy in the middle of last year,
after he left Time magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramzy remained in the country on the visa that he had
received while working for Time, which was valid until the end
of 2013. Chinese authorities then issued him a 30-day visa,
valid until Jan. 30, ostensibly to give him enough time to
prepare to leave the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said Ramzy informed them
in May that he was no longer working for Time magazine and he
handed back his government-issued press card, which foreign
reporters are required to have to report legally in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But Austin Ramzy did not, in accordance with Chinese
regulations, apply to other Chinese departments to change his
visa type and his residence permit type, which previously was
for Time," Qin told a daily news briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regretfully, Austin Ramzy did not do this, and he continued
to use his existing residence permit to come and go from China.
So his actions were in contravention of China's rules," he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residence permits in China are contingent upon employment,
and foreign nationals are supposed to leave the country when
they no longer work for the organisation which sponsored their
residence permit, or else convert to another visa type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramzy declined to comment when reached by Reuters, and the
New York Times did not immediately respond to an emailed request
for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The NY Times, following rules, handed Foreign Ministry a
visa application for Austin Ramzy last June. They have not
approved it," Edward Wong, acting Beijing bureau chief for the
Times, said on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qin said that both the New York Times and Ramzy had admitted
to the Foreign Ministry to contravening China's rules, and that
the ministry had granted Ramzy a visa valid until the end of
January to give him time to sort out personal affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qin added that the Foreign Ministry was currently handling
the New York Times' request for accreditation for Ramzy, but
that it would not be completed before Jan. 31, implying that he
would have to leave when his visa expires on Jan. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that happens, Ramzy's case will be the second time in 13
months that a New York Times reporter has had to leave China.
Chris Buckley, a former Reuters journalist, had to leave Beijing
in December 2012 after the government did not approve his
accreditation for the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckley has not yet received approval to return to China as
a resident journalist. He works from Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper has another outstanding China visa
application, for Philip Pan, its Beijing bureau chief in
waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether China would grant journalist visas to either
Buckley or Pan, Qin said it was China's sovereign right to
decide to whom it granted journalist accreditations and visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign reporters working in China face numerous
difficulties, including interference, or even violence, when
covering sensitive issues such as protests and dissidents'
trials. China says foreign media are granted wide-ranging
freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, the Chinese government rejected a visa
application by Paul Mooney, an American journalist to whom
Thomson Reuters had extended an offer to work in China. The
government gave no reason for the rejection.

biggest cluster of blocks - OML 52, 53 and 55 - and Chevron had
begun discussions with the company over the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chevron decided to look at alternative bids after
Brittania-U did not show sufficient evidence it could muster the
amount promptly, industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MILAN Jan 27 (Reuters) - Veneto Banca's CEO said the bank
is prepared to consider possible merger proposals with the help
of Goldman Sachs, in line with a recommendation by
Italy's central bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlisted Veneto Banca is one of 15 Italian lenders under
scrutiny by the European Central Bank as it checks the health of
the banking sector before taking over supervision of euro zone
banks in November from national regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We respect suggestions and indications coming from the Bank
of Italy, which I imagine are guided by particular prudence
ahead of the single European supervisor," Chief Executive
Vincenzo Consoli told Affari weekly. "We will look at
possible options with adviser Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central bank has told Veneto Banca to consider possible
mergers after an on-site audit as part of efforts to strengthen
Italy's fragmented banking system and shore up lenders' capital
base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If anyone is interested then it is welcome to make an
offer," Consoli was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been speculation about a merger between Veneto
Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza, another cooperative lender
located, like Veneto Banca, in Italy's wealthy north-east.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consoli declined to say whether the Bank of Italy was
encouraging a specific merger with Banca Popolare di Vicenza,   
 "If (Popolare Vicenza) believes our bank is interesting then it
should present a good proposal and as a board we have no choice
but to assess it and present it to shareholders," Consoli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consoli said that a merger would mean selling or closing
down branches as the two banks are present in the same areas.

&lt;p&gt;* Stock futures jump after Turkey's central bank raises
rates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Apple shares drop on muted iPhone sales, outlook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Federal Reserve starts two-day policy meeting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dow up 0.6 pct; S 500 up 0.6 pct; Nasdaq up 0.4 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Caroline Valetkevitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded on
Tuesday after Pfizer's upbeat results gave investors some relief
from the pain of the Dow's five-day losing streak, and the
market's focus turned to the Federal Reserve's next move on
stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market's advance, which also broke the S 500's
three-day slide, came after heavy losses tied to concerns about
the withdrawal of U.S. monetary stimulus as well as worries
about emerging markets, including a slowdown in China's growth
and political turmoil from Turkey to Thailand. Last week, the
S 500 marked its worst percentage loss since June 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the close, U.S. stock index futures rallied after
Turkey's central bank sharply raised its interest rates, giving
further relief to investors. S 500 e-mini futures shot
up 20 points on volume of 1.7 million contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bucking the day's trend, the stock of Apple Inc 
dropped 8 percent to close at $506.50 - its worst slide in a
year - a day after holiday iPhone sales missed expectations.
Apple's slide limited the gains of the S 500 and the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer Inc jumped 2.6 percent to close at
$30.42, boosting both the Dow and S 500 after the biggest U.S.
drugmaker reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a reflex rally. It just technically looked deeply
oversold, so it was bound for a small short relief rally," said
Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson &amp; Co. in
Lake Oswego, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average rose 90.68 points or
0.57 percent, to end at 15,928.56. The S 500 gained
10.94 points or 0.61 percent, to finish at 1,792.50. The Nasdaq
Composite added 14.35 points or 0.35 percent, to close
at 4,097.96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 remains below its 50-day moving average, after
closing below it on Friday for the first time since Oct. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bright spot in the day's economic data was a report
showing U.S. consumer confidence rose in January. Consumers grew
more optimistic about both business conditions and the job
market, according to the Conference Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods
unexpectedly fell 4.3 percent in December, and a gauge of
planned business spending on capital goods also slid, which
could cast a shadow on an otherwise bright economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data preceded the start of the Fed's two-day policy
meeting. Investors are anxious to hear whether the Fed will cut
another $10 billion from its monthly bond-buying program. In
December, the central bank announced plans to scale back its
stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent soft economic data coupled with equity selling in the
United States and abroad may have some participants rethinking
what the Fed will do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perhaps there is a growing collection of wisdom (that) the
Fed may postpone its tapering," said Mark Luschini, chief
investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in
Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple shares fell to their lowest since October. The tech
bellwether's iPhone sales in the holiday shopping season missed
lofty expectations and the company forecast weak revenue for the
current quarter in its quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bell, shares of audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic Inc
, an Apple supplier, fell 4.6 percent to $17.87 as it
forecast fourth-quarter revenue far below Wall Street's
estimates. In the regular session, Cirrus shares declined 4.5
percent to end at $18.74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the regular session, activist investor Carl Icahn
said he bought another half-billion dollars' worth of Apple
stock, his third investment in the iPhone and iPad maker in less
than a week. The purchase increases his stake to more than $4
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another snapshot of the economy, U.S. single-family home
prices in November rose slightly more than expected from the
previous month, while the increase from a year ago was the
biggest in almost eight years, a closely watched survey showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume was slightly below average for the month. About 6.6
billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with
the average of 6.9 billion so far this month, according to data
from BATS Global Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advancers outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange by about 3 to 1. On the Nasdaq, two stocks rose for
every one that fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: United States M-Commerce Market Report 2012-2016: 
      ISIS, PayPal, Visa  Citibank Dominate the Market
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/fgjt28/mcommerce_market) 
      has announced the addition of the "United 
      States M-Commerce Market Report 2012-2016: ISIS, PayPal, Visa  Citibank 
      Dominate the Market" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The key driver is the high adoption of mobile devices
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US is among one of the leading nations in the world that fueled the 
      demand for, and, consequently, the growth of smartphones. In order to 
      attract more customers and facilitate more transactions on this 
      platform, mobile service providers are expanding their networks, and 
      also providing high-speed data transfer services. Mobile phone 
      application providers are increasingly creating applications that are 
      user-friendly and easy to use. As the use of mobile devices increases, 
      the adaption to mobile payments is also forecast to increase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Offers are always introduced to attract customers. Many retailers are 
      introducing mobile coupons that provide various offers and benefits for 
      consumers who shop through m-commerce. This encourages consumers to 
      purchase goods through m-commerce. As there is a demand for the virtual 
      wallet among smartphone users, the availability of mobile coupons will 
      encourage them to make mobile purchases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the key concerns in the market is 
      security, as mobile commerce involves the transfer of critical data over 
      the network. Consumers are increasingly becoming aware of the 
      consequences of data privacy and are emphasizing data-secure processes 
      and connections.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, helped by higher sales of drugs for cancer, nerve pain and arthritis, and forecast 2014 earnings in line with Wall Street estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. drugmaker said it earned $2.57 billion, or 40 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with $6.32 billion, or 86 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter when the company recorded a $4.8 billion gain from selling its nutritional products business to Swiss food group Nestle SA (NESN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 56 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 52 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For graphic, see link.reuters.com/ken46v)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said quarterly results were solid and driven by unexpectedly strong sales and lower-than-expected expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schott said investors remain focused mainly on the company's pipeline of experimental drugs, including a treatment for advanced breast cancer called palbociclib and studies to determine whether Pfizer's blockbuster Prevnar vaccine against pneumococcal bacteria can prevent pneumonia in adults age 65 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe Pfizer shares could see meaningful upside in the event of positive data for palbociclib," Schott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts expect the drug, which has been granted a "breakthrough" drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to garner annual sales of more than $5 billion if ongoing trials succeed and it is approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REALLY HUGE OPPORTUNITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a really huge opportunity," Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten said in an interview on Tuesday, adding that palbociclib could also hold promise in treating newly diagnosed and recurrent breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis AG (NOVN.VX) and Eli Lilly (LLY.N) are also racing to develop drugs similar to palbociclib, which is meant to stunt growth of cancer cells by blocking two enzymes, cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other drugmakers, including Merck &amp; Co (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), are racing to develop a different class of cancer drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that enable the immune system to recognize cancer cells and attack them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dolsten said Pfizer's own experimental immuno oncology drugs might be able to be used in combination with PD-1 inhibitors and other cancer drugs that target specific proteins. They include vaccines and antibody drug conjugates, which are antibodies that carry payloads of other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oncology has become one of Pfizer's biggest priorities, with the introductions of Xalkori for lung cancer in 2011, and approvals in 2012 of Inlyta for kidney cancer and Bosulif for chronic myelogenous leukemia last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company's oncology program suffered a setback on Monday when Pfizer said an experimental treatment for lung cancer, dacomitinib, failed to meet its goals in two late-stage studies among patients who had received prior treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's effective tax rate fell 2 percentage points to 27.7 percent in the fourth quarter, largely related to audit settlements with overseas governments, bolstering quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global company revenue fell 2 percent to $13.56 billion, hurt by competition from cheaper generic forms of its medicines. But they topped Wall Street forecasts of $13.35 billion. Revenue would have grown 1 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it expects full-year earnings in 2014, excluding special items, of $2.20 to $2.30 per share. That is roughly in line with Wall Street expectations of $2.28 per share, and assumes that Pfizer buys back $5 billion worth of its common stock during the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inlyta and Xalkori sales doubled in the quarter, to $102 million and $89 million, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lyrica, a Pfizer treatment for nerve pain that is its biggest product, rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter to $1.26 billion, while sales of Prevnar rose 3 percent to $1.1 billion. Sales of Enbrel, a treatment for psoriasis and arthritis, rose 5 percent to $1 billion. And Celebrex, used to treat pain and arthritis, rose 6 percent to $798 million. But sales of impotence treatment Viagra fell 14 percent to $476 million, hurt by sharply lower sales in overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company shares rose 3 percent to $30.54 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a 1.1 percent advance for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index .DRG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Sofina Mirza-Reid and Jonathan Oatis)&lt;/p&gt;

    Jan 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc reported
better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, helped
by higher sales of drugs for cancer, nerve pain and arthritis,
and forecast 2014 earnings in line with Wall Street estimates.
    The biggest U.S. drugmaker said it earned $2.57 billion, or
40 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with
$6.32 billion, or 86 cents per share, in the year-earlier
quarter when the company recorded a $4.8 billion gain from
selling its nutritional products business to Swiss food group
Nestle SA.
    Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 56 cents per share.
Analysts, on average, expected 52 cents per share, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

   JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said quarterly results were
solid and driven by unexpectedly strong sales and
lower-than-expected expenses.
    Schott said investors remain focused mainly on the company's
pipeline of experimental drugs, including a treatment for
advanced breast cancer called palbociclib and studies to
determine whether Pfizer's blockbuster Prevnar vaccine against
pneumococcal bacteria can prevent pneumonia in adults age 65 and
older.
    "We believe Pfizer shares could see meaningful upside in the
event of positive data for palbociclib," Schott said.
    Some analysts expect the drug, which has been granted a
"breakthrough" drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, to garner annual sales of more than $5 billion
if ongoing trials succeed and it is approved.
    
    REALLY HUGE OPPORTUNITY
    "It's a really huge opportunity," Pfizer research chief
Mikael Dolsten said in an interview on Tuesday, adding that
palbociclib could also hold promise in treating newly diagnosed
and recurrent breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer and other
malignancies.
    Novartis AG and Eli Lilly are also racing
to develop drugs similar to palbociclib, which is meant to stunt
growth of cancer cells by blocking two enzymes, cyclin-dependent
kinases 4 and 6.  
    Other drugmakers, including Merck &amp; Co and
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, are racing to develop a
different class of cancer drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that
enable the immune system to recognize cancer cells and attack
them.
    Dolsten said Pfizer's own experimental immuno oncology drugs
might be able to be used in combination with PD-1 inhibitors and
other cancer drugs that target specific proteins. They include
vaccines and antibody drug conjugates, which are antibodies that
carry payloads of other drugs.
    Oncology has become one of Pfizer's biggest priorities, with
the introductions of Xalkori for lung cancer in 2011, and
approvals in 2012 of Inlyta for kidney cancer and Bosulif for
chronic myelogenous leukemia last year.
    But the company's oncology program suffered a setback on
Monday when Pfizer said an experimental treatment for lung
cancer, dacomitinib, failed to meet its goals in two late-stage
studies among patients who had received prior treatment for
advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
    Pfizer's effective tax rate fell 2 percentage points to 27.7
percent in the fourth quarter, largely related to audit
settlements with overseas governments, bolstering quarterly
results.
    Global company revenue fell 2 percent to $13.56 billion,
hurt by competition from cheaper generic forms of its medicines.
But they topped Wall Street forecasts of $13.35 billion. Revenue
would have grown 1 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which
lowers the value of sales in overseas markets.
    Pfizer said it expects full-year earnings in 2014, excluding
special items, of $2.20 to $2.30 per share. That is roughly in
line with Wall Street expectations of $2.28 per share, and
assumes that Pfizer buys back $5 billion worth of its common
stock during the year. 
    Inlyta and Xalkori sales doubled in the quarter, to $102
million and $89 million, respectively.   
    Sales of Lyrica, a Pfizer treatment for nerve pain that is
its biggest product, rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter to
$1.26 billion, while sales of Prevnar rose 3 percent to $1.1
billion. Sales of Enbrel, a treatment for psoriasis and
arthritis, rose 5 percent to $1 billion. And Celebrex, used to
treat pain and arthritis, rose 6 percent to $798 million. But
sales of impotence treatment Viagra fell 14 percent to $476
million, hurt by sharply lower sales in overseas markets.
    Company shares rose 3 percent to $30.54 in afternoon trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a 1.1 percent advance for
the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index.

Dominating</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Market in 
      Korea 2014-2018 with Citrix Systems Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Vmware 
      Inc. Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3jxkw3/virtual_desktop) 
      has announced the addition of the "Virtual 
      Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Market in Korea 2014-2018" report 
      to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure market in Korea 
      to grow at a CAGR of 66.9 percent over the period 2013-2018. One of the 
      key factors contributing to this market growth is the increasing 
      adoption of cloud infrastructure. The Virtual Desktop Infrastructure 
      market in Korea has also been witnessing the increased demand for 
      virtualization. However, the need for huge capital investment in 
      restructuring the network to suit the requirements of virtualized 
      infrastructure could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key vendors dominating this space are Citrix Systems Inc., Microsoft 
      Corp., and Vmware Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other vendors mentioned in the report are Korea Telecom Corp., LG CNS, 
      LG Uplus Corp., Samsung SDS Co. Ltd., and SK Telecom Co. Ltd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: Korean 
      companies are now increasingly adopting virtualization techniques for 
      their mission critical applications. As virtualization offers 
      cost-effectiveness, it will help Korean organizations to remain agile, 
      which is crucial to the current economic situation. When an organization 
      suddenly needs to expand or contract, then server, storage, and desktop 
      virtualization helps in the scalability and in evading capital 
      expenditures. As far as security is concerned, the risk of cyber-attacks 
      reduces, as only the source and virtual system can be attacked. This 
      leads to less hardware spending by Korean companies, and more 
      utilization of resources held currently. Therefore, the emergence of 
      virtualization is expected to drive the growth of the market in the 
      coming years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the 
      increasing adoption of cloud infrastructures. The rapid adoption of 
      cloud technology can be attributed to the fact that both users and 
      providers need a better delivery mechanism that is ubiquitous, scalable, 
      and flexible.

The Ensim IaaS Manager, in concert with the Ensim Automation Suite, enables a complete end-to-end cloud services brokerage solution. This includes ordering, automated provisioning, usage tracking, billing and simplified self-service management for public, private, and hybrid cloud environments. IaaS manager supports multiple hypervisors, including Microsoft Corp.'s Windows Server with Hyper-V and Microsoft System Center 2012 R2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IaaS Manager, which also provides a complete multi-tenant front-end for System Center 2012 R2, enables enterprises and service providers to rapidly and effectively create and offer their own public or private cloud-based IaaS solutions via a robust service catalog; enables usage tracking with billing and chargeback; and provides simplified, consistent self-service operations administration for the end-user, IT admins, agents, and resellers, via an easy-to-use role-based portal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the Ensim solution, product managers can establish ideal pricing models, accurately track usage -- even at the most granular item level -- and provide automated upgrade / downgrade and upsize / downsize functionality, automating system-wide housekeeping. For a full list of IaaS Manager's features and benefits visit http://www.ensim.com/cloud-billing-provisioning-and-portal/cloud-service-broker/infrastructure-as-a-service.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is committed to the success of service providers and enterprises as they develop and deploy public and private cloud solutions," said Brian Hillger, director, product marketing, Microsoft. "We are pleased to see that Ensim, a valued member of the Microsoft System Center Alliance, is building on Windows Server 2012 R2 with Hyper-V and System Center 2012 R2 to help customers effectively model, deliver and charge for cloud-based offerings." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensim IaaS Manager is hardware and network agnostic and supports deployments on the leading infrastructure solutions such as Cisco, EMC, Hitachi, NetApp, Dell, IBM, HP and more.

"With support for the leading hypervisors, including Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware, KVM, and Xen, Ensim is making it easier than ever to take advantage of the cloud for IaaS needs." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With IaaS Manager, Ensim supports virtual machine management, including the ordering of both individual virtual machines (VPS), as well as the purchase, deployment and management of virtual data centers (VDC).&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the virtual data center model, a user orders a virtual data center based on overall capacity desired (CPU, memory, disk, etc.). Once it is purchased, an authorized user can deploy any available template, and apply as many resources as needed across as many virtual machines as desired within the purchased capacity of the virtual data center.&#160;The VDC model enabled by Ensim allows for rapid development cycles and puts the virtual data center owner in full control of managing the environment without having to make an additional purchase each time a new virtual machine is deployed.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the VPS model is often a more cost-effective option for smaller businesses.&#160;It provides an easier buying experience and a simplified administration portal with the ability for a single subscriber to maintain multiple predefined virtual servers connected in a single vLan. Users enjoy system administrator-level access to one or more virtual machines with their own operating system and bundled software, or can install any software that runs on that OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Ensim &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1998, Ensim is a leading provider of solutions to automate on-boarding, orchestration, provisioning, and management of users and organizations with business applications, services, and infrastructure in private, public, and hybrid clouds.

      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced today it will invest $1 
      million to fund higher education programs for U.S. military veterans 
      including grants to Florida State College at Jacksonville, University of 
      South Florida, The University of Texas at Arlington and San Diego State 
      University.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Education is a path to sustainable employment as well as family and 
      financial stability,&#8221; said Maureen Casey, the firm&#8217;s Director of 
      Military and Veterans Affairs. &#8220;By supporting educational opportunities 
      for veterans and their families we will cultivate and empower the next 
      greatest generation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Casey will discuss the college grants during her testimony today before 
      the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. The hearing will showcase the 
      private sector&#8217;s successful initiatives in hiring veterans &#8211; and 
      highlight what the federal government can learn from them. Education is 
      a key component of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s veterans employment strategy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Many veterans face unique challenges in educational settings related to 
      their military service, family status and attendance as non-traditional 
      students. JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s education grants will help U.S. colleges 
      build programs for veterans on campus, including orientation and bridge 
      programs, student services and enhancing the classroom experience with 
      the ultimate goal of increasing retention and graduation rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Experts from JPMorgan Chase and Syracuse University&#8217;s Institute for 
      Veterans and Military Families (IVMF) will provide technical assistance 
      to the grantees and will help develop best practices to share with other 
      higher education institutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s $1 million investment builds upon the company&#8217;s 
      existing commitment to veteran education. In 2011, the company and the 
      university co-founded the Institute for Veterans and Military Families 
      (IVMF), the first national center in higher education focused on social, 
      economic, education and policy issues affecting veterans and their 
      families post-service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Institute and JPMorgan Chase also launched the Veterans Career 
      Transition program, a tuition-free program for post-9/11 veterans and 
      military spouses to help with their transition back to civilian life. 
      The program offers three tracks with certification opportunities: 
      technology and operations, human resources and professional skills 
      studies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase recognizes the tremendous sacrifices that military 
      members and their families have made on behalf of all Americans. As a 
      result, the company has developed a firm-wide strategy focused on 
      employment, housing and education for returning veterans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In early 2011, JPMorgan Chase and 10 other companies launched the 
      100,000 Jobs Mission, pledging to hire a total of 100,000 veterans by 
      2020. Since then, 120 more companies from nearly every sector of the 
      U.S. economy have joined in, hiring 117,439 U.S. military veterans in 
      less than three years. The companies have now doubled their commitment &#8211; 
      to hiring 200,000 by 2020.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase itself has hired more than 6,300 veterans since 2011. It 
      has also provided more than 630 mortgage-free homes, amounting to more 
      than $102 million, to military families through its non-profit partners. 
      The bank refurbishes each home to meet the unique needs of the veteran.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN MATEO, Calif., Jan. 28, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AtHoc, Inc. today announced
that one of the most prominent military medical centers in the
world, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), has
successfully implemented the 
AtHoc Interactive Warning System (AtHoc IWS) for mass
notification and interactive hospital communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WRNMMC of Bethesda, Md., established in 2011, brings together
two renowned healthcare institutions, Walter Reed Army Medical
Center and the National Naval Medical Center, commonly recognized
as Bethesda Naval Hospital. This consolidated revitalization has
united the nation's foremost military healthcare systems on one
campus, culminating in "The Nation's Medical Center," a monumental
achievement in military medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WRNMMC has chosen AtHoc IWS for its network-based,
enterprise-wide notification and communication system as part of
their commitment to providing a safe and secure environment for the
dedicated care of presidents, dignitaries and wounded soldiers and
their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uniquely equipped for the healthcare environment, the AtHoc IWS
solution enables IP-based interaction among on-premise medical
staff. Designed to reach all 12,000 personnel with the touch of a
button, messages are rapidly delivered through pervasive computer
desktop pop-up alerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The people who come through our doors are here to heal, to stay
healthy and to help others," said Terry J. Prince, U.S. Navy,
WRNMMC command master chief. "The AtHoc solution helps us achieve
our mission in providing world-class health care by giving us the
ability to swiftly deliver hospital codes directly to key staff
members. We're also able to receive replies in real time,
accelerating emergency response. Installation was quick as well,
with non-disruptive integration into existing infrastructure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are proud and honored to provide a modern network-based
alerting system that supports those who serve our elected leaders
and, the true patriots, our wounded warriors," said Dave Brown,
vice president, AtHoc Defense and Intelligence Group. "Our mass
notification system brings an added dimension of confidence in an
environment where fast, trusted communications among highly
dispersed personnel is imperative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AtHoc IWS leverages the latest advances in mobile, cloud and IP
technologies that empower the healthcare enterprise to communicate,
interact and account for all personnel in critical situations.
Whether the need is disseminating hospital codes or&#160;providing
a layer of security monitoring, complex staff recall or emergency
response team notifications, AtHoc provides a next generation
solution that facilitates physical security, life safety and
continuity of patient care and operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AtHoc IWS unifies analog and digital systems over the IP network
and transforms disparate, existing systems into one complete
end-to-end mass communication tool while building a foundation for
future expansion. Converging physical security and safety into the
IP system, emergency managers are able to leverage all assets to
issue interactive warnings with enterprise-wide reach throughout an
entire healthcare facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alert messages are delivered through an extensive range of
channels and devices: sirens, radios, computer desktop pop-ups,
instant messages, digital signs, texts, emails, VoIP work phones,
mobile or smartphones and more. The push of a button activates all
of these systems for hospital-wide mass notification or targeted
alerts to specific buildings, medical staff or individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AtHoc's offerings are available as Software as a Service (SaaS),
on-premise and hybrid configurations, tailored to meet exact
customer operational needs and security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AtHoc will demonstrate the IWS solution at
the&#160;upcoming&#160;HIMSS
2014 Annual Conference  Exhibition&#160;in Orlando, Fla.,
Feb.&#160;23-27, 2014 at Booth #1413.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc reported better than
expected fourth-quarter results, helped by sales of new
treatments for cancer, nerve pain and arthritis.
    The biggest U.S. drugmaker on Tuesday said it earned $2.57
billion, or 40 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. That
compared with $6.32 billion, or 86 cents per share, in the
year-earlier quarter, when the company recorded a gain from
selling its nutritional products business to Swiss food group
Nestle SA.
    Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 56 cents per share.
Analysts, on average, expected 52 cents per share, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

			EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ian Read, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, &#8220;The 
      just-completed year was highlighted by solid financial performance and 
      shareholder-friendly capital allocation, a strengthening of our 
      innovative core as well as the formation of our new commercial structure 
      designed to enable each business to have a sharper focus on its distinct 
      market opportunities and challenges.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We enter 2014 with confidence in the competitive positioning of our 
      commercial businesses, the prospects for our recently launched products 
      and the strength of our research pipeline. We remain focused on those 
      areas and opportunities we believe will continue to create value for our 
      shareholders, and we seek to identify additional opportunities that will 
      strengthen our innovative and established pharmaceutical businesses as 
      well as our Consumer business. We will focus on advancing science and 
      innovation to deliver new therapies in areas with unmet need and 
      ensuring our shareholders' capital is allocated toward the most 
      attractive opportunities for value creation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Read continued, &#8220;During 2014, we expect to report on several, 
      important clinical data readouts for our mid- and late-stage pipeline 
      compounds. In the near term, we expect to report top-line results for 
      the Phase 2 study for palbociclib in patients with post-menopausal, 
      ER-positive, advanced breast cancer and for the CAPiTA study for Prevnar 
      13 in adults age 65 and older. In addition, we anticipate data 
      presentations at upcoming medical conferences of Phase 2b data for 
      bococizumab, our PCSK9 inhibitor for LDL cholesterol reduction, and 
      Phase 2a data for our staphylococcus aureus vaccine. During the 
      second quarter, we anticipate reporting top-line results for two pivotal 
      Phase 3 studies for Xeljanz in psoriasis.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We see attractive opportunities globally to deliver value to patients, 
      payors and other stakeholders through a combination of innovative, 
      established and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. I believe we 
      have the business structure, leadership team and financial capability 
      firmly in place to facilitate our continued success,&#8221; Mr. Read concluded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Frank D&#8217;Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, &#8220;For full-year 2013, I 
      am pleased with our financial performance, our strategic accomplishments 
      and our ability to continue delivering shareholder value through prudent 
      capital allocation. Regarding our financial performance, we achieved or 
      exceeded all elements of our 2013 financial guidance despite an 
      operating environment that remains challenging. We completed two 
      important strategic initiatives in 2013: the separation of our Animal 
      Health business through the disposition of Zoetis(3), and the 
      formation of the new commercial structure that was successfully 
      implemented at the start of 2014. Finally, we delivered significant 
      shareholder value through share repurchases and dividends. With our 
      strong operating cash flow as well as the proceeds generated from the 
      separations of our Nutrition and Animal Health businesses, we 
      repurchased $16.3 billion of our common stock in 2013. As a result of 
      those share repurchases as well as Pfizer common stock tendered in the 
      Zoetis(3) exchange offer, we reduced the number of shares of 
      outstanding common stock by approximately one billion, or 13%, in 2013 
      compared to year-end 2012. In addition, we paid $6.6 billion in 
      dividends. In total, we returned approximately $23 billion to 
      shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2013.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are also providing our 2014 financial guidance, including ranges for 
      adjusted revenues(2) of $49.2 to $51.2 billion and for 
      adjusted diluted EPS(2) of $2.20 to $2.30. Our guidance for 
      adjusted revenues(2) reflects the anticipated negative impact 
      of approximately $3.0 billion due to recent and expected product losses 
      of exclusivity, as well as the expiration and near-term termination of 
      certain collaboration agreements that continue to significantly 
      negatively impact alliance revenue, partially offset by anticipated 
      revenue growth from certain other products. We expect adjusted RD 
      expenses(2) to be between $6.4 billion and $6.9 billion, 
      which reflects the late-2013 and early-2014 initiations of Phase 3 
      clinical programs for certain pipeline compounds. Lastly, our reported(1) 
      and adjusted(2) diluted EPS guidance reflects anticipated 
      share repurchases totaling approximately $5 billion this year. These 
      planned repurchases will more than offset the potential dilution related 
      to employee compensation programs,&#8221; concluded Mr. D&#8217;Amelio.

			QUARTERLY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Fourth-Quarter 2013 vs. 
      Fourth-Quarter 2012)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Reported revenues(1) decreased $333 million, or 2%, which 
        reflects operational growth of $64 million, or 1%, and the unfavorable 
        impact of foreign exchange of $397 million, or 3%. The operational 
        increase was primarily due to the strong growth of Lyrica, Inlyta and 
        Xalkori globally, Enbrel outside of North America, as well as 
        Celebrex, Eliquis and Xeljanz, primarily in the U.S. In addition, 
        fourth-quarter 2013 reported revenues(1) included $65 
        million from the transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with 
        Zoetis(3). Revenues were negatively impacted primarily by 
        the expiration on October 31, 2013 of the collaboration agreement for 
        Enbrel in North America, continued erosion for branded Lipitor in 
        developed Europe and certain other developed markets, the ongoing 
        expiration of the Spiriva collaboration in certain countries, other 
        product losses of exclusivity in certain markets, decreased government 
        purchases of Prevnar in certain emerging markets, and various other 
        events.
      
			
        Business unit revenues were impacted by the following:

        
					
            Primary Care: Revenues declined 8% operationally, primarily due to 
            the shift in the reporting of Lipitor revenues in developed Europe 
            and Australia to the Established Products unit beginning January 
            1, 2013, as well as certain other product losses of exclusivity in 
            various markets, including Viagra in most major European markets 
            in June 2013 and Lyrica in Canada in February 2013, and the 
            termination of the co-promotion agreement for Aricept in Japan in 
            December 2012. Additionally, in the U.S. and certain European 
            countries, the co-promotion collaboration for Spiriva is in its 
            final year, which, per the terms of the collaboration agreement, 
            has resulted in a decline in Pfizer&#8217;s share of Spiriva revenues; 
            the agreement has terminated in certain other countries. These 
            declines were partially offset by the strong operational 
            performance of Lyrica in developed markets as well as Celebrex, 
            Eliquis and Premarin, primarily in the U.S.
          
					
            Specialty Care: Revenues decreased 5% operationally, primarily due 
            to the expiration of the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in 
            North America on October 31, 2013; for a 36-month period 
            thereafter, Pfizer is entitled to royalty payments that are 
            expected to be significantly less than the share of Enbrel profits 
            prior to the expiration of the collaboration agreement, and those 
            royalty payments are and will be included in Other 
            (income)/deductions&#8211;net rather than in Revenues. 
            Revenues were also negatively impacted by the shift in the 
            reporting of Geodon and Revatio revenues in the U.S. and 
            Xalabrands revenues in developed Europe and Australia to the 
            Established Products unit beginning January 1, 2013. These 
            declines were partially offset by the growth of Prevnar, Enbrel 
            outside of North America as well as Xeljanz and the hemophilia 
            portfolio (BeneFIX and ReFacto AF/Xyntha) in the U.S.
          
					
            Emerging Markets: Revenues grew 9% operationally, primarily due to 
            volume growth in China, most notably for Lipitor, which was 
            partially offset by the impact of the transfer of certain product 
            rights to the Pfizer-Hisun joint venture in first-quarter 2013. 
            Revenues were also negatively impacted by decreased government 
            purchases of&#160;Prevnar&#160;as well as government cost-containment 
            measures in certain other emerging markets.
          
					
            Established Products: Revenues increased 6% operationally. This 
            performance was driven by the favorable impact of revenues from 
            products in certain markets that were shifted to the Established 
            Products unit from other business units beginning January 1, 2013, 
            including Lipitor, Caduet and Xalbrands in developed Europe and 
            Australia and Geodon in the U.S., as well as the contribution from 
            the collaboration with Mylan Inc. to market generic drugs in 
            Japan. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by the continued erosion 
            of branded Lipitor in Japan due to generic competition and 
            additional generic competition for Metaxalone/Skelaxin in the U.S.
          
					
            Consumer Healthcare: Revenues increased 2% operationally, 
            primarily due to strong emerging markets growth for core 
            supplement products, including Centrum and Caltrate, as a result 
            of several recent product launches and increased promotional 
            activities in those markets, as well as growth of Emergen-C in the 
            U.S. due to additional promotional activities. This growth was 
            partially offset by a decline in revenues for pain management 
            products in the U.S., primarily due to increased competition 
            resulting from the return to the market of certain competing 
            analgesic brands.
          
					
            Oncology: Revenues increased 29% operationally, driven by the 
            continued solid uptake of new products, most notably Inlyta and 
            Xalkori in several major markets. Inlyta&#8217;s market share is stable 
            in the U.S. and continues to increase in international developed 
            markets as physician and patient feedback remains positive both in 
            terms of efficacy and tolerability, and as pricing and 
            reimbursement are being granted in additional developed Europe 
            markets. Revenues were negatively impacted by the performance of 
            Sutent due to increased competitive pressures in certain 
            international developed markets as well as government 
            cost-containment measures in certain European markets.
          
				
			
		
		
			
        Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SIA expenses and adjusted RD 
        expenses(2) in the aggregate were flat operationally. 
        Overall, they decreased $291 million, or 3%, primarily reflecting 
        the&#160;favorable impact of foreign exchange and the benefits of 
        cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, partially offset by 
        higher adjusted cost of sales(2) on an operational basis 
        due to an unfavorable shift in product mix and adjusted SIA expenses(2) 
        to support several new product launches.
      
			
        The effective tax rate on adjusted income(2) declined 2.0 
        percentage points to 27.7% from 29.7%. This decline was primarily due 
        to an increase in tax benefits compared to fourth-quarter 2012 related 
        to audit settlements with foreign jurisdictions for multiple years and 
        the extension of the U.S. research and development tax credit that was 
        signed into law in January 2013, partially offset by a change in the 
        jurisdictional mix of earnings.
      
			
        The diluted weighted-average shares outstanding declined by 
        approximately 862 million shares, due to the company&#8217;s ongoing share 
        repurchase program and the impact of the Zoetis(3) exchange 
        offer, which was completed on June 24, 2013.
      
			
        In addition to the aforementioned factors, fourth-quarter 2013 
        reported earnings were significantly unfavorably impacted by the 
        non-recurrence of income from discontinued operations attributable to 
        the company&#8217;s Animal Health and Nutrition businesses, including the 
        gain on the sale of the Nutrition business, in the year-ago quarter. 
        Reported earnings were favorably impacted by a lower effective tax 
        rate, lower charges related to asset impairments and legal matters, 
        and lower acquisition-related expenses. The effective tax rate on 
        reported income(1) decreased in fourth-quarter 2013 in 
        comparison with the year-ago quarter primarily due to an increase in 
        tax benefits related to an audit settlement with the U.S. Internal 
        Revenue Service as well as audit settlements with foreign 
        jurisdictions for multiple years.

			FULL-YEAR FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Full-Year 2013 vs. Full-Year 2012)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Reported revenues(1) decreased $3.1 billion, or 6%, which 
        reflects an operational decline of $1.9 billion, or 4%, and the 
        unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.2 billion, or 2%. In 
        addition to the aforementioned factors that negatively impacted 
        fourth-quarter 2013 revenues, full-year 2013 revenues were negatively 
        impacted by erosion of branded Lipitor in the U.S. and decreased 
        government purchases of Enbrel in certain emerging markets. Revenues 
        were positively impacted by the operational growth of Lyrica, 
        Celebrex, Inlyta and Xalkori globally, Eliquis and Xeljanz in the 
        U.S., as well as the contribution from the collaboration with Mylan 
        Inc. to market generic drugs in Japan. In addition, reported revenues(1) 
        in full-year 2013 included $132 million from the transitional 
        manufacturing and supply agreements with Zoetis(3).
      
			
        Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SIA expenses and adjusted RD 
        expenses(2) in the aggregate decreased $1.5 billion, or 5%, 
        primarily reflecting the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity 
        initiatives, the non-recurrence of a $250 million payment included in 
        adjusted RD expenses(2) in third-quarter 2012 to 
        obtain the exclusive global over-the-counter rights to Nexium, and 
        the&#160;favorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher 
        adjusted cost of sales(2) on an operational basis due to an 
        unfavorable shift in product mix and adjusted SIA expenses(2) 
        to support several new product launches.
      
			
        The effective tax rate on adjusted income(2) declined 1.2

        signed into law in January 2013.
      
			
        The diluted weighted-average shares outstanding declined by 
        approximately 613 million shares, due to the company&#8217;s ongoing share 
        repurchase program and the partial-year impact of the Zoetis(3)

		&lt;p&gt;
      Unfavorable impacts:

				Viagra -- Pfizer settled its litigation against Teva 
        Pharmaceuticals, USA Inc. (Teva) relating to Pfizer&#8217;s patent covering 
        the use of Viagra to treat erectile dysfunction, which expires in 
        April 2020 (including pediatric exclusivity). As a result of the 
        settlement, Teva will be allowed to launch a generic version of Viagra 
        in the U.S. on December 11, 2017, or earlier under certain 
        circumstances. Teva will pay Pfizer a royalty for a license to produce 
        its generic version. The terms of the settlement agreement are 
        otherwise confidential.
      
			
				Xalkori -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted 
        regular approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic 
        ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as detected by an 
        FDA-approved test. Xalkori was previously granted accelerated approval 
        in August 2011 due to the critical need for new agents for people 
        living with ALK-positive NSCLC.
      
			
				Xeljanz
				
					
            The FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to 
            include additional patient-reported outcomes data in the label for 
            adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. 
            These additional data show improvement in patients receiving 
            Xeljanz based on health-related outcome measures reported by 
            patients.
          
					
            The top-line results were announced from the first two (OPT 
            Compare and OPT Retreatment) of five Phase 3 clinical trials in 
            adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. In OPT 
            Compare, Xeljanz met the primary endpoint of non-inferiority to 
            high-dose Enbrel at the 10 mg twice-daily (BID) dose, but did not 
            at the 5 mg BID dose. In OPT Retreatment, Xeljanz met the primary 
            efficacy endpoints at the 5 and 10 mg BID doses by demonstrating 
            that a greater proportion of patients continuing Xeljanz treatment 
            maintained their response during the treatment-withdrawal phase 
            compared to patients who switched to placebo. Additionally, among 
            patients who lost an adequate response, many were able to 
            recapture their response upon retreatment with Xeljanz. No new 
            safety signals were observed in these two studies.
          
				
			
		
		
			
				Eliquis -- The FDA accepted for review an sNDA for Eliquis for 
        the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism 
        (PE), and for the reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE. The 
        Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the 
        FDA is August 25, 2014. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency 
        accepted for review an application for Eliquis for the treatment of 
        DVT and PE, and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE.
      
			
				Duavee -- The FDA approved Duavee (0.45 mg/20 mg tablets), a 
        novel therapy for women with a uterus, for the treatment of 
        moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and 
        the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Duavee is expected to 
        be available in the U.S. in February 2014.
      
			
				Embeda -- The FDA approved a Prior Approval Supplement for 
        Embeda Extended Release Capsules CII. The Prior Approval Supplement 
        included an update to the Embeda manufacturing process that addressed 
        the pre-specified stability requirement that led to the voluntary 
        recall of Embeda from the market in March 2011. Pfizer anticipates 
        product availability beginning in the second quarter of 2014.
      
			
				Remoxy -- Pfizer will continue the development program for 
        Remoxy Extended-Release Capsules CII. Having achieved technical 
        milestones related to manufacturing and following guidance received 
        from the FDA in 2013, Pfizer is proceeding with the additional 
        clinical studies and other actions required to address the Complete 
        Response Letter received in June 2011. As previously disclosed, the 
        complete response submission is not expected to occur prior to 
        mid-2015.

				Palbociclib
				
					
            A Phase 3 trial (PENELOPE-B) in early-stage breast cancer began 
            enrolling patients. This is a randomized global study that will 
            evaluate palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy versus 
            placebo plus endocrine therapy in prolonging 
            investigator-assessed, invasive disease-free survival in women 
            with hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth 
            factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) early-stage breast cancer with 
            high risk of relapse after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This trial is 
            sponsored by the German Breast Group, a leading cooperative group 
            with extensive experience conducting clinical trials in breast 
            cancer, in collaboration with Pfizer.
          
					
            Pfizer entered into an agreement with GSK to&#160;explore the 
            anti-cancer efficacy and the safety of GSK&#8217;s trametinib 
            (GSK1120212)&#160;combined with palbociclib in a Phase I/II study in 
            patients with advanced/metastatic melanoma. The two companies will 
            collaborate on the study, which GSK will conduct.
          
				
			
		
		
			
				Dacomitinib -- Pfizer announced top-line results from two Phase 
        3 studies of dacomitinib in patients with previously treated advanced 
        NSCLC. Neither study met its primary endpoint. In the ARCHER 1009 
        trial, dacomitinib did not demonstrate statistically significant 
        improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with

				ALO-02 --
				Pfizer announced top-line results from a Phase 
        3 study of ALO-02 (oxycodone hydrochloride and naltrexone 
        hydrochloride extended-release capsules) in patients with 
        moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain. In this study, ALO-02 met 
        the primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating a statistically 
        significant difference from placebo in the mean change in the daily 
        average pain numerical rating scale scores from baseline to the final 
        two weeks of the double-blind treatment period.
      
			
				Tafamidis -- Pfizer initiated a global Phase 3 program for 
        tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy (TTR-CM), the first study of 
        its kind in this rare, progressive and universally fatal disease. 
        Tafamidis is approved for the treatment of transthyretin familial 
        amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) in the European Union and Japan under 
        the trade name Vyndaqel.
      
			
				Bococizumab (RN316) --&#160;The Phase 3 program was 
        initiated for this PCSK9&#160;monoclonal antibody to lower LDL cholesterol. 
        This is a global program expected to involve more than 22,000 
        patients, which includes multiple lipid-lowering studies as well as 
        two cardiovascular outcomes studies. This program includes the 
        broadest range of high-risk patients including a focus on patients in 
        greatest need of LDL-lowering.
      
			
				Ertugliflozin --&#160;Pfizer in&#160;collaboration 
        with Merck initiated a Phase 3 program for this SGLT2 inhibitor for 
        the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
      
			
				Tanezumab --&#160;Pfizer entered into a collaboration 
        agreement with Eli Lilly  Company (Lilly) to jointly develop and 
        globally commercialize tanezumab, which provides that Pfizer and Lilly 
        will equally share product-development expenses as well as potential 
        revenues and certain product-related costs. The tanezumab program 
        currently is subject to a partial clinical hold by the FDA pending 
        submission of nonclinical data to the&#160;FDA. Pfizer now anticipates 
        submitting that data by the end of 2014.

        Pfizer successfully implemented its previously announced plans to 
        internally separate its commercial operations into three businesses at 
        the start of the 2014 fiscal year. The company remains on track to 
        provide greater financial transparency for each of these businesses 
        beginning with first-quarter 2014 financial results.

            Results of Operations section of Pfizer&#8217;s Quarterly Report on Form

            The Provision for taxes on income for fourth-quarter and 
            full-year 2013 was favorably impacted by U.S. tax benefits of 
            approximately $430 million, representing tax and interest, 
            resulting from a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service 
            (IRS) with respect to audits of the Wyeth tax returns for the 
            years 2006 through date of acquisition. Full-year 2013 was also 
            favorably impacted by international tax benefits of approximately 
            $470 million, most of which occurred in the fourth quarter, 
            representing tax and interest, resulting from the resolution of 
            certain tax positions pertaining to prior years with various 
            foreign tax authorities and from the expiration of certain 
            statutes of limitations, as well as the extension of the U.S. 
            research and development tax credit that was signed into law in 
            January 2013. The Provision for taxes on income for 
            full-year 2012 was favorably impacted by a $1.1 billion settlement 
            (representing tax and interest) with the IRS related to audits for 
            multiple tax years, as well as approximately $300 million related 
            to the resolution of foreign audits pertaining to multiple tax 
            years, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the 
            non-deductibility of a legal charge related to Rapamune.

            pre-tax amounts and applying that jurisdiction&#8217;s applicable tax 
            rate. The fourth quarter of 2013 was favorably impacted by U.S. 
            tax benefits of approximately $430 million, representing tax and 
            interest, resulting from a settlement with the U.S. Internal 
            Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to audits of the Wyeth tax 
            returns for the years 2006 through date of acquisition. The 
            full-year 2013 was unfavorably impacted by (i) the tax liability 
            associated with the patent litigation settlement income, (ii) the 
            non-deductibility of goodwill derecognized and the jurisdictional 
            mix of the other intangible assets divested as part of the 
            transfer of certain product rights to Pfizer's 49%-owned 
            equity-method investment in China, and (iii) the non-deductibility

            40%-owned generics company in Brazil since we expect to retain the

          Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted 
          diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for 
          U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. Despite the 
          importance of these measures to management in goal setting and 
          performance measurement, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components 
          and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are Non-GAAP financial measures 
          that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, 
          therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of 
          the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its 
          components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net 
          income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to 
          the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Non-GAAP 
          Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS

      and projected future results are the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        the outcome of research and development activities, including, without 
        limitation, the ability to meet anticipated clinical trial 
        commencement and completion dates, regulatory submission and approval 
        dates, and launch dates for product candidates, as well as the

        product launches may be achieved;
      
			
        the outcome of post-approval clinical trials, which could result in 
        the loss of marketing approval for a product or changes in the

        products, private label products and product candidates that treat 
        diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs 
        and drug candidates;
      
			
        the implementation by the FDA of an abbreviated legal pathway to 
        approve biosimilar products, which could subject our biologic products 
        to competition from biosimilar products in the U.S., with attendant 
        competitive pressures, after the expiration of any applicable 
        exclusivity period and patent rights;

        and approval activities or to satisfy its financial obligations, 
        including under Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly funded or 
        subsidized health programs, that may result from the possible failure 
        of the U.S. federal government in the future to provide funding to

        enforcement of or to increase the federal debt ceiling;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday that a China-based reporter for the New York Times broke rules on residence visas and would be leaving the country before the end of the week, in a case which could sour Beijing's relations with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

Chinese authorities then issued him a 30-day visa, valid until January 30, ostensibly to give him enough time to prepare to leave the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said Ramzy informed them in May that he was no longer working for Time magazine and he handed back his government-issued press card, which foreign reporters are required to have to report legally in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But Austin Ramzy did not, in accordance with Chinese regulations, apply to other Chinese departments to change his visa type and his residence permit type, which previously was for Time," Qin told a daily news briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regretfully, Austin Ramzy did not do this, and he continued to use his existing residence permit to come and go from China.

      Fitch Downgrades 1 Distressed Class of JPMCC 2007-CIBC20
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded one distressed class and affirmed 18 
      classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 
      (JPMCC) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 
      2007-CIBC20. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 8.5% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 10.5%, including $98.2 million (3.9% of 
      the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has 
      designated 39 loans (27.1%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 
      seven specially serviced assets (7.5%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrade is a result of principal losses incurred due to recent 
      loan liquidations. The affirmations are due to increasing credit 
      enhancement and continued paydown. As of the January 2014 distribution 
      date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 21.6% 
      to $1.99 billion from $2.54 billion at issuance. No loans are defeased. 
      Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes M through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is the Colony Portfolio VII 
      loan (5.4% of the pool), which is secured by five industrial properties 
      and 4 office properties located in MO, GA, IL, KS, CA, CO. The loan was 
      specially serviced at the time of Fitch's last rating action in February 
      2013 due to a maturity default. The loan was modified in November 2012 
      to a single note with three component notes/tranches and its maturity 
      extended to Oct. 1, 2014 from Oct. 1, 2012 for Note A, and from Oct. 1, 
      2013 to Oct. 1, 2014 for Note B; Note C remains a maturity of Oct. 1, 
      2014. The portfolio has suffered declines in occupancy and base rent 
      since 2011. As of September 2013 the portfolio is 89.3% occupied down 
      from 96.4% at issuance. The property has experienced a 25% decline in 
      net operating income (NOI) as of year-end (YE) 2012 compared with YE 
      2011.

      The next largest contributor to expected losses is the North Hills Mall 
      loan (7.1%), which is secured by a 577,383 sf regional lifestyle center 
      located in Raleigh, NC within the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill MSA, 
      referred to as 'The Research Triangle'. The property is anchored by J.C. 
      Penney, Regal Entertainment, REI, Gold's Gym, and a non-collateral 
      Target. In addition to the retail component, there is a 101,423 sf 
      office component. A 200-room Renaissance Hotel that is not party of the 
      collateral opened in 2008 at the eastern end of the center. Property 
      performance has struggled since issuance, but YE 2012 DSCR has improved 
      to 1.18x from 1.06x YE 2011. As of As of October 2013, the mall is 96.3% 
      occupied or 96.9% including the office component. There are 
      approximately 11% of the leases rolling in 2014 and 18% in 2015. Per 
      REIS as of 3Q 2013, the Raleigh-Durham retail market had a vacancy rate 
      of 8.8% with asking rents at $19.41.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is the 
      specially-serviced STF Portfolio loan (2.1%), originally secured by a 
      portfolio of 19 properties totaling 1.2 million sf located in TX, and 
      NM. The loan was transferred to special servicing in August 2010 for 
      payment default. Per the special servicer, 18 of the 19 properties have 
      been sold. The only remaining property is 2660 Airport Road located in 
      San Theresa, NM. As of November 2013, the property is 61.3% occupied by 
      Anamarc Enterprises through April 2015. The special servicer is 
      currently reevaluating their marketing strategy and has ordered a new 
      appraisal.

Morgan for Engaging in Speculating With U.S. Treasury STRIPS in $5 Million Discretionary Account</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAPLES, Fla., Jan. 29, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Similar to other multi-million dollar claims filed recently by investors rights law firm of Vernon Healy, this claim filed against J.P. Morgan today addresses what the law firm believes to be deceptive sales strategies designed to appeal to high net worth investors. "We see a recent trend in pitching 'risk management' as a sales tool," explained attorney Chris Vernon. The investors drawn to these types of sales pitches by Wall Street firms and Family Offices want to focus on reasonable returns with downside protection, not speculate with their net worth. But, according to Vernon, "Too often, investment firms sell strategies that result in devastating losses to investors who were trying to avoid speculative investing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In the J.P. Morgan case filed today, the financial advisor exercised both discretion and direction over the client's account. The advisor, who is based out of a California office of J.P. Morgan, has a number of investor complaints that have resulted in FINRA arbitration claims filed against J.P. Morgan as his employer. Although the complaining investors are from diverse states-- New Jersey, Washington, Florida, and California--the substance of virtually all the complaints seem to involve U.S. Treasury STRIPS or other government debt. Like the Claim filed today, the FINRA arbitration claims filed by his other customers collectively include allegations of: misrepresentation of the level of risk, misrepresentation of the risk associated with the recommended strategy, over-concentration of the account, breach of fiduciary duty, failure to follow instructions and inappropriate use of margin and leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	According to the claim filed by Vernon Healy (and consistent with other investor complaints against J.P. Morgan), this financial advisor exposed clients to an inappropriate level of risk by making a speculative bet that U.S. Government debt would fall in value. Again, Vernon Healy sees this as a troubling industry-wide trend of luring conservative high net worth investors into high-risk strategies falsely promoted as low risk/reasonable return strategies.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Claim filed today alleges that J.P. Morgan and its advisor's use of margin and leverage compounded the harm caused by the incompetent investment advice. According to the Claim, at one point the margin balance in this customer's account spiked to more than $2 million. This added to the leverage imbedded within the U.S. Treasury STRIPS strategy used by J.P. Morgan's advisor. Because STRIPS are traded at deep discounts to maturity value in lieu of interest, they are more volatile than traditional U.S. Treasuries. Thus, in effect, there were two levels of leverage in this strategy, according to the Claim. The first level of leverage was at the account level with the utilization of margin; the second level of leverage was at the position level with the use of STRIPS, which are typically much more volatile than Treasuries with the same maturity.&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Claim also argues that the J.P. Morgan advisor evolved his short selling of these STRIPS into more and more distant maturities, which further increased the risks of these investments.&#160;Notably, the lion's share of the alleged losses from this shorting of STRIPS resulted from the trades in the longest maturity STRIPS.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Just like a hedge fund, J.P. Morgan not only charged management fees but also charged performance or incentive fees.&#160;According to the Claim, these types of fees actually incentivized its advisors to take risks with clients' money because it resulted in extra fees for successful bets (and no reimbursement of incentive fees if the gains are reversed or losses are suffered). It is hard for firms like J.P. Morgan to justify that the success of a portfolio should be measured over a long period of time by the client when incentive fees are collected annually.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Although the Claim we filed today is against J.P. Morgan, others are following the same disturbing trend," warned attorney Chris Vernon. The Vernon Healy firm is currently conducting an aggressive nationwide and international investigation into similar practices on behalf of clients of other firms that cater to high net worth investors.&#160;Specifically, Vernon Healy believes that firms such as J.P. Morgan and its Wall Street competitors (as well as Trust Companies and Multi Family Offices) often lead such investors to believe these investment strategies are customized and that the risks are managed to a far greater extent than they are. Chris Vernon predicts that this is just the beginning, "Unfortunately, these marketing pitches will likely continue as long as they generate more in fees than what is paid out in lawsuits and arbitrations."&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Based in Naples, Florida, the securities attorneys at the Vernon Healy law firm have conducted aggressive nationwide investigations of hedge funds, fund of fund hedge funds, managed futures, structured products, reverse convertibles, municipal bonds, bond funds, Puerto Rico bonds, non-traded REITs, private equity, EB-5, complex insurance products and strategies, TICS, and various securities fraud cases and Ponzi schemes. The firm's investigations and advocacy on behalf of investors have been featured in AARP magazine and Forbes.&#160;More recently, one of Vernon Healy's ongoing investigations was reported in Barron's.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Chris Vernon

      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) today announced it has created a new 
      CDFI Collaboratives program and awarded through its Foundation $33 
      million to community development financial institutions (CDFIs) across 
      the U.S. This first-of-its-kind program creates partnerships among CDFIs 
      to help them build capacity, improve access to capital for small 
      businesses, affordable housing and healthy food networks, and create 
      economic growth in distressed and underserved communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;CDFIs have long been critical change agents in underserved communities, 
      helping to promote economic revitalization and create opportunities for 
      low- and moderate-income people that otherwise would not exist,&#8221; said 
      Janis Bowdler, Senior Program Director for Financial Capability and 
      Affordable Housing, JPMorgan Chase Foundation. &#8220;This innovative program 
      will enable our CDFI partners to serve more residents in high-need 
      communities and help drive lasting economic growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s CDFI Collaboratives program, 27 CDFIs have come 
      together to form seven Collaboratives that will work in 21 states across 
      the U.S. The Collaboratives are organized around a common community 
      development challenge, such as growing small businesses, creating 
      affordable housing and improving access to fresh food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      economic growth in distressed and underserved communities.

      S&#220;SS MicroTec AG: Installation of ELP300 Excimer Laser Stepper and Joint 
      Development Agreement with IBM for Advanced Packaging and 3D Integration
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SUSS MicroTec, a global supplier of equipment and process solutions for 
      the semiconductor industry and related markets, announces the extension 
      of a joint development agreement (JDA) with the IBM Corporation. SUSS 
      MicroTec Photonic Systems Inc, a subsidiary of SUSS MicroTec, recently 
      installed a ELP300 Excimer laser stepper system at IBM. The installation 
      of the Excimer laser system, and the JDA extension under this alliance, 
      will serve to further develop, enhance and propel the application of 
      Excimer laser technologies in the realm of advanced semiconductor 
      packaging - including 3D systems integration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Excimer laser process offers extended process capability beyond 
      traditional manufacturing approaches, while at the same time providing a 
      lower cost of ownership potential with extendibility to both current and 
      future applications. In the program, both IBM and SUSS MicroTec will 
      continue collaboration on the development of Excimer laser processes and 
      process systems for two distinct roles; Seed Layer Removal for UBM 
      (under bump metallization) and micro-structuring organic dielectrics 
      (Vias and RDL trenches) for system interconnects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This joint development effort will leverage joint resources from IBM's 
      packaging expertise and SUSS MicroTec Photonic Systems' 24 years of 
      Excimer laser processing and tool development to create leading-edge 
      packaging and enable higher performance back end of line materials for 
      the semiconductor back-end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      'We see high growth potential for this technology and continue 
      contributing to the development of alternative manufacturing processes 
      that address existing manufacturing challenges and continued cost 
      reductions.' says Frank P. Averdung, President and CEO of SUSS MicroTec. 
      'Together with IBM, we intend to extend these capabilities to meet 
      industry needs.'

      About SUSS MicroTec
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SUSS MicroTec is a leading supplier of equipment and process solutions

&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan raises its stance on the construction materials sector to
"overweight" from "neutral", citing its diversified geographical revenue
exposure, relatively little dependence on China and high earnings rebound
potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We see scope for 2014 to be a year of earnings growth, and to mark the end
of nearly five years of material negative earnings revisions," the bank's
analysts write in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan's preferred stocks in the sector are HeidelbergCement 
and Wolseley, which it rates at "overweight", plus Lafarge and
CRH, raised to "overweight" from "neutral".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also raises Holcim and Italcementi to "neutral"
from "underweight". It downgrades Buzzi Unicem to "underweight" from
"neutral" and Saint-Gobain to "neutral" from "overweight".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in HeidelbergCement, which JP Morgan adds to its "European Analyst
Focus List", are indicated to rise 2.9 percent to the top of Germany's blue-chip
index, according to pre-market data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters messaging rm://maria.sheahan.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Nadia Damouni and Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE Jan 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
is likely to appoint its cloud-computing head, Satya Nadella, as
its next chief executive, a source familiar with the matter said
on Thursday, as the board concludes a five-month search for a
tech-savvy heavy-hitter to lead the world's largest software
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the move, co-founder Bill Gates may step aside as
chairman and be replaced by lead independent director John
Thompson, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity
because the process is private. Gates would remain a director,
the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg first reported the news on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising star Nadella, a native of Hyderabad, India - where
Microsoft has its largest non-U.S. research center - was
promoted to run the company's fast-expanding cloud, or
internet-based, computing initiatives in July last year as part
of current CEO Steve Ballmer's radical re-organization of the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment of the 22-year Microsoft veteran would make
him the most powerful Indian-born tech executive in the world
and put him alongside PepsiCo Inc's chief, Indra Nooyi,
as the leader of a well-known, large-cap U.S. corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in 1967 and educated in India and the United States,
Nadella's tech career started at internet software pioneer Sun
Microsystems. He joined Microsoft in 1992 and quickly climbed
the corporate ladder with leading roles in the Office and Bing
search-engine teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was promoted to run the company's server and tools unit
in 2011. That unit now forms the backbone of Microsoft's
cloud-computing platform, which Nadella runs under his official
title of executive vice president, cloud and enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's a solid choice," offering continuity of strategy and
proven execution, said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm
McAdams Wright Ragen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors had campaigned for an external CEO who might
be more likely to shake up the company and reward shareholders
with greater dividends and share buybacks, but Parakh said that
did not mean Nadella would be unpopular with Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any new CEO is going to have to have the shareholders' say
in mind. But it's not certain that will translate into actions,"
said Parakh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Nadella is named CEO, it is likely Thompson will help out
on the crucial task of managing Microsoft's relations with its
powerful Wall Street investors, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella has little experience of that aspect of the job, and
Ballmer and Gates did not prioritize it. Gates would likely
focus on technical innovation in any new role, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been calls for months for Gates to step down from
investors who believe Microsoft's co-founder is a block to
radical change and investor-friendly moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who plans to retire as soon as a new CEO is named,
was reelected to the board in November, but it is not clear how
long he will remain there after retirement, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several people briefed on the CEO search process had
previously told Reuters that Microsoft was down to a handful of
candidates, including Nadella and Tony Bates, executive
vice-president of business development, plus at least one
external candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board still has not met to finalize Nadella's offer and
nothing has been signed, the source said. Microsoft declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 0.8 percent to $37.15 after hours,
after gaining slightly in regular Nasdaq trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONG SEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's CEO search has taken longer than most expected
when Ballmer said last August he would retire within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a blog post on the company's website in December,
Thompson emphasized the need for a CEO with "an ability to lead
a highly technical organization and work with top technical
talent".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson, who leads the four-member CEO search committee,
said at the time he expected the panel to reach a decision "in
the early part of 2014".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment of a company veteran like Nadella, which
follows a flirtation with outsiders such as Ford Motor Co 
Chief Executive Alan Mulally, could disappoint some investors
who want a more radical transformation at the software giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While many on the Street are now expecting Mr. Nadella to
get the CEO spot, we believe filling this position with a core
Microsoft insider will disappoint those hoping for a fresh
strategic approach (e.g. potential breakup of
enterprise/consumer, Xbox spin off) an outside executive could
have brought to the table," FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in a
research note, adding that innovation and fresh strategies were
needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With that said, we believe Mr. Nadella's prior roles in the
Online Services Division, Business Division and most recently as
president of the Server and Tools business position him as a
strong internal candidate with a broad set of knowledge around
Microsoft's massive product portfolio," Ives wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court on Thursday refused to dismiss a $1.07 billion lawsuit accusing Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) of selling securities as the financial crisis began that it expected to lose value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, brought by Australian hedge fund Basis Yield Alpha Fund, says Goldman made misleading statements and omissions about collateralized debt obligations known as Timberlake and Point Pleasant. It claims Goldman sold the securities as a way to offload subprime mortgages it knew were toxic and also sought to profit by shorting the securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its ruling, a five-judge appeals panel said a lower court rightly declined to dismiss the fraud claims, rejecting Goldman's view that they should be thrown out because of disclosures and risk disclaimers in its offering circulars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the fund's allegations are true, "there is a 'vast gap' between the speculative picture Goldman presented to investors and the events Goldman knew had already occurred," Justice Dianne Renwick wrote in the decision on behalf of four judges on the court. A fifth judge concurred with different reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court dismissed negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment and rescission claims against Goldman. But it also refused to order the case into arbitration, as the bank had sought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an excellent decision affirming that sellers of securities have to speak honestly and cannot use the fine print to avoid responsibility," said Eric Lewis, a lawyer who represents Basis Yield. "Goldman knew they had fixed the race. The securities were designed to fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has said the losses were caused by the collapse of the housing market, not misrepresentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are confident that we will ultimately prevail on the remaining claim by Basis, which was one of the world's most sophisticated investors in mortgage products," said Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield Alpha Fund brought the lawsuit in 2011 seeking to recoup $67 million in losses that contributed to the fund's insolvency. The lawsuit also seeks $1 billion in punitive damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timberwolf was cited in a scathing 2011 U.S. Senate panel report that faulted Goldman and other banks for pushing debt they expected to perform poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said Goldman kept marketing Timberwolf even after Thomas Montag, an executive who is now Bank of America Corp's co-chief operating officer, called Timberwolf "one shitty deal" in an email to a colleague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's CDO practices also have drawn regulatory scrutiny. In April 2010, it agreed to pay $550 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it sold the risky Abacus CDO while letting hedge fund billionaire John Paulson bet against it. The bank did not admit wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIBYA CASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also was sued in London's High Court last week for allegedly exploiting a lack of financial knowledge at Libya's sovereign wealth fund, which became a Goldman client in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court documents seen by Reuters on Thursday, the Libyan Investment Authority claims Goldman took advantage of the fund's "financially illiterate staff" when it encouraged investment in more than $1 billion in trades that ended up worthless.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Karen Freifeld&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 30 (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court
on Thursday refused to dismiss a $1.07 billion lawsuit accusing
Goldman Sachs Group Inc  of selling securities as the
financial crisis began that it expected to lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, brought by Australian hedge fund Basis Yield
Alpha Fund, says Goldman made misleading statements and
omissions about collateralized debt obligations known as
Timberlake and Point Pleasant. It claims Goldman sold the
securities as a way to offload subprime mortgages it knew were
toxic and also sought to profit by shorting the securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its ruling, a five-judge appeals panel said a lower court
rightly declined to dismiss the fraud claims, rejecting
Goldman's view that they should be thrown out because of
disclosures and risk disclaimers in its offering circulars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the fund's allegations are true, "there is a 'vast gap'
between the speculative picture Goldman presented to investors
and the events Goldman knew had already occurred," Justice
Dianne Renwick wrote in the decision on behalf of four judges on
the court. A fifth judge concurred with different reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court dismissed negligent misrepresentation, unjust
enrichment and rescission claims against Goldman. But it also
refused to order the case into arbitration, as the bank had
sought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an excellent decision affirming that sellers of
securities have to speak honestly and cannot use the fine print
to avoid responsibility," said Eric Lewis, a lawyer who
represents Basis Yield. "Goldman knew they had fixed the race.
The securities were designed to fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has said the losses were caused by the collapse of
the housing market, not misrepresentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are confident that we will ultimately prevail on the
remaining claim by Basis, which was one of the world's most
sophisticated investors in mortgage products," said Goldman
spokesman Michael DuVally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield Alpha Fund brought the lawsuit in 2011 seeking
to recoup $67 million in losses that contributed to the fund's
insolvency. The lawsuit also seeks $1 billion in punitive
damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timberwolf was cited in a scathing 2011 U.S. Senate panel
report that faulted Goldman and other banks for pushing debt
they expected to perform poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said Goldman kept marketing Timberwolf even after
Thomas Montag, an executive who is now Bank of America Corp's
co-chief operating officer, called Timberwolf "one shitty deal"
in an email to a colleague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's CDO practices also have drawn regulatory scrutiny.
In April 2010, it agreed to pay $550 million to settle U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission charges it sold the risky
Abacus CDO while letting hedge fund billionaire John Paulson bet
against it. The bank did not admit wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIBYA CASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also was sued in London's High Court last week for
allegedly exploiting a lack of financial knowledge at Libya's
sovereign wealth fund, which became a Goldman client in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court documents seen by Reuters on Thursday, the Libyan
Investment Authority claims Goldman took advantage of the fund's
"financially illiterate staff" when it encouraged investment in
more than $1 billion in trades that ended up worthless. Goldman
has said the claims are without merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, the Basis Yield fund said it entered $80.8
million of credit default swaps related to "triple-A" and
"double-A" rated Timberwolf debt. It said it bought $12.3
million of "triple-B" rated debt tied to subprime residential
mortgages in a CDO known as Point Pleasant 2007-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within weeks, the transactions began to lose value, and
Basis Yield began to liquidate within two months. It said it
lost $56.3 million on Timberwolf in under six weeks, and $10.8
million on Point Pleasant in less than three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis Yield was managed by Sydney-based Basis Capital Funds
Management Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Basis Yield  Alpha Fund v. Goldman Sachs Group,
Inc et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No.

			Optimus Editor Hovig Menakian Teams with Director Keith Rivers and 
      Microsoft to Create &#8220;Celebrating the Women of 2013&#8221; Spot
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Inspirational spot highlights the brave, courageous women of 2013
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Leading production and post house Optimus 
      today announced that Santa Monica-based Editor Hovig Menakian cut the 
      Microsoft spot, &#8220;Celebrating 
      the Women of 2013.&#8221; Airing nationally now, the spot features the 
      bravery and courage of women around the globe who spoke out, broke 
      barriers, overcame tragedy and changed the world in 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Set to Sara Bareilles&#8217;s song, &#8220;Brave,&#8221; &#8220;Celebrating the Women of 2013&#8221; 
      was created with found material highlighting the many courageous acts of 
      these female heroes, who include: Malala Yousafzi, Margaret Thatcher, 
      Adrianne Haslet-Davis, Gabrielle Giffords, Diana Nyad, Janet Yellen, 
      Antoinette Tuff, Angela Merkel, Edith Windsor, Deb Cohan and women on 
      the front lines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Keith and I worked closely with Microsoft&#8217;s creative team to determine 
      who we would feature in the spot,&#8221; commented Menakian. &#8220;Once we had a 
      solid list, we scoured the internet for materials to try to determine 
      what sources to pull from and give it form. Along the way, we discovered 
      more people, and the concept evolved into what it is now. Microsoft had 
      a solid message from the start that allowed us to search for a broad 
      range of women in an extremely fast turnaround time. They made our jobs 
      easy and it was a lot of fun to work with their creative team.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The spot, which notably aired during the Golden Globe Awards and GRAMMY 
      Awards, aims not only to thank remarkable women of 2013, but also to 
      show us what the human spirit can achieve. As the GRAMMY-nominated 
      Bareilles puts forward in her song, it encourages viewers to &#8220;say what 
      you want to say.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I have worked with Optimus for years, and I immediately thought of them 
      to edit this spot,&#8221; said Rivers. &#8220;Given Hovig&#8217;s aesthetic, how he tells 
      stories and how he cuts, I knew he would be the perfect fit for the job. 
      We seamlessly teamed with Microsoft&#8217;s impressive creative team to 
      complete the project in two weeks. What was amazing was how everyone 
      came together &#8211; even third-parties who were licensing footage and images 
      &#8211; to showcase the heroic, powerful, risk-taking women of 2013.&#8221;

		&lt;h1&gt;The Year of the Auction: Sellers Are Choosing the Auction Method for Selling Luxury Properties, According to J. P. King Auction Company&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;GADSDEN, AL--(Marketwired - Jan 30, 2014) -  Will 2014 be the year of the luxury rebound? Those who have been holding on to their high-end real estate since the economic recession began seem to think so. Owners of multi-million properties are asking questions and preparing to sell, but the way they're choosing to sell their homes looks different than it did pre-2007, perhaps permanently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the last several months, we've spoken with numerous property owners that have pulled their properties off the traditional real estate market and are researching other methods of sale," said Scott King, Executive Vice President of Sales at J. P. King Auction Company. "We're consulting with these individuals trying to help them determine the best fit for selling their properties."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the auction method. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A proactive, national or international marketing reach and a turnaround that works on the sellers' timeframe puts them in control and makes the auction method of marketing an increasingly popular one among luxury sellers. When J. P. King Auction Company pioneered using the auction method for luxury properties in the early '90s, the company began turning heads as those with upscale properties realized auctions weren't just for distressed homes. Now, J. P. King is clearly seeing a trend of sellers trying to determine if the market conditions are right to sell in a recovering economy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not only that, but real estate agents are turning to us in an attempt to get their clients' properties sold, knowing that we can work together to broaden the buyer base. They recognize the importance of preserving their relationships with their clients, and often turning to the auction method meets everyone's needs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market research backs the market uptick sellers are noticing. Christie's Real Estate recently published their findings in "Luxury Defined: An Insight Into the Luxury Residential Property Market," which noted that several cities have more luxury buyers than available properties, with only 33,000 properties of $1 million or more available in the entire country. With a demand for real estate like this, sellers have realized one of the keys to moving their property is reaching their target market, wherever they may be, recognizing that the auction method finds that market and turns them into bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in the last two months of 2013, J. P. King sold six properties that spent a combined quarter century sitting on the market, waiting for the right buyer. When these sellers chose to work with J. P. King, each of the properties was listed and sold within 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are people that have put their lives on hold waiting for the economy and market demand to line up, and we all seem to agree that this is the highest demand any of us has seen since the early 2000s," King said. "We're looking forward to working with these owners and their real estate agents to show them that the auction method takes a step beyond bringing the property to the market and instead brings the market to the property."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About J. P. King:
				J. P. King Auction Company is a national real estate auction marketing firm, specializing in high-value resort and recreational properties. A fourth-generation company, J. P. King has marketed properties in all 50 states and six countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of declining production at legacy oil and natural gas wells has become endemic for multinational energy groups, which have tried to offset the trend by launching massive and risky exploration projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's oil and natural gas production dropped 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter from year-ago levels, with natural gas production falling around the world and oil output slipping in half the regions where the company operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results reflected a "mediocre quarter" for Exxon, especially in international production, Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've lost momentum already, reverting back to declining production and stagnant earnings," Youngberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) said on Thursday the fourth quarter was its least profitable in five years as its own production slipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assuage Wall Street, Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson promised in a statement that the company will ramp up exploration projects over the next two years to find newer reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon spent $42.5 billion in 2013 on exploration and other capital projects, a staggering sum that led Tillerson to admit last year: "I never would have dreamed we'd be spending at this level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's liquefied natural gas operation in Papua New Guinea should make its first deliveries by September, while expansions at the Kearl oil sands development in Canada and the Upper Zakum oil project in Abu Dhabi are underway, executives said on a conference call with investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also is expanding in U.S. shale formations, adding rigs in the Permian formation in Texas and running all rigs available in the Bakken formation in North Dakota and the Woodford Ardmore shale in Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These and other projects should help Exxon reach its goal of boosting annual oil and natural gas production 2 percent to 3 percent by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors said they supported the new exploration if it helps increase total production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it's done in the context of normal exploration, or a change in the makeup of demand, that's probably a positive," said Oliver Pursche of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, who manages Exxon shares for clients.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ernest Scheyder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's
largest publicly traded oil company by market value, posted
lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as it failed to
offset declining production but spent heavily to find fresh
reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem of declining production at legacy oil and
natural gas wells has become endemic for multinational energy
groups, which have tried to offset the trend by launching
massive and risky exploration projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's oil and natural gas production dropped 1.8 percent
in the fourth quarter from year-ago levels, with natural gas
production falling around the world and oil output slipping in
half the regions where the company operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results reflected a "mediocre quarter" for Exxon,
especially in international production, Edward Jones analyst
Brian Youngberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've lost momentum already, reverting back to declining
production and stagnant earnings," Youngberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc said on Thursday
the fourth quarter was its least profitable in five years as its
own production slipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assuage Wall Street, Chief Executive Officer Rex
Tillerson promised in a statement that the company will ramp up
exploration projects over the next two years to find newer
reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon spent $42.5 billion in 2013 on exploration and other
capital projects, a staggering sum that led Tillerson to admit
last year: "I never would have dreamed we'd be spending at this
level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's liquefied natural gas operation in Papua New Guinea
should make its first deliveries by September, while expansions
at the Kearl oil sands development in Canada and the Upper Zakum
oil project in Abu Dhabi are underway, executives said on a
conference call with investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also is expanding in U.S. shale formations,
adding rigs in the Permian formation in Texas and running all
rigs available in the Bakken formation in North Dakota and the
Woodford Ardmore shale in Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These and other projects should help Exxon reach its goal of
boosting annual oil and natural gas production 2 percent to 3
percent by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(BREAKINGVIEWS - Exxon outlays should pump up 2014 after
down year: )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors said they supported the new exploration if it
helps increase total production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it's done in the context of normal exploration, or a
change in the makeup of demand, that's probably a positive,"
said Oliver Pursche of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, who

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Visa Inc's (V.N) chief executive urged U.S. merchants and banks to hasten the adoption of a more secure technology for credit and debit cards after security breaches at several retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and retailers have been dragging their feet over the upgrade and have been at odds over who should bear the cost, which experts have said could be as much as $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) have been pushing for merchants and issuers to meet an October 2015 target date to accept cards with an embedded chip to hold information, rather than rely on the easily copied magnetic strips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have estimated that only 60 percent of U.S. point-of-sale terminals would meet the target date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately many merchants and issuers and both of their lobbyists are attempting to assign blame in the press and not reacting in a particularly constructive manner," Charlie Scharf said in a post-earnings conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is in all of our best interest that change quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month Target Corp (TGT.N), the third-largest U.S. retailer, said about 40 million credit card records and 70 million other records containing data on its customers were stolen in a security breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luxury retail chain Neiman Marcus NMRCUS.UL and Michaels Cos Inc, the biggest U.S. arts and crafts retailer, have said they were victims of cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Americans have been victims of data theft, but that hasn't stopped them from using credit cards and social media sites or shopping online, according to a Ipsos/Reuters poll of 8,308 Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 64 percent of the victims said the experience had not deterred them from using their credit or debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROFIT BEATS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company, reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit as more people used cards instead of cash to make payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income attributable to Visa rose 9 percent to $1.41 billion, or $2.20 per Class A share, in the first quarter from $1.29 billion, or $1.93, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total operating revenue increased 11 percent to $3.16 billion in the quarter ended December 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.16 per share on revenue of $3.13 billion, according to Thomson Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster City, California-based Visa said total volume grew about 7 percent to $1.84 trillion, helped by a strong holiday shopping in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa shares were up 2 percent at $221.80 in morning trading on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;* Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) files law suit in London&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Says paid more than $1 bln for trades that ended worthless&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Says Goldman exerted undue influence by encouraging trades&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Goldman says claims without merit, to defend them strongly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Clare Hutchison&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs exploited a lack of
financial knowledge at Libya's sovereign wealth fund and a
position of trust when it encouraged the fund to invest more
than $1 billion in trades that ended up worthless, the fund has
claimed in court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) last week filed a law
suit against the U.S. investment bank in London's High Court,
seeking to cancel a series of equity derivatives trades between
January and April 2008 and the repayment of premiums paid to
Goldman Sachs for its services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court documents seen by Reuters on Thursday, the LIA said
Goldman took advantage of the fund's "financially illiterate"
staff, who had placed trust and confidence in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LIA estimates Goldman made "substantial and unusually
high" profit of around $350 million on the trades, which expired
as worthless in 2011, the documents show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Goldman said: "We think the claims are
without merit, and will defend them vigorously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LIA became a Goldman client in August 2007, shortly
after it began operating. Under the partnership, Goldman offered
to train LIA staff in financial markets and products, alongside
giving strategic investment advice, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the two became so close that a
Goldman executive addressed the LIA employees as his friends and
frequently gave them small gifts, such as aftershaves and
chocolates, the LIA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was that executive who "heavily encouraged" the LIA to
obtain exposure to stocks, including shares in Citigroup 
and EDF, on a leveraged basis by entering into a number
of large long-dated complex derivatives transactions, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LIA said Goldman failed to properly document these
trades, providing details only after they had been executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only when it received those details did the LIA come to
understand that the trades were not cautious investments, but
rather "complex derivatives and synthetic instruments which
represented highly speculative gambles", it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement accompanying the filing, AbdulMagid Breish,
Chairman of the LIA, described the transactions as "unjust".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unique circumstances allowed Goldman Sachs to take
advantage of the LIA's extremely limited financial and legal
experience, to deliberately exploit its position of influence,
and to take advantage in a way that generated colossal losses
for the LIA but substantial profits for Goldman Sachs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has just under two weeks to acknowledge service of
the legal proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

      Solutions  Customer Satisfaction
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the 11th consecutive year, Mariner has earned its 
      Microsoft Gold Partner status for the Business Intelligence competency 
      and Silver for the Data Platform competency. Mariner is part of the 1 
      percent of partners worldwide that have attained this high degree of 
      proficiency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In a recent note to the firm, Philip W. Morris, Co-founder and CEO, 
      announced that Mariner had achieved gold again, saying, &#8220;Thank you for 
      all that you do to ensure that we continue to be recognized by Microsoft 
      in that elite class of partners: Microsoft Gold Partner, a distinction 
      attained by fewer than 1% of Microsoft&#8217;s 300,000 partners.&#8221; He added, 
      &#8220;Each year since 2003, we have undertaken the rigorous process of 
      renewing our Gold status providing new qualitative and quantitative 
      evidence that we are worthy of continuing to be a Gold Partner . . . As 
      a part of the re-certification process, we must also participate in a 
      customer satisfaction survey conducted by an independent third party to 
      provide qualitative evidence of our capabilities . . . it [earning 100% 
      customer satisfaction] is a testament to the quality of the services you 
      have provided to our customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;By achieving a Gold competency, partners have demonstrated the highest, 
      most consistent capability and commitment to the latest Microsoft 
      technology,&#8221; said Phil Sorgen, corporate vice president, Worldwide 
      Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. &#8220;These partners have a deep expertise 
      that puts them in the top 1 percent of our partner ecosystem, and their 
      proficiency will help customers drive innovative solutions on the latest 
      Microsoft technology.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To earn a Microsoft Gold competency, Mariner proved their ability to 
      provide analytic and business intelligence solutions by having 
      designated Microsoft-certified professionals on staff, submitting recent 
      customer references, passing technology and sales assessments and having 
      customers complete a satisfaction survey.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      resources, pre-release product information and specialized training,

			EXXONMOBIL CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;ExxonMobil delivered strong business results in 2013 while remaining 
      focused on improving profitability and long-term shareholder value.
			Disciplined 
      use of capital, project execution and asset management are positioning 
      the company to deliver sustained superior financial performance across 
      the business cycle.
			Over the next two years, ExxonMobil will 
      start up numerous major projects delivering profitable new supplies of 
      oil and natural gas while strengthening our refining and chemicals 
      businesses.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Fourth quarter 2013 earnings were $8.4&#160;billion, down 16% from the 
      fourth quarter of 2012.
			Full year 2013 earnings were $32.6 
      billion, down 27% from 2012.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Capital and exploration expenditures were $9.9 billion in the fourth 
      quarter and $42.5 billion for the year, including $4.3 billion for 
      acquisitions.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;In 2013, the Corporation distributed $26&#160;billion to shareholders 
      through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Earnings of $8,350&#160;million decreased $1,600&#160;million or 16% from the 
        fourth quarter of 2012.
      
			
        Earnings per share (assuming dilution) were $1.91, a decrease of 13% 
        from the fourth quarter of 2012.
      
			
        Capital and exploration expenditures were $9.9&#160;billion, down 20% from 
        the fourth quarter of 2012.
      
			
        Oil-equivalent production decreased 1.8% from the fourth quarter of 
        2012. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects 
        and divestments, production was essentially flat, with liquids volumes 
        up 3.0%.
      
			
        Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $12.0&#160;billion, including 
        proceeds associated with asset sales of $1.8&#160;billion.
      
			
        Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $3&#160;billion.
      
			
        Dividends per share of $0.63 increased 11% compared to the fourth 
        quarter of 2012.
      
			
        Statoil and ExxonMobil announced the fifth discovery in Block 2 
        offshore Tanzania. The discovery of an additional 2-3 trillion cubic 
        feet of natural gas in place in the Mronge-1 well brings the total gas 
        resource estimate to 17-20 trillion cubic feet.
      
			
        The Alaska LNG project announced selection of a lead site for the 
        liquefied natural gas plant in the Nikiski area on the Kenai 
        Peninsula. Together with the ongoing multi-year summer field work, 
        this is a key step forward for the project and continued progress 
        toward building Alaska&#8217;s energy future.
      
			
        ExxonMobil commissioned a new hydrotreater at its Singapore refinery, 
        which increased the site&#8217;s ultra-low sulfur diesel production capacity 
        by 62&#160;thousand barrels per day. The new unit, along with the recently 
        completed petrochemical expansion project at our Singapore complex, 
        positions ExxonMobil to competitively deliver high-value products to 
        the growing Asia Pacific region.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fourth Quarter 2013 vs. Fourth Quarter 2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upstream earnings were $6,786&#160;million in the fourth quarter of 2013, 
      down $976&#160;million from the fourth quarter of 2012. Higher natural gas 
      realizations, partly offset by lower liquids realizations, increased 
      earnings by $60&#160;million. Production volume and mix effects decreased 
      earnings by $550&#160;million. All other items, including higher operating 
      expenses, decreased earnings by $490&#160;million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 1.8% from the fourth 
      quarter of 2012. Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC 
      quota effects and divestments, production was essentially flat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquids production totaled 2,235&#160;kbd (thousands of barrels per day), up 
      32&#160;kbd from the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding the impacts of 
      entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids 
      production was up 3.0%, as project ramp-up, mainly in Canada and 
      Nigeria, and lower downtime were partially offset by field decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fourth quarter natural gas production was 11,887&#160;mcfd (millions of cubic 
      feet per day), down 654&#160;mcfd from 2012. Excluding the impacts of 
      entitlement volumes and divestments, natural gas production was down 
      3.9%, as field decline was partially offset by project ramp-up and 
      increased demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,186&#160;million, $418&#160;million 
      lower than the fourth quarter of 2012. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were 
      $5,600&#160;million, down $558&#160;million from the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downstream earnings were $916&#160;million, down $852&#160;million from the fourth 
      quarter of 2012. Weaker margins, mainly in refining, decreased earnings

        Earnings were $32,580&#160;million, down $12,300&#160;million or 27% from 2012. 
        Lower net gains from divestments impacted earnings by $8.6&#160;billion.
      
			
        Earnings per share decreased 24% to $7.37. Excluding net gains from 
        divestments, earnings per share decreased 6%.
      
			
        Oil-equivalent production was down 1.5% from 2012. Excluding the 
        impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, 
        production was essentially flat.
      
			
        Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $47.6&#160;billion, including 
        proceeds associated with asset sales of $2.7&#160;billion.
      
			
        The Corporation distributed $26&#160;billion to shareholders in 2013 
        through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.
      
			
        Capital and exploration expenditures were $42.5&#160;billion, including 
        $4.3 billion for acquisitions, up 7% from 2012.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upstream earnings were $26,841&#160;million, down $3,054&#160;million from 2012. 
      Higher gas realizations, partially offset by lower liquids realizations, 
      increased earnings by $390&#160;million. Production volume and mix effects 
      decreased earnings by $910&#160;million. All other items, including lower net 
      gains from asset sales, mainly in Angola, and higher expenses, reduced 
      earnings by $2.5&#160;billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On an oil-equivalent basis, production was down 1.5% compared to 2012. 
      Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and 
      divestments, production was essentially flat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Liquids production of 2,202&#160;kbd increased 17&#160;kbd compared with 2012. 
      Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and 
      divestments, liquids production was up 1.6%, as project ramp-up and 
      lower downtime were partially offset by field decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Natural gas production of 11,836&#160;mcfd decreased 486&#160;mcfd from 2012. 
      Excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes and divestments, natural 
      gas production was down 1.5%, as field decline was partially offset by 
      higher demand, lower downtime, and project ramp-up.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2013 were $4,191&#160;million, up 
      $266&#160;million from 2012. Earnings outside the U.S. were $22,650&#160;million, 
      down $3,320&#160;million from the prior year.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Downstream earnings of $3,449&#160;million decreased $9,741&#160;million from 2012 
      driven by the absence of the $5.3&#160;billion gain associated with the Japan 
      restructuring. Lower margins, mainly refining, decreased earnings by 
      $2.9&#160;billion. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $310&#160;million. 
      All other items, including higher operating expenses, unfavorable 
      foreign exchange impacts, and lower divestments, decreased earnings by 
      $1.2&#160;billion. Petroleum product sales of 5,887&#160;kbd decreased 287&#160;kbd 
      from 2012.

      U.S. Downstream earnings were $2,199&#160;million, down $1,376&#160;million from 
      2012. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $1,250&#160;million, a decrease of 
      $8,365&#160;million from the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chemical earnings of $3,828&#160;million were $70&#160;million lower than 2012. 
      The absence of the gain associated with the Japan restructuring 
      decreased earnings by $630&#160;million. Higher margins increased earnings by 
      $480&#160;million, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by 
      $80&#160;million. Prime product sales of 24,063&#160;kt were down 94&#160;kt from 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Corporate and financing expenses were $1,538&#160;million, down $565&#160;million 
      from 2012, as favorable tax impacts were partially offset by the absence 
      of the Japan restructuring gain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Actual results, 
      including project plans, costs, timing, and capacities; capital and 
      exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and share purchase 
      levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in oil

      and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic 
      recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes

			Frequently used terms
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This press release includes cash flow from operations and asset 
      sales, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.
			Because of the 
      regular nature of our asset management and divestment program, we 
      believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with 
      the sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and 
      returns of investments together with cash provided by operating 
      activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business 
      and financing activities.
			A reconciliation to net cash provided 
      by operating activities is shown in Attachment II.
			References to 
      quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that we believe 
      will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as &#8220;proved 
      reserves&#8221; under SEC definitions.
			Further information on 
      ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and other 
      terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms" available 
      through the &#8220;Investors&#8221; section of our website at exxonmobil.com.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Reference to Earnings
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			References to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to 
      ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income statement.
			Unless 
      otherwise indicated, references to earnings, Upstream, Downstream, 
      Chemical and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per 
      share are ExxonMobil's share after excluding amounts attributable to 
      noncontrolling interests.

		&lt;p&gt;
			The term &#8220;project&#8221; as used in this release can refer to a variety of

&lt;p&gt;Jan 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's
most valuable publicly traded oil company, said on Thursday its
quarterly profit dropped 16 percent as production fell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the fourth quarter, the company posted net income of
$8.35 billion, or $1.91 per share, compared with $9.95 billion,
or $2.20 per share, in the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total oil and natural gas production fell 1.8 percent from
the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;

			Visa&#174; Subscribes to SAP&#174; Financial Services Network to Streamline 
      Process for Corporations to Pay by Visa
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced plans to provide companies a 
      simplified way to pay by Visa through their Visa Commercial issuer using 
      the SAP Financial Services Network. The new payment solution is expected 
      to help corporations more easily automate and process their invoice 
      payments without the need for significant investment in custom software, 
      and is planned to be available summer 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Global commercial consumption expenditure is estimated at US $112 
      trillion1, but nearly half of all corporate payments are 
      still paid by checks, which is an inefficient approach compared with 
      electronic transfers. The new solution is expected to help corporations 
      who want to move toward electronic business-to-business payments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As companies shift from labor-intensive, paper-based processes to more 
      efficient electronic procurement systems, having the option to pay with 
      Visa will help simplify the process and bring many benefits,&#8221; said Tad 
      Fordyce, SVP and head of Global Commercial Solutions, Visa Inc. &#8220;We 
      anticipate that being able to make Visa payments via connection to the 
      SAP Financial Services Network will help corporations streamline 
      accounts payable processing, while avoiding the upfront and ongoing 
      costs that would be associated with custom software for the payment 
      process.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Corporations have long sought to simplify integration with their 
      financial providers and take advantage of new services designed to 
      optimize their payables and receivables,&#8221; said Sanjay Chikarmane, senior 
      vice president and general manager, Information Management and Financial 
      Services Network, SAP. &#8220;We anticipate companies will be able to benefit 
      from connecting to the SAP Financial Services Network and make Visa 
      transactions via the network. Integrating Visa&#8217;s payables solutions with 
      ERP and finance systems via the SAP Financial Services Network is 
      expected to help ease reconciliation and increase up-to-date visibility 
      into cash.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - The race to determine the next head of Microsoft Corp looks to have ended where it began, with the software giant poised to take the route of least risk and tap rising internal star Satya Nadella for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bruising, five-month selection process, the list of contenders was cut to six serious candidates, with the chief executive job nearly going to Ford Motor Co CEO Alan Mulally, an outsider favored by investors lobbying for radical change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Nadella wins the day, as expected, it will be for his innovative work on Microsoft's growing server and tools business, which provides online computing and storage for companies, said a source briefed on the search process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella is in discussions with the board, and is likely to ask that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates drop his chairman role and help Nadella more closely on technology, two sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear why Nadella might want a role change for Gates.

&lt;p&gt;By Nadia Damouni and Bill Rigby
    NEW YORK/SEATTLE, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The race to determine
the next head of Microsoft Corp looks to have ended
where it began, with the software giant poised to take the route
of least risk and tap rising internal star Satya Nadella for the
job.
    After a bruising, five-month selection process, the list of
contenders was cut to six serious candidates, with the chief
executive job nearly going to Ford Motor Co CEO Alan
Mulally, an outsider favored by investors lobbying for radical
change. 
    If Nadella wins the day, as expected, it will be for his
innovative work on Microsoft's growing server and tools
business, which provides online computing and storage for
companies, said a source briefed on the search process.
    Nadella is in discussions with the board, and is likely to
ask that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates drop his chairman role
and help Nadella more closely on technology, two sources said. 
    It is not clear why Nadella might want a role change for
Gates. The presence of Gates and current CEO Steve Ballmer on
the board has deterred some external candidates who feared they
would meet resistance if they want to make fundamental changes,
sources have told Reuters over the past few months.
    Nadella is praised for his role in overseeing growth in the
company's cloud computing and Bing search engine business, and
as a technologist with a talent for marketing. Critics say he
failed to halt Google Inc's dominance in the search
engine business. They say Microsoft's entry into the
cloud-computing arena was late and clunky, allowing Amazon.com
Inc to set the standard in providing online computing
platforms for companies
    It remains unclear whether the 46-year old Indian-born
executive will meet some investors' desire for more radical
moves at the software maker, after Ballmer announced in August
that he planned to retire.  
    "From the technical side, Mr. Nadella is a good choice,"
said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura who publicly lobbied
for an outside candidate who would shake up Microsoft and
maximize returns to shareholders.
    "We do not want to see a continuation of the existing
direction for the business, so it will be important that Mr.
Nadella be free to make changes," said Sherlund.
    It was just such a desire that made Mulally a front runner
until a few weeks ago, when it became clear that the Ford CEO
and Microsoft's search committee did not see eye to eye.
    "If (Mulally) had played his cards differently, it could
have turned out differently," sources said of the Ford CEO,
pointing to his failure to present a detailed plan to the board.
The move weakened support for him among Microsoft's directors,
they said. 
    Mulally took himself out of the running once it became clear
that Microsoft had cooled, the sources said. 
    
    CANDIDATES DROP OUT
    In the meantime, outsiders Steve Mollenkopf from Qualcomm 
Inc and Ericsson's Hans Vestberg gained
ground, the sources said, as they engaged more openly with the
board. Both ultimately dropped out, Mollenkopf after he was
offered a promotion to CEO at Qualcomm. 
    At the same time, Microsoft refocused on insiders, including
Nadella, Tony Bates - the former Skype boss now in charge of
Microsoft's business development - and Stephen Elop, who is set
to rejoin Microsoft when its acquisition of Nokia's 
handset business closes.
    Microsoft has declined to discuss individual candidates.
Mulally never publicly confirmed his interest in the job but
stated his intention to stay at Ford in early January. Vestberg
and Mollenkopf also declared their intention to stay at their
respective companies. Insiders Bates, Elop and Nadella have not
spoken publicly about the process. 
    Nadella's appointment has not been finalized, the source
cautioned. The Microsoft board is set to meet early next week,
where the terms of the new arrangement will be finalized. 
    Nadella has a strong reputation inside the company. His
inquisitive mind set him apart early in his career, friends in
India say. 
    "Satya is by far the best internal choice," said Brad
Silverberg, who was in charge of Microsoft's breakthrough
Windows 95 release and went on to start Seattle-based venture
capital firm Ignition Partners. 
    To other Microsoft observers, Nadella's longevity at the
company suggests that he is not a radical thinker and more of a
political animal.
    "They need and will pick only a bendable guy, who will
preserve the existing culture of saying yes," said Joachim
Kempin, a former senior vice president of Microsoft and a long
time critic of its management.
    
    GATES' ROLE 
    Microsoft shares did not move much after word of Nadella's
likely selection on Thursday after the market close. The stock
closed up 2.66 percent at $37.84 in Nasdaq trading on Friday.
    Some welcomed the possibility of Gates, long seen by Wall
Street as a barrier to change, moving into a more advisory role
for Nadella. That could pave the way for lead independent
director John Thompson to chair the board and take care of
governance and managing investors, an area largely ignored by
Ballmer and Gates. 
    Nomura's Sherlund was not certain, however, that Thompson
would be any more amenable to Wall Street. 
    "In our conversations with Mr. Thompson, he has not appeared
receptive to taking steps to enhance shareholder value through
accelerated share repurchase, cost cutting and better focusing
the business," said Sherlund. "This could be disappointing for
investors, and it could take time for ValueAct to change the
dynamics on the Board to effect a change in thinking with regard
to shareholder value."
    Activist investor ValueAct took a $2 billion stake in
Microsoft last year and immediately began campaigning for
Ballmer's ouster. Microsoft offered the firm a seat on the board
last year.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) plans to keep spending roughly $40 billion per year for the next several years on new oil and natural gas projects in a bid to lift production that is on track to be flat for the third straight year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That stay-the-course approach, announced on Friday after the second-largest U.S. oil company said its quarterly profit dropped 32 percent, spooked investors and prompted the stock to fall 3.5 percent, the most of any large energy producer this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and other international energy companies, Chevron has tried to offset declining production at its existing oil and natural gas wells by spending massively on new exploration projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Shell announced earlier this week that it would focus more on energy projects that have the best chance of success, cutting spending and also selling underperforming assets.

Chevron Chief Executive John Watson said he expects capital spending to be in the $40 billion range for the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is betting that its relatively high dividend yield for the energy industry and its large stock buyback program will appease investors until five of its major projects, including two massive liquefied natural gas projects in Australia and deepwater wells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, are online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically it's a treadmill," said Oppenheimer &amp; Co analyst Fadel Gheit.

&lt;p&gt;By Ernest Scheyder
    Jan 31 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp plans to keep
spending roughly $40 billion per year for the next several years
on new oil and natural gas projects in a bid to lift production
that is on track to be flat for the third straight year.
    That stay-the-course approach, announced on Friday after the
second-largest U.S. oil company said its quarterly profit
dropped 32 percent, spooked investors and prompted the stock to
fall 3.5 percent, the most of any large energy producer this
quarter.
    Like Exxon Mobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell 
and other international energy companies, Chevron has tried to
offset declining production at its existing oil and natural gas
wells by spending massively on new exploration projects.
 
    But Shell announced earlier this week that it would focus
more on energy projects that have the best chance of success,
cutting spending and also selling underperforming assets. The
news boosted Shell's stock. 
    Chevron has taken the opposite approach and plans to keep
the cash flowing. It spent $41.9 billion last year on energy
projects, a 23 percent increase from 2012. Chevron Chief
Executive John Watson said he expects capital spending to be in
the $40 billion range for the next few years.
    Chevron is betting that its relatively high dividend yield
for the energy industry and its large stock buyback program will
appease investors until five of its major projects, including
two massive liquefied natural gas projects in Australia and
deepwater wells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, are online.
    "Basically it's a treadmill," said Oppenheimer &amp; Co analyst
Fadel Gheit. "Yes, all these new projects will add oil. But
guess what, until they hit that goal, their base line production
is declining."
    Chevron's oil and natural gas production fell 3.4 percent in
the fourth quarter to 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per
day (boed).
    Rising production in the United States and Nigeria wasn't
enough to offset declining production at legacy fields around
the world, which typically see production slip 4 percent
annually, Chevron said. 
    For 2014, Chevron expects total production of 2.6 million
boed, up only 0.5 percent from 2013 levels. The estimate missed
Wall Street's expectations and disappointed investors, who had
hoped 2014 would be a "positive transition year" toward 2017
when new projects come online, Credit Suisse analyst Edward
Westlake said in a note.
    Even if Chevron hits its 2014 production goal, it would only
be on par with 2012 levels.
    
    Looking forward, Chevron said it has made significant
progress on its five main growth projects. In total, the five
new protects will add 500,000 boed in production, the company
estimates, once fully online. 
    "We are in a depleting resource business, and you do need to
add to the portfolio," Watson said on a conference call with
investors.
    Last year the company said by 2017 it expects daily
production to be 3.3 million boed.     
    The company reported net income of $4.93 billion, or $2.57
per share, compared with $7.25 billion, or $3.70 per share, in
the year-ago period.
    The quarterly profit met expectations of Wall Street
analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
    The results were not a total surprise to Wall Street, as
Chevron hinted earlier this month that its fourth-quarter profit
would be "comparable" with third-quarter results, when it posted
net income of $4.95 billion.   
    In refining, profit plunged 58 percent due to shrinking
margins, largely due to price differentials between different
types of crude oil. 
    Refiners make more money when the price difference between
various types of crude oil is wide. When the gap narrows in the
price differences, costs tend to rise. Exxon on Thursday posted
weakness in its own refining unit.

&lt;p&gt;CONAKRY (Reuters) - A surge in cocaine trafficking has transformed Guinea into West Africa's latest drug hot spot, jeopardizing President Alpha Conde's efforts to rebuild state institutions after a military coup and attract billion of dollars in mining investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locals and Latin Americans long-accused of smuggling are operating freely in the country, some with high-level protection from within Conde's administration, according to Guinean and international law enforcement officials and internal police reports seen by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth of trafficking was overlooked as diplomats focused on securing a fragile transition back to civilian rule after the 2008 putsch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counter-narcotics agents from the United States and other countries, meanwhile, concentrated on smugglers in neighboring Guinea-Bissau, a tiny former Portuguese colony dubbed by crime experts Africa's first "narco-state".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the U.S. State Department's 2013 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report said seizures in Guinea and cases abroad traced back there show a spike in trafficking since Conde won power at a 2010 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of government figures makes estimating volumes tricky, but a foreign security source said one or two planes landed each month last year, ferrying in cocaine from Latin America mostly for smuggling to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whatever the attitude of the head of state, it's clear that traffickers can operate in Guinea. They have deep roots there," said Stephen Ellis, researcher at the African Studies Centre, Leiden, in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellis said drug money was having a corrosive effect on attempts by Conde's government to improve governance: "It's worrying because of the effects not just on the politics of Guinea, but the whole region."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A July report by Guinea's top anti-drugs agency, seen by Reuters, said traffickers were operating with protection of senior civilian, military and police officials. It said proceeds from the trade are laundered through various channels, including real estate, fishing companies and local mining operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGHWAY 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea and Guinea-Bissau are at the eastern end of "Highway 10", the nickname given by law enforcement officers for the 10th parallel north of the equator, the shortest route across the Atlantic, used by traffickers over the past decade to smuggle Latin American cocaine destined mainly for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;United Nations experts estimated last year that some 20 metric tons of cocaine, mostly from Colombia and Venezuela, pass each year through West Africa, which became an attractive transit point as U.S. and European authorities cracked down on more direct routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea's role has surged since last year, when an April U.S. sting operation targeted Guinea-Bissau's military chief, prompting traffickers to seek sanctuary in Conakry, law enforcement officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift of the trade to Guinea raises the stakes. While Guinea-Bissau is an unstable backwater of just 1.6 million people that rarely attracts notice outside a small community of West Africa watchers, Guinea has nearly 8 times as many people and a much larger regional role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With vast reserves of iron ore, it has also secured billions of dollars in pledges for investment from mining firms including Rio Tinto and Brazil's Vale. A breakdown of law and order associated with the drugs trade could have an impact on that investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the moldy, potholed seaside capital, expensive restaurants, gleaming hotels and new apartment blocks highlight pockets of wealth. But they soon give way to teeming, rubbish-strewn neighborhoods away from the center of town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are frightened to take the lid off Guinea," said one foreign official, who, like others interviewed for the story, declined to be identified. "Authorities know traffickers are there but are powerless to do anything. They need international help."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that Col. Moussa Tiegboro Camara, Guinea's top anti-narcotics officer, has been accused of involvement in a massacre of protesters under the military junta in 2009, making it impossible for Western nations to cooperate with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not respond to a request for comment, nor did officials in Conde's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government spokesman Damantang Camara denied that trafficking was rising or that the state was complicit: "There will be no compromise with drug traffickers." (Camara is a common surname in Guinea and several people in this report who share the name are not related.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those meant to keep order lack the resources to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Guinean anti-narcotics officer said his men are unarmed, need money for fuel and are forced to buy second-hand laptops. The 230 anti-drug agents are too few to police the air strips, coastal landing points or chaotic main port, making the country a smuggler's paradise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local and international officials with access to intelligence reports say cocaine is increasingly landing by sea at unmonitored ports or flown in by small planes using remote air strips. Shipments then often receive military escort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Guinean anti-drugs agents were tipped off about a boat landing carrying cocaine and tried to scramble officers to the scene near Boffa, 80 km (50 miles) north of Conakry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They didn't get very far. Before they left the capital, they were ordered off the case by other security forces. Their men later found a boat stained with dried blood and stripped of identification and communications equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were shut out by the Navy and the Gendarmerie ... They were hostile to our presence on the ground," said a Guinean anti-narcotics officer with detailed knowledge of the case. "There has been a total blackout on the incident."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"THE UNTOUCHABLES"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug trafficking in Guinea flourished in the years leading up to veteran president Lansana Conte's death in 2008. Political and military elites, including the late president's eldest son Ousmane Conte, secured the trade, according to Guinean legal documents and foreign law enforcement officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dadis Camara, the army captain who seized power in the chaos after the end of Conte's 24-year rule, hauled senior civilian and military figures before him to confess their roles in drug trafficking. The inquisitions - known as the Dadis Show - became popular TV viewing and were used to neutralize rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a signed police transcript, Ousmane Conte admitted in February 2009 to taking $300,000 from an alleged drug trafficker who used the late president's son's name to secure clearance for planes ladened with cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Washington nominated Ousmane Conte a drug kingpin. But, like others accused of trafficking, the son of the late president was soon free again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has said on national television: "I confess that I have participated in the trafficking of drugs, but I am not a godfather." Reuters was not able to reach him for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is now sidelined. But the Guinean anti-drugs officer said the network, dubbed "The Untouchables", is back in action: "We fear they've taken the president hostage. If we don't get international support, we'll never be able to tackle them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dadis Camara, the junta leader who took over after Lansana Conte's death, fled Guinea after an assassination attempt in December 2009. Elections were held the following year, bringing to power Conde, a longstanding figure in the opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conde took office after years in exile abroad. This has left him vulnerable and reliant on figures who know the system, according to a diplomat who follows Guinean politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He doesn't know who to trust ... Once they realized that he barked but did not bite, the networks reformed," the diplomat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea's drug operations initially shifted to smaller Guinea-Bissau during a crackdown after Conte's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the July memo by Guinea's top anti-drugs unit, which reports directly to the president, said traffickers had "tactically withdrawn" back to Guinea after last year's U.S. sting operation in the smaller country, which missed its target, Guinea-Bissau army chief General Antonio Injai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They had never gone very far. For a number of years, they have been in touch with Guinea's cocaine networks," the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN PLAIN VIEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, according to Guinean Supreme Court documents reviewed by Reuters, the court seized two dozen buildings owned by suspected traffickers. But legal cases subsequently fell through and the buildings were returned. They now swell the property portfolios of people accused by police of trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One, a half-finished, sky-blue building with a dry-cleaner downstairs, has risen up just down the road from the drug unit's headquarters, according to the local anti-narcotics officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government spokesman Camara said cases against traffickers during military rule had not been properly put together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their lawyers had no problem in taking them apart," he said. "Not all those traffickers were neutralized. That doesn't mean they are operating again. I don't believe that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a second international law enforcement officer, several known foreign traffickers, many of them targeted in the 2008-9 crackdown, live in Conakry. They come from countries including Colombia, Nigeria, Greece, Brazil and Suriname.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a conference in Abu Dhabi in November, Conde touted the country as "open for business" in a bid to woo Gulf investors. He won billions of dollars in mining investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Conde faces a tough battle for re-election in 2015. He must also accomplish the delicate task of keeping in check the armed forces, implicated in trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are dealing with a government that lacks the most basic forms of governance ... If you are a narco, the conditions you would want are all here," said a second Western diplomat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. State Department report said officials tackling trafficking had been threatened due to their work. A State Department spokesman, however, said there appeared to be no significant threats to Guinea's stability from trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the July 2013 memo from Guinea's anti-drug unit challenged this, calling on Guinea's highest authorities to "neutralize" traffickers operating in complicity with officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stability of the country depends on it," it warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story has been corrected to fix date in 44th paragraph to 2015)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Daniel Flynn and Peter Graff)&lt;/p&gt;

Guinea's top anti-narcotics officer, has been accused of
involvement in a massacre of protesters under the military junta
in 2009, making it impossible for Western nations to cooperate
with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not respond to a request for comment, nor did
officials in Conde's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government spokesman Damantang Camara denied that
trafficking was rising or that the state was complicit: "There
will be no compromise with drug traffickers." (Camara is a
common surname in Guinea and several people in this report who
share the name are not related.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those meant to keep order lack the resources to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Guinean anti-narcotics officer said his men are unarmed,
need money for fuel and are forced to buy second-hand laptops.
The 230 anti-drug agents are too few to police the air strips,
coastal landing points or chaotic main port, making the country
a smuggler's paradise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local and international officials with access to
intelligence reports say cocaine is increasingly landing by sea
at unmonitored ports or flown in by small planes using remote
air strips. Shipments then often receive military escort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Guinean anti-drugs agents were tipped off about a
boat landing carrying cocaine and tried to scramble officers to
the scene near Boffa, 80 km (50 miles) north of Conakry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They didn't get very far. Before they left the capital, they
were ordered off the case by other security forces. Their men
later found a boat stained with dried blood and stripped of
identification and communications equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were shut out by the Navy and the Gendarmerie ... They
were hostile to our presence on the ground," said a Guinean
anti-narcotics officer with detailed knowledge of the case.
"There has been a total blackout on the incident."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"THE UNTOUCHABLES"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug trafficking in Guinea flourished in the years leading
up to veteran president Lansana Conte's death in 2008. Political
and military elites, including the late president's eldest son
Ousmane Conte, secured the trade, according to Guinean legal
documents and foreign law enforcement officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dadis Camara, the army captain who seized power in the chaos
after the end of Conte's 24-year rule, hauled senior civilian
and military figures before him to confess their roles in drug
trafficking. The inquisitions - known as the Dadis Show - became
popular TV viewing and were used to neutralise rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a signed police transcript, Ousmane Conte admitted in
February 2009 to taking $300,000 from an alleged drug trafficker
who used the late president's son's name to secure clearance for
planes ladened with cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Washington nominated Ousmane Conte a drug kingpin.
But, like others accused of trafficking, the son of the late
president was soon free again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has said on national television: "I confess that I have
participated in the trafficking of drugs, but I am not a
godfather." Reuters was not able to reach him for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is now sidelined. But the Guinean anti-drugs officer said
the network, dubbed "The Untouchables", is back in action: "We
fear they've taken the president hostage. If we don't get
international support, we'll never be able to tackle them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dadis Camara, the junta leader who took over after Lansana
Conte's death, fled Guinea after an assassination attempt in
December 2009. Elections were held the following year, bringing
to power Conde, a longstanding figure in the opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conde took office after years in exile abroad. This has left
him vulnerable and reliant on figures who know the system,
according to a diplomat who follows Guinean politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He doesn't know who to trust ... Once they realised that he
barked but did not bite, the networks reformed," the diplomat
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guinea's drug operations initially shifted to smaller
Guinea-Bissau during a crackdown after Conte's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the July memo by Guinea's top anti-drugs unit, which
reports directly to the president, said traffickers had
"tactically withdrawn" back to Guinea after last year's U.S.
sting operation in the smaller country, which missed its target,
Guinea-Bissau army chief General Antonio Injai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They had never gone very far. For a number of years, they
have been in touch with Guinea's cocaine networks," the memo
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN PLAIN VIEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, according to Guinean Supreme Court documents
reviewed by Reuters, the court seized two dozen buildings owned
by suspected traffickers. But legal cases subsequently fell
through and the buildings were returned. They now swell the
property portfolios of people accused by police of trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One, a half-finished, sky-blue building with a dry-cleaner
downstairs, has risen up just down the road from the drug unit's
headquarters, according to the local anti-narcotics officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government spokesman Camara said cases against traffickers
during military rule had not been properly put together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their lawyers had no problem in taking them apart," he
said. "Not all those traffickers were neutralised. That doesn't
mean they are operating again. I don't believe that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a second international law enforcement officer,
several known foreign traffickers, many of them targeted in the
2008-9 crackdown, live in Conakry. They come from countries
including Colombia, Nigeria, Greece, Brazil and Suriname.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a conference in Abu Dhabi in November, Conde touted the
country as "open for business" in a bid to woo Gulf investors.
He won billions of dollars in mining investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Conde faces a tough battle for re-election in 2015. He
must also accomplish the delicate task of keeping in check the
armed forces, implicated in trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are dealing with a government that lacks the most basic
forms of governance ... If you are a narco, the conditions you
would want are all here," said a second Western diplomat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. State Department report said officials tackling
trafficking had been threatened due to their work. A State
Department spokesman, however, said there appeared to be no
significant threats to Guinea's stability from trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the July 2013 memo from Guinea's anti-drug unit
challenged this, calling on Guinea's highest authorities to
"neutralise" traffickers operating in complicity with officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stability of the country depends on it," it warned.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walton Group of Companies (Walton), a Canadian real estate 
      investment, planning, and development group with U.S. headquarters based 
      in Scottsdale, Arizona, announced today that Sam Wilkins has joined as 
      Executive Vice President, Capital Markets of Walton Asset Management 
      (WAM).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Wilkins has been a member of Walton&#8217;s Board of Advisors for the past 
      4 years, providing strategic counsel and guidance to the group of 
      companies. As Executive Vice President, Wilkins will continue to help 
      Walton implement its strategic growth plan, providing expertise in 
      advisory transactions, capital raising and investment banking. In his 
      new role, Wilkins will step down from Walton&#8217;s Board of Advisors to 
      oversee WAM&#8217;s west coast operations. He&#8217;ll be responsible for 
      institutional debt and equity capital raising, managing development 
      entities and negotiating strategic partnerships with institutional 
      investors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re excited that Sam is joining us as Executive Vice President,&#8221; said 
      Ed Steffelin, President of Walton Asset Management (USA). &#8220;With his 
      extensive background and expertise, we&#8217;re confident that Sam will carry 
      out the mission of WAM, which is centered on developing, marketing and 
      administering Walton real estate development products for institutional 
      partners.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As a Board Member, I&#8217;ve seen the success of Walton&#8217;s approach 
      firsthand,&#8221; Wilkins explained. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had the chance to watch the senior 
      leadership team at Walton in action over several years, and have 
      developed tremendous respect for their integrity and broad-ranging 
      capabilities. I look forward to furthering my involvement with Walton as 
      Executive Vice President, expanding Walton&#8217;s institutional capital 
      relationships and delivering new joint venture investment opportunities 
      to Walton&#8217;s stakeholders.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Immediately prior to joining Walton, Mr. Wilkins was a partner at North 
      Point Advisors, a San Francisco-based investment bank focused on MA and 
      private equity for consumer and real estate companies. In earlier 
      financial roles, Sam managed the Lodging, Gaming and Leisure investment 
      banking group at Banc of America Securities (formerly, Montgomery 
      Securities). He then opened and ran the West Coast office of Adams, 
      Harkness (now Canaccord Genuity) and managed the investment banking 
      business at Presidio Financial Partners. In 2004, Sam and partners 
      raised $86 million of equity capital for Chileno Bay Development 
      Partners LP, and he joined Chileno Bay as a general partner. Sam later 
      became CEO and oversaw the successful entitlement and master planning of 
      this luxury resort project in Cabo San Lucas, MX, while negotiating a 
      variety of financial transactions and strategic relationships on behalf 
      of Chileno Bay.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Wilkins graduated with honors from Yale University and the 
      University of Chicago Law School. In addition to his various roles in 
      finance, Sam practiced law at Goodwin Procter in Boston and was an 
      Associate Independent Counsel on the Iran-Contra investigations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      He lives in Mill Valley, California with his wife and three children.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI (Reuters) - In his university days in India, Satya Nadella, likely the next chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp, was a relentless questioner.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			JPMorgan Chase  Co&#8217;s New Skills at Work Initiative Will 
      Partner With the White House to Focus on Long Term Unemployed Workers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) today announced that New Skills 
      at Work &#8211; its landmark, $250 million global effort to close the 
      skills gap &#8211; will partner with the White House and use its 
      ground-breaking local workforce research to provide critical data on the 
      challenges facing the long-term unemployed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Skills at Work aims to help people get the training they need 
      to compete for the jobs that are available today and into the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We welcome the opportunity to work with the Administration to rally 
      employers across our economy to build industry-based workforce 
      partnerships that can align our investments in education and skills 
      training with current job openings and future career pathways,&#8221; said 
      JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Even though unemployment is high, we hear from our business clients 
      every day about the challenges they face finding workers with the right 
      skills for jobs that are open right now,&#8221; said Dimon. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we are 
      working with community leaders across the country &#8211; technical training 
      programs, community colleges, policymakers and employers &#8211; to address 
      this skills gap.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Joseph Carbone, President and CEO, The WorkPlace, and a key participant 
      in today&#8217;s White House event on developing a skilled workforce, said, 
      &#8220;An essential tool in helping the long-term unemployed return to work is 
      innovative, data-driven industry intelligence on the needs of the 
      business community. New Skills at Work will encourage 
      collaboration between employers and training partners while being a 
      guide for targeted investments to increase worker capacity.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. recently launched New Skills at Work, a 
      five-year workforce readiness and demand-driven training initiative. 
      Working closely with local businesses, elected officials, academics and 
      community leaders, JPMorgan Chase will use new data and industry 
      intelligence to direct grants and forge partnerships to help close the 
      skills gap.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To achieve this goal, communities need reliable local level data to tell 
      them exactly which skills are needed in which sectors, in order to drive 
      strategic local workforce planning. New Skills will begin its 
      work in nine cities -- Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Los 
      Angeles, Miami, New York, and the San Francisco Bay Area &#8211; and will, as 
      the first step in improving workforce training, develop new data to 
      create regional gap reports that analyze the specific skill needs in 
      each community.

			JPMorgan Chase  Co&#8217;s New Skills at Work Initiative Will 
      Partner With the White House to Focus on Long Term Unemployed Workers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) today announced that New Skills 
      at Work &#8211; its landmark, $250 million global effort to close the 
      skills gap &#8211; will partner with the White House and use its 
      ground-breaking local workforce research to provide critical data on the 
      challenges facing the long-term unemployed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Skills at Work aims to help people get the training they need 
      to compete for the jobs that are available today and into the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We welcome the opportunity to work with the Administration to rally 
      employers across our economy to build industry-based workforce 
      partnerships that can align our investments in education and skills 
      training with current job openings and future career pathways,&#8221; said 
      JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Even though unemployment is high, we hear from our business clients 
      every day about the challenges they face finding workers with the right 
      skills for jobs that are open right now,&#8221; said Dimon. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we are 
      working with community leaders across the country &#8211; technical training 
      programs, community colleges, policymakers and employers &#8211; to address 
      this skills gap.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Joseph Carbone, President and CEO, The WorkPlace, and a key participant 
      in today&#8217;s White House event on developing a skilled workforce, said, 
      &#8220;An essential tool in helping the long-term unemployed return to work is 
      innovative, data-driven industry intelligence on the needs of the 
      business community. New Skills at Work will encourage 
      collaboration between employers and training partners while being a 
      guide for targeted investments to increase worker capacity.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. recently launched New Skills at Work, a 
      five-year workforce readiness and demand-driven training initiative. 
      Working closely with local businesses, elected officials, academics and 
      community leaders, JPMorgan Chase will use new data and industry 
      intelligence to direct grants and forge partnerships to help close the 
      skills gap.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To achieve this goal, communities need reliable local level data to tell 
      them exactly which skills are needed in which sectors, in order to drive 
      strategic local workforce planning. New Skills will begin its 
      work in nine cities -- Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Los 
      Angeles, Miami, New York, and the San Francisco Bay Area &#8211; and will, as 
      the first step in improving workforce training, develop new data to 
      create regional gap reports that analyze the specific skill needs in 
      each community.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Those gap reports, Dimon said, will now incorporate research into and 
      analysis of challenges facing long term unemployed workers. &#8220;We

      Research and Markets: Global Data Warehousing Market Forecasts Report 
      2014-2018: IBM, Microsoft, Oracle  Teradata Dominate the Industry
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/hb9ts8/global_data) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Data Warehousing Market Forecasts Report 2014-2018: IBM, Microsoft, 
      Oracle  Teradata Dominate the Industry" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers in this market is the increased amount of data 
      generated by organizations. Due to the large amount of data generated, 
      enterprises need data warehousing solutions to automatically track the 
      performance and behavior of the information stored in their systems. In 
      addition, they require analytics to develop innovative business 
      strategies and improve their overall operational efficiency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In recent years, the high adoption of cloud computing technology by 
      enterprises has been one of the emerging trends in the Global Data 
      Warehousing market. Cloud-based data warehousing acts as an 
      infrastructure design with a higher potential than traditional data 
      warehouse deployment methods. Thus, organizations can use their private 
      cloud for supporting their data warehouse and analytics. Budget 
      constraints for IT, insufficient time to build in-house software, and 
      cost advantages attached to hosted or on-demand software subscriptions 
      are the primary factors responsible for the increased adoption of 
      cloud-based data warehousing solutions by enterprises. In addition, 
      cloud services do not have overhead costs of space, power, and cooling 
      that are generally incurred with the deployment of traditional in-house 
      data warehouse solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the difficulty in managing and improving data quality. 
      Companies have to undergo several steps of scrutiny in order to ensure 
      the high quality of data to be used for analytical purposes.

			Devon IT Announces Microsoft Lync Now on WES7 Thin Clients
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft Lync is now supported on WES7 thin clients allowing for 
      effective communication for companies with instant messaging, voice 
      communication, and web conferencing
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Devon IT today announced support for Microsoft&#8217;s unified communications 
      application, Lync, on Lenovo&#8217;s ThinkCentre M32 thin client that operates 
      using WES7.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Advancements in thin client technology have developed drastically and 
      now supports unified communication applications on thin client devices 
      for a more advanced end-user experience,&#8221; explained Joe Makoid, 
      President, Devon IT. &#8220;This is a primary example of how virtual desktop 
      solutions are giving desktop users more of a PC experience.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This new Lync application capabilities will allow Lenovo thin client 
      customers with investments in VDI to deploy Lync; including IM, 
      presence, conferencing and enterprise voice and video as a part of their 
      end-to-end strategy. This Lync application plug-in allows use of any 
      Lync certified USB audio and video devices and redirects voice and video 
      traffic from the virtualized desktop directly to the thin client running 
      the local application. The combination of both the application plug-in 
      and Microsoft RemoteFX (RDP 8) results in lower bandwidth utilization 
      for optimum communication experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For companies that require constant communication between both internal 
      and external contacts Microsoft Lync allows desktop users to easily 
      communicate with anyone in their Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Exchange 
      Server contacts. Microsoft Lync features include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Audio and video originate on the Thin Client and offloads encoding and 
        decoding of media to the Thin Client to make the solution more 
        scalable.
      
			
        Desktop sharing makes giving presentations to many different offices 
        and locations simple.
      
			
        Document collaboration which allows participants to share documents 
        and see when people add text, drawings and annotations; similar to 
        Google Documents feature.
      
			
        Windows applications sharing to allow collaboration on a specific 
        application.
      
			
        Join meetings from your office or on the road with a single click, no 
        need to dial-in or remember meeting passcodes.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the best features that MS Lync has to offer is its ability to 
      sync your contacts in Outlook and Outlook Web App. Not only are your 
      contacts synchronized but it syncs your contact preferences and 
      recognizes your contact card updates. For example: if you create a 
      contact as a favorite, Lync will store that contact in the favorite&#8217;s 
      folder as well. Microsoft Lync goes beyond other unified communication 
      applications such as IM and Skype and has many features to deliver a 
      high-tech communication platform.

&lt;p&gt;COPENHAGEN Jan 31 (Reuters) - Danish Prime Minister Helle
Thorning-Schmidt, deserted by a key ally over plans to sell part
of a state energy utility to Goldman Sachs, suffered
further blows when its chairman resigned and a poll on Friday
showed her weakened by the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Thorning-Schmidt's two coalition allies, the
Socialist People's Party, quit on Thursday over plans to sell 25
percent of the DONG energy utility, highlighting Europe's
growing unease and sometimes outright animosity towards private
utilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My party sees Goldman Sachs as a bandit in financial
matters that has played a damaging role in the development of
the financial crisis in 2008, and an investment bank that at
almost any cost is prepared to move revenues away from Denmark
to evade Danish tax," said Steen Gade, an MP for the Socialist
People's Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ostensibly backing free energy markets, many European
governments from Spain to Hungary have squeezed utilities by
intervening in power generation, capping energy prices or
re-nationalising some services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONG Chairman Fritz Schur, who stewarded a transformation
into a utility with a focus on offshore wind energy, quit late
on Thursday saying he "welcomed the new investors" but it was
time to go with a new minority shareholder coming in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONG is 81 percent owned by government with most of the rest
held by municipalities and other energy service providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Gallup poll showed that 54 percent of voters think
Thorning-Schmidt had been weakened by the row, a bad omen as she
started talks on Friday with the Social Liberal Party, her only
remaining ally, to fill six vacant cabinet posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN REJECTS CRITICISM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danish pension fund ATP, which manages 600 billion
crowns ($109 billion) and teamed up with Goldman for the DONG
stake, said the political storm would not change its decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government has no influence on ATP," Carsten Stendevad,
the fund's chief executive said. "It is not a risk-free
investment. We have looked at the risks and estimated that the
yield we could hope for corresponds to those risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also rejected the criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a long-term commitment which reflects our support
for the management team's current strategy...including the
significant renewable energy investments," Goldman said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scandinavia has so far resisted a European Union drive to
liberalise utilities, keeping energy state owned through
innovative firms building business empires across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweden's Vattenfall has become a key player on the German
market while Norway's Statkraft has grown into Europe's biggest
renewable energy firm with production from Britain to Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria's government fell last year after mass protests
against power prices. Hungary forced utilities to implement big
price cuts to relieve indebted households, making power and gas
prices the number one issue in the upcoming election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's opposition has also proposed price caps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georg Zachmann, a researcher at Brussels think tank Bruegel,
said Denmark was something of an outlier at a time of
re-nationalisation for Europe, with local distribution networks
being bought back by municipalities in places such as Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight may indeed be about a national champion, similar
to when Microsoft bought Nokia's coveted
handset business and a Chinese investor bought Volvo Cars, said
Paul Kr&#252;ger Andersen, a professor at Aarhus University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You might say this is anti-capitalism," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Twitter Inc has bought 900 patents and signed a cross-licensing agreement with IBM, making peace with Big Blue and bulking up on its intellectual property portfolio as it takes on larger rivals Google and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement announced on Friday comes after International Business Machines Corp accused Twitter in November - on the eve of its high-profile initial public offering - of infringing three of its patents. At the time, it underscored how few patents the six-year-old social media company possessed in relation to more established rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cross-licensing agreement will help safeguard Twitter against similar claims in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is one of the industry's largest research spenders and stockpilers of intellectual property, a consistent leader in U.S. patent filings and the owner of some 41,000 patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter is following on the heels of Facebook, which itself faced similar claims before its own 2012 IPO. The world's largest social network has since gone on a patent-buying spree, acquiring intellectual property from tech bellwethers, including Microsoft Corp and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This acquisition of patents from IBM and licensing agreement provide us with greater intellectual property protection and give us freedom of action to innovate on behalf of all those who use our service," Ben Lee, Twitter's legal director, said in a joint statement with IBM on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Edwin Chan; Editing by Jan Paschal)&lt;/p&gt;

few patents the six-year-old social media company possessed in
relation to more established rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cross-licensing agreement will help safeguard Twitter
against similar claims in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is one of the industry's largest research spenders and
stockpilers of intellectual property, a consistent leader in
U.S. patent filings and the owner of some 41,000 patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter is following on the heels of Facebook, which itself
faced similar claims before its own 2012 IPO. The world's
largest social network has since gone on a patent-buying spree,
acquiring intellectual property from tech bellwethers, including
Microsoft Corp and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This acquisition of patents from IBM and licensing
agreement provide us with greater intellectual property
protection and give us freedom of action to innovate on behalf
of all those who use our service," Ben Lee, Twitter's legal
director, said in a joint statement with IBM on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;Global crude oil prices and refining margins were generally lower in 
      2013 than 2012,&#8221; said Chairman and CEO John Watson. &#8220;These conditions, 
      as well as lower gains on asset sales and higher expenses, resulted in 
      lower earnings. We continue to have an advantaged portfolio, and we have 
      maintained our industry-leading position in upstream earnings per barrel 
      for the past four years.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our strong financial position and healthy cash generation in 2013 have 
      allowed us to fund a substantial investment program, add several new 
      resource opportunities and, at the same time, raise shareholder 
      distributions. Major capital projects currently under construction are 
      expected to deliver significant production growth and shareholder value 
      in the years ahead. We also raised the dividend on our common shares for 
      the 26th consecutive year and continued our share repurchase 
      program, both of which underscore our commitment to providing strong 
      shareholder returns.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Watson continued, &#8220;We made significant progress on our LNG projects in 
      Australia during the past year, with Gorgon almost 75 percent complete 
      and Wheatstone successfully reaching important construction and LNG 
      marketing milestones. We expect 2014 will be the peak year for spending 
      on these two projects as we move them closer to first production. 
      Significant progress was also made at two important Gulf of Mexico 
      deepwater projects, Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We continued to pursue shale and tight-rock opportunities during 2013,&#8221; 
      Watson noted. Key achievements included major new investments in the 
      Vaca Muerta Shale in Argentina and the Kitimat LNG Project in Canada, 
      acquisition of additional acreage in the Duvernay Shale in Canada, and 
      securing new shale opportunities in Ukraine and central Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Watson commented that the company added approximately 800 million 
      barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves in 2013. These additions, 
      which are subject to final reviews, equate to approximately 85 percent 
      of net oil-equivalent production for the year. The largest additions 
      were for the Marcellus Shale and the Permian Basin in the United States. 
      Also significant were additions for fields in Asia and Africa. The 
      company&#8217;s three-year average reserve replacement ratio is 123 percent of 
      net oil-equivalent production. The company will provide additional 
      details relating to 2013 reserve additions in its Annual Report on Form 
      10-K scheduled for filing with the SEC on February 21, 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the downstream, we progressed our new premium base-oil plant in 
      Pascagoula, Mississippi, and look forward to start-up in early 2014,&#8221; 
      Watson continued. &#8220;In addition, Chevron Phillips Chemical reached a 
      final investment decision on a new ethane cracker in Texas. Both of 
      these projects advance our strategy of focusing investments on higher 
      growth and higher margin products.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company purchased $1.25 billion of its common stock in fourth 
      quarter 2013 under its share repurchase program. Repurchases for the 
      full year totaled $5 billion. At year-end, balances of cash, cash 
      equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled $16.5 
      billion, a decrease of $5.4 billion from the end of 2012. Total debt at 
      December 31, 2013 stood at $20.4 billion, an increase of $8.2 billion 
      from a year earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			UPSTREAM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide net oil-equivalent production was 2.58 million barrels per day 
      in the fourth quarter 2013, down from 2.67 million barrels per day in 
      the 2012 fourth quarter. Production increases from project ramp-ups in 
      the United States and Nigeria were more than offset by normal field 
      declines and lower cost recovery volumes.

      U.S. upstream earnings of $803 million in the fourth quarter 2013 were 
      down $560 million from a year earlier due to lower crude oil production 
      and higher operating, income tax, depreciation and exploration expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company&#8217;s average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural 
      gas liquids was $90 in the fourth quarter 2013, down from $91 a year 
      ago. The average sales price of natural gas was $3.35 per thousand cubic 
      feet, compared with $3.22 in last year&#8217;s fourth quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net oil-equivalent production of 650,000 barrels per day in the fourth 
      quarter 2013 was down 24,000 barrels per day, or 4 percent, from a year 
      earlier. Production increases in the Marcellus Shale in western 
      Pennsylvania and the Delaware Basin in New Mexico were more than offset 
      by normal field declines elsewhere.
			The net liquids component of 
      oil-equivalent production decreased 5 percent in the 2013 fourth quarter 
      to 440,000 barrels per day, while net natural gas production decreased 1 
      percent to 1.26 billion cubic feet per day.

      International upstream earnings of $4.0 billion decreased $1.45 billion 
      from the fourth quarter 2012. The decrease between quarters was 
      primarily due to the absence of a gain of approximately $1.4 billion on 
      an asset exchange in Australia and higher exploration expenses. Foreign 
      currency effects increased earnings by $300 million in the 2013 quarter, 
      compared with a decrease of $34 million a year earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in the 
      fourth quarter 2013 was $101 per barrel, up from $100 a year earlier. 
      The average price of natural gas was $5.75 per thousand cubic feet, 
      compared with $5.97 in last year&#8217;s fourth quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net oil-equivalent production of 1.93 million barrels per day in the 
      fourth quarter 2013 was down 68,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, from 
      a year ago. Production increases due to project ramp-ups in Nigeria were 
      more than offset by normal field declines and lower cost recovery 
      volumes. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production 
      decreased 4 percent to 1.29 million barrels per day, while net natural 
      gas production decreased 3 percent to 3.84 billion cubic feet per day.

      U.S. downstream operations earned $265 million in the fourth quarter 
      2013 compared with earnings of $331 million a year earlier. The decrease 
      was mainly due to higher operating expenses reflecting repair and 
      maintenance activity at company refineries and lower margins on refined 
      product sales, partially offset by higher gains on asset sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Refinery crude oil input of 871,000 barrels per day in the fourth 
      quarter 2013 increased 169,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period. 
      The increase was primarily due to the absence of effects of an August 
      2012 incident at the refinery in Richmond, California that shut down the 
      crude unit. Refined product sales of 1.22 million barrels per day were 
      up 69,000 barrels per day from the fourth quarter 2012, mainly 
      reflecting higher gas oils, kerosene and jet fuel sales. Branded 
      gasoline sales increased 1 percent to 513,000 barrels per day.

      Net charges in the fourth quarter 2013 were $312 million, compared with 
      $538 million in the year-ago period. The change between periods was 
      mainly due to lower corporate tax items and other corporate charges.

			CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cash flow from operations in 2013 is estimated at $35.0 billion, 
      compared with $38.8 billion in 2012. Excluding working capital effects, 
      estimated cash flow from operations in 2013 is $36.3 billion, compared 
      with $38.4 billion in 2012, primarily reflecting lower earnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Capital and exploratory expenditures in 2013 were $41.9 billion, 
      compared with $34.2 billion in 2012. The amounts included $2.7 billion 
      in 2013 and $2.1 billion in 2012 for the company&#8217;s share of expenditures 
      by affiliates, which did not require cash outlays by the company. 
      Expenditures for 2013 include approximately $4 billion for major 
      resource acquisitions in Argentina, Australia, the Permian Basin and the 
      Kurdistan Region of Iraq, along with additional acreage in the Duvernay 
      Shale and interests in the Kitimat LNG Project in Canada. In addition, 
      work progressed on a number of major capital projects, particularly two 
      Australian LNG projects and two deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. 
      Expenditures for upstream represented 90 percent of the companywide 
      total in 2013.

      REFORM ACT OF 1995
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to 
      Chevron&#8217;s operations that are based on management&#8217;s current 
      expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals 
      and other energy-related industries. Words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; 
      &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;forecasts,&#8221; &#8220;projects,&#8221; 
      &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;seeks,&#8221; &#8220;schedules,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;budgets,&#8221; &#8220;outlook&#8221; and 
      similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking 
      statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance 
      and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many 
      of which are beyond the company&#8217;s control and are difficult to predict. 
      Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what 
      is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The 
      reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking 
      statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. 
      Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update 
      publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new 
      information, future events or otherwise.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing 
      crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and 
      chemicals margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of 
      exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness 
      of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological 
      developments; the results of operations and financial condition of 
      equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company&#8217;s 
      joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development 
      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company&#8217;s 
      production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation 
      networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe 
      weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the 
      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability 
      for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future 
      environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or 
      product changes required by existing or future environmental statutes, 
      regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other 
      pending or future litigation; the company&#8217;s future acquisition or 
      disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or 
      impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, 
      industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on 
      scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with 
      the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally 
      accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and 
      the factors set forth under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; on pages 28 
      through 30 of the company&#8217;s 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 
      addition, such results could be affected by general domestic and 
      international economic and political conditions. Other unpredictable or 
      unknown factors not discussed in this press release could also have 
      material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.
