&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Ten senior Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) executives, including Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, were on New Year's Eve given stock pegged to earlier restricted awards worth tens of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives, which also include Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn, Vice Chairmen Michael Evans and John Weinberg, Global Head of Human Capital Management Edith Cooper, Chief of Staff John Rogers, General Counsel Greg Palm, Global Head of Compliance Alan Cohen, and Chief Accounting Officer Sarah Smith, got a total of 508,104 shares, according to multiple filings late Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These executives sold 245,838 of those shares to cover tax obligations, and held on to the rest, which were worth $33.1 million. The shares were sold at a price of $126.24 on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares were not awarded as 2012 compensation; rather, they were grants that were awarded in prior years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the firm said Goldman had no comment on the stock delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the executives did not sell shares for profits on Monday, in recent months, top Goldman executives have been cashing in on stock awards granted in prior years that would have expired in November. Blankfein took home $5.9 million in proceeds from such transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transactions come amid a broader rally in bank shares. Goldman's stock soared 41 percent in 2012, to close the year at $127.56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This version of the story has been corrected to show that executives sold some stock received from restricted grants to cover tax obligations. Also corrects the amount of stock each received and the number executives who got shares.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra, editing by G Crosse)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other executives, including Vice Chairmen Michael Evans and
John Weinberg, Global Head of Human Capital Management Edith
Cooper, Chief of Staff John Rogers, General Counsel Greg

on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the nine executives received $26.8 million
through stock sales on Monday, selling shares at an average
price of $126.24. The shares were not awarded as 2012
compensation; rather, they were grants that were awarded in
prior years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months, top Goldman executives have been cashing
in on those grants before they expire. Including his stock sales
on Monday, Blankfein has taken home $10.1 million in proceeds
from such transactions since October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transactions come amid a broader rally in bank shares.
Goldman's stock soared 41 percent in 2012, to close the year at
$127.56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman representatives did not immediately respond to a

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An Exxon Mobil pipeline spill into the Yellowstone River in 2011 would have been far less severe if the company had not delayed closing valves, a report issued on Wednesday by federal pipeline regulators said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's Silvertip pipeline, which carries 40,000 barrels per day of crude in Montana, leaked about 1,500 barrels of oil into the Yellowstone River in July 2011 after the region suffered heavy flooding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had Exxon Mobil Pipeline Company's shutdown procedures required remote controlled valves to be closed immediately after a leak, "the crude oil release volume would have been much less," said a U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration report obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controllers closed some valves and pumps 10 minutes after the spill. But workers then waited about 46 minutes before shutting other valves, the report said. If the company had responded faster the spill would have been about two-thirds smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said erosion from the flooding exposed the pipeline to debris that severed it and caused the leak. It did not specify fault or express that Exxon violated any safety regulations. A spokesman said the agency was reviewing the report to determine if enforcement actions will be taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Silvertip routinely transports oil sands crude from Canada which environmentalists have said can corrode pipelines. The oil industry has said the petroleum is no more corrosive than other crude transported in pipelines.

    About NuVasive

    NuVasive is a medical device company focused on developing minimally
disruptive surgical products and procedurally integrated solutions for
the spine. The Company is the 4th largest player in the $7.9 billion
global spine market.

    NuVasive's principal product offering is based on its Maximum Access
Surgery, or MAS(R) platform. The MAS platform combines several categories
of solutions that collectively minimize soft tissue disruption during
spine surgery with maximum visualization and safe, easy reproducibility
for the surgeon: a proprietary software-driven nerve avoidance system and
intra-operative monitoring support; MaXcess(R), a unique split-blade
retractor system; a wide variety of specialized implants; and several
biologic fusion enhancers. MAS significantly reduces surgery time and
returns patients to activities of daily living much faster than
conventional approaches. Having redefined spine surgery with the MAS
platform's lateral approach, known as eXtreme Lateral Interbody Fusion,
or XLIF(R), NuVasive has built an entire spine franchise. With over 75
products today spanning lumbar, thoracic and cervical applications, the
Company will continue to expand and evolve its offering predicated on its
R focus and dedication to outstanding service levels supported by a
culture of Absolute Responsiveness(R).

are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements
that involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors which,
if they do not materialize or prove correct, could cause NuVasive's

&lt;p&gt;http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20130102:nBw025739a

LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Apple has won ABI Research`s Competitive Assessment of mobile application
storefronts, with Google finishing second and Microsoft third. In the
assessment, the leading app distributors were ranked by two dimensions:
implementation and innovation. 

In terms of implementation, Apple came first, ahead of Google and RIM. The
company`s superior performance in this dimension is mainly down to its effective
approach to monetization, large market share over the app industry, and the
ability to achieve a large inventory of titles while maintaining a reasonably
strict quality control. 

However, in the innovation dimension Apple is narrowly beaten by Microsoft, with
Google claiming the third spot. ABI Research is particularly impressed by
Microsoft`s fresh approach to app discovery, as well as Windows Phone store`s
overall solid usability. Discovery is an area that has been given significant
importance, because when a customer arrives at an app storefront much of the
following download activity is based on how the vendor presents and highlights
its inventory, especially through various charts. 

Senior analyst Aapo Markkanen comments, "Although Apple has done a great job
capitalizing on App Store`s head start as an app distributor, it should really
start re-thinking the way it charts the top apps. Microsoft should be lauded for
its initiative to extend its ranking algorithm beyond raw download figures, by
including factors that can actually measure the customer satisfaction and
retention. Retention-based charts are less prone to manipulation, so as an
additional plus Microsoft can also afford being more transparent about its
approach. Moves like this can help break the developers free from the `tyranny
of downloads`, decrease their reliance on costly marketing campaigns, and thus
lower the barriers to entry." 

These findings are from ABI Research`s Mobile Application Markets
(http://www.abiresearch.com/research/service/mobile-application-storefronts/)
Research Service, which focuses on the distribution and the economics of mobile
apps, providing data-driven insights on areas such as download volumes, revenues
and business models, plus trends within different applications categories. 

ABI Research provides in-depth analysis and quantitative forecasting of trends
in global connectivity and other emerging technologies. From offices in North

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Foundation Medicine, Inc., a molecular information company that brings
comprehensive cancer genomic analysis to routine clinical care, today announced
that Michael J. Pellini, M.D., president and chief executive officer, will
present an overview of the company at the 31st Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare
Conference at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco on Wednesday,
January 9, 2013 at 7:30 a.m. PT. 

Dr. Pellini will provide an update on the recent commercial launch of Foundation
Medicine`s first clinical product, FoundationOne, a pan-cancer, fully
informative genomic profile designed to help oncologists expand their patients`
treatment options. 

About FoundationOneTM

FoundationOne is a fully informative genomic profile that complements
traditional cancer decision tools and often expands treatment options by
matching each patient with targeted therapies that may be relevant to the
molecular changes in their tumor. Using next-generation sequencing,
FoundationOne interrogates all genes somatically altered in human cancers that
are validated targets for therapy or unambiguous drivers of oncogenesis based on
current knowledge. It reveals all classes of genomic alterations including base
substitutions, insertions, deletions, copy number alterations and select
rearrangements. Each patient`s genomic profile is reported to the physician
matched with targeted therapies and clinical trials that may be relevant based
on the molecular blueprint of their tumor. Results are supported by the latest
scientific and medical evidence. FoundationOne has been optimized to fit easily
into the clinical workflow of a practicing oncologist. It is available for all
solid tumors and clinical grade results can be obtained from as little as 50ng
of DNA obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples.
FoundationOne is a laboratory-developed test performed at Foundation Medicine`s
CLIA-certified facility and is currently available for all solid tumor types.
Please visit www.foundationone.com for more information. 

About Foundation Medicine

Foundation Medicine is a molecular information company dedicated to a
transformation in cancer care in which treatment is informed by a deep
understanding of the genomic changes that contribute to each patient`s unique
cancer. The company`s initial clinical assay, FoundationOneTM, is a fully
informative genomic profile to identify a patient`s individual molecular
alterations and match them with relevant targeted therapies and clinical trials.
Foundation Medicine`s molecular information platform aims to improve day-to-day
care for patients by serving the needs of clinicians, academic researchers and
drug developers to help advance the science of molecular medicine in cancer. For

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Ten senior Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) executives, including Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, were on New Year's Eve given stock pegged to earlier restricted awards worth tens of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives, which also include Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn, Vice Chairmen Michael Evans and John Weinberg, Global Head of Human Capital Management Edith Cooper, Chief of Staff John Rogers, General Counsel Greg Palm, Global Head of Compliance Alan Cohen, and Chief Accounting Officer Sarah Smith, got a total of 508,104 shares, according to multiple filings late Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These executives sold 245,838 of those shares to cover tax obligations, and held on to the rest, which were worth $33.1 million. The shares were sold at a price of $126.24 on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares were not awarded as 2012 compensation; rather, they were grants that were awarded in prior years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the firm said Goldman had no comment on the stock delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the executives did not sell shares for profits on Monday, in recent months, top Goldman executives have been cashing in on stock awards granted in prior years that would have expired in November. Blankfein took home $5.9 million in proceeds from such transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transactions come amid a broader rally in bank shares. Goldman's stock soared 41 percent in 2012, to close the year at $127.56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This version of the story has been corrected to show that executives sold some stock received from restricted grants to cover tax obligations. Also corrects the amount of stock each received and the number executives who got shares.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra, editing by G Crosse)&lt;/p&gt;

SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This news release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the federal securities laws, including but not limited to, statements regarding
future events, developments, the Company's future performance, as well as
management's expectations, beliefs, intentions, plans, estimates or projections
relating to the future (including, without limitation, statements concerning
revenue, net income and earnings per share). Risks and uncertainties exist that
may cause the results to differ materially from those set forth in these
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause the anticipated results to
differ from those described in the forward-looking statements are set forth in
Part I, Item A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2012, including but not limited to: the volume and timing of
systems sales and installations; length of sales cycles and the installation
process; the possibility that products will not achieve or sustain market
acceptance; seasonal patterns of sales and customer buying behavior; impact of
incentive payments under The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on sales and
the ability of the Company to meet continued certification requirements; the
development by competitors of new or superior technologies; the timing, cost and
success or failure of new product and service introductions, development and
product upgrade releases; undetected errors or bugs in software; product
liability; changing economic, political or regulatory influences in the
health-care industry; changes in product-pricing policies; availability of
third-party products and components; competitive pressures including product
offerings, pricing and promotional activities; the Company's ability or
inability to attract and retain qualified personnel; possible regulation of the
Company's software by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; changes of
accounting estimates and assumptions used to prepare the prior periods'
financial statements; and general economic conditions. A significant portion of
the Company's quarterly sales of software product licenses and computer hardware
is concluded in the last month of a fiscal quarter, generally with a
concentration of such revenues earned in the final ten business days of that
month. Due to these and other factors, the Company's revenues and operating
results are very difficult to forecast. A major portion of the Company's costs
and expenses, such as personnel and facilities, are of a fixed nature and,
accordingly, a shortfall or decline in quarterly and/or annual revenues
typically results in lower profitability or losses. As a result, comparison of
the Company's period-to-period financial performance is not necessarily
meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance.
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 3, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- REVA Medical, Inc. (ASX:RVA) ("REVA" or the "Company")

About REVA

REVA is a development stage medical device company incorporated in Delaware, USA, that is focused
on the development and eventual commercialization of its proprietary bioresorbable stent products.
REVA's initial product, the ReZolve&#174; scaffold, which is in a clinical study phase, combines REVA's
proprietary stent design with a proprietary polymer that is metabolized and cleared from the body.
The ReZolve scaffold is designed to offer full x-ray visibility, clinically relevant sizing, and a
controlled and safe resorption rate. In addition, by early encapsulation of the stent in the
artery tissue coupled with the loss of scaffold structure over time, the ReZolve scaffold may
reduce the incidence of late forming blood clots or otherwise reduce long-term disease
progression, potential benefits of bioresorbable scaffolds that have yet to be proven. REVA will
require clinical results and regulatory approval before it can begin selling the ReZolve scaffold.

&lt;p&gt;MILAN Jan 3 (Reuters) - Italian biopharmaceutical company
Philogen has signed a worldwide licence agreement with drug firm
Pfizer for the development of Dekavil, an experimental
treatment for autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, Pfizer will retain exclusive rights to
market any products developed during the collaboration, Philogen
said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philogen will receive an upfront payment and will be
eligible to receive milestone and royalty payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further financial details were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The licensing agreement with Pfizer accelerates our strong
commitment to Philogen's unique approach to delivering
therapeutic molecules specifically to their site of action,"
Philogen Chief Executive Duccio Neri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently in Phase 1 clinical testing, Dekavil is designed
as an "armed antibody" which selectively targets inflammatory
disease sites in the body instead of suppressing the immune
system, Philogen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Siena-based biotech group focuses on developing
treatments for disorders related to angiogenesis, the growth of
new blood vessels which can play a role in illnesses such as
cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a &#8220;significantly better than expected&#8221; ADP employment report, Goldman Sachs has raised its estimate to 200,000 for the U.S. Labor Department&#8217;s December nonfarm payroll report due Friday, the firm&#8217;s team of economists said. Separately, initial jobless claims were higher than expected for the most recent week, but the Labor Department reported some holiday distortions, the economists noted. &#8220;Overall, the data since our preliminary estimate last Friday have been strong enough to prompt us to revise up our forecast for nonfarm payrolls to 200,000,&#8221; the economists concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADP report showed private payrolls expanded by 215,000 jobs in December, easily topping a median forecast of 140,000. Initial jobless claims totaled 372,000 in the week ended December 29, slightly more than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medium-sized establishments accounted for the largest share of the ADP gain, Goldman&#8217;s economists observed. By sector, construction employment rose by an unusually large 39,000  &#160;the largest monthly gain since 2006  while employment in trade and transportation employment (+53,000) and professional and &#160;business services (+37,000) also rose, they said. In addition to the better-than-expected December figure, the November gain in private jobs was revised upward from 118,000 to 148,000, they noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a result of the stronger-than-expected ADP data, the increase in the manufacturing ISM employment index, and a solid gain in online help-wanted advertising, we are revising our forecast for the change in December nonfarm payrolls to +200,000 from +175,000. Our forecast for the unemployment rate stays at 7.7 percent,&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s economists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists polled by Reuters last week were looking for a rise of 150,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heres how ADP data stacks up against the official figures over time.&lt;/p&gt;

announced it has achieved a Silver Management &amp; Virtualization Competency
in the Microsoft Partner Network, demonstrating its ability to meet
Microsoft customers' evolving needs in today's dynamic business

complete a set of tests to prove their level of technology expertise,
submit customer references and demonstrate their commitment to customer
satisfaction by participating in an annual survey.

wide-range of business focused technology solutions that improve
operational efficiencies, enhance customer service and align with
corporate growth strategies. In addition to the Microsoft Silver Portals

Network is designed to help customers identify services and solution
providers that have demonstrated proof of their capability to deliver
quality outcomes and customer satisfaction."

    The Microsoft silver competency defines partners' success as technology

competency having a unique set of requirements and benefits formulated to
accurately represent the specific skills and services that partners bring
to the industry. Requirements for the silver competency are comparable to

ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill., Jan. 3, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Repligen Corporation announced today
that it has entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with Pfizer Inc. to advance
Repligen's spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) program, originally in-licensed from Families of SMA
(FSMA).

Families of SMA funded and directed the preclinical development of RG3039 with an investment of
more than $13 million. This was the first drug discovery program ever conducted specifically for
SMA. Repligen licensed RG3039 in 2009 from Families of SMA.

"We believe this collaboration with Pfizer, a leading pharmaceutical company with specialized
efforts in orphan and genetic diseases, has the potential to accelerate the development of
therapies for SMA," said Walter C. Herlihy, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of
Repligen.

"There is a critical need to expedite potential treatment solutions for rare diseases such as
spinal muscular atrophy, where patients have such limited options," said Jose Carlos
Gutierrez-Ramos, Senior Vice President, Pfizer BioTherapeutics R "This partnership will combine
our expert capabilities in advancing molecules for genetic diseases with Repligen's leading SMA
program."

"This licensing deal demonstrates the innovative collaborations that Families of SMA has
successfully implemented between non-profit, biotech and big pharma," stated Jill Jarecki, Ph.D.,
Research Director for Families of SMA. "These partnerships are critical for the development of new
treatments for an orphan disease such as SMA. We are extremely pleased to see Pfizer taking the
lead on the development and commercialization of the SMA program, following Repligen's development
work and FSMA's original investment."

FSMA began the Quinazoline/RG3039 program in 2000 at the very initial stages of drug development,
when risk is the highest.  It was the very first industrial drug program for SMA ever conducted. 
The direction from FSMA provided the positive results necessary to license the program to Repligen
and now Pfizer to leverage resources and expertise for clinical development.

Through FSMA's leadership and research funding of $13 million, a drug candidate has been created
that treats the underlying cause of SMA.  In preclinical studies, the drug has been shown to
efficiently cross the blood brain barrier, a critical feature for a neurological drug, and prolong
survival significantly in two different mouse models of SMA.

The FSMA research model is to fund early stage drug discovery programs for SMA and then partner
with companies for later stages and accelerated clinical development.  At the earliest stages of
drug development, programs have less than a 1% chance of success. This inherent risk along with
small patient populations has traditionally hindered industry from working on orphan diseases.

This new license agreement with Pfizer marks a significant advance for the SMA community by
securing the commitment of one of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies to develop potential
treatments for the disease.

The SMA program includes RG3039, a small molecule drug candidate in clinical development for SMA,
as well as backup compounds and enabling technologies.  Under the terms of the agreement, Repligen
is responsible for completing the first two cohorts of an active Phase 1 trial evaluating RG3039
in healthy volunteers, which it anticipates will occur during the first quarter of 2013. Repligen
will also provide certain technology transfer services to Pfizer who will then assume full
responsibility for the SMA program moving forward, including the conduct of any registration
trials necessary for product approval. Repligen has previously received U.S. Orphan Drug and Fast
Track designations for RG3039 for the treatment of SMA, as well as Orphan Medicinal Product
designation in the EU.

Families of SMA

Families of SMA is the world's leader focused on funding SMA research to develop a treatment and
cure for the disease. The successful results and progress that the organization has delivered,
from basic research to drug discovery to clinical trials, provide real hope for families and
patients impacted by the disease. The charity has invested over $55 million in research and has
been involved in funding half of all the ongoing novel drug programs for SMA. Families of SMA is a
nonprofit 501(c)3 organization, with 31 Chapters and 90,000 members and supporters throughout the
United States. The organization's work has produced major discoveries, including identification of
the underlying cause and a back-up gene for the disease, which provides a clearly defined target
for disease altering therapies. The organization is also dedicated to supporting SMA families
through networking, information and services and to improving care for all SMA patients.

About ZELTIQ

ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ZLTQ) is a medical technology company focused on developing and
commercializing products utilizing its proprietary controlled-cooling technology platform.
ZELTIQ's first commercial product, the CoolSculpting System, is designed to selectively reduce
stubborn fat bulges that may not respond to diet or exercise. CoolSculpting is based on the
scientific principle that fat cells are more sensitive to cold than the overlying skin and
surrounding tissues. CoolSculpting utilizes patented technology of precisely controlled cooling to
reduce the temperature of fat cells in the treated area, which is intended to cause fat cell
elimination through a natural biological process known as apoptosis. ZELTIQ developed
CoolSculpting to safely, noticeably, and measurably reduce the fat layer within a treated fat
bulge without requiring the patient to diet or exercise.

proprietary drug discovery and drug development platform, ChemoCentryx has generated multiple
clinical and preclinical-stage programs, each targeting distinct chemokine and chemoattractant
receptors with different small molecule compounds. The Company's most advanced drug candidate,
vercirnon (also known as Traficet-EN, CCX282 or GSK1605786), a specific CCR9 inhibitor, completed
a multi-national clinical trial, called PROTECT-1, in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's
disease, where it demonstrated the ability to induce a clinical response and to maintain clinical
remission, and is now in Phase III clinical development. The Company's lead independent drug
candidate, CCX140, a CCR2 inhibitor, has been shown to be safe and well tolerated while
demonstrating clinical activity on glycemic indices in a Phase II clinical trial in type 2
diabetics, and is now in Phase II clinical development for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.
In addition, CCX872, the Company's next-generation CCR2 inhibitor, is in Phase I clinical
development. Other clinical programs include CCX354 (also known as GSK2941266), a CCR1 inhibitor
which successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,
and CCX168, a C5aR inhibitor in Phase II clinical development for the treatment of anti-neutrophil
cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. ChemoCentryx also has several programs in
advanced preclinical development.

combining the two technologies to stream media with immersive DTS sound. Moving
forward, the collaboration with Microsoft will enable a vast and growing number
of consumer electronics products to stream in DTS, allowing consumers to enjoy
their streaming content with the same high-impact DTS surround sound that can be
found on optical media formats, such as Blu-ray. 

"We are pleased to be working with Microsoft to deploy our advanced audio
solutions into the Smooth Streaming ecosystem," said Mark Johnson, vice
president, streaming and media solutions at DTS. "Smooth Streaming is one of the
most widely used platforms for the digital transmission of premium content to
connected devices, and now with support for DTS audio solutions, streaming
services that utilize the platform can begin to offer a highly differentiated,
immersive entertainment experience that complements their video content with
high-quality DTS surround sound." 

Infrastructure partners, including those in charge of content preparation and
distribution tools, will also be implementing DTS in Smooth Streaming
functionality, which will enable tens of thousands of premium content titles to
stream in DTS surround sound.

&lt;p&gt;http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20130103:nBw035287a

WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Repligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN) announced today that it has entered into an
exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with Pfizer Inc. to advance Repligen`s
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) program, originally in-licensed from Families of
SMA (FSMA). The SMA program includes RG3039, a small molecule drug candidate in
clinical development for SMA, as well as backup compounds and enabling
technologies. Under the terms of the agreement, Repligen is entitled to receive
up to $70 million from Pfizer, commencing with an upfront payment of $5 million
and total potential future milestone payments of up to $65 million as well as
royalties on any future sales of SMA compounds developed under the agreement.
SMA is an orphan neurodegenerative genetic disease that presents early in life. 

"This agreement is consistent with the strategic decision we announced in August
2012 to focus Repligen`s internal efforts on the growth of our bioprocessing
business, while seeking external partners for our therapeutic development
programs," said Walter C. Herlihy, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer
of Repligen. "We believe this collaboration with Pfizer, a leading
pharmaceutical company with specialized efforts in orphan and genetic diseases,
has the potential to accelerate the development of therapies for SMA." 

"There is a critical need to expedite potential treatment solutions for rare
diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy, where patients have such limited
options," said Jose Carlos Gutierrez-Ramos, Senior Vice President, Pfizer
BioTherapeutics R "This partnership will combine our expert capabilities in
advancing molecules for genetic diseases with Repligen`s leading SMA program." 

Under the terms of the agreement, Repligen is responsible for completing the
first two cohorts of an active Phase 1 trial evaluating RG3039 in healthy
volunteers, which it anticipates will occur during the first quarter of 2013.
Repligen will also provide certain technology transfer services to Pfizer, who
will then assume full responsibility for the SMA program moving forward,
including the conduct of any registration trials necessary for product approval.
Repligen has previously received U.S. Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations
for RG3039 for the treatment of SMA, as well as Orphan Medicinal Product
designation in the EU. 

"This licensing deal demonstrates the innovative collaborations that Families of
SMA has successfully implemented between non-profit, biotech and big pharma,"
stated Jill Jarecki, Ph.D., Research Director for Families of SMA. "These
partnerships are critical for the development of new treatments for an orphan
disease such as SMA. We are extremely pleased to see Pfizer taking the lead on
the development and commercialization of the SMA program, following Repligen`s
development work and FSMA`s original investment." 

Families of SMA, a patient organization dedicated to funding research to advance
therapies for SMA, funded and directed the preclinical development of RG3039
with an investment of more than $13 million. This was the first drug discovery
program ever conducted specifically for SMA. Repligen`s research and clinical
efforts, including the current Phase 1b trial, have been partially supported by
a $1.4 million grant from the Muscular Dystrophy Association. 

About Spinal Muscular Atrophy

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease in
which a defect in the SMN1 (survival motor neuron) gene results in low levels of
the protein SMN and leads to progressive damage to motor neurons. It is the
leading cause of infant mortality and the second most common inherited
neuromuscular disease, with symptoms that typically emerge before the age of
two. SMA is characterized by progressive muscle weakness leading to severe
physical disability and, often, early loss of life due to respiratory
insufficiency. 

About Families of SMA

Families of SMA is the world`s leader focused on funding SMA research to develop
a treatment and cure for the disease. The successful results and progress that
the organization has delivered, from basic research to drug discovery to
clinical trials, provide real hope for families and patients impacted by the
disease. The charity has invested over $55 million in research and has been
involved in funding half of all the ongoing novel drug programs for SMA.
Families of SMA is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization, with 31 Chapters and 90,000
members and supporters throughout the United States. The organization`s work has
produced major discoveries, including identification of the underlying cause and
a back-up gene for the disease, which provides a clearly defined target for
disease-altering therapies. The organization is also dedicated to supporting SMA
families through networking, information and services and to improving care for
all SMA patients. For more information: www.curesma.org. 

About the Muscular Dystrophy Association

The Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) is the leading nonprofit health agency
dedicated to finding treatments and cures for more than 40 neuromuscular
diseases, including SMA, by funding worldwide research. MDA also funds
comprehensive health care and support services, advocacy, information and
education, and accessible summer camp for thousands of youngsters fighting
progressive muscle diseases. To date, MDA has invested more than $41.6 million
in SMA research, funding basic research and clinical trials of therapeutic
strategies such as gene-based therapies, small-molecule development, and stem
cells. MDA, along with other SMA patient advocacy groups, has been working with
policymakers to explore the potential of expanding newborn screening panels to
include SMA. For more information, visit mda.org and follow MDA on Facebook

BEDMINSTER, N.J. &amp; RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced today that Thomas van Haarlem, M.D.,
Aerie`s President and Chief Executive Officer, will present an overview and
update of the Company`s novel glaucoma therapies at the 31st Annual J.P. Morgan
Healthcare Conference on Thursday, January 10 at 1:00 pm PT at the Westin St.
Francis Hotel in San Francisco. 

About Aerie Pharmaceuticals

Aerie Pharmaceuticals is a privately held pharmaceutical company in late Phase 2
dedicated to the discovery and development of novel small-molecule treatments
for glaucoma. Aerie`s internal research and development engine has generated an
innovative glaucoma pipeline of three proprietary products, all of which are
well tolerated, high efficacy, once-daily eye drop therapies that include the
first new mechanisms of action for glaucoma treatment in nearly 20 years.
Aerie`s products have blockbuster potential within the $4 billion U.S. / E.U.
market and are expected to commence commercialization by 2016. 

The Company`s lead product candidate, AR-12286, is a highly selective Rho Kinase
inhibitor that is the first glaucoma therapy to reduce intraocular pressure by
relaxing and clearing the trabecular meshwork, which is the eye`s main fluid
drain. AR-12286 is expected to be the new, convenient second-line glaucoma drug
of choice, in a market where nearly half of patients require second-line or
add-on therapy. Aerie`s PG286 fixed combination with travoprost is the first
glaucoma therapy to lower intraocular pressure by opening both of the eye`s
fluid drains. This new second-line therapy offers the convenience of two drugs
in one eye drop and the highest efficacy of any single drop glaucoma medication.
The Company`s third product, AR-13324, is a potential first line therapy and the
first of a new dual action drug class that reduces the eye`s fluid inflow while
also increasing fluid outflow through the trabecular meshwork drain, all in a
highly effective single drop per day. 

Aerie is located in Bedminster, New Jersey and Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina. Further information on the Company is available at
www.aeriepharma.com.

PALO ALTO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
CardioDx, Inc., a pioneer in the field of cardiovascular genomic diagnostics,
today announced that the company will present at the 31st Annual J.P. Morgan
Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. 

David Levison, the company`s President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide
an overview of CardioDx and of Corus&#174; CAD, the only clinically validated gene
expression test for obstructive coronary artery disease, on Thursday, January
10, 2013 at 10:00 a.m. PT at the Westin St. Francis Hotel. 

Corus CAD is a decision-making tool that can help primary care clinicians and
cardiologists exclude obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) as the cause of
a stable nondiabetic patient's symptoms. The test involves a routine blood draw
conveniently administered in the clinician`s office, and does not expose
patients to risk of radiation or imaging agent intolerance. It is the only
sex-specific test for obstructive CAD, accounting for critical biological
differences between men and women. Corus CAD has now been used to assess more
than 33,000 U.S. patients. 

In August 2012, Medicare coverage was established for the Corus CAD gene
expression test for evaluating patients presenting with typical and atypical
symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease, making the test a covered
benefit for more than 40 million Medicare enrollees in the U.S. 

Corus CADhas been recognized by The Wall Street Journal`s Technology Innovation
Awards, honored as a Gold Edison Award recipient, and named one of TIME`s Top
Ten Medical Breakthroughs. CardioDx was recently honored as one of
FierceMedicalDevices` "Fierce 15" most promising privately held medical device
and diagnostic companies. 

About CardioDx

CardioDx, Inc., a pioneer in the field of cardiovascular genomic diagnostics, is
committed to developing clinically validated tests that empower clinicians to
better tailor care to each individual patient. Strategically focused on coronary
artery disease, cardiac arrhythmia and heart failure, CardioDx is poised to
expand patient access and improve healthcare quality and efficiency through the
commercialization of genomic technologies. For more information, please visit

PRINCETON, N.J. &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Ophthotech Corp. announced today that the company will participate in the 31st
Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference to be held Jan. 7-10, 2013. Samir
Patel, M.D., president and chief executive officer of Ophthotech, will deliver a
presentation on Mon., Jan. 7 at 2:30 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST) in
presentation room Elizabethan C/D at the Westin St. Francis Hotel, San
Francisco. The presentation will focus on Ophthotech`s lead compound Fovista
(anti-PDGF agent) for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular
degeneration (wet AMD). 

About Ophthotech

Ophthotech Corporation is a privately held biopharmaceutical company with proven
capabilities and expertise in discovering, developing and commercializing
first-in-class therapies for the treatment of major ophthalmic diseases.
Ophthotech`s lead compound Fovista (previously known as E10030) is being
developed for use in combination with anti-VEGF therapy for the treatment of
patients with wet AMD. Today, wet AMD represents a growing, $4 to $5
billion-dollar market, yet there remains an unmet need. The majority of patients
are unable to achieve significant visual gain, and many patients lose additional
vision with the current standard of care, anti-VEGF monotherapy. 

In addition to Fovista, Ophthotech`s pipeline also includes an anti-C5 agent,
ARC1905, a potent and selective inhibitor of factor C5 of the complement cascade
being developed for the treatment of dry AMD. Like wet AMD, dry AMD represents a
substantial market opportunity, with 15 to 20 million Americans and Europeans
affected, and no approved therapy. 

Ophthotech`s venture investors include SV Life Sciences, Novo Ventures, HBM
Partners and Clarus Ventures. Ophthotech is headquartered in Princeton, NJ, with
offices in New York. For more information, please visit www.ophthotech.com.

Morgan Healthcare Conference on Wednesday, January 9, 2013 at 2:30 p.m. PT at the Westin St.

About ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc.:

ZIOPHARM Oncology is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization
of new cancer therapies.  The Company's clinical programs include:

Palifosfamide (ZIO-201) is a potent bi-functional DNA alkylating agent that has activity in
multiple tumors by evading typical resistance pathways.  Palifosfamide is in the same class as
bendamustine, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide.  Intravenous palifosfamide is currently being
studied in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (PICASSO 3) for the
treatment of first-line metastatic soft tissue sarcoma and is also in a pivotal Phase 3 trial
(MATISSE) for first-line metastatic small cell lung cancer.  Additionally, the Company is
developing an oral capsule form of palifosfamide.

Ad-RTS IL-12 is currently being tested in a Phase 2 study. Ad-RTS IL-12 uses synthetic biology to
enable controlled, local delivery of therapeutic interleukin-12 (IL-12), a protein important for
an immune response to cancer.  ZIOPHARM's DNA synthetic biology platform is being developed in
partnership with Intrexon Corporation and employs an inducible gene-delivery system that enables
controlled, local delivery of genes that produce therapeutic proteins to treat cancer.  This is
achieved by placing IL-12 under the control of a proprietary biological "switch" (the RheoSwitch
Therapeutic System&#174;, RTS&#174;) to turn on/off the therapeutic protein expression at the tumor site.

Indibulin (ZIO-301) is a novel, tubulin binding agent that is expected to have several potential
benefits, including oral dosing, application in multi-drug resistant tumors, no neuropathy and a
tolerable toxicity profile.  It is currently being studied in a Phase 1/2 trial in metastatic
breast cancer.

Darinaparsin (ZIO-101) is a novel mitochondrial-and hedgehog-targeted agent (organic arsenic)
currently in ongoing studies with Solasia Pharma K.K.

ZIOPHARM's operations are located in Boston, MA, and New York City.  Further information about
ZIOPHARM may be found at www.ziopharm.com

&lt;p&gt;* First production at Hebron set for 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* 3,500 construction jobs to be created&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Fourth major offshore Newfoundland project&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jeffrey Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp 
said on Friday it is moving ahead with the next major oil
project in the North Atlantic, the $14 billion Hebron
development off the Newfoundland coast, boosting its
already-large investments in Canada's most oil-rich regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the biggest U.S. oil major, said it will
produce 150,000 barrels of oil a day at Hebron using a massive
concrete gravity-base structure like the one employed at the
nearby Hibernia project, which has been operating in the
iceberg-prone region since the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First production of the project's heavy crude is scheduled
for 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The green light for Hebron, the fourth major offshore
Newfoundland oil project, encouraged owners of energy operations
in harsh areas in a week during which critics pilloried the
industry for an accident in the Far North.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, opponents of Royal Dutch Shell's
 Arctic oil program called on the Obama administration
to put offshore drilling plans in the region on hold after its
oil rig broke away from tow boats in high seas and ran aground
off Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Exxon Mobil said its own experience in
Arctic development would serve it well as it and its partners
develop Hebron in the tough Atlantic operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 700 million barrel project, in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin,
350 km (200 miles) southeast of St John's, Newfoundland, is well
below the Arctic Circle. Discovered in 1980, the development
follows others - Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose - in the
region. It won regulatory approval last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Exxon Mobil, Hebron is moving forward just as it is set
to start production from the C$10.9 billion Kearl oil sands
project in Northern Alberta, operated by its Canadian affiliate
Imperial Oil Ltd.. The first phase will pump 110,000
barrels a day of bitumen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's investments extend a trend to bulking up on
more operations in North America, where advances in technology
have reignited an energy production boom, said Fadel Gheit,
analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon has legacy assets both onshore and offshore Canada,
and this project, although it's not a company maker ... it's
obviously positive. A lot of other companies in recent months
have showed interest in Eastern Canada," Gheit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last January, for example, Shell won bids for four blocks of
acreage off Nova Scotia, by offering to spend C$970 million on
exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, Hebron was at the center of a debate
between the Newfoundland and Labrador government and the oil
industry, in which the province complained of being
short-changed as huge energy developments moved forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, they agreed to a new fiscal arrangement and the
province paid C$110 million for a 4.9 percent interest. In 2008,
the cost had been estimated at C$5 billion to C$7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil has since become a major driver of the economy in
Newfoundland, which had long had the status of a "have-not"
province due partly to the collapse of the cod fishery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government of Premier Kathy Dunderdale estimated that
the project would mean C$23 billion in provincial royalties,
taxes and return on investment through the government-owned
energy company, Nalcor Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal has been to ensure that Newfoundlanders and
Labradorians are the main benefactors with respect to our
natural resources, and that the development of Hebron maximizes
benefits for the people of the province, Dunderdale said in a
statement. "Hebron will support jobs, the economy and
strengthens our province's position as an energy warehouse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil said the production structure, designed to hold
1.2 million barrels of the heavy Hebron crude, is being built at
the Bull Arm construction site in Newfoundland. It will provide
3,500 construction jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest logical market for the Hebron crude is the U.S.
Gulf Coast, where numerous refineries have the equipment needed
to process heavy oil, said Greg Haas, manager of research for
Houston-based Hart Energy LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some East Coast plants, including PBF Energy's Paulsboro,
New Jersey, and Delaware City refineries, also have capacity to
run such supply, Haas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil shares were up 53 cents at $89.08 on the New
York Stock Exchange late in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other partners in Hebron are Chevron Corp,
Suncor Energy Inc and Statoil ASA.&lt;/p&gt;

* Development of field offshore Newfoundland and Labrador to produce more than
700 million barrels of oil, an increase versus earlier estimates 
* Gravity-based platform designed for daily oil production of 150,000 barrels 
* First oil anticipated in 2017

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today it will develop the Hebron
oil field offshore the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador using a
gravity-based structure that will recover more than 700 million barrels of oil,
an increase versus earlier estimates. 

Capital cost for the project, which is expected to begin oil production around
the end of 2017, is estimated at $14 billion. The platform is being designed for
daily production of 150,000 barrels of oil. 

"Hebron is one of several large-scale oil developments that ExxonMobil will
bring on stream in the next five years," said Neil W. Duffin, president of
ExxonMobil Development Company. "ExxonMobil will employ its expertise in Arctic
development and project execution to develop this world-class resource in
challenging operating conditions." 

Hebron`s development will provide significant benefits to the province,
including employment for up to 3,500 people during construction in the province,
and royalties and taxes to fund provincial infrastructure, social programs and
services. 

The project received regulatory approval from the governments of Canada and
Newfoundland and Labrador in May. 

Hebron will be developed using a stand-alone gravity-based structure consisting
of reinforced concrete designed to withstand sea ice, icebergs and
meteorological and oceanographic conditions. The base will be designed to store
approximately 1.2 million barrels of crude oil and will support an integrated
topsides deck that includes a living quarters and facilities to perform drilling
and production. 

Front-end engineering and design was completed last year and significant
progress has been achieved on detailed engineering. Current cost estimates
reflect advanced project definition and current market and foreign exchange
rates. 

Construction of the gravity-based structure is under way at the project`s
primary construction site in Bull Arm, Newfoundland and Labrador. Topsides
fabrication is expected to begin later this year. 

Hebron will be operated by ExxonMobil affiliate, ExxonMobil Canada Properties,
which holds 36 percent equity in the project. Hebron co-venturers are Chevron
Canada Limited (26.7%), Suncor Energy Inc. (22.7%), Statoil Canada (9.7%) and
Nalcor Energy Oil and Gas (4.9%). 

The Hebron field is located offshore Newfoundland and Labrador in the Jeanne
d'Arc Basin more than 200 miles (350 kilometers) southeast of the capital of St.
John's and about 19 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of ExxonMobil`s Hibernia
project. Water depth is approximately 300 feet (92 meters).

Smart TV Alliance introduces 5 new members and an updated SDK at CES 2013,
increasing market reach, promoting richer apps and optimizing Smart TV
experience


LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Smart TV Alliance announced today that five new industry-leading manufacturers
and solution providers joined the Alliance to stimulate cross-platform Smart TV
applications and services. Consumers will enjoy a richer Smart TV experience
with 3D video, the highest quality video and audio, and the greatest variety of
content with applications created from a new software development kit (SDK) for
2013 TVs from global manufacturers. 

New Smart TV Alliance members include manufacturers Panasonic, ABOX42 and
TechniSat, and solution providers IBM and Specific Media. They recognize the
need for and value in being able to develop and provide apps across multiple
platforms and join Alliance founders LG Electronics, TP Vision and Toshiba, as
well as Obigo, Qualcomm Incorporated and YuMe, in creating a non-proprietary
ecosystem for application developers to create attractive, platform-independent
services. 

"Smart TV Alliance members are repairing a fragmented market opportunity for app
developers and TV manufacturers, creating the best Smart TV experience for
consumers," said Richard Choi, president of Smart TV Alliance from founding
member LG Electronics. "Now app developers can concentrate on doing what they do
best. Instead of chasing down each manufacturer`s individual requirements and
compliance process, they can make the most out of their creative energy by
developing innovative applications and services." 

The upcoming SDK captures the latest trends and features available to app
developers so they will be able to deliver the most current and exciting apps
for 2013 Smart TVs from LG, TP Vision and Toshiba. The new SDK features include:


For 2013 Smart TVs:

* Richer applications available from upgraded HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
specifications 
* 3D video 
* MPEG-DASH support with more reliable audio and video quality with less
stuttering and freezing 
* More and better content choices with updated digital rights management (DRM)
features that reflect DRM requirements from content owners

For application developers:

* New common emulator allows developers to test an application once to ensure it
will work with Smart TV Alliance member televisions 
* Application compliance checking tool enables developers to test compliance
automatically with Smart TV Alliance cross-platform requirements 
* Advanced debug tools help developers solve application problems faster and
more easily

Smart TV Alliance CES 2013 Events

Smart TV Alliance will host two events in Las Vegas on Jan. 9, a press event and
a developers` conference.

* The Smart TV Press Event at 11 a.m. will include presentations by Alliance
members, as well as an introduction of the new SDK, a joint quality assurance
pilot program, and a review of the Alliance roadmap. 
* The Developers Conference from 6 to 9 p.m. will include demonstrations of apps
on new Smart TV Alliance compatible TVs and technical presentations including an
application development case study by Obigo.

Contact Smart TV Alliance to request an invitation to either event. 

About Smart TV Alliance

Founders LG Electronics, TP Vision and Toshiba established Smart TV Alliance in
2012 to create attractive, platform-independent services for Smart TV
applications. Smart TV Alliance's mission is to create a large and productive
ecosystem for Smart TV application development that gives manufacturers a faster
path to more and better TV applications, enables developers to write
applications once for many different platforms, and provides consumers with a

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co started an internal cost-cutting review several weeks ago that may include layoffs at its studio and other units, three people with knowledge of the effort told Reuters, in an early sign that big companies may not be finished tightening their belts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, whose empire spans TV, film, merchandise and theme parks, is exploring cutbacks in jobs it no longer needs because of improvements in technology, one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also looking at redundant operations that could be eliminated following a string of major acquisitions over the past few years, said the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people did not want to be identified because Disney has not disclosed the internal review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of repeated and sometimes severe cost cutting in the wake of the financial crisis, by last summer it looked as though Corporate America had trimmed all the fat and was back on the path of profits through operating growth. But news Disney is weighing cuts - on the heels of Eli Lilly and Co's warning last week that cost controls would drive earnings this year - could herald yet another wave of retrenchment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney executives warned in November that the rising cost of sports rights and moribund home video sales would dampen growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are constantly looking at eliminating redundancies and creating greater efficiencies, especially with the rapid rise in new technology," said Disney spokeswoman Zenia Mucha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of profit margin, Disney's studio is the least profitable of the entertainment conglomerate's four major product divisions. The studio had a profit margin of 12.3 percent in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its fifth division, the interactive unit that creates online games, lost $758 million over the last three years, according to the company's financial filings. The unit lost $216 million last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney could trim jobs at both the studio and interactive divisions as well as its music arm, said Tony Wible, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, who has a neutral rating on the company's stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The media company is in what CEO Bob Iger calls a "transition year" after spending on projects such as the "Cars Land" expansion at the Disneyland Resort in California and a new cruise ship that launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We invested a lot of money in our theme parks and resorts business," Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo told a media conference in December. "We want to execute against delivering the returns that we've been promising all of you for the years that we've been making those investments. We really want to hunker down on it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CUTS NOT CERTAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff cuts are not a certainty at this point, the source added, although the company has a history of streamlining operations through layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the interactive group laid off about 200 people at its video games unit after what Disney executives said at the time was a shift away from console games to focus on online and mobile entertainment. In September, 50 employees at Disney Interactive were laid off in a restructuring of the money-losing unit, according to one of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also made cuts at its publishing unit last year, and cut workers at its studio in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not necessarily a negative thing," said Michael Morris, an analyst with Davenport and Co who has a buy recommendation on the stock but was not aware of the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It speaks to a fiscally responsible management."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CORPORATE AMERICA CUTS BACK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Disney does make some cuts, it would be the latest company to warn that costs still need to come under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly said last week that sales this year would be flat to slightly higher, but said profit growth would exceed Wall Street estimates on the back of cost controls. In late December, book publisher Scholastic Corp said it too would look for cost savings in the current fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney and Lilly are far from alone, though. Tech companies in particular are expected to have been hurt by the fourth-quarter uncertainty over the impending "fiscal cliff" of automatic tax increases and spending cuts which led corporate clients to slow or stop spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress agreed to a deal on January 1 that averted the cliff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear of the cliff may have affected sales across a range of industries, further clouding the growth picture. Retailers are also expected to contend with the fallout of a lackluster holiday season, which could lead to cutbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomson Reuters corporate earnings research analyst Greg Harrison said many of the themes that held true in 2012 -- like cost cuts that helped earnings, even as sales stalled -- were likely to carry over into this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the absence of any fresh catalysts for profits emerging, it may be reasonable to expect that current estimates for earnings growth in the low- to mid-single digits throughout 2013 may shrink, even though analysts believe that the slowest part of the earnings growth is now behind us," Harrison wrote in a preview of the fourth-quarter earnings season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a trend is emerging, it should begin to be clear as soon as the next two weeks, as companies start reporting 2012 results and offering up their 2013 outlooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STUDIO COULD BE TARGET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present review, headed by CFO Rasulo, has already identified areas to change in the company's travel policy, said one of the sources. It is also looking at a hiring freeze rather than layoffs, said a second source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuts are most likely at the studio, said two of the three sources, where the strategy has changed to focus on fewer films and rely more on outside producers such as Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio, which finances its own films and pays Disney a fee to market and distribute them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film strategy shift began when Iger took over as CEO in late 2005. Under Iger, the company purchased "Toy Story" creator Pixar Animation and Marvel, which brought it characters such as "Thor" and "Iron Man" that featured in this summer's blockbuster hit "The Avengers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney completed a $4.06 billion acquisition of "Star Wars" creator George Lucas' Lucasfilm in December, and has said that it will begin producing new installments of the lucrative franchise in 2015, and make a film every two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in the company fell 2.3 percent on Monday to close at $50.97, sharply underperforming broader markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwin Chan, Richard Pullin and Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, TX, Jan 07 (Marketwire) -- 
ClearCorrect, LLC, announced today it received notice that the US
International Trade Commission (ITC) has terminated an investigation
brought by Invisalign maker Align Technology, Inc.

    On January 4, 2013, the Commission issued notice that it had terminated
the March 2012 enforcement complaint filed by Align against ClearCorrect
Operating, LLC, ("ClearCorrect USA") and ClearCorrect Pakistan (Private),
Ltd., ("ClearCorrect Pakistan"). Align's enforcement complaint sought to
bind ClearCorrect USA and ClearCorrect Pakistan to the terms of a 2006
Consent Order between Align and former competitor OrthoClear, because
certain employees of ClearCorrect Pakistan once worked for OrthoClear.
The ITC, however, found that there has been "no violation of the consent
order" by ClearCorrect USA or ClearCorrect Pakistan and terminated the
case.

    "We're very happy with this decision from the ITC," said Jarrett
Pumphrey, ClearCorrect's CEO. "We think the decision validates what we've
been saying all along: we're not OrthoClear."

    Still on the table is the patent infringement complaint Align also filed
with the ITC. Bolstered by its victory in the enforcement case,
ClearCorrect is as confident as ever that it does not infringe any valid
intellectual property, and in fact, looks forward to invalidating the
overly-broad patent claims Align has served up.

    "ClearCorrect's recent victory does not end its pursuit of judicial
findings that Align's patent claims are invalid because they merely claim
what orthodontists have been doing for decades," said Mike Myers,
ClearCorrect's legal counsel. "The validity of Align's patent claims was
last tested in its litigation against Ormco Corporation when the United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit invalidated every Align
patent claim it reviewed."

&lt;p&gt;http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20130107:nBw076563a

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan and the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) released today
Perspectives on Progress, a report that reveals the experiences, expectations,
and perceptions of 99 impact investors in 2012, as well as their plans for 2013.
The survey indicates a growing market, with respondents planning to commit USD 9
billion to impact investing in 2013, up from a total commitment of USD 8 billion
in 2012. 

Additionally, the vast majority of surveyed investors report that their impact
investment portfolio performance is meeting or exceeding social, environmental,
and financial expectations, which is critical to impact investments as impact
investors seek measurable social and environmental impact alongside financial
returns. Two-thirds of respondents are principally pursuing market-rate
financial returns. Investors surveyed for the report include fund managers,
development finance institutions, foundations, diversified financial
institutions, and other investors with at least USD 10 million committed to
impact investment. 

"At J.P. Morgan Social Finance, we are especially encouraged by the findings in
this survey - that, despite the market`s early stage, investors' portfolios are
meeting financial expectations in addition to social and environmental
expectations," said Yasemin Saltuk, Director of Research for J.P. Morgan Social
Finance and co-author of the report. "The findings from this report are
insightful and we are optimistic for the continued growth in investments that
have a positive social and environmental impact." 

"Although investors have been making socially and environmentally motivated
investments for quite some time, collaboration to develop a coherent and
supportive market has increased significantly in the last five years," said Amit
Bouri, Managing Director at the GIIN and co-author of the report. "In the
results of this survey, we see positive indication of a market growing in both
size and sophistication, which we hope will encourage more activity and attract
new investors to the impact investing field." 

Though the impact investing market is relatively new, a majority of respondents
report that some or many investments passed their initial screens in nearly all
regions of the world, with U.S. &amp; Canada, South Asia, and Latin America &amp; the
Caribbean providing the most robust pipelines to surveyed investors. However,
respondents believe the market is still challenged by a lack of appropriate
capital across the risk/return spectrum and a shortage of high-quality
investment opportunities. Encouragingly, surveyed investors indicate that
progress was made in these areas and across other indicators of market growth in
2012. 

Respondents also highlight the importance of impact measurement for both raising
capital and general industry development. Notably, 96 percent of respondents
measure their social and/or environmental impact, with most utilizing
third-party standards, including the Impact Reporting and Investment Standards
(IRIS) metrics, offered as a free public good by the GIIN. 

Perspectives on Progress is the third in a series of reports, started in 2010,
that present perceptions of the impact investment market as well as portfolio
performance from a sample of impact investors. Impact investments are
investments that are made into companies, organizations, and funds with the
intention to generate measurable social and environmental impact alongside a
financial return. They can be made in both emerging and developed markets, and
target a range of returns from below market to market rate, depending upon the
circumstances.

Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd / Actelion to present at the 31st Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare
Conference - Delivering on our strategy . Processed and transmitted by Thomson Reuters ONE. The
issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. 


ALLSCHWIL/BASEL, SWITZERLAND - 07 January 2013- Actelion Ltd (SIX: ATLN) Actelion Ltd (SIX: ATLN)
announced today that Jean-Paul Clozel, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Actelion, will present at
the J. P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Tuesday, 08 January 2013 at 9.30 a.m. Pacific time /
18.30 hrs Swiss time at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, CA.

Dr. Clozel will describe the progress made during 2012 in delivering on the three elements of
Actelion's strategy for value creation.

1) Sustain and grow the PAH franchise

Dr. Clozel will present an overview of Actelion's current product offerings in the pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH) market. He will also describe the excellent morbidity / mortality
outcome data from the SERAPHIN study with macitentan (Opsumit(R)). This novel and differentiated
dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) was the result of a tailored drug discovery process in
Actelion's labs.

In addition, Dr. Clozel will describe the opportunity for the Company's selective IP receptor
agonist, selexipag - developed together with Nippon Shinyaku - which has now enrolled over 1,000
patients into GRIPHON, a pivotal study also designed to demonstrate a reduction in the risk of
morbidity/mortality events.

Dr. Clozel will present how Actelion's franchise today and in the future has the potential to
reshape the treatment paradigm in PAH.

2) Build an additional specialty franchise

Dr. Clozel will also present the positive results with the Company's innovative compounds,
ponesimod in psoriasis and cadazolid in Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. At the end of
2012, mid-stage clinical studies reported results that allowed Actelion to decide to pursue both
compounds in Phase III development. This provides Actelion with the foundation for its mid-term
goal of building an additional specialty franchise.

3) Optimize profitability

As the third element to Actelion's strategy, the company is committed to profit growth in the
coming years and to value creation for shareholders. Dr. Clozel will present the measures taken to
ensure the company can deliver on these commitments and the company's near and mid-term core
earnings guidance.

Jean-Paul Clozel, MD and Chief Executive Officer of Actelion commented: "At last year's J. P.
Morgan conference I told the audience that 2012 would be an important year for Actelion. I am very
pleased to take this opportunity to describe the excellent progress the company has made to
deliver on our strategy for value creation. In 2013, and the years to come, Actelion will realize
the value it has created from innovation in our labs."

The presentation is available in pdf-format on www.actelion.com http://www.actelion.com/ . To

Investor Relations section of Actelion's corporate website. An archived replay will be available

    CBM Asia-ExxonMobil Joint Venture Background

    On December 20, 2012 CBM Asia announced it signed a farm-in joint venture
agreement with ExxonMobil. The final terms and conditions of the proposed
farm-in remain subject to negotiation and execution of formal agreements
between ExxonMobil and CBM Asia as well as, among other conditions,
government approvals. Under the farm-in joint venture agreement the
Company will acquire a 35% to 37.5% participating interest in four
existing PSCs (Banjar I PSC, Banjar II PSC, Barito I PSC and Tapin PSC)
in the Barito Basin, South Kalimantan. The total gross area of the four
PSCs is approximately 4,258 km2 or 1.0 million acres. CBM Asia considers
the Barito Basin to be the largest and best undeveloped CBM exploration
opportunity in the world, with an industry gas-in-place estimate of 102
Tcf(1). Details of the farm-in joint venture include:


--  CBM Asia will provide assistance to drill and conduct two 5-well
    production pilots at its sole cost: one in the Banjar II PSC and the
    second in the Barito I PSC. CBM Asia and ExxonMobil will complete
    remaining exploratory drilling obligations under the applicable Firm
    Commitment work programs for the Banjar I, Banjar II and Barito I PSCs,
    sharing costs equally. CBM Asia will fulfill its farm-in commitment on
    completion of these pilots and exploratory drilling. CBM Asia estimates
    the total cost of the farm-in commitment to be USD15 million, with most
    expenditures expected to occur over a period of approximately 12 months
    starting in June 2013.

--  Depending on the results of the planned 5-well production pilots in the
    Banjar II and Barito I PSCs, CBM Asia will have the option to
    participate in completion of the Tapin PSC Firm Commitment work program,
    paying 50% of the Firm Commitment work program costs. 

--  The CBM Asia ExxonMobil farm-in joint venture also provides the
    potential opportunity for CBM Asia to participate alongside ExxonMobil
    in three existing PSCs and future PSCs tendered by the Government of
    Indonesia in the area of three completed Joint Studies in the Kutai
    Basin, East Kalimantan. The total gross area of the six PSCs/Joint
    Studies is approximately 8,859 km2 or 2.2 million acres. Subject to
    government approval and upon ExxonMobil acquiring its PI in one or more
    of such existing and future PSCs, ExxonMobil will farm out/assign 50% of
    its PI to CBM Asia. All exploration costs will be split evenly between
    CBM Asia and ExxonMobil. Subject to Government of Indonesia approval,
    CBM Asia will act as nominee operator.

petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known
accumulations prior to production. There are no assurances that any
portion of the estimated gas in place resources will be discovered.
Furthermore, the above estimates make no allowance for the recovery of
the gas which will depend on, among other things, the reservoir
characteristics encountered and future economic conditions.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7lf3f3/pfizers) has announced the
addition of the "Pfizer's tofacitinib - JAK inhibition -a new rheumatoid
arthritis therapy paradigm" report to their offering. 

Tofacitinib is an oral pan-JAK inhibitor with relative functional selectivity
for JAK3 (vs 1 or 2). Pfizer has completed a series of phase III trials
targeting use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A similar phase III program is
underway in psoriasis. Pfizer has reported results for all five pivotal ORAL
trials in RA as positive', although details are lacking for three. This report
explores those trials and their results (known and unknown) as they relate to
the probability of FDA approval for the various efficacy claims available for RA
therapies. 

For any first in class' agent, safety is somewhat of a wild card. Current
therapies (ie, the biologics) carry substantial risks related to the suppression
of immune function. Although this suggests that that FDA is willing to tolerate
these risks in the context of this debilitating disease, the question remains as
to how the agency will react to other safety signals that seem to be present in
the data. This report also explores those safety questions, along with the
market opportunity, should tofacitinib gain approval.

&lt;p&gt;http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20130107:nBw075351a

Isracard, with three million customers, shares benefits of Digital Banker for
Online and mobile channels
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Personetics, the leading provider of predictive virtual assistant solutions for
the banking industry, today shared customer user data from key deployments
including Isracard, a market-leading international issuer of Mastercard, Visa
and American Express cards. 

"&#8230;the new service which explains my purchases is amazing. I am impressed by
American Express and will continue to use their card for a long time." -
Isracard Customer

Personetics Digital Banker is an intelligent virtual assistant solution that
anticipates customers` financial needs and approaches them with relevant
solutions. Digital Banker`s interactive technology delivers a unique and
intuitive customer experience across all self-service channels while reducing
overall service costs for financial institutions. Digital Banker puts customers
in control and allows them to be more self-sufficient. For example, Digital
Banker will present a map with the merchant`s location to help a customer
remember a transaction before the customer files a costly dispute or the
solution will help a customer analyze his or her latest utility bill to see if
it differs from past bills. Digital Banker`s powerful predictive engine responds
to customers` needs and works to resolve their question or issue in the most
efficient manner possible. 

"We`re very excited to offer Personetics Digital Banker to our customers," says
Dov Kotler, CEO of Isracard. "It`s helping us deliver a better experience and
meet our business objectives. Our customers love it. It was easy to implement
and we are seeing a steady increase in customer usage." 

Isracard, the largest card issuer in Israel with more than three million
customers, wanted to increase up-sell conversion rates for new products and
services, reduce service costs, expand self-service channel adoption and
differentiate itself on quality of customer experience. Digital Banker was
embedded into Isracard`s existing Online and mobile applications, speeding
delivery and easing customer transition to more cost effective self-service
options. Customers began using the new, intuitive features immediately with no
instruction or training. The number of users continues to grow at a steady pace.


Key Results:

* Customers like the new predictive assistant technology, recording a high
satisfaction rate shortly after deployment 
* A large percentage of customers with issues resolve their problems without
live agent help, avoiding significant service costs 
* When offered at the ideal time - the moment of truth - nearly half of all
up-sell recommendations are accepted by customers for new products and services,
like electronic statements and automatic bill pay 
* Ten percent of active users access the system at least monthly

The system not only supports customer issues, but also helps them better
understand their spending, with more than half of the interactions dealing with
common personal and family financial topics. The types of topics explored by
customers is broadly distributed across all those offered, from spending trends
to single transaction details. Isracard plans to double the number of topics
customers can explore in the next couple months. 

"Rightfully, financial institutions have invested heavily in Online and mobile
banking as more and more customers move to these channels," says David Sosna,
CEO of Personetics. "Digital Banker provides the next generation of predictive
interactivity, improving the customer experience. We build off of the features
and services banks already offer, integrating easily into the look and feel of
existing apps and providing users a personalized and intuitive way to find what
they are looking for. We`re happy to be working with Isracard to offer Digital
Banker to their customers."

company in Israel. The Isracard Group unites four companies that operate a wide
scope of activities in credit payments under the same operating management
framework.

Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALGN) today announced the commercial
availability of the Invisalign Outcome Simulator, the Company's first
Invisalign chair-side application powered by the iTero and iOC scanners.
Previewed earlier this year, the interactive application provides
dentists and orthodontists an enhanced platform for patient education and

visualize the benefits possible with Invisalign treatment.

    "The Invisalign Outcome Simulator is an exciting new chair-side tool,

    As the only Invisalign chair-side intra-oral scanning application on the
market, the Invisalign Outcome Simulator's unique dual view layout shows
a prospective patient an image of his/her own current dentition next to

    About Align Technology, Inc.
 Align Technology designs, manufactures and
markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or
the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a
series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move
teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of
metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the
aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is
appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded
in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.
The Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen,
Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express 10, Invisalign Express 5,
Invisalign Lite, and Vivera Retainers. To learn more about Invisalign or
to find an Invisalign trained doctor in your area, please visit
www.invisalign.com.

    Cadent Holdings, Inc. is a subsidiary of Align Technology and is a
leading provider of 3D digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and
dentistry. The Cadent family of products includes the iTero and iOC
intra-oral scanning systems, OrthoCAD iCast and OrthoCAD iRecord. For

The Company

CytoDyn is a biotechnology company focused on the development of new therapies
for combating infection with immune deficiency viruses and other antibody
applications. Its proprietary drug candidate PRO 140 is a humanized monoclonal
antibody which has demonstrated the ability to block the entry of HIV virus into
human white blood cells by binding to a cell surface protein known as CCR5. PRO
140 has completed Phase I and Phase IIa human clinical trials. CytoDyn intends
to continue to develop PRO 140 as a therapeutic anti-viral agent in persons
infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ("HIV"). In addition, CytoDyn is
seeking partners for the development of another proprietary monoclonal antibody
for the treatment of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus ("FIV"), a retroviral
infection in cats. CytoDyn recently filed for a provisional patent for the use
of these anti-FIV antibodies as well as selected small molecule antagonists and
agonists for the treatment of FIV, and filed an application for registration of
the trademark CytoFeline, intended for use in conjunction with veterinary
preparations for the treatment of FIV. For more information please go to
www.cytodyn.com. 

Forward-Looking Statements

This press release includes forward-looking statements and forward-looking
information within the meaning of United States securities laws. These
statements and information represent CytoDyn`s intentions, plans, expectations
and beliefs, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, of which
many are beyond CytoDyn`s control. These factors could cause actual results to
differ materially from such forward-looking statements or information. The words
"believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "attempt," "anticipate," "foresee,"
"plan," and similar expressions and variations thereof, identify certain of such
forward-looking statements or forward-looking information, which speak only as
of the date on which they are made. CytoDyn disclaims any intention or
obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or
forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Readers are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements or
forward-looking information. 

While it is impossible to identify or predict all such matters, these
differences may result from, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of the
timing and success of, and expense associated with, research, development,
regulatory approval and commercialization of our products and product
candidates, including the risks that clinical trials will not commence or
proceed as planned; products appearing promising in early trials will not
demonstrate efficacy or safety in larger-scale trials; future clinical trial
data on our products and product candidates will be unfavorable; our products
will not receive marketing approval from regulators or, if approved, fail to
gain sufficient market acceptance to justify development and commercialization
costs; competing products currently on the market or in development may reduce
the commercial potential of our products; CytoDyn, our collaborators or others
may identify side effects after the product is on the market; or efficacy or
safety concerns regarding marketed products, whether or not scientifically
justified, may lead to product recalls, withdrawals of marketing approval,
reformulation of the product, additional pre-clinical testing or clinical
trials, changes in labeling of the product, the need for additional marketing
applications, or other adverse events. 

We are also subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including risks
associated with the actions of our corporate, academic and other collaborators
and government regulatory agencies; risks from market forces and trends;
potential product liability; intellectual property, litigation, environmental
and other risks; and risks that current and pending patent protection for our
products may be invalid, unenforceable or challenged, or fail to provide
adequate market exclusivity. There are also substantial risks arising out of our
need to raise additional capital to develop our products and satisfy our
financial obligations; the highly regulated nature of our business, including
government cost-containment initiatives and restrictions on third-party payments
for our products; the highly competitive nature of our industry; and other
factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

ARDSLEY, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACOR) today announced that AMPYRA&#174;
(dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg unaudited net sales for the
fourth quarter of 2012 were $73 million and unaudited AMPYRA 2012 full-year net
sales were $266 million. These results are subject to completion of the
Company`s year-end audit. 

The Company provided 2013 guidance for AMPYRA net sales revenue of $285-$315
million. Guidance for Zanaflex&#174; (tizanidine hydrochloride) and ex-U.S. FAMPYRA
revenue is $25 million, which includes sales of branded Zanaflex products,
royalties from ex-U.S. FAMPYRA and authorized generic tizanidine hydrochloride
capsules sales, and $9.1 million in amortized licensing revenue from the $110
million payment the Company received from Biogen Idec in 2009 for FAMPYRA
ex-U.S. development and commercialization rights. 

Guidance for 2013 sales, general and administrative (SG) expense is $170-$180
million and 2013 research and development (R) expense is $60-$70 million. The
increase in SG and R expenses in 2013 over 2012 is primarily related to
research and commercialization expenses for the recently acquired product
Diazepam Nasal Spray. 

Based on this guidance, the Company expects to be cash flow positive in 2013. 

President and CEO Ron Cohen, M.D. will provide a corporate overview, including
the Company`s recent acquisition of Diazepam Nasal Spray, at the 31st Annual
J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference today at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time in San
Francisco. The presentation is available via webcast at www.acorda.com. 

"AMPYRA has made a significant contribution to the treatment of people with MS,
with more than 73,000 people having tried the drug since its launch in 2010. Our
marketing programs won numerous industry-wide awards and helped AMPYRA to grow
in 2012. We expect continued growth in 2013. We also initiated proof-of-concept
clinical studies of AMPYRA in 2012 in two additional disease states, post-stroke
deficits and cerebral palsy. We expect to have results for both studies in the
second quarter of this year." 

Dr. Cohen continued, "In December, we acquired rights to Diazepam Nasal Spray,
which adds an important, potential near-term commercial asset to our pipeline.
We are currently preparing a New Drug Application that we expect to submit to
the FDA later this year. In addition, we expect to have three compounds in Phase
1 or Phase 2 clinical trials in the first half of 2013 that target significant
unmet needs in the areas of heart failure, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord
injury. We are also continuing to focus on potential in-licensing opportunities,
primarily for approved or near-commercial medicines that can leverage our
exceptional specialty commercial organization and other areas of company
expertise."

J.P. Morgan introduces its multi-asset trading platform designed for a
post-regulatory trading environment 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan today announces the roll-out of J.P. Morgan Markets, the firm`s new
multi-asset class trading platform, bringing pre-trade, trade and post-trade
functionality onto a single platform for the first time. Debuting with a first
wave of trading solutions, it is a complete redesign and consolidation of the
firm`s existing e-trading offerings from front to back, and will present a
seamless client experience throughout the entire trade lifecycle. 

"We have created J.P. Morgan Markets to give clients an intuitive user
experience, and a convenient and efficient way to trade across different asset
classes, all in one place," said Troy Rohrbaugh, global head of FX &amp; Rates
Trading. "By having a high degree of automation at every stage of a trade,
clients will be able to focus on trading ideas rather than the increasing
complexity of a post-regulatory world in trade execution, post-trade clearing,
settlement and reporting." 

With a single log-in, J.P. Morgan Markets will offer clients one of the largest
sets of products and services in the market, including the firm`s award-winning
research, powerful analytics and structuring tools, multi-product trading and
extensive post-trade capabilities. Over time, it will give access to liquidity
across asset classes, market-leading algorithmic tools, and connectivity to
countless trading venues, as needed by clients or mandated by future
regulations. 

"Developing J.P. Morgan Markets has been a huge undertaking and, by the end of
this year, we will have consolidated more than 30 platforms into one client
offering," said Peter Cherasia, global head of Markets Strategies. "It will
enable us to quickly deliver innovative new products as we adapt to changing
market conditions, and clients will find it a faster, more effective and
transparent place to trade." 

Today marks the first phase in a roll-out of products and services, with most
existing clients and products fully on-board by the end of 2013. Functionality
available to clients today includes: pre-trade research and analytics, FX,
Rates, Commodities trade execution and a number of post-trade services. Other
pre- to post-trade functionality will be added throughout the rest of the year,
or as market structure changes and new regulations are implemented. 

The platform underlines J.P. Morgan`s continual investment in electronic
trading, and also in technology more generally, which typically has a budget of
several billion U.S. dollars each year. J.P. Morgan is Risk magazine`s
Derivatives House of the Year (2012), and has the #1 ranked Equity Research team
in the U.S., and the #1 ranked Fixed Income Research team in the U.S. and
Europe, according to Institutional Investor.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) will disclose the values of its money-market mutual funds on a daily basis rather than monthly to satisfy investor call for greater transparency, according to people familiar with the company's plans, the Wall Street Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes, some of which will take effect as early as Wednesday, is a major shift in an industry that has for years battled regulators over plans to tighten rules governing price disclosures, the types of assets funds can hold and the ways funds can return money to investors in the event of a crisis, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank will disclose the previous day's net asset value of its three U.S. commercial paper funds on Wednesday followed by its six U.S. government and tax-exempt funds next week, the Journal quoted the people as saying. The daily price of its six offshore funds will be available by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment outside regular business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fund companies are required to report their net asset values only on a monthly basis. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission discloses the information publicly 60 days after it receives it from fund firms. (link.reuters.com/mad25t)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's move to publish daily values could force other firms to follow suit in the $2.7 trillion industry, according to experts, said the Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Avik Das in Bangalore; Editing by Matt Driskill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are among a group of banks expected to agree as soon as this week to a $1.5 billion settlement with federal regulators over botched foreclosure claims, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accord would come on the heels of a separate $8.5 billion settlement announced on Monday with 10 bigger mortgage servicers, including America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan Case &amp; Co (JPM.N), Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Inc (HSBA.L), Ally Financial Inc GKM.N, EverBank Financial Corp (EVER.N) and OneWest Bank FSB have also said they are in settlement discussions with the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear how many of these banks are part of the $1.5 billion settlement that includes Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other relatively small mortgage servicers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two sources did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve reiterated a previous statement that the Fed and the OCC continue to work with other parties outside of Monday's accord to reach similar agreements. Representatives of the OCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Morgan Stanley's respective roles in the settlement stems from mortgage-servicing businesses that the two investment banks purchased in the run-up to the subprime mortgage crisis, and have since sold. Goldman had owned Litton Loan Servicing LP and Morgan Stanley owned Saxon Capital Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve had ordered the two firms to conduct case-by-case reviews of foreclosures after widespread mistakes were discovered across the industry in the way U.S. banks had processed home seizures. The settlement would end those reviews and result in at least $1.5 billion in cash and assistance for borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The story corrects to show Goldman, Morgan Stanley are part of a group that may agree to settlement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York and Aruna Viswanatha in Washington; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - James "Jes" Staley is leaving his job as chairman of the investment banking unit of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to join a hedge fund that profited from the bank's $6.2 billion "London Whale" loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 56-year-old Staley, who was moved aside in July from his position as chief executive for investment banking at JPMorgan, is becoming a partner at BlueMountain Capital Management, the hedge fund company said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BlueMountain was among a group of hedge funds that profited by betting against JPMorgan in credit derivatives transactions known as the "London Whale" trades, which cost the bank billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, BlueMountain worked for JPMorgan to help the bank close the positions, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund manages more than $12 billion and was founded by JPMorgan alums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley, a 34-year veteran of JPMorgan, was sidelined in a management reshuffle in July that foreshadowed his departure. He had long been seen as a possible successor to JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, but both men are the same age, and Dimon seems to be focusing on promoting younger executives now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At BlueMountain, Staley will focus on cultivating relationships with clients and developing new strategies, the firm said, echoing the kind of talk about financial innovation that used to be routine at investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many bankers complain that regulations are making it harder to innovate.

He was a founding member of its equities business in the early 1980s.

The bank has to get ready for that. The transition that Jamie and I have been able to execute from JPMorgan to a firm like BlueMountain, I feel very proud of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley said he expects changes in the financial system will shift more trading, particularly of credit instruments, from banks to firms like BlueMountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley will become BlueMountain's ninth managing partner. He declined twice on CNBC to discuss the trade other than to make the point that JPMorgan had trusted BlueMountain enough to use it to resolve the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Whale trades were made through JPMorgan's chief investment office in London, which was a separate business unit from the investment bank. One of the key engineers of the trade was Bruno Iksil, who took big enough positions to earn the nickname "the London Whale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, CEO Dimon complained about the way some JPMorgan employees dealt with the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have some people who acted terribly and we had some leaders who acted like children. It was unbelievable," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Feldstein, the CEO of BlueMountain, worked for JPMorgan for more than a decade before starting the hedge fund in 2003. His jobs at JPMorgan included heading structured credit and the global credit portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, in a memo to senior managers after the announcement of Staley's departure, said, "BlueMountain is an important client of ours, and we look forward to working with Jes in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, John Wallace, Kenneth Barry, Andrew Hay and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Ryan takes over many of Barry Zubrow's duties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Ryan has been regulator of US thrifts in Treasury
Department&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ken Bentsen takes Ryan's role at securities trade group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co,
whose influence with lawmakers and regulators was damaged by its
$6.2 billion derivatives loss last year, has hired Tim Ryan, the
head of Wall Street's biggest trade group, as global head of
regulatory strategy and policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan, who helped manage the U.S. savings and loan crisis in
the 1980s and was director of the Office of Thrift Supervision,
has been chief executive of the Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association since 2008. He previously worked
at JP Morgan for 19 years, rising to vice chairman of investment
banking for financial institutions and government agencies
before joining SIFMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He rejoins the biggest U.S. bank when new capital
requirements, laws and regulations aimed at restricting risk are
constraining many of the most profitable trading and lending
activities at large banks. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon
had been a loud voice in Washington seeking to moderate many of
the restrictions, until disclosure of the "London Whale" loss
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan, who is 67, will absorb many of the functions of Barry
Zubrow, who has run corporate and regulatory affairs at JPMorgan
since last January. Zubrow, who retired at the end of 2012, had
been in charge of risk management when the bank's chief
investment office in London was building the "London Whale"  
credit derivatives position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ryan's new role, he will oversee executives who manage
regulatory policy, as well as those who manage the bank's client
relationships with the Federal National Mortgage Association
 and other government-sponsored enterprises and
government agencies, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters, who is head of commodities and was assigned
by Dimon late last year to coordinate regulatory affairs for the
commercial and investment banking divisions as well, will
continue in both roles, the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At SIFMA, Ryan earned $3 million in total compensation and
benefits in the fiscal year ending October 2011, the most recent
year for which the trade group made filings with the Internal
Revenue Service. The JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on
his new compensation package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ken Bentsen, SIFMA's executive vice president for public
policy and advocacy, will serve as interim CEO after Ryan leaves
in mid-February and is a leading candidate to replace him
permanently, a spokesman at the trade group said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - James "Jes" Staley is leaving his job as chairman of the investment banking unit of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to join a hedge fund that profited from the bank's $6.2 billion derivatives loss at the hands of the "London Whale" trader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 56-year-old Staley, who was moved aside in July from his position as chief executive for investment banking at JPMorgan, is becoming a partner at BlueMountain Capital Management, the hedge fund company said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BlueMountain was among a group of hedge funds that profited by betting against JPMorgan in credit derivatives transactions known as "the London Whale" trades, which ended up costing the bank billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, BlueMountain worked for JPMorgan to help the bank close the positions, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund manages more than $12 billion, and was founded by JPMorgan alums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley, a 34-year veteran of JPMorgan, was sidelined in a management reshuffle in July that foreshadowed his departure. He had long been seen as a possible successor to JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, but both men are the same age, and Dimon seems to be focusing on promoting younger executives now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At BlueMountain, Staley will focus on cultivating relationships with clients and developing new strategies, the firm said, echoing the kind of talk about financial innovation that used to be routine at investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many bankers complain that regulations are making it harder to innovate. The new rules were put in place after a financial crisis that was fueled in large part by abuses of innovations like securitization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley will buy a stake in BlueMountain, and the money will be used on new technology and staff, the firm said. The amount of his investment was not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley spent nearly 22 of his 34 JPMorgan years at its investment bank. He was a founding member of its equities business in the early 1980s. He later worked as CEO of its asset management unit, which includes its private bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dimon reorganized business units, he named two younger executives to be co-CEOs of commercial and investment banking and made Staley chairman of the unit and head of a committee to consider the future of global banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley, appearing on CNBC on Tuesday, said of no longer being in contention for Dimon's job, "There is a generational issue. The bank has to get ready for that. The transition that Jamie and I have been able to execute from JPMorgan to a firm like BlueMountain, I feel very proud of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley said he expects changes in the financial system will shift more trading, particularly of credit instruments, from banks to firms like BlueMountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley will become BlueMountain's ninth managing partner. He declined twice on CNBC to discuss the trade other than to make the point that JPMorgan had trusted BlueMountain enough to use it to resolve the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Whale trades were made through JPMorgan's chief investment office in London, which was a separate business unit from the investment bank. One of the key engineers of the trade was Bruno Iksil, who took big enough positions to earn the nickname "the London Whale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Feldstein, the CEO of BlueMountain, worked for JPMorgan for more than a decade before starting the hedge fund in 2003. His jobs at JPMorgan included heading structured credit and the global credit portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, in a memo to senior managers after the announcement of Staley's departure, said, "BlueMountain is an important client of ours, and we look forward to working with Jes in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, John Wallace, Kenneth Barry and Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase and Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today that Tim Ryan would re-join
the firm as Global Head of Regulatory Strategy and Policy. Ryan served as CEO of
the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) since 2009. He
will report to Matt Zames, co-Chief Operating Officer for JPMorgan Chase. 

"We are extremely pleased that Tim will be returning to JPMorgan Chase," said
Mr. Zames. "More than at any time in our history, regulatory strategy and
policies around the world are affecting our business and how we serve clients.
Tim has both a deep knowledge of these policies and the government
representatives formulating them, and also knows our businesses and executives
extremely well from his 16 years at the firm. Beyond that, he has outstanding
leadership qualities and integrity. We`re fortunate to have him back on our
senior team." 

"I`m looking forward to coming back to J.P. Morgan," said Mr. Ryan. "I`ve had a
great experience at SIFMA and am fortunate to have worked with as many terrific
people as I did. As Dodd Frank, Basel, EU, FSB and housing policies continue to
evolve, I believe my experience can help the businesses across JPMorgan Chase
continue to adapt and thrive." 

Before joining SIFMA in 2008, Ryan was Vice Chairman of Investment Banking for
Financial Institutions and Governments at J.P. Morgan. Prior to joining JPMorgan
in 1993, Mr. Ryan was the director of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in
the U.S. Department of the Treasury. As OTS director, he was the banking and
securities regulator for the nation's approximately 2,000 thrifts. He was also a
principal manager of the savings and loan cleanup, which involved closing
approximately 700 insolvent institutions, improving capital bases and selling
over $300 billion of assets. 

From 1983 to 1990, Ryan was a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of the law
firm Reed, Smith, Shaw &amp; McClay, where he headed the Pension Investment Group
and was a member of the firm`s Executive Committee. From 1981 to 1983, he was
Solicitor of Labor at the U.S. Department of Labor.

&lt;p&gt;By Lauren Tara LaCapra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s an interesting article out today from Bloomberg, which accuses Goldman Sachs of skirting the yet-to-be-defined-or-implemented Volcker rule, and accuses its top executives, including CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, of being a hypocrite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg reporter Max&#160;Abelson&#160;has done some good work on the subject. His article is well written and well sourced&#8212;he spoke to at least 20 people and got many of them to go on the record about their former employer and describe how Goldman continues to place bets with the firm&#8217;s own money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abelson concludes &#8220;Goldman Sachs has worked around regulations curbing proprietary bets at banks. &#8220; But what the article really points out is that Wall Street will keep finding new ways to move the goal posts in its favor when it comes to defining and clamping down on prop trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who aren&#8217;t well-versed in Volckerdom, all you really need to know is that it&#8217;s named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and it&#8217;s intended to prevent Wall Street firms from making the kind of big bets that could ultimately put taxpayers on the hook. But critics complain the rule, as currently envisioned, has been so watered down that it allows a lot of interpretation for what constitutes prop trading, and gives banks a lot of latitude to keep doing what they have always been doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks, for instance, will still be able to act as market makers, buying and selling securities on behalf of clients, and they may still be able to make long-term investments. All of this gives rise to questions of whether it&#8217;s still OK for banks to make a strategic investment in another company and for how long? And how do you know if a hedge trade is really a hedge?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the Volcker rule does not, of course, prevent lending &#8211; which appears to be the regulatory exception the Goldman group Abelson writes about is making the most of. Indeed, in a bizarre twist of logic, some Goldman sources have been arguing that lending is the same thing as buying up distressed debt and bankruptcy claims in the secondary market, and working aggressively to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Reuters in May 2011, Volcker himself said he did not think that was the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s comparable to a loan,&#8221; he said in comments that were not published at the time. &#8220;If you buy an asset to trade it, that&#8217;s not a loan.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you want to be a bank, follow the bank rules,&#8221; he added. &#8220;If Goldman Sachs and the others want to do proprietary trading, then they shouldnt be banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volcker&#8217;s position, shared by others, is that banks should be following the spirit of the law, rather than the letter. (He famously compared prop trading to Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart&#8217;s assertion about pornography: &#8220;I know it when I see it.&#8221;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if it looks like a prop trade, walks like a prop trade and quacks like a prop trade, then it&#8217;s a prop trade, and banks shouldn&#8217;t be doing it, and regulators should be able to spot it easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory that makes sense, but in practice it&#8217;s not clear what will happen. Regulators &#8211; who often complain of being understaffed and underfunded and overwhelmed by the amount of rulemaking work they&#8217;ve had to do &#8211; have extended the deadline for a final Volcker rule by months because of all the pushback from banks and an ongoing, vigorous debate about the costs and benefits of the rule. (The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, received 241 detailed unique comment letters and 14,479 form letters of support for the regulation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Goldman revamped its reporting lines and isolated its lending and investing activities into one division, in which its Special Situations Group is housed. It&#8217;s possible that regulators will pass a rule that explicitly bans the kind of activity that goes on in that group, which invests the bank&#8217;s own money in troubled debt, bankruptcy notes and sometimes equity, without doing anything for clients. But it&#8217;s also possible that regulators writing the rule &#8211; which include the SEC, The Federal Reserve, The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission &#8211; might make the language vague enough to allow banks some wiggle room when it comes to the way they use their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the final rule isn&#8217;t out yet, and Volcker won&#8217;t be implemented until 2014. It&#8217;s a little strange to say Goldman is breaking a rule that doesn&#8217;t exist yet, although calling executives hypocrites is less of a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman executives including Blankfein and outgoing CFO David Viniar have said publicly that the bank does not have any prop trading businesses any longer, because it shut down its principal strategies and global macro trading desks, which also made bets with Goldman&#8217;s capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We shut off that activity,&#8221; Blankfein said at an event in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s been shut down,&#8221; Viniar said in February 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Bloomberg&#8217;s story does is raise an important question for shareholders, regulators and taxpayers that won&#8217;t be answered for at least a few months: Has it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney toys are sold around the world. Now, children can find them in the cloud as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media giant is teaming up with toy company JAKKS Pacific and Patrick Soon-Shiong, Los Angeles' wealthiest person, on a new line of toys - with a nifty technological twist designed to link the goodies that kids lug home from the store with Disney's stable of well-known animated characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"DreamPlay", developed by Soon-Shiong's NantWorks company, and JAKKS works via an app that can be downloaded on Apple Inc devices like the iPad, or smartphones and tablets running Google Inc Android software. When a device's camera is trained on any toy specifically designed to work with DreamPlay, it triggers one of thousands of preset animations that appear on the device's screen and seem to be unfolding in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With viewers' eyes locked on the tablet or smartphone screen, fairies appear to glide in and out of buildings, animated critters start playing musical instruments, mythical characters prance on a toy piano's keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which licensed its characters to DreamPlay, and its partners hope that children will take to the new approach, which is intended to extend and expand the life of the toy. But it remains to be seen if the concept will prove to be more than a novelty, and be able to arrest a child's infamously short attention span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three will demo their concept on Tuesday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, but Reuters got a sneak peak at the technology on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a showroom in the 20th floor of a Santa Monica, Calif. building, visitors to JAKKS' demonstration are treated to an animated version of Sebastian - the red Jamaican crab from Disney's "Little Mermaid" movie - who pops up onscreen on an iPad seconds after the tablet's camera is trained on a real-life set of toy bongo drums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animated crab pounces on the drums and proceeds to bang out a calypso song onscreen, with both Sebastian and the physical drum set appearing together as if the two shared the same cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REAL, VIRTUAL INTERACTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DreamPlay allows not just Sebastian, but also Tinker Bell and a host of other well-loved Disney characters to "interact" virtually with specially made toys via image-recognition software. The software was developed by Soon-Shiong, a former cancer surgeon who created drugs to fight diabetes and breast cancer and then sold the companies that produced them for $8.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon-Shiong teamed with JAKKS, a $678 million-a-year toy maker and licensee of toys based on the Princess line of dolls, Marvel action figures and other Disney toys, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology works via the "cloud" - images and video clips stored on remote servers that are streamed to kids' mobiles when the app recognizes a particular item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a tremendous way to combine great technology and Disney's magical story telling to extend the time a child can play with a toy," said Bob Chapek, president of Disney's consumer products unit. "Kids find out that playing with their toy doesn't end when they get it home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since taking over in 2011, Chapek has repositioned Disney's consumer product unit to expand its use of technology with its toys. DreamPlay is the first of what Chapek says are other products that will twin technology with familiar Disney toys, although he won't name them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down the road, Disney may explore new business models, including selling subscriptions to content created specifically to be used with a particular toy, said Chapek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is hardly certain for a product that requires a child to hold up a phone or tablet, and peer through it to play with a toy that's stationary. Will children want to see Rapunzel endlessly dancing on the keys of a piano or Rosetta, a fairy from Disney's "Tinker Bell" movies, fly in and out of a cottage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The technology may be great, but no one has proven to me yet that a kid will sit in front of an iPhone or iPad instead of playing with a toy that's right in front of him," said Sean McGowan, a toy analyst with Needham &amp; Co who downgraded JAKKS to hold in September along with other toy companies, and then downgraded JAKKS to underperform in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAKKS intends to begin selling DreamPlay versions of toys from the Disney Princess line in October. It will then expand its offerings next year, with international sales starting in 2014, said Stephen Berman, JAKKS President and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DreamPlay toys will be "a couple of dollars" costlier than the regular version, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Target stores and Toys R Us are among the U.S. retailers who will carry the DreamPlay line, Berman says. Top-Toy, the giant Nordic retailer, has also signed on, while Beijing Hualian Group, which operates supermarkets and department stores across China, is coming onboard as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kids don't own iPhones or iPads but they all know how to use them," says Berman. "Kids have so much more imagination than we do. Imagine recording a bunch of the videos and giving the kid an iPad to play with them on a trip to see the grandparents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAKKS will ramp up marketing for the DreamPlay line, said Berman. DreamPlay toys will be prominently displayed at all the partner-retailers, he added, and shoppers will be encouraged to use their smartphones to view them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those that aim smartphones at a boxed Tinker Bell, for instance, may get a start as the fairy from "Peter Pan" literally soars out of the box, leaving an empty package behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Technology can help people live better, work better, play better," said Soon-Shiong as he showed off the line of toys. "This is the way they will play better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Ronald Grover; Edited By Edwin Chan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When JP Morgans London Whale blew up, one part of the collateral damage was the publication of a detailed Volcker Rule. The Whale was gambling JP Morgans money, and wasnt doing so on behalf of clients  yet somehow his actions were Volcker-compliant. And when the blow-up revealed the absurdity of that particular loophole, the rule went back to the SEC for further refinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we still dont know exactly what will and what wont be allowed under Volcker, if and when it ever comes into force. We do know, however, that Citigroup is selling off its internal hedge fund, Citi Capital Advisors. If by selling off you mean giving away: its spinning the fund out as an independent entity, to be owned 75% by its current employees. Citi will retain a Volcker-compliant 25% stake, and slowly reduce the $2.5 billion of its own money it has invested in the entity so that the managers can diversify the client base away from Citi and to build a stand-alone firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its incredibly difficult to value a hedge fund, especially a relatively small one without a long track record. The high-water point for such transactions was probably Citis acquisition of Vikram Pandits fund, Old Lane, in 2007. Old Lane managed $4.5 billion, and was sold for $800 million, but even then the markets appreciated that the buy was more of an acqui-hire of Pandit than a fair price for a young and volatile business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years later, Citi was on the ropes and selling rather than buying; thats when it unloaded its fund-of-funds, Citi Alternative Investments, to Skybridge Capital. Skybridge paid almost nothing up-front for the business, but agreed to remit a large chunk of the groups management fees back to Citi for the first three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg managed to find one consultant who valued Citi Capital Advisors, which manages about $3.4 billion, at $100 million. I, for one, wouldnt buy in at that valuation: less than $1 billion of the assets under management constitute real money, as opposed to simply being a place where Citi parks a small chunk of its balance sheet. And as the Citi funds diminish, the chances of Citi Capital Advisors becoming a profitable standalone entity have to be pretty slim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to Multi-Strategy Investing, a small group of a dozen people within Goldman Sachs, who between them manage about $1 billion. As Max Abelson shows, MSI is unabashedly an internal hedge fund, concentrating on medium-term trades lasting a few months. (The idea is that if positions are held for longer than 60 days, that makes them Volcker-compliant.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abelson finds a lot of illustrious alumni of the MSI group; maybe the bank is keeping it on just for nostalgias sake. Because I cant for the life of me see the point of it. Goldman Sachs has a trillion-dollar balance sheet; the $1 billion it has invested in MSI is basically a rounding error. And by the time youve shelled out annual bonuses to a dozen high-flying Goldman Sachs professionals, the contribution of MSI to Goldmans annual profits has to be downright minuscule. (Lets say the group generates alpha of 5%, or $50 million per year: that doesnt go very far, split 12 ways at Goldman Sachs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, with a mere $1 billion under management, MSI doesnt present Goldman with much in the way of tail risk. But by the same token, this really doesnt seem like a particularly attractive business for Goldman to be in. As Abelson says, Goldmans own CEO is adamant that the bank doesnt make money trading for its own account: everything it does has to be for clients. Under that principle, MSI shouldnt exist. And the profits from the group simply cant be big enough to make it worth the regulatory and reputational bother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman should take a leaf out of Citis book, here, and spin MSI off as a standalone operation, if necessary retaining a 25% stake. If its principals can make a go of it, attracting real money from outside investors, great. If they cant, no harm done. Alternatively, Goldman could just shut down MSI entirely, and put its valuable employees to work helping the banks clients, and making money that way. Either way, there doesnt seem to be any point to keeping this small fund going as is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS, NV, Jan 08 (Marketwire) -- 
CES - IBM (NYSE: IBM), STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM) and Shaspa today
announced a collaboration to tap cloud and mobile computing for
manufacturers and service providers to provide innovative ways for
consumers to manage and interact with their homes' functions and
entertainment systems using multiple user interfaces such as voice
recognition and physical gestures for a smarter home.

    A "smart home" brings networking functions together, creating a gateway
that connects a television, computer or mobile device with smart meters,
lights, appliances, plugs and sensors within the home as well as services
from outside. Parks Associates forecasts that more than 8 billion devices
will be connected on the home network by year-end 2015.[1]

    In Las Vegas this week during the world's largest consumer electronics
exhibition, the three companies will demonstrate a TV linked to ST's Home
Gateway, running software from business partner Shaspa, and connected to
the IBM cloud. Through sensors, the system can monitor home parameters
such as temperature, carbon dioxide[2] level through a wireless or
batteryless IPv6 network, or human motion within the home. The data can
be communicated to a smartphone or tablet via a wireless router. In this
way, the homeowner can offload much of the home management to the cloud
and interact with the system using event and time-based preset scenarios. 

    The companies anticipate that this initiative could allow consumers to
use any device capable of running apps to manage a variety of personal
activities such as viewing their home's energy consumption; controlling
security, heating and lighting systems; activating home appliances such
as washing machines; monitoring health and assisted living conditions; or
engaging in e-commerce. For example, a person with limited mobility could
gesture to the TV to unlock the front door, turn up the heat or check
vital signs. This project represents the future of electronics technology
as sensing devices and equipment seamlessly respond to user needs and
requests, emulating the way humans sense their environment. 

    "Thanks to emerging cloud services we are entering a new era in which the
role of the personal cloud is expanding into daily life and the smart
home to improve energy efficiency, health and wellness and home
entertainment," said Bruce Anderson, General Manager Global Electronics
Industry, IBM. "This collaboration is a great example of how cloud
computing can be used for business and industry innovation versus solely
for IT efficiency purposes. In the future, cloud-enabled electronics will
sense what people want, evolving from seeing-to-noticing-to-remembering
personal needs and histories."

    In this project, ST's Home Gateway and Shaspa's embedded software acts as
a bridge between the home and cloud services provided by the IBM
SmartCloud Service Delivery Platform, which gives electronics
manufacturers a cloud platform to manage smart devices and rapidly
introduce new consumer services. The gateway, based on a STiH416,
provides the physical connectivity, provisioning and management
middleware, application protocols, and interfaces for connecting and
controlling the "Internet of Things." The connected-home System-on-Chip
runs software including Linux and a service management system compliant
with the OSGi industry standard. 

    The infrastructure for the gateway-cloud service operation is provided by
Shaspa's GUI and application software. IBM Worklight in combination with
the Mobile Interface of the Shaspa embedded software is the mobile
application platform that enables end users to control and manage their
homes from their personal devices. The mobile platform is used to build
the application, connect the app to all the sensors within the home, and
manage all events that take place. IBM software such as MQ Series and
Worklight helps transmit the data to mobile devices. Data captured in the
cloud supports the discovery of new insights through advanced analytics. 

    "Smarter buildings are an essential part of the journey towards a
sustainable world, and this building-to-cloud system shows that connected
living is becoming possible today," said Oliver Goh, Founder &amp; CEO of
Shaspa. "This secure, scalable offering with be the enabler for
ecosystems, enabling the fast creation and deployment of value-add
services."

    The idea of an intelligent home that uses technology to enhance the lives
of its occupants is far from new; in fact, it was a major theme in the
1933 Chicago World's Fair. We are now in a position to realize the
intelligent-home dream with systems that feature scalability,
interoperability and security built-in from the start. This requires
collaborations among leading players across the ecosystem.

    "The smart home is a key part of the smarter world we need to address
important global challenges, including energy saving and more affordable
and accessible healthcare, and many different technologies and skills
must be brought together to accelerate its development," said Alessandro
Cremonesi, Group Vice President and General Manager of Advanced Systems
Technology, STMicroelectronics. "This demonstration confirms that ST's
solutions, from sensors, low-power microcontrollers and communications
devices to home gateways, combined with our unrivalled track record in
successful partnering, can contribute significantly to making smart homes
a reality."

    The demo will be shown at two venues near the Las Vegas Convention
Center: A private, invitation-only suite at The Encore Hotel (ST) and The
Venetian, exhibit meeting room 2405 (IBM).

[2] While carbon dioxide isn't generally dangerous, monitoring CO2 levels
is useful so that environmental systems can adjust ventilation to suit
the number of occupants in a room. Knowing how many people are in a room
can save energy; fewer occupants produce lower levels of CO2 and
therefore ventilation levels can be set lower.

Cloud computing enhances control of "Internet of Things" in the home to help manage heating,
lighting, security and more via multiple user interfaces including gestures and voice recognition

 

LAS VEGAS, CES -- January 8, 2013 -- IBM (NYSE:IBM), STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) and Shaspa
today announced a collaboration to tap cloud and mobile computing for manufacturers and service
providers to provide innovative ways for consumers to manage and interact with their homes'
functions and entertainment systems using multiple user interfaces such as voice recognition and
physical gestures for a smarter home.

A "smart home" brings networking functions together, creating a gateway that connects a
television, computer or mobile device with smart meters, lights, appliances, plugs and sensors
within the home as well as services from outside. Parks Associates forecasts that more than 8
billion devices will be connected on the home network by year-end 2015.[1] #_ftn1 

In Las Vegas this week during the world's largest consumer electronics exhibition, the three
companies will demonstrate a TV linked to ST's Home Gateway, running software from business
partner Shaspa, and connected to the IBM cloud. Through sensors, the system can monitor home
parameters such as temperature, carbon dioxide[2] #_ftn2  level through a wireless or batteryless
IPv6 network, or human motion within the home. The data can be communicated to a smartphone or
tablet via a wireless router. In this way, the homeowner can offload much of the home management
to the cloud and interact with the system using event and time-based preset scenarios. 

The companies anticipate that this initiative could allow consumers to use any device capable of
running apps to manage a variety of personal activities such as viewing their home's energy
consumption; controlling security, heating and lighting systems; activating home appliances such
as washing machines; monitoring health and assisted living conditions; or engaging in e-commerce. 
For example, a person with limited mobility could gesture to the TV to unlock the front door, turn
up the heat or check vital signs. This project represents the future of electronics technology as
sensing devices and equipment seamlessly respond to user needs and requests, emulating the way
humans sense their environment. 

"Thanks to emerging cloud services we are entering a new era in which the role of the personal
cloud is expanding into daily life and the smart home to improve energy efficiency, health and
wellness and home entertainment," said Bruce Anderson, General Manager Global Electronics
Industry, IBM. "This collaboration is a great example of how cloud computing can be used for
business and industry innovation versus solely for IT efficiency purposes. In the future,
cloud-enabled electronics will sense what people want, evolving from
seeing-to-noticing-to-remembering personal needs and histories."

In this project, ST's Home Gateway and Shaspa's embedded software acts as a bridge between the
home and cloud services provided by the IBM SmartCloud Service Delivery Platform
http://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/en/mbs03030usen/MBS03030USEN.PDF , which gives
electronics manufacturers a cloud platform to manage smart devices and rapidly introduce new
consumer services. The gateway, based on a STiH416
http://www.st.com/internet/imag_video/product/253155.jsp , provides the physical connectivity,
provisioning and management middleware, application protocols, and interfaces for connecting and
controlling the "Internet of Things." The connected-home System-on-Chip runs software including
Linux and a service management system compliant with the OSGi industry standard.  

The infrastructure for the gateway-cloud service operation is provided by Shaspa's GUI and
application software. IBM Worklight in combination with the Mobile Interface of the Shaspa
embedded software is the mobile application platform that enables end users to control and manage
their homes from their personal devices. The mobile platform is used to build the application,
connect the app to all the sensors within the home, and manage all events that take place. IBM
software such as MQ Series and Worklight helps transmit the data to mobile devices. Data captured
in the cloud supports the discovery of new insights through advanced analytics. 

"Smarter buildings are an essential part of the journey towards a sustainable world, and this
building-to-cloud system shows that connected living is becoming possible today," said Oliver Goh,
Founder &amp; CEO of Shaspa. "This secure, scalable offering with be the enabler for ecosystems,
enabling the fast creation and deployment of value-add services."

The idea of an intelligent home that uses technology to enhance the lives of its occupants is far
from new; in fact, it was a major theme in the 1933 Chicago World's Fair. We are now in a position
to realize the intelligent-home dream with systems that feature scalability, interoperability and
security built-in from the start.  This requires collaborations among leading players across the
ecosystem.

"The smart home is a key part of the smarter world we need to address important global challenges,
including energy saving and more affordable and accessible healthcare, and many different
technologies and skills must be brought together to accelerate its development," said Alessandro
Cremonesi, Group Vice President and General Manager of Advanced Systems Technology,
STMicroelectronics. "This demonstration confirms that ST's solutions, from sensors, low-power
microcontrollers and communications devices to home gateways, combined with our unrivalled track
record in successful partnering, can contribute significantly to making smart homes a reality."

The demo will be shown at two venues near the Las Vegas Convention Center: A private,
invitation-only suite at The Encore Hotel (ST) and The Venetian, exhibit meeting room 2405 (IBM).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - James "Jes" Staley, chairman of the investment banking unit of JPMorgan Chase, is leaving the company to join hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management, the fund said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley had been chief executive of JPMorgan's investment bank until July, when JPMorgan (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon reorganized business segments and named two younger executives to be co-chiefs of commercial and investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley had been at JPMorgan for 34 years and had been expected to leave after the management shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said at the time that Staley, 56, understood the need to make room for younger executives as part of the company's process of keeping and training potential CEO successors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BlueMountain said Staley will become its ninth managing partner.

&lt;p&gt;EDISON, NJ, Jan 08 (Marketwire) -- 
StrikeForce Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: SFOR) announce the release of
GuardedID(R) Anti-Keylogging Keystroke Encryption software for the
Microsoft Windows 8 Operating System. GuardedID is the single most
important security program that consumers and corporations need to
protect themselves. It overcomes the inadequacies of anti-virus software
by encrypting each and every keystroke in real-time, therefore protecting
your computer, even if you are infected with keylogging malware.

    "The biggest misconception that people have about anti-virus software is
that they think it actually protects them from every type of threat,
unfortunately, that's just not true," says Mark L. Kay, CEO of
StrikeForce Technologies. "Test results from industry leaders have shown
that anti-virus software is only about 25% effective in stopping threats;
but you won't hear that from the anti-virus vendors."

    Successful keylogging attacks are making the news on a daily basis, on
Oct. 26th, 2012 South Carolina's Governor Nikki Hale announced that the
IRS had been hacked, the culprit was a keylogger. "Keyloggers are the
most efficient and effective way to steal personal and corporate
information," adds Kay. "In the recent Verizon 2012 Data Breach
Investigations Report, Verizon noted that 'When malware was used to
exfiltrate data, 98% of the time it was paired with keylogging
functionality.' Cybercriminals use keyloggers and ransomware to steal
identities, access confidential corporate information and perpetrate
financial fraud."

    GuardedID's Keystroke Encryption Software can help put an end to data
security breaches. If every computer had keystroke encryption,
keyloggers, used in part for virtually every major breach in the last
decade, would be rendered useless.

    About StrikeForce:
 StrikeForce Technologies (OTCBB: SFOR) is the creator
and key patent holder for two factor out-of-band authentication as well
as an anti-keylogging keystroke encryption technology (patent pending).
The company's GuardedID(R) anti-keylogging keystroke encryption
technology prevents keylogger malware from stealing personal, business,
financial information and passwords. Their software protects over six
million individuals and businesses in over 100 countries from identity
theft and data breaches. StrikeForce's ProtectID out-of-band
authentication technology is the only platform to offer eight different
out-of-band methods, including phone, voice, instant messaging, hard
tokens, and desktop/mobile tokens. ProtectID can be installed and managed
100% on premise, or, via StrikeForce's hosted service offering.

Prevenar 13 is the First and Only Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Approved for
This Age Group
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the European Commission has
approved expanding the use of the company`s pneumococcal conjugate vaccine,
Prevenar 13* (pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine [13-valent,
adsorbed]), to older children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years for active
immunization for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis
media caused by vaccine-type Streptococcus pneumoniae. Children in this age
group who have not previously received Prevenar 13 may receive a single dose of
the vaccine. 

"Prevenar 13 has been administered to millions of infants and young children
around the world and helps protect against the often fatal effects of
pneumococcal disease," said Emilio Emini, Ph.D., chief scientific officer,
Vaccine Research, Pfizer. "As the global leader in pneumococcal disease
prevention, Pfizer continues to study the use of this life-saving vaccine across
all ages." 

The European Commission`s decision to approve this expanded indication followed
submission and review of a Phase 3, open-label trial of Prevenar 13 in 592
healthy children and adolescents, including those with underlying medical
conditions such as asthma (17.4% of the study population). The study met all
endpoints, demonstrating immunogenicity and establishing a safety profile in
children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years consistent with the safety profile
established in previous trials in infants and young children. 

"Children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 with underlying medical conditions have
an increased risk of pneumococcal disease," said Luis Jodar, Ph.D., vice
president, Vaccines Global Medicines Development Group, Pfizer. "Pfizer will
continue working with health authorities worldwide in an effort to provide
access to Prevenar 13 to those at risk of disease." 

About Prevenar 13

Prevenar 13 was first introduced for use in infants and young children in
December 2009 in Europe and is now approved for such use in more than 120
countries worldwide. It is the most widely used pneumococcal conjugate vaccine,
with more than 500 million doses of Prevenar/Prevenar 13 having been distributed
worldwide. Currently, Prevenar 13 is included as part of a national or regional
immunization program in more than 60 countries, helping to protect more than 30
million children per year against invasive pneumococcal disease. 

Prevenar 13 offers the broadest serotype coverage of any currently available
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for prevention of pneumococcal disease including
invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia and otitis media. The 13 pneumococcal
serotypes in Prevenar 13 (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F)
are among the most prevalent invasive-disease-causing strains in children
worldwide. 

Prevenar 13 is also approved for use in adults 50 years of age and older in more
than 80 countries, and is the first and only pneumococcal vaccine to be granted
World Health Organization prequalification in the older adult population. 

Prevenar 13 is marketed in the United States as Prevnar 13&#174; (Pneumococcal
13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]). In the United States,
Prevnar 13 is not indicated for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia in the
pediatric population. 

Pneumococcal Disease

Pneumococcal Disease (PD) is a group of illnesses caused by the bacterium
Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), also known as pneumococcus. While
pneumococcus can infect people of all ages, infants, and young children and
individuals with certain underlying chronic conditions, are at heightened risk.
Certain underlying medical conditions, such as asthma and illnesses that impact
a person`s immune system, can increase an individual`s risk of PD. PD is
associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 

Indication for Prevenar 13 in Europe

Prevenar 13 is approved in the EU for active immunization for the prevention of
invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused byvaccine-type S.
pneumoniae in infants and children from 6 weeks to 17 years of age and invasive
pneumococcal disease in adults aged 50 years and older. 

Important Safety Information for Prevenar 13

The use of Prevenar 13 should be determined on the basis of official
recommendations taking into consideration the impact of invasive disease in
different age groups as well as the variability of serotype epidemiology in
different geographical areas. 

In clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were
injection-site reactions, fever, irritability, decreased appetite, and increased
and/or decreased sleep. 

Risks are associated with all vaccines, including Prevenar 13. Hypersensitivity
to any component, including diphtheria toxoid, is a contraindication to its use.
As with other vaccines, the administration of Prevenar 13 should be postponed in
subjects suffering from acute, severe febrile illness. However, the presence of
a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result in the deferral of
vaccination. Prevenar 13 does not provide 100 percent protection against vaccine
serotypes or protect against non-vaccine serotypes. 

Indications for Prevnar 13 in the United States

In the United States, Prevnar 13 is indicated for use in children six weeks
through 5 years of age for the prevention of invasive disease (e.g., meningitis,
bacteremia) caused by 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B,
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). The vaccine is also indicated in adults 50
years of age and older for active immunization for the prevention of pneumonia
and invasive disease caused by the 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes
contained in the vaccine (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and
23F). Indication is based on immune responses.

LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
DreamPlay Toys, LLC (DreamPlay), the joint venture between NantWorks LLC and
JAKKS Pacific, Inc., debuted Disney-branded DreamPlay products, the next
generation of interactive technology-based toys, at the annual Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. DreamPlay products will incorporate
NantWorks` groundbreaking iD image recognition technology, a robust recognition
platform that accurately recognizes images, 3D objects, voice, speech, data,
live video and more, with the capability to differentiate between millions of
objects instantaneously. The integration of this novel technology with beloved
Disney characters enables the consumer to experience a seamless blending of the
physical toy with new character based content in the form of interactive games
and animation right on their smart phone or tablet device. 

DreamPlay Toys and JAKKS Pacific plan to launch this interactive product line in
the US at major retailers in Fall 2013 and Internationally in 2014. Using
NantWorks` iD technology, apps will be developed for both iOS and Android
devices, which will allow the consumer to access deep, content-rich experiences
from their mobile and tablet devices without the need for any type of QR code.
The patented 2D and 3D recognition technologies instantly recognize the toy and
allow children to interact, play and learn in ways that were not possible
before. It is a seamless convergence of technology, storytelling and traditional
toy play delivered through a single experience. 

"What really sets this apart from anything else out there is the combination of
a truly incredible technological platform combined with the best content and
storytelling company in the world, Disney. Kids are about to see the magic they
always dreamed of come to life right before their eyes," said Dr. Patrick
Soon-Shiong, NantWorks` founder. "At NantWorks, we believe in breaking barriers
and bringing the impossible to life. This collaboration marks the convergence of
imagination, innovation, and interactivity and we are excited that Disney is
delivering new experiences to the consumer utilizing our groundbreaking iD
technology." 

"One of our top priorities is to integrate cutting-edge technologies with our
incredible Disney content to transform traditional toys into interactive
storytelling experiences that are uniquely Disney," said Bob Chapek, president,
Disney Consumer Products. "Today`s announcement is an exciting first step toward
our vision of re-imagining conventional toys as new forms of play and digital
entertainment that will enrich and enhance how the consumer interacts with
Disney products." 

"We are excited to work with Disney, our longtime licensor, to develop and
deliver best-in-class play experiences for families to enjoy," said Stephen
Berman, President and CEO, JAKKS Pacific, Inc. "Increasingly, kids are 'playing'
with digital technology. Our goal is to combine physical toy play with a digital
experience incorporating the unique content that only Disney can provide. By
marrying toys and Disney to our DreamPlay technology using the powerful
NantWorks iD recognition platform, we are merging the two ways kids are playing
today, with smart devices and traditional toys, enhancing their experience and
deepening the level of interaction with our products using their smart phone or
tablet device. Children and their parents will be treated to a truly magical
experience and endless possibilities to interact with their favorite brands and
characters from Disney." 

Disney will be granted exclusive rights to utilize the DreamPlay technology in
the toy space along with select entertainment characters and brands owned by
JAKKS, such as Monsuno. The launch of the products is subject to certain
conditions under the applicable agreements between Disney, DreamPlay Toys and
JAKKS. 

Disney-branded DreamPlay toys will be demonstrated to the media by appointment
at the Consumers Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2013 at the DreamPlay
Booth located at the Venetian Hotel, Veronese Ballroom, Booth 2502.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Jan 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney toys are
sold around the world. Now, children can find them in the cloud
as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media giant is teaming up with toy company JAKKS Pacific
and Patrick Soon-Shiong, Los Angeles' wealthiest person, on a
new line of toys - with a nifty technological twist designed to
link the goodies that kids lug home from the store with Disney's
stable of well-known animated characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"DreamPlay", developed by Soon-Shiong's NantWorks company, 
and JAKKS works via an app that can be downloaded on Apple Inc
 devices like the iPad, or smartphones and tablets
running Google Inc Android software. When a device's
camera is trained on any toy specifically designed to work with
DreamPlay, it triggers one of thousands of preset animations
that appear on the device's screen and seem to be unfolding in
the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With viewers' eyes locked on the tablet or smartphone
screen, fairies appear to glide in and out of buildings,
animated critters start playing musical instruments, mythical
characters prance on a toy piano's keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which licensed its characters to DreamPlay, and its
partners hope that children will take to the new approach, which
is intended to extend and expand the life of the toy. But it
remains to be seen if the concept will prove to be more than a
novelty, and be able to arrest a child's infamously short
attention span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three will demo their concept on Tuesday at the Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas, but Reuters got a sneak peak at
the technology on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a showroom in the 20th floor of a Santa Monica, Calif.
building, visitors to JAKKS' demonstration are treated to an
animated version of Sebastian - the red Jamaican crab from
Disney's "Little Mermaid" movie - who pops up onscreen on an
iPad seconds after the tablet's camera is trained on a real-life
set of toy bongo drums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animated crab pounces on the drums and proceeds to bang
out a calypso song onscreen, with both Sebastian and the
physical drum set appearing together as if the two shared the
same cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REAL, VIRTUAL INTERACTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DreamPlay allows not just Sebastian, but also Tinker Bell
and a host of other well-loved Disney characters to "interact"
virtually with specially made toys via image-recognition
software. The software was developed by Soon-Shiong, a former
cancer surgeon who created drugs to fight diabetes and breast
cancer and then sold the companies that produced them for $8.6
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon-Shiong teamed with JAKKS, a $678 million-a-year toy
maker and licensee of toys based on the Princess line of dolls,
Marvel action figures and other Disney toys, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology works via the "cloud" - images and video
clips stored on remote servers that are streamed to kids'
mobiles when the app recognizes a particular item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a tremendous way to combine great technology and
Disney's magical story telling to extend the time a child can
play with a toy," said Bob Chapek, president of Disney's
consumer products unit. "Kids find out that playing with their
toy doesn't end when they get it home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since taking over in 2011, Chapek has repositioned Disney's
consumer product unit to expand its use of technology with its
toys. Dr eamPlay is the first of what Chapek says are other
products that will twin technology with familiar Disney toys,
although he won't name them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down the road, Disney may explore new business models,
including selling subscriptions to content created specifically
to be used with a particular toy, said Chapek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is hardly certain for a product that requires a
child to hold up a phone or tablet, and peer through it to play
with a toy that's stationary. Will children want to see Rapunzel
endlessly dancing on the keys of a piano or Rosetta, a fairy
from Disney's "Tinker Bell" movies, fly in and out of a cottage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The technology may be great, but no one has proven to me
yet that a kid will sit in front of an iPhone or iPad instead of
playing with a toy that's right in front of him," said Sean
McGowan, a toy analyst with Needham &amp; Co who downgraded JAKKS to
hold in September along with other toy companies, an d then
downgraded JAKKS to underperform in O c tober.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAKKS intends to begin selling DreamPlay versions of toys
from the Disney Princess line in October. It will then expand
its offerings next year, with international sales starting in
2014, said Stephen Berman, JAKKS President and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DreamPlay toys will be "a couple of dollars" costlier than
the regular version, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Target stores and Toys R Us are among the U.S.
retailers who will carry the DreamPlay line, Berman says.
Top-Toy, the giant Nordic retailer, has also signed on, while
Beijing Hualian Group, which operates supermarkets and
department stores across China, is coming onboard as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kids don't own iPhones or iPads but they all know how to
use them," says Berman. "Kids have so much more imagination than
we do. Imagine recording a bunch of the videos and giving the
kid an iPad to play with them on a trip to see the
grandparents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAKKS will ramp up marketing for the DreamPlay line, said
Berman. DreamPlay toys will be prominently displayed at all the
partner-retailers, he added, and shoppers will be encouraged to
use their smartphones to view them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those that aim smartphones at a boxed Tinker Bell, for
instance, may get a start as the fairy from "Peter Pan"
literally soars out of the box, leaving an empty package behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Technology can help people live better, work better, play
better," said Soon-Shiong as he showed off the line of toys.
"This is the way they will play better."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan 08 - Fitch Ratings has assigned South Korea-based KT 
Corporation's (KT, 'A'/Stable) proposed JPY senior notes an expected rating of 
'A(EXP)'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final rating is contingent upon receipt of final documents conforming to 
information already received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notes are rated at the same level as KT's Issuer Default Rating of 'A' as 
they represent direct, unconditional, unsecured, and unsubordinated obligations 
of the company, ranking equally with other senior unsecured debt and subject to 
a negative pledge clause. However, as is common in Korean global bond issuance, 
the negative pledge clause does not protect bondholders from subordination 
through future grants of senior-ranking security interests to either debt 
denominated in Korean won or debt in any currency with a maturity less than one 
year from the date of issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratings reflect KT's position as a fully diversified telecommunications 
operator in South Korea, with leading market positions in the fixed-line and 
broadband businesses, and the second-largest market share in the wireless 
segment. However, Fitch believes that the company has little rating headroom and 
that further declines in telecom service margins or EBITDA are likely to lead to 
a negative rating action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch does not foresee any material improvement to KT's operating margins in 
2013. This is because telecom operators are likely to continue to pursue 
aggressive marketing policies to expand their long term evolution subscriber 
base to improve average revenue per user. However, marketing efforts in early 
2013, continuing from Q412, are unlikely to be as severe as witnessed in 
Q212-Q312, largely due to regulatory curb on excessive competition. For Q113, 
the regulatory body has suspended all telecom operators from subscriber 
acquisition for about 20 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch forecasts that KT's net debt will continue to decline in 2013 with net 
debt/operating EBITDAR falling below 1.5x, (1.7x at end-2011), mainly due to 
cash received from the securitisation of handset instalment receivables, as well 
as reduced capex. KT, on a core telecom operation basis, has reduced net debt to 
KRW7.5trn at end-September 2012 from KRW8.5trn at end-2011. However, if KT makes 
a sizable debt-funded acquisition to expand its geographical footprint, or to 
diversify business portfolio, this would result in a negative rating action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Could Trigger A Rating Action?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to 
negative rating action include&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- further deterioration in the operating environment causing core telecom 
service margins or EBITDA to decline further&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- debt-funded acquisitions leading to core telecom adjusted net debt/operating 
EBITDAR over 1.5x on a sustained basis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-  negative pre-dividend free cash flow on a sustained basis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive: Given the company's difficult regulatory and market environment, 
positive rating actions are unlikely in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/SACRAMENTO (Reuters) - A group of investors led by hedge fund manager Chris Hansen and Microsoft Corp CEO Steve Ballmer is close to a deal to buy the Sacramento Kings basketball team for $500 million and move the franchise to Seattle, Yahoo Sports reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maloof family, which has wrangled with the city of Sacramento for years over a new arena and held talks with other cities about moving the team, has now agreed to sell, the report said, citing league sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters could not confirm the report. The Sacramento Kings did not immediately respond to phone calls or emails seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the reported deal, the Kings would play for two seasons in KeyArena, the stomping ground of the Seattle Supersonics before the team's 2008 move to Oklahoma City, and then move into a new facility, Yahoo reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Basketball Association franchise is Sacramento's only major sports team, and its mayor, Kevin Johnson, is a former NBA star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm going to make every effort that I can possibly do to identify a potential buyer that will ensure that the Sacramento Kings remain in Sacramento," Johnson told reporters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American cities often clash over sports franchises, which are seen as economic engines and a source of civic pride. The value of sports franchises has soared in recent years, largely as a result of pay television contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson promised to locate buyers, mentioning billionaire supermarket mogul Ron Burkle as having expressed an interest in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears to me for the first time that they have possibly shown a desire to sell the team, and that's what I think is significant today," Johnson said, referring to the Maloof family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle sports fans were infuriated by the loss of the Supersonics and have pined for a new NBA team ever since. Hansen last year gained city council approval for a new $490 million arena near the waterfront south of downtown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, the NBA and representatives for Hansen all declined to comment. Seattle city officials told Reuters they were aware of the rumors, but were not in a position to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOFTWARE AND SPORTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer's potential involvement reflects a strong connection between the software giant and local sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen owns the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers, and is a part-owner of the Seattle Sounders, the soccer team. Microsoft's longtime head of human resources, Lisa Brummel, is a part-owner of the Seattle Storm women's basketball team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer himself is an avid basketball fan and sometime player, who used to scrimmage regularly before work with other employees in a gym near the company's campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Supersonics moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder, its owner faulted Seattle officials for not coming up with a plan to replace the aging KeyArena. Many fans, though bitter, still sport Supersonics jerseys on the streets of Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional sports have enjoyed a recent resurgence in the city, with the NFL's Seahawks enjoying success on the field in a relatively new stadium, and the Sounders soccer team boasting the best attendance in the MLS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite resistance from unions and others who fear a third stadium by the city docks will crimp freight transport, the majority of locals favor a new basketball arena and local politicians now embrace the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city council in October signed off on an agreement struck between would-be franchise owner Hansen, Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and King County Executive Dow Constantine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But McGinn was coy when asked about the report on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know as much as you do about the Sonics," McGinn told reporters at a re-election news conference on Wednesday. "But if it's true, ain't it cool?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry observers say there are still a number of factors that could undermine any potential agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hansen has spent millions of dollars on land south of downtown Seattle to house a new arena, but locating it there is contingent upon the outcome of an environmental assessment and a review of other potential sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not a done deal. There are discussions, I'm told," said Marc Ganis, president of consultancy SportsCorp Ltd in Chicago, who is not involved in the deal. "There are lots of unknowns. I think $500 million sounds like the right range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kings have appeared to be on the brink of leaving their host city in past years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maloofs opened talks with officials in Anaheim to move the team to the Orange County city in 2011, but NBA officials convinced them to give Sacramento another year to get a deal for a new arena in place. Then, last August, reports circulated that the Maloofs were talking with officials about moving to Virginia Beach, Va.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to be an NBA city with an NBA team, and we want that team to be the Sacramento Kings," Johnson said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sue Zeidler in Los Angeles.

&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE Jan 10 (Reuters) - Copper and gold miner PanAust
Ltd is Australia's top contender to be taken over in
2013 in another year likely to be dominated by acquisitions of
resource companies, according to an annual report from JP
Morgan's specialist sales desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell could bid for oil and gas
producer Santos Ltd or Senex Energy Ltd this
year, gold and nickel miners are likely to see consolidation,
and Echo Entertainment Group will remain a target of
Crown Ltd, the JP Morgan sales desk team predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since starting its "Specialist Sales Top Takeovers List"
three years ago, JP Morgan has successfully picked 20 Australian
takeover stocks, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our no. 1 pick for 2013 will be PanAust. Copper
consolidation continues globally, and PanAust is one of the
largest listed players left," JP Morgan said in the report,
which was obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will only be a matter of time before it gets acquired,"
the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team advised buying PanAust, which is expected to
produce 68,000 tonnes of copper this year and has projects in
Laos, Thailand and Chile, and offsetting that with a short
position in potential acquirer Oz Minerals Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible 2013 play is a takeover of Santos and/or
Senex by Shell, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Acquiring Santos makes strategic sense for Shell. This
should lead to a four train LNG (liquefied natural gas) project
which is more in line with the scale that Shell would like for a
high cost LNG project," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buru Energy, an emerging oil and shale gas play
with assets in the Canning Basin in Western Australia, could be
eyed by North West Shelf joint venture partners Woodside
Petroleum, BHP Billiton, BP Plc, Shell
and Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The North West Shelf is short gas from 2020 and Buru
Energy's large acreage could be seen as a potential solution to
extend the life of the project," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top gold takeover targets were named as Regis Resources
, Medusa, and Perseus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Areas and Mirabela Nickel, two of
the largest listed players left in the nickel industry, may be
targeted respectively for high grades and long mine life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Crown, billionaire James Packer's company, may make a
bid for rival Echo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our view is that Crown will bid for Echo this year to
ensure it has a monopoly position in Sydney just like it has in
Melbourne and Perth," said the team, which had chosen Echo as
the top pick in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was potential for Vale, Glencore 
or Chinese suitors to bid for Atlas Iron to gain entry
into the Pilbara iron ore region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is already producing, has an open shareholder register,
and it is not too large at a market cap of A$1.6 billion," JP
Morgan said of Atlas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possibilities were BG acquiring Drillsearch
Energy, Paladin Energy attracting interest
from Cameco Corp or Chinese firms, and offers for
Centro Retail Australia, Mirvac Group or
Commonwealth Property Office Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IOOF Holdings, the only remaining listed pure
wealth management player left, may catch the attention of AMP
Ltd or one of the major banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And construction group Adelaide Brighton might
attract Fletcher Building, possibly as a joint bid with
Boral, the yearly update said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - A group of investors including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) CEO Steve Ballmer and hedge fund manager Chris Hansen is close to a deal to buy the Sacramento Kings professional basketball team for $500 million and move the National Basketball Association franchise to Seattle, Yahoo Sports reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maloof family is close to agreeing to sell the Kings to the Ballmer group, which hopes to move the franchise to Seattle in time for the 2013-14 season, Yahoo Sports cited league sources as saying. Reuters could not immediately confirm the accuracy of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the proposed deal, the Kings would play for two seasons in KeyArena - the former stomping grounds of the Seattle Supersonics - before moving into a new facility built with the help of a public financing deal already in place, Yahoo reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, the NBA and representatives for Hansen all declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sacramento Kings did not immediately respond to phone calls or emails seeking comment. Seattle city officials told Reuters they were aware of the rumors, but were not in a position to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle lost the SuperSonics franchise in 2008 when it moved to Oklahoma City and was renamed the Thunder. At the time, its owner faulted Seattle officials for not coming up with a plan to build a new arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then last October, officials from Seattle - a stone's throw from Microsoft's corporate base in Redmond - signed off on a pact to bankroll a new NBA arena. That was built on an earlier agreement struck between would-be franchise owner Hansen, Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and King County Executive Dow Constantine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But McGinn was coy when asked about the report on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know as much as you do about the Sonics," McGinn told reporters at a re-election news conference on Wednesday. "But if it's true, ain't it cool?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry observers said there remained a welter of factors that could undermine any potential agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hansen has spent millions of dollars on land south of downtown Seattle to house a new arena, though locating it there is contingent upon the outcome of an environmental assessment and a review of other potential sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not a done deal. There are discussions, I'm told," said Marc Ganis, president of consultancy SportsCorp Ltd in Chicago, who is not involved in the deal. "There are lots of unknowns. I think $500 million sounds like the right range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, himself a former NBA star, also weighed in on the widespread reports on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bottom line Sacramento: it's not over," he tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Kaminsky and Sue Zeidler in Los Angeles; editing by G Crosse)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAY HARBOR, FL, Jan 09 (Marketwire) -- 
SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCQB: SMME) -- Speaking today, The President and CEO
of SmartMetric, Inc., Ms. Chaya C. Hendrick, said, "SmartMetric, Inc. is
looking forward to its trial by jury against Visa and MasterCard for what
SmartMetric alleges as serious infringement of its '464' Patent."

    The "464" Patent, issued by the United States Patent Office and owned in
full by SmartMetric, Inc., deals with data cards such as smartcards that
are inserted into readers and that are used to establish a connection
with a network. Visa has announced that it has started issuing in the
USA, such cards that are referred to in the industry as EMV Cards.

    SmartMetric has argued in its motions before the Federal Court that Visa
and MasterCard should be found guilty of infringing the SmartMetric
Patent. The company, SmartMetric, Inc. is in the discovery phase of the
Court proceedings and is waiting for the card companies to produce papers
that so far they have sought to withhold from disclosure to the Company
and its CEO, C. Hendrick. In what appears very strange indeed both Visa
and MasterCard have claimed allowing SmartMetric and especially its CEO
access to all of its information under discovery would be harmful to
their interests. SmartMetric has objected to this withholding of
information and only allowing the so called confidential information to
be seen by SmartMetric's Patent litigation lawyers. The first motion by
Visa and MasterCard to exclude information under discovery was thrown out
by the Court in a ruling by the Judge on December 3rd 2012. The card
companies have refiled almost an identical motion that was rejected last
December and SmartMetric has filed its objections to this new motion. We
are now awaiting another ruling of the Court regarding this matter.

    About SmartMetric, Inc.
 SmartMetric, Inc. has developed a portable
biometric identity and transaction card capable of storing a wide variety
of personal information while protecting you against identity theft and
fraud. It is one of the most advanced portable identity authentication
solutions in the world today. The card contains a biometric fingerprint
scanner and reader which only you can unlock and is smaller and thinner
than a credit card. The SmartMetric card is ideal for a wide range of
consumers, including Personal, Government and Corporate.

Joint integration brings powerful communications and customer service
capabilities across the enterprise 
DALY CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Genesys, a leading provider of customer service solutions, today announced that
it has integrated Microsoft Lync with its industry leading customer service
platform. The integration of Microsoft Lync and Genesys creates a combined voice
platform, enabling companies to unify Contact Center interactions and Enterprise
Communications. By incorporating Genesys` industry leading skills-based routing,
reporting and multi-channel customer service capabilities, the joint solution
will deliver voice and instant messaging (IM) interactions originating from any
Lync enterprise device to agents. 

News Facts:

* Microsoft Lync is a unified communications (UC) platform used by organizations
of all sizes for communications. Through the Lync integration, Genesys will now
help companies consolidate their enterprise communications (external and
internal) and contact center into one combined solution - without the need for
expensive PBX hardware. Ultimately, Genesys and Lync will improve first call
resolution by finding the right available resource, at the right time, via
enterprise-wide directory search and ad-hoc conferencing. 
* Microsoft Lync provides several levels of functionality that are particularly
effective for use in conjunction with Genesys` SIP Server and Customer
Interaction Management platform, such as real-time user status (available, busy,
out of office, etc), and enabling companies to route calls to available agents
wherever they may be stationed. As a result, organizations using both remote
agents and contact center employees can better direct enquiries based upon the
status of any given agent while increasing efficiency of service. 
* Through a rigorous testing process, Genesys has met the requirements of the
Lync ISV Qualification Program, which is designed to ensure that qualified
applications meet customer expectations for specific scenarios.

Supporting Quotes:

"The integration of Genesys SIP Server with Microsoft Lync Enterprise Voice
empowers Contact Center agents to enjoy the rich collaboration and multimedia
capabilities offered by Lync when communicating with their peers, while also
extending these capabilities out to their customers," said Merijn Te Booij, Vice
President of Products and Strategy, Genesys. "The advantages of running the same
Unified Communication platform in the contact center and the wider enterprise
are obvious but compelling: enhancing collaboration throughout the business to
efficiently and cost-effectively deliver the best outcomes for customer
service." 

"Tearing down the walls and extending the advantages of unified communications
into the realm of customer service makes organizations fully connected to key
stakeholders and customers that have traditionally been on the outside looking
in." said Jon Morrow Sr. Program Manager Partner Engineering, Microsoft Lync.

&lt;p&gt;http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20130109:nBw095728a

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs Asset Management announced that it will begin disclosing a daily
market value Net Asset Value ("NAV") for its US-domiciled Commercial Paper Money
Market funds effective today. Disclosure of the NAV for the Government and
Municipal funds is expected to follow next week. 

"As a leading provider of liquidity solutions, we believe that more frequent
disclosure and greater transparency will benefit investors. This will have no
impact to how fund shareholders transact or the way the funds are managed," said
James McNamara, Managing Director and President of Goldman Sachs Mutual Funds.
"It is our belief that this level of transparency will also benefit the ongoing
dialogue around potential regulatory changes to money market funds." 

As the industry and regulators work to determine the next course of action
relative to money market fund reform, GSAM believes increased transparency will
help investors, and the market at large. This disclosure is also consistent with
Goldman Sachs` long-standing advocacy of mark-to-market accounting. 

"Given that much of the discussion about systemic risk has centered on the
commercial paper fund market in the US, we have decided as a first step to
disclose those funds` market value NAVs," said David A. Fishman and James P.
McCarthy, Managing Directors and Co-Heads of GSAM`s Global Liquidity Management
business. "This additional transparency gives fund investors more information to
understand the underlying value of the portfolio - a data point we already use
each day to manage risk and achieve the funds` primary goal: seeking to achieve
a $1.00 NAV." 

The calculation, disclosure and monitoring of a market value NAV for a money
market fund is not new. In fact, every money market fund is required by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to calculate a market value NAV to the
nearest hundredth of a cent (or $0.0001) on a monthly basis, which is made
available to investors on a 60-day lag. Additionally, GSAM and its Funds` Board
regularly monitor the funds` market value NAV. 

GSAM will begin disclosing a daily market value NAV for the following
US-domiciled commercial paper or "prime" funds: the GS Financial Square Money
Market Fund, the GS Financial Square Prime Obligations Fund and the GS VIT Money
Market Fund. The information will be available to investors on the Funds website
at http://www.goldmansachs.com/gsam/glm/products/money-market/index.html. 

GSAM plans to disclose daily NAVs for US-domiciled tax-exempt, government, and
Treasury funds next week and for non-US Money Market funds in the near future.

Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS), which manages $856 billion as of September 30, 2012.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, ENGLAND, Jan 09 (MARKET WIRE) --
Microsoft, Ford and Red Bull are three of the 100 stand-out performers of
2012, according to the World Finance readership and editorial panel.

    The World Finance 100, announced today, celebrates the most innovative,
progressive and strategically-sound individuals and organisations of the
year.

    With entrants spanning the globe, the list provides an exhaustive
collection of those reshaping the landscape of business over the course
of yet another difficult year.

    Joining Microsoft, Ford and Red Bull on the list are pioneers in
technological development, such as Korea's Samsung and Hungary's NNG, as
well as those making great strides in customer relations, such as
Australia's Commonwealth Bank and Alkhabeer Capital.

    On announcing the list, editor Alexander Redcliffe paid testament to the
entrants for showing strength and flexibility during a period of numerous
economic challenges. He said:

    "This year has not been an easy ride for industry, with a number of
unfavourable and unpredictable circumstances bringing many national
economies to their knees. While many hands have been forced to change
business structures and strategic endeavours, the World Finance 100
represents those who have set out to rethink the way business is
conducted."

&lt;p&gt;http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20130109:nBw095592a

LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Smithers Apex are pleased to announce the full conference programme for Cleaning
Products Europe 2013, taking place on 26-28 March in Prague, Czech Republic.
With a strong focus on innovation, collaboration and consumer engagement in the
cleaning products industry, the conference programme will feature expert
speakers from all levels of the supply chain from detergent manufacturers to
chemical suppliers and regulatory bodies to retail representatives. 

In these troubled economic times, the &#8364;28bn1 West European cleaning products
sector is more resilient than most, however consumers are still searching for
effectiveness and value and in recent years sales have remain static. European
consumers expect that their products are biodegradable, do not harm the
environment and are sustainable. European Detergents legislation ensures some of
this. But in the current mature market, manufacturers will gain competitive
advantage by ensuring their products meet the highest sustainability standards,
whilst continuing to perform well and remain cost effective. 

Commitments have been outlined by companies and organisations throughout Europe
in order to meet these standards and to prove to consumers that they are serious
about sustainability. With a seven year timeline until these main commitments
need to be met, the Cleaning Products Europe 2013 conference programme will
identify and assess the current challenges, which need to be overcome in order
to reach these company targets, in addition to featuring case studies of
solutions and opportunities within the industry and beyond. 

Chaired once again by market leaders P and Unilever, the conference benefits
from a strong brand owner presence, with highlights including insights from
Unilever and Henkel on the opportunities in the bio based economy for the
cleaning products industry, and a keynote address from Mohamed Samir, Vice
President Fabric Care Western Europe at P on solving the world`s
sustainability challenges through innovation. 

Two pre-conference workshops also feature at Cleaning Products Europe 2013, one
with a focus on providing an introduction to sustainable cleaning products,
through insightful industry case studies and the other has been developed to
help with making good choices when formulating, marketing, and selecting "green"
products.

&lt;p&gt;Singapore investors are more upbeat than they were six and 12
months ago, according to a survey by J.P. Morgan Asset
Management, in a sign the rally in the city-state's stock market
may continue in coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Straits Times Index has gained 1.5 percent
since the start of the year, boosted by the U.S. government's
last-minute deal to avoid a so-called fiscal cliff and signs of
a pick-up in China. The STI rose nearly 20 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The J.P. Morgan confidence index, taken every six months,
stands at 106, up from 101 in the previous survey and 86 last
year. A reading above 100 shows investors are optimistic, while
a reading below that level indicates pessimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is no doubt influenced by the progress we have seen
over the past six months where the risk of a financial meltdown
in Europe is largely reduced," Andrew Creber, J.P. Morgan Asset

CapitaMalls Asia Ltd, but gains are likely to be
limited as investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of a European
Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 0531 GMT, the benchmark Straits Times Index was

Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CapitaMalls Asia, which is seen as a good proxy to China's
economic recovery, rose 2.4 percent to S$2.16. It is the
strongest performer on the STI so far this year, rising 8.8
percent. Last year, it surged 71.7 percent, beating the
benchmark's 19 percent gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybank Kim Eng said CapitaMalls will be a strong
beneficiary from China's focus on growing its domestic private
consumption as it has 59 shopping centres in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd, which owns Hong Kong
offices, gained 2.5 percent to $7.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of construction firm Yongnam Holdings Ltd 
rose 6.1 percent to S$0.26, after it said its American
depository receipts started trading on the OTCQX, which would
allow it to diversify its shareholder base and improve access to
new capital markets.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - James "Jes" Staley is leaving his job as chairman of the investment banking unit of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to join a hedge fund that profited from the bank's $6.2 billion "London Whale" loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 56-year-old Staley, who was moved aside in July from his position as chief executive for investment banking at JPMorgan (JPM.N), is becoming a partner at BlueMountain Capital Management, the hedge fund company said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BlueMountain was among a group of hedge funds that profited by betting against JPMorgan in credit derivatives transactions known as the "London Whale" trades, which cost the bank billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, BlueMountain worked for JPMorgan to help the bank close the positions, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund manages more than $12 billion and was founded by JPMorgan alums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley, a 34-year veteran of JPMorgan, was sidelined in a management reshuffle in July that foreshadowed his departure. He had long been seen as a possible successor to JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, but both men are the same age, and Dimon seems to be focusing on promoting younger executives now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At BlueMountain, Staley will focus on cultivating relationships with clients and developing new strategies, the firm said, echoing the kind of talk about financial innovation that used to be routine at investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many bankers complain that regulations are making it harder to innovate. The new rules were put in place after a financial crisis that was fueled in large part by abuses of innovations such as securitization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley will buy a stake in BlueMountain and the money will be used on new technology and staff, the firm said. The amount of his investment was not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley spent nearly 22 of his 34 JPMorgan years at its investment bank. He was a founding member of its equities business in the early 1980s. He later worked as CEO of its asset management unit, which includes its private bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dimon reorganized business units, he named two younger executives to be co-CEOs of commercial and investment banking and made Staley chairman of the unit and head of a committee to consider the future of global banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley, appearing on CNBC on Tuesday, said of no longer being in contention for Dimon's job, "There is a generational issue. The bank has to get ready for that. The transition that Jamie and I have been able to execute from JPMorgan to a firm like BlueMountain, I feel very proud of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley said he expects changes in the financial system will shift more trading, particularly of credit instruments, from banks to firms like BlueMountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley will become BlueMountain's ninth managing partner. He declined twice on CNBC to discuss the trade other than to make the point that JPMorgan had trusted BlueMountain enough to use it to resolve the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Whale trades were made through JPMorgan's chief investment office in London, which was a separate business unit from the investment bank. One of the key engineers of the trade was Bruno Iksil, who took big enough positions to earn the nickname "the London Whale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, CEO Dimon complained about the way some JPMorgan employees dealt with the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have some people who acted terribly and we had some leaders who acted like children. It was unbelievable," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Feldstein, the CEO of BlueMountain, worked for JPMorgan for more than a decade before starting the hedge fund in 2003. His jobs at JPMorgan included heading structured credit and the global credit portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, in a memo to senior managers after the announcement of Staley's departure, said, "BlueMountain is an important client of ours, and we look forward to working with Jes in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, John Wallace, Kenneth Barry, Andrew Hay and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase and Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today that Tim Ryan would re-join
the firm as Global Head of Regulatory Strategy and Policy. Ryan served as CEO of
the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) since 2009. He
will report to Matt Zames, co-Chief Operating Officer for JPMorgan Chase. 

"We are extremely pleased that Tim will be returning to JPMorgan Chase," said
Mr. Zames. "More than at any time in our history, regulatory strategy and
policies around the world are affecting our business and how we serve clients.
Tim has both a deep knowledge of these policies and the government
representatives formulating them, and also knows our businesses and executives
extremely well from his 16 years at the firm. Beyond that, he has outstanding
leadership qualities and integrity. We`re fortunate to have him back on our
senior team." 

"I`m looking forward to coming back to J.P. Morgan," said Mr. Ryan. "I`ve had a
great experience at SIFMA and am fortunate to have worked with as many terrific
people as I did. As Dodd Frank, Basel, EU, FSB and housing policies continue to
evolve, I believe my experience can help the businesses across JPMorgan Chase
continue to adapt and thrive." 

Before joining SIFMA in 2008, Ryan was Vice Chairman of Investment Banking for
Financial Institutions and Governments at J.P. Morgan. Prior to joining JPMorgan
in 1993, Mr. Ryan was the director of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in
the U.S. Department of the Treasury. As OTS director, he was the banking and
securities regulator for the nation's approximately 2,000 thrifts. He was also a
principal manager of the savings and loan cleanup, which involved closing
approximately 700 insolvent institutions, improving capital bases and selling
over $300 billion of assets. 

From 1983 to 1990, Ryan was a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of the law
firm Reed, Smith, Shaw &amp; McClay, where he headed the Pension Investment Group
and was a member of the firm`s Executive Committee. From 1981 to 1983, he was
Solicitor of Labor at the U.S. Department of Labor.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney toys are sold around the world. Now, children can find them in the cloud as well.&lt;/p&gt;

The software was developed by Soon-Shiong, a former cancer surgeon who created drugs to fight diabetes and breast cancer and then sold the companies that produced them for $8.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon-Shiong teamed with JAKKS, a $678 million-a-year toy maker and licensee of toys based on the Princess line of dolls, Marvel action figures and other Disney toys, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology works via the "cloud" - images and video clips stored on remote servers that are streamed to kids' mobiles when the app recognizes a particular item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a tremendous way to combine great technology and Disney's magical story telling to extend the time a child can play with a toy," said Bob Chapek, president of Disney's consumer products unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since taking over in 2011, Chapek has repositioned Disney's consumer product unit to expand its use of technology with its toys. DreamPlay is the first of what Chapek says are other products that will twin technology with familiar Disney toys, although he won't name them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down the road, Disney may explore new business models, including selling subscriptions to content created specifically to be used with a particular toy, said Chapek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is hardly certain for a product that requires a child to hold up a phone or tablet, and peer through it to play with a toy that's stationary. Will children want to see Rapunzel endlessly dancing on the keys of a piano or Rosetta, a fairy from Disney's "Tinker Bell" movies, fly in and out of a cottage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It brings added value to a toy, and kids will love it," said Lars Gjoerup, Joint Group Managing Director of Top-Toy, a large toy retailer in the Nordic region. "The toy will create an emotional attachment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAKKS intends to begin selling DreamPlay versions of toys from the Disney Princess line in October. It will then expand its offerings next year, with international sales starting in 2014, said Stephen Berman, JAKKS president and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DreamPlay toys will be "a couple of dollars" costlier than the regular version, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Target stores and Toys R Us are among the U.S. retailers who will carry the DreamPlay line, Berman says. Top-Toy, the giant Nordic retailer, has also signed on, while Beijing Hualian Group, which operates supermarkets and department stores across China, is coming onboard as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kids don't own iPhones or iPads but they all know how to use them," says Berman. "Kids have so much more imagination than we do. Imagine recording a bunch of the videos and giving the kid an iPad to play with them on a trip to see the grandparents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAKKS will ramp up marketing for the DreamPlay line, said Berman. DreamPlay toys will be prominently displayed at all the partner-retailers, he added, and shoppers will be encouraged to use their smartphones to view them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those that aim smartphones at a boxed Tinker Bell, for instance, may get a start as the fairy from "Peter Pan" literally soars out of the box, leaving an empty package behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Technology can help people live better, work better, play better," said Soon-Shiong as he showed off the line of toys. "This is the way they will play better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ronald Grover; Edited by Edwin Chan and Jeremy Laurence)&lt;/p&gt;

sold around the world. Now, children can find them in the cloud

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit would be "notably higher" than the previous quarter as oil and gas output bounced back and it booked a $1.4 billion gain on an asset transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today reported in its interim update that
earnings for the fourth quarter 2012 are expected to be notably higher than
third quarter 2012. Upstream results are projected to be higher between
sequential quarters, reflecting increased gains on asset transactions and higher
liftings. Downstream earnings in the fourth quarter are also expected to be
higher, largely reflecting a positive swing in timing effects, despite a sharp
decline in industry refining margins. 

Basis for Comparison in Interim Update

This interim update contains certain industry and company operating data for the
fourth quarter 2012. The production volumes, realizations, margins and certain
other items in the report are based on a portion of the quarter and are not
necessarily indicative of Chevron's full quarterly results to be reported on
February 1, 2013. The reader should not place undue reliance on this data. 

Readers are advised that portions of the commentary below compare results for
the first two months of the fourth quarter 2012 to full third quarter 2012
results, as indicated. 

UPSTREAM

The table that follows includes information on production and price indicators
for crude oil and natural gas for specific markets. Actual realizations may vary
from indicative pricing due to quality and location differentials and the effect
of pricing lags. International earnings reflect actual liftings, which may
differ from production due to the timing of cargoes and other factors.

U.S. net oil-equivalent production increased 39,000 barrels per day during the
first two months of the fourth quarter, reflecting recovery from the impacts of
Hurricane Isaac and an increase in production associated with recently acquired
acreage in the Permian Basin. International net oil-equivalent production during
the first two months of the fourth quarter increased 107,000 barrels per day,
mainly due to the absence of planned maintenance in Kazakhstan and the United
Kingdom. 

International upstream earnings in the fourth quarter are expected to include a
gain of approximately $1.4 billion from a previously announced asset exchange in
Australia, compared to a gain of $600 million in the third quarter associated
with the sale of an equity interest in the Wheatstone project. 

U.S. crude oil realizations increased $0.27, to $97.61 per barrel during the
first two months of the fourth quarter, consistent with the typical monthly lag
on pricing in the Gulf of Mexico. International liquids realizations increased
$1.86, to $100.06 per barrel. U.S. natural gas realizations increased $0.51 to
$3.14 per thousand cubic feet, while international natural gas realizations
decreased $0.09 to $5.94 per thousand cubic feet during the first two months of
the fourth quarter. 

DOWNSTREAM

The table that follows includes industry benchmark indicators for refining and
marketing margins. Actual margins realized by the company will differ due to
crude and product mix effects, planned and unplanned shutdown activity and other
company-specific and operational factors.

For the full fourth quarter, U.S. and international refining margins decreased
significantly compared to third quarter 2012. International marketing margins
also declined, while U.S. marketing margins improved from the previous quarter. 

During the first two months of the fourth quarter, U.S. refinery crude-input
volumes decreased by 77,000 barrels per day compared to the third quarter,
driven primarily by the continued shutdown of the Richmond, California refinery
crude unit. A return to normal operations at the Pascagoula, Mississippi
refinery post Hurricane Isaac partly offset the decrease. International refinery
crude-input volumes increased 9,000 barrels per day compared to the third
quarter. 

ALL OTHER

The company`s general guidance for the quarterly net after-tax charges related
to corporate and other activities is between $300 million and $400 million. Due
to the potential for non-ratable accruals related to income taxes, pension
settlements, environmental and other matters, actual results may significantly
differ from the guidance range. Total net charges for the fourth quarter are
expected to be notably higher than the general guidance range. 

NOTICE

Chevron`s discussion of fourth quarter 2012 earnings with security analysts will
take place on Friday, February 1, 2013, at 8:00 a.m. PST.A webcast of the
meeting will be available in a listen-only mode to individual investors, media,

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

FOR THE PURPOSE OF "SAFE HARBOR'' PROVISIONS OF THE

PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This interim update of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking statements
relating to Chevron`s operations that are based on management`s current
expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other
energy-related industries. Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends,"
"plans," "targets," "forecasts," "projects," "believes," "seeks," "schedules,"
"estimates," "budgets," "outlook" and similar expressions are intended to
identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of
future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other
factors, many of which are beyond the company`s control and are difficult to
predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what
is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader should
not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only
as of the date of this interim update. Unless legally required, Chevron

acquisition or disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset
dispositions or impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures,
recapitalizations, industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or
restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared
with the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally
accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the
factors set forth under the heading "Risk Factors" on pages 29 through 31 of the
company`s 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, such results could be
affected by general domestic and international economic and political
conditions. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this interim
update could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Jan. 10, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(Nasdaq:SNSS) today announced that Daniel Swisher, Chief Executive Officer of Sunesis, provided a
corporate update, including a clinical trial enrollment update and overview of 2013 major
corporate milestones, in a presentation at the 31st Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in
San Francisco. A webcast replay of the presentation, which was delivered today, January 10, at
12:00 PM Pacific Time, is archived on the Sunesis website at http://ir.sunesis.com
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10017819=1=http%3A%2F%2Fir.sunesis.com=http%3A%2F%2Fir.sunesis.com%2F
 and will be available for two weeks.

"Last year was a very productive period for Sunesis, with meaningful progress in our vosaroxin
studies, including our pivotal, Phase 3 VALOR trial," said Daniel Swisher, Chief Executive Officer
of Sunesis. "Looking ahead in 2013, we see a number of value-creating milestones, particularly
with the advancement of vosaroxin toward commercialization. It is our goal to see vosaroxin, an
unpartnered asset and one of the most advanced and promising therapies in development for AML
today, change the global standard of care in this disease. With continued support and enthusiasm
from our investigators and stakeholders, as well as a strong balance sheet, we remain well
positioned to achieve this goal."

Clinical Trial Updates

VALOR enrollment reaches 500 patients. Enrollment in the VALOR Trial, a Phase 3, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal trial of vosaroxin plus cytarabine in patients with
first relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), has reached 500 patients. Target
enrollment of 675 patients is expected to be complete in 2013, with unblinding of the study data
expected in the first half of 2014. VALOR is the largest company-sponsored trial ever conducted in
first relapsed or refractory AML.

Enrollment doubles in LI-1 trial. Enrollment in the Less Intensive 1 (LI-1) study, a Phase 3
randomized, controlled trial evaluating novel treatment regimens, including two
vosaroxin-containing regimens, in newly diagnosed elderly AML and high-risk myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) patients, has reached 49 vosaroxin-treated patients. LI-1 is being conducted by the
United Kingdom's National Cancer Research Institute under the direction of Professor Alan K.
Burnett, Head of Haematology at Cardiff University.

2013 Major Corporate Milestones

VALOR

* Completion of enrollment. Sunesis remains on track to complete full enrollment of VALOR in 2013.
Enrollment is currently ongoing at more than 100 leading sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, South
Korea, Australia and New Zealand.
 
* Interim safety analysis. Sunesis expects a planned interim safety analysis of VALOR by the
trial's independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to occur in June, 2013.

LI-1

* First interim analyses. Sunesis anticipates the first planned interim assessments of the LI-1
trial following enrollment of 50 patients per vosaroxin treatment arm, which are expected to occur
in 2013. Currently, various treatment options are being evaluated in a randomized Phase 3 design
with key endpoints including complete remission (CR), 12 month survival, and overall survival.
Treatment arms that are exhibiting promising results are expected to continue enrolling up to a
total of 200 patients enrolled per arm.

Vosaroxin

* Initiation of investigator sponsored trials. Sunesis is evaluating additional indications and
trials, and expects to support the initiation of additional investigator sponsored trials in MDS
and AML at leading centers in 2013.
 
* Expansion of the Intellectual Property Estate. Sunesis expects to secure additional patents in
2013, with the goal of supporting the Company's vosaroxin global patent estate and intellectual
property strategy. The Company's multi-layered patent portfolio currently supports market
exclusivity for vosaroxin to 2030 in the US, and beyond 2025 in multiple geographies around the
world.

Kinase Inhibitor Program

* Continued progress with partnered kinase inhibitor programs. Sunesis currently has partnered
kinase inhibitor programs in oncology with Millennium Pharmaceuticals and immunology with Biogen
Idec.

About VALOR

About Vosaroxin

Vosaroxin is a first-in-class anti-cancer quinolone derivative (AQD), a class of compounds that
has not been used previously for the treatment of cancer. Vosaroxin both intercalates DNA and
inhibits topoisomerase II, resulting in replication-dependent, site-selective DNA damage, G2
arrest and apoptosis. Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Commission
have granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.
Additionally, vosaroxin has been granted fast track designation by the FDA for the potential
treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia in combination with cytarabine.

About AML 

AML is a rapidly progressing cancer of the blood characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation
of immature blast cells in the bone marrow. The American Cancer Society estimates there were
approximately 13,780 new cases of AML and 10,200 deaths from AML in the U.S. in 2012. 
Additionally, it is estimated that the prevalence of AML across major global markets (U.S.,
France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and Japan) is over 50,000. AML is generally a
disease of older adults, and the median age of a patient diagnosed with AML is about 67 years. AML
patients with relapsed or refractory disease and newly diagnosed AML patients over 60 years of age
with poor prognostic risk factors typically die within one year, resulting in an acute need for
new treatment options for these patients.

About Sunesis Pharmaceuticals 

Sunesis is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new
oncology therapeutics for the treatment of solid and hematologic cancers. Sunesis has built a
highly experienced cancer drug development organization committed to advancing its lead product

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Jan 10 (Marketwire) -- 
Lattice Technology, Inc., an industry leader of technical communication
and digital mock up software for the manufacturing industry, today
announced the availability of their latest release of Lattice3D
Reporter(TM), v6. This product is a software plug-in that allows
manufacturing companies to quickly and easily embed ultra-lightweight,
interactive versions of a 3D CAD model and related part information into
any Microsoft(R) Excel(R) file. 

    The 3D embedded information may include multiple bills of materials
(eBOM, mBOM, sBOM), work instructions, assembly animations and 3D
interactive snapshots. Unlike comparable solutions, the embedded 3D
models are accurate for measurement and other functions. One of the key
features of Lattice3D Reporter is that templates automate the publishing
process, allowing users to define how models and their associated
information will be represented in Excel. This solution is powered by the
industry's most compressed, secure and accurate 3D format -- XVL
developed by Lattice Technology. 

    The embedded Excel files may be viewed with Excel using the free Lattice
Technology plug-in, Lattice3D Reporter Viewer(TM). Using this plug-in,
anyone can review and interrogate interactive 3D models and their
associated information via Excel, one of the most commonly used
information tools. The result is immediate improvement in communication,
accuracy and time-to-market.

    "Lattice3D Reporter is a leap forward for the manufacturing industry
because it provides unprecedented clarity of information across the
extended enterprise," stated Bill Barnes, Lattice Technology general
manager for Americas and Europe. "By combining the industry's most
lightweight, accurate 3D format with a tool as ubiquitous as Excel, we
deliver an easy to use solution that provides invaluable data to anyone
inside or outside of the company."

    The latest version of Lattice3D Reporter enables even greater
productivity, ease of use and communication with updates to the following
key features: 


--  Powerful lightweight format -- All 3D graphics load quickly, allowing
    users to locate a part visually, instead of remembering long numeric
    IDs. Thumbnail "snapshots" give users alternate perspectives, assembly
    relationships or animated instructions.
--  Expanded Excel toolset for 3D -- Build 3D spreadsheets within Excel,
    saving all information with the ".xls" extension. Information can be
    used in an interactive 3D environment or printed in 2D, giving users
    unprecedented flexibility.
--  Automated updates of spreadsheets -- When engineering data is updated
    and released, previously created spreadsheets are automatically
    updated, saving time and eliminating the possibility of costly errors.
--  Integration with existing IT infrastructures -- 3D data from
    engineering is rapidly integrated into existing ERP, PLM and other IT
    infrastructures, improving productivity and communication throughout
    the extended enterprise.

    

KCMA Corporation (Kawasaki Construction Machines,
www.kawasakiloaders.com) fabricates and assembles front loader heavy
equipment in their plant in Newnan, Georgia. When a joint-venture
resulted in a total redesign of all their models, KCMA implemented
Lattice3D Reporter to shorten the learning curve, reduce assembly time
and ensure quality as workers implemented the new designs.

    "Using Lattice3D Reporter, we have seen a forty percent reduction in
start-up assembly time for new products at our plant," explained Tony
Endo, Assistant for Vice President at KCMA. "In addition to saving time,
the 3D models and related parts lists help us maintain the high quality
standards of Kawasaki products." 

    Lattice3D Reporter is a Microsoft Excel plug-in which is available for
purchase as a floating or node-locked license. Lattice3D Reporter Viewer
is an Excel plug-in available as a free download from the Lattice
Technology website.

&lt;p&gt;What do ATM machines, the Universal Barcode system and a fact-finding computer that won jeopardy have in common?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to an IBM spokesperson, these inventions began with a patent&#160;secured by the company&#8217;s scientists. For the 20th consecutive year, the computer services company has held its ground as the king of patents &#8212; it acquired 6,478 in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is in no small part due to increasing contributions from research teams abroad. Nearly 30 percent of IBM&#8217;s patients were produced by researchers outside of the U.S., an eight percent jump from 2010.&#160;Israel, Japan, Canada, and Germany are among the company&#8217;s most productive countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, its patent count exceeded the combined totals of Accenture, Amazon, Apple, EMC, HP, Intel, Oracle, and Symantec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racking up patents is a smart strategy. It yields about $1 billion per year in licensing revenue and reduces the risk of being sued as the company moves into new territory, such as analytics and &#8220;big data.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big data is a buzzword used to describe the growing volume, complexity, and variety of data companies are accumulating. With global research firm Gartner projecting that big data will help drive IT spending to $3.8 trillion in 2014, it&#8217;s no surprise that IBM is making moves in this space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to IBM, 300 of the patents secured this year would foster innovation in the emerging big data analytics market. The company has made a name for itself in the field with its machine learning patented invention, which was implemented in &#8220;The Watson system&#8221;, a smart question-answering computer. In October, Watson hit the headlines for securing a place at medical school, where it was fed test questions from the United States Medical Licensing Exam. As VentureBeat reported, Watson is currently being positioned as a smarter successor to Apple&#8217;s Siri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1993, the company has received nearly 67,000 patents. It currently boasts a team of about 8,000 scientists residing in 35 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most concretely, our 2012 patent record and the two decades of leadership it extends are a testament to thousands of brilliant IBM inventors &#8212; the living embodiments of our devotion to innovation that matters, for our clients, for our company, and for the world,&#8221; said Ginni Rometty, IBM&#8217;s chairman and CEO in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to IFT Patent Services, the top patent-acquirers in 2012 are as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Big Data, Business, Deals, Enterprise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MADRID (Reuters) - StormHarbour, a small investment bank specializing in the financial sector, has opened an office in Spain and hired a former top executive at Goldman Sachs as an adviser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm said on Thursday that Juan del Rivero, a 23-year veteran of Goldman Sachs and formerly chairman for Spain and Portugal at the bank, would join as a senior adviser, working with Gonzalo Chocano, head of Spanish origination in its newly-launched Madrid base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;StormHarbour, established in 2009, focuses on sales and trading and capital markets advisory, working closely with financial institution clients.

&lt;p&gt;* Launch sought by March 2014 in NSE's third foray abroad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* NSE's Japan move signals growing foreign interest in India&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Rafael Nam and Abhishek Vishnoi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI, Jan 10 (Reuters) - India's National Stock Exchange
and Japan Exchange Group will seek to launch yen-denominated
futures based on the Nifty index of Indian stocks, the bourse
operators said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They plan to launch the new contracts on the Osaka
Securities Exchange by next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchanges signed a letter of intent to prepare for the
launch of S CNX Nifty index futures by March 2014, when the
OSE is expected to complete its derivatives markets integration
with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, they said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would mark the Indian exchange's third global venture,
as it seeks to take advantage of rising foreign interest in
Indian equities to overtake older rival BSE Ltd, whose narrower
stock index competes against the NSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSE already offers Nifty futures trading at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, part of CME Group Inc, and the far
more popular futures and options trading at the Singapore
Exchange (SGX) listed on the Singapore Exchange Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yen-denominated S CNX Nifty futures contracts will help
investors in Japan to effectively diversify their portfolios in
their own currency," said Ravi Narain, CEO of NSE, according to
the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volumes for U.S. dollar-denominated Nifty futures and
options have surged at the Singapore Exchange in recent years as
foreign investors look to avoid higher taxes in India, including
most recently a proposal to crack down on investments via tax
havens such as Mauritius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SGX had 339,605 outstanding Nifty futures index contracts as
of Wednesday, slightly above the 334,900 contracts in India,
according to data from the Singapore Exchange and NSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign investments into domestic stocks reached a net
$24.55 billion in Indian equities last year, as valuations
tumbled after a rough 2011 and markets welcomed fiscal and
economic reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those flows helped send the NSE's main Nifty stock index
 up 27.7 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Going by the trend of SGX Nifty, I do believe quite a good
amount of participation would come in this instrument too," said
Yogesh Radke, head of quantitative research at Edelweiss
Securities Ltd in Mumbai, said of the new contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he added: "Huge positions have already shifted to SGX
which is not good for Indian markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSE, partly owned by Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse
 and the Singapore Exchange, already dominates
derivatives trading in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchange handled 106.2 million contracts in domestic
stock index futures in January-November last year versus 8.9
million contracts on the BSE, according to data from the World
Federation of Exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third exchange, MCX-SX, is expected to launch equities
trading later this month while BSE is looking to regain its
competitiveness by working on an initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSE is also looking to list some time this year, although it
has yet to appoint underwriters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Jan 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
has hired veteran oil trader Quek Chin Thean to head its
commodities trading team in Asia-Pacific, a spokeswoman for the
Wall Street bank said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointment of Quek comes as investment banks are under
pressure to comply with stringent Dodd-Frank regulations aimed
at limiting excessive risk-taking by banks after the 2008
financial crisis, while struggling to keep their market share in
the lucrative commodities market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perhaps Goldman is contemplating going back into physical
oil trading in a big way as a strategy post Dodd-Frank," said an
oil industry observer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Dodd-Frank act has really got the U.S. banks at its
sides. They have to recast their activities to comply with it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quek will be based in Singapore and is due to start in
March, Goldman spokeswoman Connie Ling said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said in October significantly lower revenues from
commodities dragged down its trading businesses in the third
quarter, singling out weak performance by a unit that had once
been a pride of Wall Street's biggest investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade in physical markets helps to ease the impact of the
regulation and provides a buffer to the bank's business model
that has been hit by generally lower interest in derivatives
trade over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has developed a physical metals trading desk in the
past few years and already owns warehousing operations licensed
by the London Metal Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, Quek resigned from his position as the chief
executive of Chinese oil trader Brightoil Petroleum (Holdings)
Ltd's Singapore unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quek, previously global head of fuel oil trading at BP
, moved with his team to Brightoil in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the two years at Brightoil, Quek and his fuel oil team
dominated the fuel oil derivatives market in Singapore, trading
a total volume of 17.27 million tonnes in the year to June 2012,
more than double that of its nearest rival BP at 8.72 million
tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brightoil also became the second-largest bunker supplier by
volume in Singapore in 2011, according to the Maritime Port
Authority of Singapore. But its profits fell, with some analysts
saying the company's expansion moves came too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

running and mentorship

BLOOMFIELD, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
Philadelphia teenagers Alexander Alford, Isaiah Gordon, Amanda Millatt, Isaac
Patterson, Alexander Patrick and Jennifer Wright are the group of six Students
Run Philly Style athletes being sponsored by the Cigna Foundation to run the
Half Marathon race in the Walt Disney World Marathon Weekend Presented by Cigna,
January 10-13, 2013 near Orlando, Fla. Students Run Philly Style (SRPS) is a 9
year old non-profit organization which serves Philadelphia students ages 12 to
18 by helping them develop values and accomplish goals through the sport of
running.

World Half Marathon on Saturday, January 12, 2013. (Photo: Cigna)

Whether it was trying to combat obesity, overcome bullying or just interest in a
free pair of sneakers that brought these kids into the program, once they
joined, they all made a commitment to live three values: courage, effort and
respect. SRPS pairs each student with an adult mentor, called a running leader,
who teaches them about character development, leadership skills and goal-setting
through training to become a marathon runner. 

In a city with soaring youth violence and over 50 percent of the children being
overweight or at high risk of becoming overweight, SRPS provides a safe, active
after-school activity led by caring, committed adults. Through a very physically
challenging training program, the running leaders are able to teach the students
to become strong, long-distance runners and strong, positive young people. 

Cigna has an established collaborative relationship with Students Run Philly
Style through support from employee volunteers and the Cigna Foundation. The
sponsorship of the SRPS athletes to bring these young people to the Walt Disney
World Marathon Weekend is part of Cigna's commitment to child wellness as one of
the key focus areas of Cigna's newly revised corporate responsibility program,
Cigna Connects. 

SRPS member Isaiah Gordon explains, "What got me interested in SRPS was a video
I saw about a boy who lost over 30 pounds running. I used to be obese and had
bad asthma. I decided to give SRPS a shot. It changed my life." Cigna manager
and SRPS running leader, Cedric Edwards, has found the program life changing
too. Edwards saw a presentation at work on the program and was so impressed he
signed up immediately to serve as a running leader. The only problem was Edwards
wasn`t a runner. "I figured none of these kids were runners when they joined
either, so I wasn`t going to let that stop me. I`m so glad I made that decision.
Being involved with the SRPS kids has been transformational&#8230;for me and them.
I`ve seen how the simple activity of running-a sport anyone can do anywhere-can
make young people stronger physically and emotionally. This program really
creates leaders as much as it does marathon runners," says Edwards. 

Isaac Patterson, who`s been a member of SRPS for three years, shares, "I joined
SRPS just for the free pair of sneakers (a pair of Nike`s that I don`t wear
anymore-out of style). But the more I got into the program, the more I realized
how good it was to be recognized and to feel accomplished." Patterson goes on to
explain, "I was bullied all my life before 8th grade. I never felt accomplished
then. The bullying ended around 8th grade, and I began to gain a lot more
confidence after completing running races and going to a few SRPS Leadership
Summit camps. I still love the free sneakers. But I also love the positive
atmosphere, the races we run and the people we meet. This will be my first time
going to Walt Disney World!" 

In all, nearly 65,000 runners are expected to compete in various events
throughout the weekend. The Disney Marathon Weekend presented by Cigna will
again feature Kids` Races throughout the weekend, including the Mickey Mile, the
Half Marathon on Saturday and the Marathon on Sunday in addition to the Family
Fun Run 5K. There is also Goofy`s Race and a Half Challenge which involves
running the half marathon and the full marathon - a total of 39.3 miles. 2013
marks the 20th anniversary of Walt Disney World Marathon Weekend and brings new
features, routes and entertainment to the event. The Health and Fitness Expo
runs throughout the weekend at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex and features
the latest in running technology and fashion.

&lt;p&gt;http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20130111:nBw115824a

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded 10 classes and affirmed 22 classes of J.P. Morgan
Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMCC) commercial mortgage
pass-through certificates series 2007-LDP10 due to increased loss expectations
on the specially serviced loans and further deterioration of loan performance. A
detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release. 

KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Fitch modeled losses of 20.4% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the
original pool balance total 20.1%, including 2.6% to date. Fitch has designated
93 loans (49.8%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 33 specially serviced
assets (21.9%). 

As of the December 2012 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal
balance has been reduced by 14.7% to $4.55 billion from $5.33 billion at
issuance. No loans have defeased since issuance. Interest shortfalls are
currently affecting classes A-JS through NR. 

The largest contributor to expected losses is the specially-serviced One Skyline
Tower loan (4.5% of the pool), which is secured by eight office buildings in
Falls Church, VA. This loan transferred to special servicing in March 2012 for
imminent default. The sponsor, Vornado, cited the Base Realignment and Closure
statute (BRAC), as contributing to recent and upcoming vacancies at the
properties. In addition, the sponsor has indicated that there may be significant
capital required to re-tenant the properties. The pari passu loan is under a
forbearance agreement as of November 2012. 

The next largest contributor to expected losses is the specially-serviced
StratREAL Industrial Portfolio II loan (3.3%), which is secured by a portfolio
of 10 industrial properties located in Tennessee, Ohio, and California. During
2010 and 2011, the portfolio lost several major tenants due to tenant lease
expiries and termination options. The loan was transferred to special servicing
in December 2012 for imminent default. The portfolio's combined occupancy is
67%; as such, the properties are not generating enough cash flow to support the
debt service. 

The third largest contributor to expected losses is the specially-serviced
Solana loan (3.1%), which is secured by an office complex located in Westlake,
TX. The pari passu loan was transferred to special servicing in March 2009 for
imminent default and has since been modified. The reported occupancy is
approximately 67%. The latest reported appraisal from May 2012 indicates a value
significantly below the loan amount. 

Fitch downgrades the following classes as indicated, and has assigned or revised
Recovery Estimates (REs): 

--$359 million class A-M to 'Bsf' from 'BBBsf', Outlook Negative;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's 
investment-management arm is telling clients that the best place
to put their money this year is in stocks of U.S. banks, even
after their recent run-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Goldman Sachs' wealth management arm is
advising investors looking for higher returns to shun U.S.
Treasuries, most other bonds and even hedge funds, warning that
most hedge funds will generate only mid-single-digit returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will be lower returns across all asset classes,"
Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman
Sachs' investment strategy group, told a press briefing on
Friday. "We think this is a very important message, but not
everyone likes to hear it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment strategy group has been advising clients to
put their money in bank stocks for two years. The firm said it
made that investment its top pick for 2013 because the
low-interest-rate environment has rendered financial stocks
particularly undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have been shunning big bank stocks for years,
citing a weak economy, volatile markets and new regulations that
have clamped down on earnings potential. Until a recent rally
begun toward the end of 2012, shares of some of the largest U.S.
banks, including Goldman's own, were trading below the stated
value of assets on their balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But last year, bank stocks gained significant ground,
particularly in the final months of 2012. The SPDR S Bank ETF
, which Goldman's investment management team uses as a
basis for its investment thesis, rose 20 percent last year and
is up another 5 percent in the first few weeks of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some stocks included in the ETF, including Bank of America
Corp, more than doubled in price last year. The ETF,
which invests in a group of 41 U.S. commercial banks, counts
Citigroup Inc, SVB Financial Group, Ocwen
Financial Corp, Comerica Inc and Bank of America
as its top five holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's case for further growth in bank stocks in 2013 is
three-fold: attractive valuation, even after the rally;
potential for bigger dividends now that capital levels have
improved; and the idea that investors can use bank stocks as an
easy play on the housing recovery, since more than half of U.S.
banks' loan books are comprised of U.S. real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brett Nelson, a managing director in Goldman's investment
strategy group who presented the case for bank stocks, forecast
that banks will be able to reach an 11 percent return-on-equity
even with new regulations - less than their historical 15
percent return-on-equity but still better than single-digit
levels that banks have recently been reporting. Return-on-equity
is a measure of how much profit a company can wring from its
balance sheet; it is monitored closely by bank investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An 11 percent return-on-equity would imply a valuation of
1.4 times book value - still much higher than the level banks
are now trading at, which is roughly equal to the value of
assets on their books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the concern is that banks are becoming utilities
(because of new regulations), then that's fine," said Nelson,
noting that the utility sector has a 10 percent return-on-equity
and trades at 1.4 times book value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of capital banks can return to shareholders
through dividends this year will also be a big driver of stock
performance, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Banks will be the fastest grower of dividends," said
Nelson, who predicts that dividend yields in the sector will
exceed that of the S by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are expected to order JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to correct lapses in how it polices suspect money flows, two people familiar with the situation said, in the latest move by officials to force banks to tighten their anti money-laundering systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action against JPMorgan, which is expected as soon as Friday, would be in the form of a cease-and-desist order, which regulators use to force banks to improve compliance weaknesses, the sources said. JPMorgan will probably not have to pay a monetary penalty, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve are expected to issue a cease-and-desist order, the sources said. The Treasury Department's anti money-laundering unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, could take a separate action against the bank, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The status of the inquiry could change, and the timing of the action could extend to next week or later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators have been cracking down on lapses at banks on their anti money-laundering controls. Banks are supposed to flag suspect transactions from sanctioned countries or those from customers with ties to drug trafficking or terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's Standard Chartered Plc last year agreed to pay a total of $667 million to U.S. and state regulators to resolve anti-money laundering probes, while HSBC Holdings Plc, also headquartered in Britain, agreed in December to pay $1.9 billion to settle a U.S. inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency identified major lapses in compliance systems at U.S. bank Citigroup Inc, which did not pay a monetary penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inquiry on JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, dates back several months, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first public signs that JPMorgan had issues with its transaction monitoring systems emerged in August 2011. At that time JPMorgan agreed to pay $88.3 million to settle Treasury Department allegations that it engaged in prohibited transactions linked to Cuba and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the expected order said JPMorgan did not adequately fix dozens of anti-money laundering issues cited previously by regulators, forcing them to take formal action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the order, JPMorgan is expected to be required to bolster systems it uses to monitor risk and transactions, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators enforcing U.S. anti money-laundering laws are required to issue cease-and-desist orders when they instruct a bank to correct Bank Secrecy Act compliance deficiencies and the bank fails to do so in short order. What happens after that, however, varies according to the severity of the bank's violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms of a cease-and-desist order, in some cases, can require a bank to review its prior transactions to determine whether it missed any suspicious activity it should have reported to regulators. If a high enough number of unreported suspicious transactions are found, the regulators may decide to issue a civil money penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no immediate action is expected from U.S. prosecutors, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency typically informs the Justice Department when it undertakes inquiries of this sort, John Hawke, a former comptroller of the currency, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would think that if the agency gets to the point of issuing a cease-and-desist order that they've already been in touch with the Justice Department," said Hawke, who is now a partner at Arnold and Porter in Washington. He said he had no knowledge of the specific case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Carrick Mollenkamp and Emily Flitter of Reuters, and Brett Wolf of the Compliance Complete service Thomson Reuters Accelus; Additional reporting by Aruna Viswanatha; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Paritosh Bansal, Tim Dobbyn, Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do ATM machines, the Universal Barcode system and a fact-finding computer that won jeopardy have in common?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to an IBM spokesperson, these inventions began with a patent&#160;secured by the company&#8217;s scientists. For the 20th consecutive year, the computer services company has held its ground as the king of patents &#8212; it acquired 6,478 in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is in no small part due to increasing contributions from research teams abroad. Nearly 30 percent of IBM&#8217;s patients were produced by researchers outside of the U.S., an eight percent jump from 2010.&#160;Israel, Japan, Canada, and Germany are among the company&#8217;s most productive countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Efrat Kasznik,&#160;president of Silicon Valley based IP consulting firm&#160;Foresight Valuation Group, IBM has a lot of patents for three main reasons: it has been around for a long time, it invests billions of dollars annually in R, and it has an elaborate incentive system for its researchers to file for patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, IBM&#8217;s patent count exceeded the combined totals of Accenture, Amazon, Apple, EMC, HP, Intel, Oracle, and Symantec. On the top 10 list (see below), Asian technology giants like Samsung and Hon Hai are buying up thousands of patents. &#8220;This trend has major implications for US companies [with]&#160;foreign companies are entering the US patent market,&#8221; said Kasznik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racking up patents is a smart strategy. It yields about $1 billion per year in licensing revenue and reduces the risk of being sued as the company moves into new territory, such as analytics and &#8220;big data.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big data is a buzzword used to describe the growing volume, complexity, and variety of data companies are accumulating. With global research firm Gartner projecting that big data will help drive IT spending to $3.8 trillion in 2014, it&#8217;s no surprise that IBM is making moves in this space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to IBM, 300 of the patents secured this year would foster innovation in the emerging big data analytics market. The company has made a name for itself in the field with its machine learning patented invention, which was implemented in &#8220;The Watson system&#8221;, a smart question-answering computer. In October, Watson hit the headlines for securing a place at medical school, where it was fed test questions from the United States Medical Licensing Exam. As VentureBeat reported, Watson is currently being positioned as a smarter successor to Apple&#8217;s Siri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1993, the company has received nearly 67,000 patents. It currently boasts a team of about 8,000 scientists residing in 35 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most concretely, our 2012 patent record and the two decades of leadership it extends are a testament to thousands of brilliant IBM inventors &#8212; the living embodiments of our devotion to innovation that matters, for our clients, for our company, and for the world,&#8221; said Ginni Rometty, IBM&#8217;s chairman and CEO in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to IFI Patent Services, the top patent-acquirers in 2012 are as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Big Data, Business, Deals, Enterprise&lt;/p&gt;

Canada Issues Record Number of Visitor Visas from Chandigarh

AMRITSAR, INDIA--(Marketwire - Jan. 11, 2013) - Canada's Chandigarh office has
issued a record number of visitor visas in 2012, Citizenship, Immigration and
Multiculturalism Minister Jason Kenney announced today. 

In 2012, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) officials issued a record
number of visitor visas in India's Punjab region - approximately 17,608,
almost three times more than were issued in 2005. As well, approximately 80%
of visitor cases processed at missions in India in this year were finalized in
five days or less, a major improvement over the 12-day processing time over
the same period last year.

"I am pleased to announce that a record number of Indians from the Punjab
region visited Canada last year and that the percentage of applicants approved
for a visitor visa has increased significantly," Minister Kenney said. "As the
cultural and commercial ties between our countries grow, it is good news that
more Indians are visiting Canada under our faster, fairer immigration system."


Minister Kenney also highlighted that, with a 54% approval rate, Canada
continues to maintain record high levels of student permits issued to the
Punjab region. In 2012, Canada issued approximately 5,200 student permits from
Chandigarh, up from 173 in 2004 when the mission first opened.

The Minister also lauded the success of the new Super Visa for parents and
grandparents. Launched one year ago, the Super Visa is allows parents and
grandparents to visit their loved ones in Canada for as long as two years at a
time. There were over 3,700 Super Visas issued from CIC's Chandigarh mission
in 2012, with an approval rate of 80% and average processing times of less
than eight weeks. 

In addition to benefiting from recent changes to Canada's immigration system,
the record numbers are also due in part to good work by law enforcement
agencies in both Canada and India to detect and deter fraud. For example, in
December, Punjab updated the Prevention of Human Smuggling Act, which would
provide for a minimum three-year prison sentence for consultants who operate
without a licence or engage in other fraudulent activities. Less fraud means
higher approval rates and faster decisions. 

While in Amritsar, Minister Kenney met with the Chief Minister of Punjab,
Prakash Singh Badal, to discuss the progress of joint anti-fraud initiatives
in India.

"I wish to thank the Chief Minister and his officials for their continued
efforts to crack down on immigration fraud and eliminate illegal activity,"
said Minister Kenney. "International cooperation is a significant part of
CIC's strategy to eliminate fraud and make immigration faster for legitimate
refugees and permanent residents."

In addition to supporting anti-fraud efforts overseas, CIC has also
strengthened the rules governing immigration consultants in Canada. CIC now
has the authority to pass on any information regarding the misconduct of an
immigration consultant, a lawyer, a paralegal or a notary to the responsible
bodies that regulate them. 

In 2012, CIC introduced new regulations to prevent fraudsters using marriages
of convenience to gain entry to Canada. Newlywed sponsored spousesare now
required to live in a legitimate relationship with their sponsors for two
years from the day they receive their permanent resident status in Canada or
risk having their status revoked and being removed from Canada. And, even if
their marriage ends after two years, sponsored spouses must now wait five
years from the day they were granted permanent resident status before they can
apply to sponsor a new spouse of their own. 

"India continues to remain one of Canada's top source countries for immigrants
and visitors," Minister Kenney said. "These increased figures show that our
recent changes make it possible for a growing number of travelers to visit
Canada."

Building a stronger Canada: Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC)
strengthens Canada's economic, social and cultural prosperity, helping ensure
Canadian safety and security while managing one of the largest and most
generous immigration programs in the world.

&lt;p&gt;(Removes incorrect reference to Deutsche Boerse, Singapore
Exchange owning partial stake in NSE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Launch sought by March 2014 in NSE's third foray abroad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* NSE's Japan move signals growing foreign interest in India&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Rafael Nam and Abhishek Vishnoi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI, Jan 10 (Reuters) - India's National Stock Exchange
and Japan Exchange Group will seek to launch yen-denominated
futures based on the Nifty index of Indian stocks, the bourse
operators said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They plan to launch the new contracts on the Osaka
Securities Exchange by next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchanges signed a letter of intent to prepare for the
launch of S CNX Nifty index futures by March 2014, when the
OSE is expected to complete its derivatives markets integration
with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, they said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would mark the Indian exchange's third global venture,
as it seeks to take advantage of rising foreign interest in
Indian equities to overtake older rival BSE Ltd, whose narrower
stock index competes against the NSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSE already offers Nifty futures trading at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, part of CME Group Inc, and the far
more popular futures and options trading at the Singapore
Exchange (SGX) listed on the Singapore Exchange Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yen-denominated S CNX Nifty futures contracts will help
investors in Japan to effectively diversify their portfolios in
their own currency," said Ravi Narain, CEO of NSE, according to
the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volumes for U.S. dollar-denominated Nifty futures and
options have surged at the Singapore Exchange in recent years as
foreign investors look to avoid higher taxes in India, including
most recently a proposal to crack down on investments via tax
havens such as Mauritius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SGX had 339,605 outstanding Nifty futures index contracts as
of Wednesday, slightly above the 334,900 contracts in India,
according to data from the Singapore Exchange and NSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign investments into domestic stocks reached a net
$24.55 billion in Indian equities last year, as valuations
tumbled after a rough 2011 and markets welcomed fiscal and
economic reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those flows helped send the NSE's main Nifty stock index
 up 27.7 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Going by the trend of SGX Nifty, I do believe quite a good
amount of participation would come in this instrument too," said
Yogesh Radke, head of quantitative research at Edelweiss
Securities Ltd in Mumbai, said of the new contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he added: "Huge positions have already shifted to SGX
which is not good for Indian markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSE already dominates derivatives trading in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchange handled 106.2 million contracts in domestic
stock index futures in January-November last year versus 8.9
million contracts on the BSE, according to data from the World
Federation of Exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third exchange, MCX-SX, is expected to launch equities
trading later this month while BSE is looking to regain its
competitiveness by working on an initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSE is also looking to list some time this year, although it
has yet to appoint underwriters.

witnessed in the Global Data Center Outsourcing market is the emergence of
vendor-neutral service providers. There are many service providers that
integrate the best solutions for various vendors to provide the most efficient
services to end-users. The main advantage of using a neutral vendor is that
equipment and services can be procured from different vendors across the
industry to formulate the best solution possible. As enterprises are nowadays
procuring equipment and solutions from different vendors, there is a growing
need for vendor-neutral service providers to manage these assembled
facilities.'' 

According to the report, nowadays, data center outsourcing is being increasingly
adopted by enterprises to reduce their operational costs and also to increase
their efficiency. Enterprises across the globe are in need of options that can
reduce the burden of data center management and can also help attain enhanced
operational efficiency. Data center outsourcing facilitates better usage of
internal resources such as human resources, enterprise capital, and time.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/mwvzrl/global_ophthalmic) has
announced the addition of the "Global Ophthalmic Drugs Market 2011-2015" report
to their offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Ophthalmic Drugs market to grow at a
CAGR of 9.98 percent over the period 2011-2015. One of the key factors
contributing to this market growth is the increase in prevalence of eye
disorders. The Global Ophthalmic Drugs market has also been witnessing the trend
of increased focus on combination therapies. However, the low patient compliance
could pose a challenge to the growth of this market. 

This report has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs
from industry experts. The report covers the Americas, and the EMEA and APAC
regions; it also covers the Global Ophthalmic Drugs market landscape and its
growth prospects in the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of
the key vendors operating in this market.

The key vendors dominating this market space are

Alcon Inc., Allergan, Inc., Merck and Co., Inc., Novartis AG, and Pfizer Inc. 

Key questions answered in this report:

- What will the market size be in 2015 and what will the growth rate be? 

- What are the key market trends? 

- What is driving this market? 

- What are the challenges to market growth? 

- Who are the key vendors in this market space? 

- What are the market opportunities and threats faced by the key vendors? 

- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the key vendors? 

You can request one free hour of analyst time when you purchase this report.
Details provided within the report.

Executive Summary:

Commenting on the report, an analyst said: "There is an increase in the use of
fixed-combination therapies for the treatment of glaucoma. Combination therapies
significantly improve compliance by reducing the number and frequency of eye
drop applications. The vendors in the Global Ophthalmic Drugs market are
focusing more on the development of combination therapies. This is evident from
the strong pipeline of combination therapies. Combination therapies are expected
to reduce inflammation, the possibility of choroidal neovascularization, and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression." 

According to the report, one of the key drivers is the increasing prevalence of
eye disorders such as macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy (DR), and
presbyopia in the elderly population. Moreover, incidences of glaucoma and
cataracts are increasing every year. Massive numbers of people worldwide suffer
from glaucoma, and this number is expected to further increase by 2020. Across
the globe, many people are estimated to suffer from age-related macular
degeneration (AMD). The incidence of AMD is expected to increase significantly
during the forecast period. 

Further, the report reveals that one of the key challenges in this market is low
patient compliance. 

The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary
information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report
contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT
analysis of the key vendors.

&lt;p&gt;http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20130113:nGNXUWYHTa

SARASOTA, Fla., Jan. 13, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sarasota cosmetic dentist Dr. Peter Rubenstein
offers Invisalign as a treatment option for straightening teeth. The treatment corrects
overcrowding, overbites and mild to moderate spacing problems. According to Dr. Rubenstein, adult
and teen patients prefer this option since the clear aligners are virtually invisible. The aligner
can be removed when eating, drinking, brushing teeth and flossing. This discreet
teeth-straightening option has minimal impact on a patient's lifestyle, while still achieving the
same results as braces. Dr. Rubenstein says that the cost for both treatments is similar.

Prestige Dental, a general and cosmetic dentistry practice serving patients in Sarasota, Osprey
and Venice, reports that Invisalign is an increasing popular option for straightening teeth.

"Invisalign
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10017872=3=Invisalign=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prestigedentalsarasota.com%2Finvisalign-cosmetic-dentistry-in-sarasota.html
 is a comfortable, convenient and effective option for straightening teeth," said Dr. Rubenstein.
"The clear aligners are virtually invisible, making this a discreet choice for adults and teens."

The aligners are made from a smooth, comfortable plastic. There are no visible brackets or metal
hardware on the teeth. This means there are no sharp metal pieces that can irritate the cheeks and
gums.

"Many of our patients compare wearing aligners to wearing thin, custom-molded teeth whitening
trays," said the dentist
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10017872=5=dentist=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prestigedentalsarasota.com%2F
. "This is an ideal choice for adults who do not want to draw attention to their cosmetic dental
procedures. Teens are less likely to be self-conscious with these aligners."

Patients can remove the device whenever they want for eating, brushing and flossing teeth.
Removing the aligners while eating and brushing makes it easier for teens to keep their teeth
clean. This helps reduce the risk for cavities.

"The average cost for both braces and Invisalign is similar," said Dr. Rubenstein "Both treatments
can correct spacing, a cross bite, overbite or underbite. However, when choosing an option for
straightening teeth, I remind patients they need to choose an option that works best for their
lifestyle. The end result may be straighter teeth, but the process of achieving this result should
complement what is more convenient for them."

As an additional benefit, Dr. Rubenstein says that office visits are also less frequent. Patients
with braces must visit their orthodontist at least once every month. Dr. Rubenstein typically sees
Invisalign patients every six weeks for new trays as teeth shift. This is easier for adult
patients with a busy work or travel schedule.

Prestige Dental provides general and cosmetic dentistry for the entire family, including teens and
adults. Cosmetic dentistry

&lt;p&gt;* Findings include weak risk controls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Orders do not requirement payments from bank&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Orders do not name individuals at fault&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Henry and Aruna Viswanatha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. banking
regulators on Monday ordered JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to
tighten its risk controls after the bank lost billions of
dollars due to bad bets from a trader known as the "London
Whale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency issued the consent orders which levy no monetary
penalties and place no specific blame on any individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, JPMorgan and its board agreed to submit an
improvement plan to the Fed within 60 days, including taking
risk outcomes into account when considering top executives' pay
packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate action, the banking regulators also ordered
JPMorgan to improve its compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and
anti-money laundering requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OCC began asking JPMorgan last April about its
derivatives trades after press reports described contracts
arranged by a London-based bank trader, nicknamed the London
Whale by hedge funds for the size of the positions he took.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which reports its fourth-quarter earnings on
Wednesday, ultimately lost $6.2 billion on the trades, saw its
reputation and stock price badly damaged, and for six months
lost government approval to buy back its own stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday's enforcement actions remove one small cloud hanging
over the bank, but it still faces probes from the U.S.
Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Financial Services Authority issued a statement on
Monday saying it is also continuing to investigate the trading
losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan neither admitted nor denied the findings. Spokesman
Joe Evangelisti said the company "has been working hard to fully
remediate the issues" cited by the regulators over the losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evangelisti added that complying with anti-money laundering
responsibilities "is a top priority."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have already made progress addressing the issues cited
in the consent orders, which contain no allegations of
intentional misconduct by the firm or any of its employees,"
Evangelisti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMPROVING PAY PACKAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public filings from the two regulators do not include
names of bank officials or details of who the investigators
believe did what wrong to lose the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed order, besides concluding that there were
deficiencies in risk controls, said broadly that senior
management had failed to bring problems with the trades to the
attention of members of the company's board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan pay contracts include so-called "clawback"
provisions to take back compensation from executives after
losses, the Fed order requires JPMorgan directors to consider
"further enhancements to the firm's compensation processes for
senior executives," including ones that factor in poor risk
controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed also puts new reporting requirements on the company,
including quarterly progress reports on compliance with the
order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaret Seiberg, senior policy analyst at Guggenheim
Securities, said despite the lack of monetary penalties, the
enforcement action still shows that regulators are turning up
the heat on risk management systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think that detracts from the overall message here,"
Seiberg said about absence of any fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONEY-LAUNDERING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators have also been cracking down recently on
lapses at banks on their anti money-laundering controls. Banks
are supposed to flag suspect transactions from sanctioned
countries or those from customers with ties to drug trafficking
or terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's Standard Chartered Plc last year agreed
to pay a total of $667 million to U.S. and state regulators to
resolve anti-money laundering probes, while HSBC Holdings Plc
, also headquartered in Britain, agreed in December to
pay $1.9 billion to settle a U.S. inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, the OCC identified major lapses in compliance
systems at U.S. bank Citigroup Inc, which did not pay a
monetary penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anti-money laundering inquiry of JPMorgan, the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, dates back several months, Reuters reported
last week in a story that said an enforcement action was
expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the regulators continue to comb through JPMorgan's
anti-money laundering system, they could find additional lapses
and issue a monetary penalty, said Peter Djinis, a former
Treasury official who helped develop some U.S. anti-money
laundering regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the bank does not face a monetary penalty, it is
likely to be forced to spend millions of dollars on bolstering
its anti-money laundering program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can't do this on the cheap," Djinis said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial mentions how Coca-Cola sells about 180 low- and no-calorie drinks, works to produce better-tasting low-calorie sweeteners and has introduced smaller can sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also reminds viewers that "all calories count no matter where they come from" and that "if you eat and drink more calories than you burn off, you'll gain weight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time Coca-Cola has used advertising to address this issue, but it is a first for television.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. federal energy regulators on Monday extended the amount of time available to decide if they will grant a rehearing against JPMorgan that would temporarily suspend the bank's energy desk from trading in a segment of the power market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) temporarily banned JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's J.P.

In the first three quarters of 2012, the bank sold about $1.4 billion of physical power, according to a Reuters analysis of the FERC power sales data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan stuck with power trading while other banks reduced their exposure to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for the decline. Power prices have fallen to 10-year lows across most of the United States thanks to an abundance of cheap natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With decades worth of cheap fuel ahead, fewer utilities have been looking to hedge their output; tough new capital requirements and regulations banning proprietary deals have cut into commodity trading; and some European banks, facing a persistent debt crisis back home, have fled dollar-intensive businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many bankers and analysts see another cause for the pull-back by banks: the risk that a more aggressive FERC may target them for anything suggestive of nefarious trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some in the power industry feel FERC's sanction against JPMorgan could drive the bank to reduce its exposure to the power market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Scott DiSavino; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Sofina Mirza-Reid)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* FERC does not say when it will decide on rehearing
    * FERC to block JPMorgan from some power trading
    * Banks reduced exposure to power markets since 2008


    By Scott DiSavino
    Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. federal energy regulators on Monday
extended the amount of time available to decide if they will
grant a rehearing against JPMorgan that would temporarily
suspend the bank's energy desk from trading in a segment of the
power market.
    In November, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) temporarily banned JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp energy arm from trading power at
market-based rates for six months, starting in April, for
failing to disclose information in a market manipulation
investigation.
    FERC has not accused the U.S. bank of market manipulation.
JPMorgan has said it would fight the sanction.
    Market-based rate authority allows a company to trade power
at whatever price the market will bear.
    Mary O'Driscoll, a spokeswoman at FERC, told Reuters
JPMorgan asked for a rehearing and this order gives the
commission more time to decide on that request. She said the
order does not impose any date on the commission to make a
decision.
    Officials at JPMorgan were not immediately available for
comment.
    The FERC sanction does not affect the bank's ability to
trade derivatives, futures, natural gas and other commodities.
This sanction only bans JPMorgan from trading physical power at
market-based rates.
    In a separate but related action, O'Driscoll said FERC on
Friday filed an appeal in federal court in Washington of a
magistrate's ruling in November blocking FERC from seeing
redacted portions of emails the regulator requested as part of
its investigation into possible market manipulation by the bank
in California and the Midwest.
    FERC sued JPMorgan over the summer to get the redacted
portions of the emails. But the bank said the information was
confidential.
    
    BANKS REDUCE POWER EXPOSURE
    As other banks have reduced their power trading over the
past few years since the Great Recession began in 2007, JPMorgan
continued to trade large amounts of physical power, according to
data submitted to FERC.
    In U.S. power markets, JPMorgan's physical electricity sales
reached $3 billion in 2008, $2.9 billion in 2009, $2.8 billion
in 2010 and almost $3 billion in 2011. In the first three
quarters of 2012, the bank sold about $1.4 billion of physical
power, according to a Reuters analysis of the FERC power sales
data.
    JPMorgan stuck with power trading while other banks reduced
their exposure to the market.
    There are many reasons for the decline. Power prices have
fallen to 10-year lows across most of the United States thanks
to an abundance of cheap natural gas. See 
    With decades worth of cheap fuel ahead, fewer utilities have
been looking to hedge their output; tough new capital
requirements and regulations banning proprietary deals have cut
into commodity trading; and some European banks, facing a
persistent debt crisis back home, have fled dollar-intensive
businesses.
    But many bankers and analysts see another cause for the
pull-back by banks: the risk that a more aggressive FERC may
target them for anything suggestive of nefarious trading.
    Some in the power industry feel FERC's sanction against
JPMorgan could drive the bank to reduce its exposure to the
power market.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 14 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co will air a two-minute
commercial on a U.S. cable television news show on Monday that
highlights its efforts in fighting obesity, as the soft drink
industry faces increasing pressure from local governments and
critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercial, which will air on CNN during The Situation
Room with Wolf Blitzer, mentions how Coca-Cola sells about 180
low- and no-calorie drinks, works to produce better-tasting
low-calorie sweeteners and has introduced smaller can sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also reminds viewers that "all calories count no matter
where they come from" and that "if you eat and drink more
calories than you burn off, you'll gain weight".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another commercial, which talks about Coke's
front-of-package calorie labels, will debut on Wednesday during
the popular "American Idol" television show on Fox, which has
partnered with Coke, the world's largest soft drink maker, for
some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time Coca-Cola has addressed the issue
with advertising, but the prime-time TV commercials seem like "a
full-blown exercise in damage control," said Michael Jacobson,
executive director of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest and an outspoken critic of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're trying to pretend they're part of the solution
instead of part of the problem," Jacobson said. If Coke was
serious about wanting to be part of the solution, Jacobson said,
it could stop advertising full-calorie drinks altogether, set up
a pricing scheme where full-calorie drinks were more expensive,
or stop opposing proposed soda taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke's commercials come as New York City prepares for an
upcoming ban on the sale of sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces
in places like restaurants, movie theaters and stadiums. In
November, voters in two California cities rejected ballot
measures for soda taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, which is also a big sponsor of the Olympics and
other sporting events, spent about $610 million on advertising
in 2011, according to Brad Adgate at Horizon Media Inc, citing
figures from Advertising Age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Idol is one of the costliest TV shows for
advertisers, according to the latest annual survey by
Advertising Age. The survey, released in October, found that the
average cost of a 30-second spot on Wednesday's edition of the
show was $340,825.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. federal energy regulators on Monday
extended the amount of time available to decide if they will
grant a rehearing in the proceeding against JPMorgan that would
temporarily suspend the bank's energy desk from trading in a
segment of the power market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) temporarily banned JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp energy trading arm from trading
power at market-based rates for six months, starting in April,
for failing to disclose information in a market manipulation
investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FERC has not accused the U.S. bank of market manipulation.
JPMorgan has said it would fight the sanction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market-based rate authority allows a company to trade power
at whatever price the market will bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary O'Driscoll, a spokeswoman at FERC, told Reuters
JPMorgan asked for a rehearing and this order gives the
commission more time to decide on that request. She said the
order does not impose any date on the commission to make a
decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at JPMorgan were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FERC sanction does not affect the bank's ability to
trade derivatives, futures, natural gas and other commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As other banks have reduced their power trading over the

continued to trade large amounts of physical power, according to

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman veteran has ability to work across bank-insiders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Schwartz seen as capable risk manager&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Increasing profitability will be Schwartz's first
challenge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Schwartz starts as CFO end-January after Viniar retires&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Carrick Mollenkamp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 14 (Reuters) - In 2004, Harvey Schwartz, who was then
head of the financing business at Goldman Sachs Group Inc's
 investment bank, came up with a new way for the bank to
make money from a seemingly mundane activity: helping companies
buy back their shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He created a product that could save companies money by
getting them improved pricing on buybacks while generating fees
and trading profits for the bank. To build what became a
multibillion-dollar market, Schwartz had to convince dozens of
skeptical Goldman sales people, derivatives traders, corporate
finance specialists and lawyers that they could make buybacks
more enticing, said Martin Chavez, a Goldman quantitative
analyst who worked with Schwartz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said, 'I know the details are going to be immensely
complicated, and it's going to seem impossible. But there is a
solution here. We're all going to work until we figure it out,'"
Chavez recalled Schwartz as saying. "And when Harvey says that,
people listen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of this month, Schwartz will need many more to
listen when he takes over as Goldman's chief financial officer
from David Viniar, the firm's long-time finance chief who is
seen by insiders, analysts and investors as a tough act to
follow. Viniar, 57, will remain a Goldman director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Schwartz, 48, who has so far worked in relative
anonymity as co-head of the firm's securities and trading unit,
fills those shoes could have far-reaching impact on Goldman's
outlook and even its culture. After 15 years of selling products
to clients and inventing ways to generate revenue for the firm,
Schwartz will now be responsible for reining in risk-takers and
worrying about costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of Goldman's 32,600 employees will report to
Schwartz, including staff in finance, accounting, legal and
technology. As CFO, he will have a vast and diverse portfolio,
overseeing everything from the bank's $949 billion balance sheet
to risk-management and Goldman's relations with analysts,
investors and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NITTY-GRITTY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz declined to comment for this article. But
interviews with Goldman executives who know the incoming CFO
give insights into why the bank picked him for the job and what
he may do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many respects Schwartz is like Viniar, the executives
said. Schwartz is a capable risk-manager who is expected to
maintain Viniar's cautious stance on risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said Schwartz understands the nitty-gritty of complex
finance and is also able to speak in plain English in front of
investors and clients. He already commands respect within the
firm and is beginning to build a following outside, having met
with investors and analysts dozens of times over the past year,
they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Schwartz has never overseen as much money or risk as he
will as CFO. He also faces a very different set of challenges
than his predecessor did when he came into the job in 1999: The
financial crisis is behind Goldman, but the firm must now
navigate an environment that is less conducive to risk-taking
and deal with much more onerous regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his immediate tests will be figuring out how Goldman
offsets the cost of maintaining a $176 billion pool of extra
cash and assets. That pool of liquidity enables the firm to meet
regulatory requirements and cushions it against a new crisis,
but it is also costly and drags on earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz could try to cut costs or change how capital is
allocated to various units to increase revenue, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CFOs of financial firms are under significant pressures to
improve efficiency and at the same time respond to regulatory
changes and meet heightened compliance requirements," said
Darrell Duffie, a Stanford University finance professor who
dissects, with his students, Goldman's regulatory filings in a
"Debt Markets" class. "Managing all of this is an enormous task
for CFOs, particularly of banks like Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next clues to how Schwartz will approach the job may
come when he makes his first public appearance as CFO on Feb. 12
at a Credit Suisse conference in Miami. Viniar will host his
final conference call with analysts as CFO when Goldman reports
its earnings this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A DIVERSE ROLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar - who took over as CFO the same year that Goldman
went public - saw the job gain importance during the financial
crisis of 2008 as risk management and liquidity became key to
the bank's survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFO at Goldman has seven main responsibilities, the top
one being risk-management. The finance chief also oversees the
bank's dealings with external constituencies, like investors,
analysts, ratings agencies and regulators, bank insiders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other responsibilities include managing Goldman's balance
sheet and liquidity pool, signing off on financial statements,
developing corporate strategy in consultation with Chief
Executive Lloyd Blankfein and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn,
handling expenses, including compensation, and communicating
with the board of directors, the insiders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those diverse roles, the CFO has to work with all kinds
of people in a range of professions, from accountants and
risk-managers to regulators and risk-takers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, a graduate of Rutgers University and Columbia
Business School, got his start at the firm in 1997 when he
joined the commodities broker J. Aron &amp; Co. The Goldman unit was
also the launch pad for several other senior Goldman executives,
including Blankfein and Cohn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A New Jersey native from Morristown, Schwartz now lives with
his long-time partner Annie Hubbard in a posh condo building
about a mile Goldman's headquarters in Lower Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman insiders said Schwartz, who is 6-foot-4 and holds a
black belt in karate, has shown both the disposition and the
ability to handle the CFO's many responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's a bear of a man, but he's gentle in his presentation,"
said John Rogers, Goldman's chief of staff and secretary to the
board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIDGING THE GAP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz has outlined a three-pronged approach as Goldman's
response to new financial regulations, which are a source of
much consternation for big banks, said Rogers, who also
co-chairs an internal regulatory committee with Schwartz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz's approach: Be sympathetic to regulators, who are
overwhelmed by the enormity of their rulemaking task; keep in
mind the objectives of global regulatory reform; portray
yourself to regulators as a helpful educator and never
overreact, Rogers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez, the Goldman quantitative analyst, said Schwartz
excels at being persuasive. Chavez, who holds a doctorate from
Stanford University in medical information sciences, had left
Goldman several years earlier to start his own business when
Schwartz approached him in 2004 for the accelerated buyback
project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two met at Delmonico's, a Wall Street steakhouse, where
Schwartz made his case to a reluctant Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was very skeptical. I thought, what does that have to do
with what I'm good at?" Chavez recalled. But "he got me excited
about the things that we could do within the financing
business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman co-President Jon Winkelried, who was
Schwartz's boss in 2004, said Schwartz could get people across
the bank to work with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We needed people who were very product literate, very
product savvy, who could package products appropriately, explain
them and put them in perspective for the investment bankers.
Harvey was very effective at bridging that gap," Winkelried
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the accelerated buyback product, clients could lock in
prices to quickly repurchase their shares at a discount, while
the bank used side bets to earn money for itself on volatility
in the client's share price. By 2008, the product had become a
$131 billion market that Goldman led, according to research by
University of Pittsburgh professors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUNKERED DOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big task facing Schwartz in the coming months is one that
every major bank is grappling with: how to improve profitability
while managing risk and meeting regulatory demands for large,
costly capital and liquidity buffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar increased Goldman's stockpile of extra cash and U.S.
and European government debt to $176 billion as of the 2012
third quarter, from $111 billion in the 2008 fourth quarter. He
extended the average length of borrowings under a type of
secured short-term funding called repurchase agreements to 150
days on average from 100 days. He also started parking more
money at the U.S. Federal Reserve instead of at other banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those moves made the bank safer, especially in the
aftermath of the financial crisis, the cost associated with
managing added capital and liquidity hurts Goldman's profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, the firm reported a return on equity -
a measure of the profit a bank generates from its balance sheet
- of 8.6 percent. That compares with returns of more than 30
percent pre-crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As CFO, Schwartz must find the balance between meeting
regulatory demands and positioning Goldman for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He can encourage colleagues to come up with new products
like the accelerated share repurchase product to increase
revenues in the new regulatory environment, analysts said. He
may also look to cut expenses, such as by reducing jobs - but
not so much that the firm can't take advantage if the stock and
bond markets improve with the economy in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a huge job," said Howard Chen, a Credit Suisse
analyst. "Goldman is just sitting there hunkered down and
weathering the storm. That's tough because they need to earn
adequate returns for shareholders."

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/w8lpbl/global_network) has announced
the addition of the "Global Network Processor and Co-processor Market 2011-2015"
report to their offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Network Processor and Co-processor
market to grow at a CAGR of 6.26 percent over the period 2011-2015. One of the
key factors contributing to this market growth is the increasing popularity of
network processors in access and metro applications. The Global Network
Processor and Co-processor market has also been witnessing the development of
multicore processors. However, the increasing technological complexity of
network standards could pose a challenge to the growth of this market. 

The key vendors dominating this market space are Broadcom Corp., EZchip
Semiconductor Ltd., Intel Corp., LSI Corp., and Renesas Electronics Corp. 

The other vendors mentioned in the report are Applied Micro Circuits Corp.,
Cavium Inc., Freescale Semiconductor Inc., PMC-Sierra Inc., Marvell Technology
Group Ltd., IBM Corp., and Fujitsu Ltd. 

Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Networking team said:
''The Semiconductor industry has evolved over the years to include various types
of end-user equipment and applications. Some of the highly complex and
high-performance computing systems use multicore architectures and processors.
Multicore processors consume less power and provide a higher output per watt
usage than conventional processors. However, multicore processors and
architectures cater only to a specific set of markets. Therefore, vendors are in
the process of developing infinitely scalable multicore architecture processors
that are both scalable and flexible enough to address distinct markets and
various applications. The development of such processors depends on the type of
processing technology required and the evolution of different forms of
processing algorithms and applications.'' 

According to the report, one of the main drivers is the increasing popularity of
network processors in access and metro applications. In recent years, chip
vendors have begun to focus on lower speeds and have also been successful in
shifting network processing ASICs into access and metro applications. Vendors
have successfully developed cost-effective product lines in digital subscriber
line access multiplexers (DSLAMs), base stations, and other applications.

Company Launches Global Advertising Campaign in the U.S. that Showcases Efforts
Underway to Help Address the Issue of this Generation
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company is reinforcing its efforts to work together with American
communities, business and government leaders to find meaningful solutions to the
complex challenge of obesity. 

A two-minute video, titled "Coming Together," debuts tonight on national cable
news. The video encourages everyone to be mindful that all calories count in
managing your weight, including those in Coca-Cola products and in all foods and
beverages. Its purpose is to highlight some of the specifics behind the
Company`s ongoing commitment to deliver more beverage choices, including low-
and no-calorie options, and to clearly communicate the calorie content of all
its products. 

A second spot, called "Be OK," will debut on American Idol on Wednesday, Jan.
16. "Be OK" makes it perfectly clear right up front that a can of Coca-Cola has
140 calories. This spot also encourages people to have some fun burning those
calories off. 

"We are committed to bring people together to help fight obesity," said Stuart
Kronauge, General Manager, Sparkling Beverages, Coca-Cola North America. "This
is about the health and happiness of everyone who buys our products and wants
great-tasting beverages, choice and information. The Coca-Cola Company has an
important role in this fight. Together, with willing partners, we will succeed."


In addition to the new advertising, Coca-Cola is already helping support and
promote physical activity initiatives in local communities. 

Programs:

* Coca-Cola Troops for Fitness: The Coca-Cola Foundation also will expand the
program in key cities across the country in 2013. Launched in Chicago last fall,
Coca-Cola Troops for Fitness taps returning military veterans to teach
military-style fitness classes like calisthenics, sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups
and other fitness and nutritional techniques to families in communities most in
need of wellness services. 
* America Is Your Park: For the third year, Coca-Cola issued a call-to-action to
Americans to go outdoors and to vote for their favorite park. In collaboration
with the National Park Foundation, America`s State Parks and National Recreation
and Park Association, Coca-Cola has donated a $100,000 recreation grant to the
winning park, as well as grants to three additional winning parks. These grants
are provided to help restore, rebuild or enhance activity areas in parks where
people can play and be active. Over the years, Coca-Cola has donated nearly $15
million for restoration and renovation of our country`s parks. 
* Triple Play: Launched in 2005 by Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) with
support from The Coca-Cola Company, Triple Play encourages kids to eat a
balanced diet, become more physically active and increase their ability to
engage in healthy relationships. 
* School Fitness Centers &amp; Governor`s Physical Fitness Challenge: Working with
the National Foundation for Governor's Fitness Councils 
        &#174; and the American College of Sports Medicine, Coca-Cola has dedicated
$5 million to place 100 new fitness centers in schools across the U.S. over the
next five years. The unbranded centers will feature new fitness equipment and
provide more than five million workouts annually, helping communities make
physical activity a priority in schools. This program has touched more than 1.4
million students since its pilot and will continue to benefit many more.

* Rails-to-Trails Conservancy: For more than 25 years, the Rails-to-Trails
Conservancy has been transforming abandoned railroad corridors into trails for
biking, walking and in-line skating. Over the years, we've donated more than
$800,000 to help the Conservancy and other local trail organizations plan,
improve or build a nationwide network of walking and biking trails. 
* ClimbsCorpTM: Launched in 2012 with support from Coca-Cola, ClimbsCorp, a
program of Brigham and Women`s Hospital, is the nation`s first service corps
dedicated to revolutionizing the cardiovascular health and wellness of the
American public. Based on the simple principle that people need to be active to
maintain better health, ClimbsCorp leverages an easy way to incorporate exercise
into our daily lives - taking the stairs.

Policies:

We are committed to providing fact-based nutrition information to help
individuals make informed choices, to suit all occasions and lifestyles. Our
commitment also includes adhering to the right policies in schools and the
marketplace; encouraging physical activity and promoting nutrition education;
and continuously meeting changing consumer needs through innovation.

* Council of Better Business Bureaus Pledge: Coca-Cola has always practiced
responsible marketing. Today, we will not buy advertising directly targeted at
audiences that are more than 35% children under 12. Our policy applies to
television, radio and print, and where data is available, to the Internet and
mobile phones. 
* Nutrition Labeling: In 2009, The Coca-Cola Company was the first company in
the beverage industry to make front-of-pack calorie-labeling a global commitment
for nearly all of our products by the end of 2011. And we`ve met that target.
Prior to that, in 2005, we were the first beverage company in the U.S. to place
dual nutrition labels on our regular calorie, single-serve packages - providing
not only the required information for an 8 fl. oz. serving, but also for the
entire package (up to 20 fl. oz.).

And we are united with America`s beverage companies and important leaders and
organizations in instituting meaningful, significant and measurable initiatives
to help address this issue and will continue to build on these efforts.

* School Beverage Guidelines: On May 3, 2006, Coca-Cola, along with President
Clinton, the American Beverage Association, and other major U.S. soft drink
companies, helped establish the national school beverage guidelines in the U.S.
by voluntarily changing our beverage offerings in primary and secondary schools.
The industry has since reduced beverage calories delivered to schools by 90%. 
* Clear on Calories: In February 2010, Coca-Cola joined the U.S. beverage
industry in announcing our support for First Lady Michelle Obama`s Let`s Move!
initiative with a "Clear on Calories" commitment, which includes placing calorie
labeling on front of nearly all beverage containers. 
* Calories Count Vending Program: Beginning in 2012, Coca-Cola and others in the
beverage industry have been working with government leaders, restaurant
operators, vending machine companies and other customers to increase
availability of low- and no-calorie beverages in vending machines. This effort
also includes adding calorie amounts for each beverage selection on vending
machines. In addition, machine fronts will display a "Calories Count" vending
snipe to remind people to consider the calories they consume.

Products:

We are committed to providing a variety of products for every lifestyle and
occasion, along with information to help people make informed choices and live
active, healthy lives.

* Lower Calorie Options: People often look for ways to manage their calories so
we help by offering low- and no-calorie options for nearly all of our brands. We
removed the calories but not the great taste.

* We offer more than 180 low- and no-calorie beverages in the U.S. and Canada,
and low- and no-calorie beverages now represent nearly one-third (33%) of our
beverage volume there. 
* We also offer 7.5 oz mini cans for many of our full-calorie beverages,
including Coca-Cola&#174;, Sprite&#174;, Fanta&#174; Orange and Seagram`s&#174; Ginger Ale. 
* And, we have incorporated a natural, zero-calorie sweetener from the stevia
plant into a number of products, including vitaminwater zeroTM.

"Overcoming obesity will require work from all of us," said Kronauge. "If we are
to reach the goal of Americans achieving a happy, healthy and active future, we
all will have to dedicate ourselves to move forward together."

The First Once-Daily, Extended-Release Liquid Medication for the Treatment of
ADHD is Now Available in Pharmacies


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that Quillivant XR (methylphenidate
hydrochloride) CII for extended-release oral suspension is now available in the
U.S. for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Quillivant XR is the first once-daily, extended-release liquid methylphenidate
for ADHD and is now available by prescription. 

"In order to effectively treat patients with chronic conditions such as ADHD, it
is important to consider individual patient needs, including options for
medication administration," said Ann Childress, M.D., president of the Center
for Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine, Las Vegas, who was an investigator in
the Quillivant XR laboratory classroom study. "As the first once-daily,
extended-release liquid medication for patients with ADHD, Quillivant XR
represents a new alternative to other ADHD treatments." 

Quillivant XR was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on
September 27, 2012 for the treatment of ADHD in patients aged 6 years and above.
The efficacy of Quillivant XR was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, crossover, multicenter, laboratory classroom study of 45
children with ADHD. Quillivant XR significantly improved ADHD symptoms compared
to placebo at the primary endpoint of four hours post-dose, and in a secondary
analysis, showed significant improvement at every time point measured, from 45
minutes to 12 hours after dosing. 

ADHD is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders in the U.S.1 According
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention`s 2007 data, about one in ten
children aged 4 - 17 in the U.S. had at any time in their life received a
diagnosis of ADHD.1 Patients with ADHD may suffer from symptoms such as
difficulty paying attention, impulsivity and being overly active in some cases.2
The condition can last into adulthood.3 Although there are many treatment
options for ADHD, until Quillivant XR there was no once-daily, extended-release
liquid option for the treatment of this condition. 

"Pfizer is pleased to provide patients and their caregivers with a new option to
help manage this challenging condition," said Sam Azoulay, M.D., senior vice
president of medical and development for Pfizer`s Emerging Markets and
Established Products Business Units. "We also recognize that caring for and
treating a child with ADHD goes beyond medication. We look forward to working
with mothers and other caregivers of children with ADHD to provide meaningful
resources to the ADHD community." 

Pfizer acquired NextWave Pharmaceuticals on November 27, 2012. Quillivant XR was
developed in conjunction with NextWave`s manufacturing partner, Tris Pharma,
using Tris Pharma`s patent-protected drug delivery platform. For more
information, please visit www.quillivantxr.com. 

Pfizer plans to offer Quillivant XR to patients in need through our Pfizer
Helpful Answers&#174; program. Pfizer Helpful Answers is Pfizer`s family of
patient-assistance programs that helps eligible patients in the U.S. in need get
access to their Pfizer medicines. In 2011, Pfizer Helpful Answers helped more
than 1 million patients receive over 7.8 million Pfizer prescriptions through

Built on IBM Flex Systems and Juniper QFabric, solution offers flexibility and
helps clients address data-center networking, cloud and virtualization demands
ENGLEWOOD, Colo.--(Business Wire)--
Addressing the growing needs for customers faced with server sprawl and
virtualization management issues, Arrow Electronics Inc. (NYSE: ARW) today
announced that it would offer converged infrastructure bundles designed to help
simplify integration for cloud data centers. Built upon the IBM (NYSE: IBM) Flex

bundle will help customers easily manage virtualization demands driven by
today`s big data initiatives that require integrated server and storage. 

"Our enterprise customers want solutions that are easy to purchase and quickly
deliver value," said Scott Seger, vice president of sales for CBTS, a provider
of end-to-end business technology solutions. "The new IBM Flex System and
Juniper QFabric bundle offers a tightly integrated system that provides the
performance and ease of deployment critical for today`s data center
environments." 

Initially available in the United States through Arrow`s Enterprise Computing
Solutions segment, the Juniper Networks QFabric Architecture for the IBM Flex
Systems helps customers simplify traditional data-center networks. Tested and
integrated into a single part number, the bundled solution will allow customers
to grow as their business needs evolve, providing cost-effective business
agility. The new products are unique given they allow customers to integrate an
open, Juniper Networks QFabric infrastructure with IBM`s Flex System. 

"Arrow is pleased to enable these two technology powerhouses, IBM and Juniper,
to come together in a complementary fashion to deliver a robust converged
infrastructure solution to the respective channel ecosystems," said Sean Kerins,

providers to deliver infrastructure that caters to their customers` current and
future needs." 

The new system offers:

speed and scalability offers customers an integrated computing stack for the
data center; 
* Ease-of-deployment: Customers can quickly reduce the time required to setup
cloud-ready data centers with an open, flexible, client-tuned approach that will
help accelerate the deployment of new cloud-based applications; 
* High performance: Offering a simple solution that improves application
performance with three microseconds of latency, the Juniper Networks QFX3500
enables server-to-server traffic speed equivalent to streaming 1,000
high-definition movies in a single second; 
* Channel partner dedication: Arrow, IBM and Juniper share a commitment to
strengthening channel alliances and facilitating business opportunities while
making it easier for customers to buy integrated solutions and technologies that
offer greater performance and scalability to meet the demands of tomorrow`s
data-center environments today.

"Juniper, Arrow and IBM are giving enterprise CXOs the ability to simplify the
integration of two market leading data center building blocks with the bundle of
FlexSystem and QFabric," said Jonathan Davidson, senior vice president and
general manager, Campus and Data Center Business Unit. "With this best of breed
infrastructure in place, clients will be able to scale without adding complexity
while simultaneously delivering application performance in their data centers." 

The IBM Flex System provides the building-block elements for IBM PureSystems.

build and tune configurations to their specific requirements. This allows them
to select the specific compute, systems networking and optional storage and
management required to support their specific workloads.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - In 2004, Harvey Schwartz, who was then head of the financing business at Goldman Sachs Group Inc's investment bank, came up with a new way for the bank to make money from a seemingly mundane activity: helping companies buy back their shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He created a product that could save companies money by getting them improved pricing on buybacks while generating fees and trading profits for the bank. To build what became a multibillion-dollar market, Schwartz had to convince dozens of skeptical Goldman sales people, derivatives traders, corporate finance specialists and lawyers that they could make buybacks more enticing, said Martin Chavez, a Goldman quantitative analyst who worked with Schwartz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said, 'I know the details are going to be immensely complicated, and it's going to seem impossible. But there is a solution here. We're all going to work until we figure it out,'" Chavez recalled Schwartz as saying. "And when Harvey says that, people listen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of this month, Schwartz will need many more to listen when he takes over as Goldman's chief financial officer from David Viniar, the firm's long-time finance chief who is seen by insiders, analysts and investors as a tough act to follow. Viniar, 57, will remain a Goldman director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Schwartz, 48, who has so far worked in relative anonymity as co-head of the firm's securities and trading unit, fills those shoes could have far-reaching impact on Goldman's outlook and even its culture. After 15 years of selling products to clients and inventing ways to generate revenue for the firm, Schwartz will now be responsible for reining in risk-takers and worrying about costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of Goldman's 32,600 employees will report to Schwartz, including staff in finance, accounting, legal and technology. As CFO, he will have a vast and diverse portfolio, overseeing everything from the bank's $949 billion balance sheet to risk-management and Goldman's relations with analysts, investors and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NITTY-GRITTY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz declined to comment for this article. But interviews with Goldman executives who know the incoming CFO give insights into why the bank picked him for the job and what he may do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many respects Schwartz is like Viniar, the executives said. Schwartz is a capable risk-manager who is expected to maintain Viniar's cautious stance on risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said Schwartz understands the nitty-gritty of complex finance and is also able to speak in plain English in front of investors and clients. He already commands respect within the firm and is beginning to build a following outside, having met with investors and analysts dozens of times over the past year, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Schwartz has never overseen as much money or risk as he will as CFO. He also faces a very different set of challenges than his predecessor did when he came into the job in 1999: The financial crisis is behind Goldman, but the firm must now navigate an environment that is less conducive to risk-taking and deal with much more onerous regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his immediate tests will be figuring out how Goldman offsets the cost of maintaining a $176 billion pool of extra cash and assets. That pool of liquidity enables the firm to meet regulatory requirements and cushions it against a new crisis, but it is also costly and drags on earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz could try to cut costs or change how capital is allocated to various units to increase revenue, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CFOs of financial firms are under significant pressures to improve efficiency and at the same time respond to regulatory changes and meet heightened compliance requirements," said Darrell Duffie, a Stanford University finance professor who dissects, with his students, Goldman's regulatory filings in a "Debt Markets" class. "Managing all of this is an enormous task for CFOs, particularly of banks like Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next clues to how Schwartz will approach the job may come when he makes his first public appearance as CFO on February 12 at a Credit Suisse conference in Miami. Viniar will host his final conference call with analysts as CFO when Goldman reports its earnings this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A DIVERSE ROLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar - who took over as CFO the same year that Goldman went public - saw the job gain importance during the financial crisis of 2008 as risk management and liquidity became key to the bank's survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFO at Goldman has seven main responsibilities, the top one being risk-management. The finance chief also oversees the bank's dealings with external constituencies, like investors, analysts, ratings agencies and regulators, bank insiders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other responsibilities include managing Goldman's balance sheet and liquidity pool, signing off on financial statements, developing corporate strategy in consultation with Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn, handling expenses, including compensation, and communicating with the board of directors, the insiders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those diverse roles, the CFO has to work with all kinds of people in a range of professions, from accountants and risk-managers to regulators and risk-takers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz, a graduate of Rutgers University and Columbia Business School, got his start at the firm in 1997 when he joined the commodities broker J. Aron &amp; Co. The Goldman unit was also the launch pad for several other senior Goldman executives, including Blankfein and Cohn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A New Jersey native from Morristown, Schwartz now lives with his long-time partner Annie Hubbard in a posh condo building about a mile from Goldman's headquarters in Lower Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman insiders said Schwartz, who is 6-foot-4 and holds a black belt in karate, has shown both the disposition and the ability to handle the CFO's many responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's a bear of a man, but he's gentle in his presentation," said John Rogers, Goldman's chief of staff and secretary to the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIDGING THE GAP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz has outlined a three-pronged approach as Goldman's response to new financial regulations, which are a source of much consternation for big banks, said Rogers, who also co-chairs an internal regulatory committee with Schwartz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz's approach: Be sympathetic to regulators, who are overwhelmed by the enormity of their rulemaking task; keep in mind the objectives of global regulatory reform; portray yourself to regulators as a helpful educator and never overreact, Rogers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez, the Goldman quantitative analyst, said Schwartz excels at being persuasive. Chavez, who holds a doctorate from Stanford University in medical information sciences, had left Goldman several years earlier to start his own business when Schwartz approached him in 2004 for the accelerated buyback project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two met at Delmonico's, a Wall Street steakhouse, where Schwartz made his case to a reluctant Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was very skeptical. I thought, what does that have to do with what I'm good at?" Chavez recalled. But "he got me excited about the things that we could do within the financing business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Goldman co-President Jon Winkelried, who was Schwartz's boss in 2004, said Schwartz could get people across the bank to work with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We needed people who were very product literate, very product savvy, who could package products appropriately, explain them and put them in perspective for the investment bankers. Harvey was very effective at bridging that gap," Winkelried said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the accelerated buyback product, clients could lock in prices to quickly repurchase their shares at a discount, while the bank used side bets to earn money for itself on volatility in the client's share price. By 2008, the product had become a $131 billion market that Goldman led, according to research by University of Pittsburgh professors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUNKERED DOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big task facing Schwartz in the coming months is one that every major bank is grappling with: how to improve profitability while managing risk and meeting regulatory demands for large, costly capital and liquidity buffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar increased Goldman's stockpile of extra cash and U.S. and European government debt to $176 billion as of the 2012 third quarter, from $111 billion in the 2008 fourth quarter. He extended the average length of borrowings under a type of secured short-term funding called repurchase agreements to 150 days on average from 100 days. He also started parking more money at the U.S. Federal Reserve instead of at other banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those moves made the bank safer, especially in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the cost associated with managing added capital and liquidity hurts Goldman's profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, the firm reported a return on equity - a measure of the profit a bank generates from its balance sheet - of 8.6 percent. That compares with returns of more than 30 percent pre-crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As CFO, Schwartz must find the balance between meeting regulatory demands and positioning Goldman for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He can encourage colleagues to come up with new products like the accelerated share repurchase product to increase revenues in the new regulatory environment, analysts said. He may also look to cut expenses, such as by reducing jobs &#8212; but not so much that the firm can't take advantage if the stock and bond markets improve with the economy in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a huge job," said Howard Chen, a Credit Suisse analyst. "Goldman is just sitting there hunkered down and weathering the storm. That's tough because they need to earn adequate returns for shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapara and Carrick Mollenkamp in New York; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Paritosh Bansal, Martin Howell and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

Initial contract with Tug Hill Operating includes dedication of acreage in the
Mississippian Lime play, open season for Kansas producers
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
JP Energy Development, an affiliate of JP Energy Partners, has signed a 15-year
agreement with Tug Hill Operating to transport crude oil from south-central
Kansas to Cushing, Okla., via the Kansas Express, a new interstate crude oil
pipeline. Tug Hill Operating, focused primarily on the Mississippian Lime play
in Kansas, will dedicate 600,000 acres to JP Energy Development to move oil to
market. The Kansas Express will be the second pipeline in the Mississippian Lime
play for JP Energy Development. The new pipeline will have capacity to take on
additional producers. 

"This is a significant development for oil producers in northern Oklahoma and
Kansas who will have additional means to move their product to market quickly
and efficiently," stated J. Patrick Barley, president and chief executive
officer, JP Energy Partners. "JP Energy Development can now expand our presence
in the Mississippian Lime play in partnership with Tug Hill Operating, whose
management and owners have an extremely successful track record of developing
oil and gas assets in the U.S." 

The new Kansas Express pipeline moves crude oil to Cushing. Existing crude
pipeline infrastructure in Kansas does not accommodate near- or long-term oil
production from the Mississippian Lime play to Oklahoma without extensive
trucking. 

"The new pipeline provides Tug Hill Operating access to the Cushing market and
limits the number of trucks on Kansas roads," stated Michael Radler, president
and chief executive officer, Tug Hill Operating. "JP Energy Development has a
proven track record of reliable service and a focus on customers that is
attractive to Tug Hill Operating. They are our preferred pipeline company, and
we hope other Kansas producers will find opportunities to use them as well." 

JP Energy Development plans to commence an open season in the coming weeks
seeking additional producer commitments, with a plan to begin construction on
the first phase of the Kansas Express in the first quarter of this year. The
final design capacity of the pipeline will be determined after the completion of
the open-season process for all prospective shippers in Kansas. Initially, the
Kansas Express pipeline is expected to be approximately 12 inches in diameter
and is expected to be in service by January 2014. Future phases of the project
are expected to extend the pipeline north to Gove County, Kan. and east to
Kingman County, Kan. 

JP Energy Development also owns and operates the Great Salt Plains Pipeline.
This pipeline, opened in October 2012, transports oil from Cherokee to Cushing,
Oklahoma. The company operates as a first purchaser and manages more than 50
crude oil transport trucks in Kansas and Oklahoma in support of the Great Salt
Plains Pipeline.

For the First Time, Disney and Pixar Animation Studios` Most Popular Characters
Come Together in a Magical Storytelling Experience
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Interactive today unveiled its most ambitious gaming initiative ever,
Disney Infinity. This all new game platform unlocks the freedom to create
stories and play experiences starring beloved characters from The Walt Disney
Company and Pixar Animation Studios. Disney Infinity allows players to both
experience original adventures in some of their favorite Disney and Pixar worlds
and to build their own worlds using the power of their imagination.

"Disney Infinity introduces a new way to interact with the best of Disney on one
game platform, both now and in the future," said John Pleasants, co-president,
Disney Interactive. "With this innovative approach to gaming, Disney Infinity
will bring to life new characters, stories and environments from The Walt Disney
Company over time in a way that will delight fans and gamers alike." 

In a way that only Disney can, Disney Infinity integrates collectible character
figures that come to life in the game. These figures provide experiences that
are true to these characters and stories, as well as the opportunity to bring
characters from various Disney and Pixar films to play together in a virtual
"Toy Box." This all-new game universe will launch in June across all consoles
and will have a phased roll out across mobile and online devices throughout
2013. 

Throughout each story-driven experience, called a "Play Set," players will solve
challenging puzzles, battle enemies and explore iconic locations from famous
Disney properties, while collecting unique characters, vehicles, and gadgets
from each world and saving them to a virtual "Toy Box." Players can access their
"Toy Box" and build and customize their own unique virtual world using their
favorite characters, vehicles, settings and accessories. Disney Infinity allows
players the opportunity to share these unique creations in the "Toy Box" mode
with friends both online and off. 

The Disney Infinity Platform includes:

* Disney Infinity Interactive Pieces - Initially a line of 40 collectible
interactive pieces will be introduced that allow players to expand and customize
their play experiences. 
* Disney Infinity Interactive Character Figures - Seventeen character figures
will allow players to experience a variety of their favorite characters in true
to property experiences and in "Toy Box" mode. 
* Disney Infinity Base - When figures are placed on the Infinity base, they
unlock the world and play experiences of Disney Infinity. 
* Disney Infinity Power Discs- Interactive discs can be placed on the Infinity
base to power up characters and "Toy Box" with unique powers, customizations and
gadgets.

"Disney Infinity combines prominent Disney and Pixar characters and scenarios in
a way that mimics how kids play in real life," said John Blackburn, vice
president and general manager, Avalanche Software. "With our platform`s unique
gameplay mechanics and innovative approach to user generated content within the
"Toy Box" mode, Disney Infinity will spark imaginations and provide endless
hours of fun and creativity." 

Development for Disney Infinity is being led by Disney Interactive and Avalanche
Software. The game currently is unrated by the ESRB. For additional information,
please visit www.disney.com/Infinity and youtube.com/disneyinfinity, join the
Disney Infinity Facebook Community (Facebook.com/disneyinfinity) and follow us

Federal Communications Commission. This device is not, and may not be, offered
for sale or lease, or sold or leased, until authorization is obtained.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The overwhelming majority of shoppers made their last purchase in a store and not online, but far fewer are committed to do so the next time they buy something, according to a study released on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 80 percent of shoppers in the study from International Business Machines Corp last bought something at a store, but only half said they would go to a brick-and-mortar retailer next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed both the importance and global reach of "showrooming," in which shoppers examine products in stores and then make their purchase online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, 26 percent admitted to showrooming, compared with 13 percent in India and 7 percent in the United States, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the latest to underscore the importance of online and mobile shopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five percent of the store shoppers surveyed around the world in November said that they were unsure whether they would shop at a store or online for their next purchase, according to IBM. Nine percent said that they would make their next purchase online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailers that do not embrace the small but growing group of showroomers risk losing those shoppers to Amazon.com Inc and other online-only competitors that often offer merchandise at lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where do you want to place your bets for the future?" Jill Puleri, the global retail leader for IBM Business Services, asked executives at the National Retail Federation conference in New York this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of all online purchases resulted from showrooming, which is popular with younger shoppers - typically males - who tend to be more affluent than average, Puleri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not the enemy, far from it," she said. "They are your best friends, your advocates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in-store transactions still make up the vast majority of sales, online purchases are increasing at a faster clip than those in stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some retail leaders say chains are not quick enough to adapt to this trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J. Crew Chief Executive Officer Mickey Drexler scolded a panel at a Financo event on Monday for retail CEOs and other business leaders for not addressing the threat of Amazon during a discussion about how essential stores are for branding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do you have a panel like this without mentioning Amazon?" Drexler asked the group, which included Coach Inc CEO Lew Frankfort and VF Corp CEO Eric Wiseman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of eight categories tracked in the IBM survey of 26,000 shoppers, the two most popular for online purchases were consumer electronics and luxury items, including jewelry and designer clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 25 percent of Internet shoppers had intended to buy in the store but ultimately purchased online, primarily for price and convenience, IBM said. Retailers that only operate online account for one-third of purchases by showroomers, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jessica Wohl in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has scrapped plans to delay paying bonuses to its bankers in Britain to exploit an income tax cut for top earners after Bank of England Governor Mervyn King criticized the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Tuesday, King chided the U.S. investment bank for considering a delay in bonuses until after April 6 when the top tax rate falls to 45 percent from 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The delay had been under consideration and the decision was made today not to do it," a person familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King's intervention ratcheted up the pressure on Goldman, which sparked a furor last week when the bank's plan emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I find it a bit depressing that people who earn so much seem to think that it's even more exciting to adjust the timing of it to get the benefit of the lower tax rate," King told a panel of British lawmakers when asked about Goldman's plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of the central bank said that while Goldman's plan was not unlawful, the tax reduction was being done at a time when the rest of society was suffering from the consequences of the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain had to shore up and nationalize banks during the 2007-09 crisis, which has sparked public anger over bonuses at a time when the government is freezing public pay and cutting expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finance minister George Osborne, who introduced the reduction to the top rate of tax, has come under pressure from campaigners to prevent banks such as Goldman from avoiding tax by delaying their bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King, who has a salary of 305,000 pounds ($490,000) a year, told parliament's Treasury Select Committee it was "clumsy" to pay bonuses in such a way and betrayed a lack of attention to how others might feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And in the long run, financial institutions, like all large institutions, do depend on goodwill and the rest of society.

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman scraps plan to exploit lower UK tax - source&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Mervyn King says Goldman plan was "depressing"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* King warns plan risked stoking public anger during crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Huw Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has scrapped
plans to delay paying bonuses to its bankers in Britain to
exploit an income tax cut for top earners after Bank of England
Governor Mervyn King criticised the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Tuesday, King chided the U.S. investment bank for

which sparked a furore last week when the bank's plan emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I find it a bit depressing that people who earn so much
seem to think that it's even more exciting to adjust the timing
of it to get the benefit of the lower tax rate," King told a
panel of British lawmakers when asked about Goldman's plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of the central bank said that while Goldman's plan
was not unlawful, the tax reduction was being done at a time
when the rest of society was suffering from the consequences of
the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain had to shore up and nationalise banks during the
2007-09 crisis, which has sparked public anger over bonuses at a
time when the government is freezing public pay and cutting

reduction to the top rate of tax, has come under pressure from
campaigners to prevent banks such as Goldman from avoiding tax
by delaying their bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King, who has a salary of 305,000 pounds ($490,000) a year,
told parliament's Treasury Select Committee it was "clumsy" to

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 15 (Reuters) - The overwhelming majority of
shoppers made their last purchase in a store and not online, but
far fewer are committed to do so the next time they buy
something, according to a study released on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 80 percent of shoppers in the study from
International Business Machines Corp last bought
something at a store, but only half said they would go to a
brick-and-mortar retailer next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed both the importance and global reach of
"showrooming," in which shoppers examine products in stores and
then make their purchase online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, 26 percent admitted to showrooming, compared with
13 percent in India and 7 percent in the United States, IBM
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the latest to underscore the importance of
online and mobile shopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five percent of the store shoppers surveyed around
the world in November said that they were unsure whether they
would shop at a store or online for their next purchase,
according to IBM. Nine percent said that they would make their
next purchase online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailers that do not embrace the small but growing group of
showroomers risk losing those shoppers to Amazon.com Inc
 and other online-only competitors that often offer
merchandise at lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where do you want to place your bets for the future?" Jill
Puleri, the global retail leader for IBM Business Services,
asked executives at the National Retail Federation conference in
New York this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of all online purchases resulted from
showrooming, which is popular with younger shoppers - typically
males - who tend to be more affluent than average, Puleri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not the enemy, far from it," she said. "They are
your best friends, your advocates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in-store transactions still make up the vast majority
of sales, online purchases are increasing at a faster clip than
those in stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some retail leaders say chains are not quick enough to adapt
to this trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J. Crew Chief Executive Officer Mickey Drexler scolded a
panel at a Financo event on Monday for retail CEOs and other
business leaders for not addressing the threat of Amazon during
a discussion about how essential stores are for branding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do you have a panel like this without mentioning
Amazon?" Drexler asked the group, which included Coach Inc
 CEO Lew Frankfort and VF Corp CEO Eric Wiseman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of eight categories tracked in the IBM survey of 26,000
shoppers, the two most popular for online purchases were
consumer electronics and luxury items, including jewelry and
designer clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 25 percent of Internet shoppers had intended to buy
in the store but ultimately purchased online, primarily for
price and convenience, IBM said. Retailers that only operate

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Operation Photo Rescue (OPR), a U.S. not-for-profit organization comprised of a
worldwide network of volunteers will be in New York City on February 2nd and 3rd
to digitally copy photos for anyone whose pictures were damaged by Hurricane
Sandy. 

Hosted by the School of Visual Arts Masters in Digital Photography program and
supported by Chase, PhotoShelter, DigMyPics, Imagingetc, and Ken Allen Studios,
the OPR team will be onsite at 133 West 21st St, Room 101c in Manhattan on
Saturday, February 2 and Sunday, February 3, 2013, 10am-5pm on both days.
Walk-ins are welcome and appointments are available via http://goo.gl/Bjrym. 

Anyone with photos damaged from Hurricane Sandy may bring up to 20 photos to be
evaluated and potentially restored. Photos that can be repaired will be
digitally captured with state-of-the-art imaging technology and later restored
and printed. Restored photos will be mailed to owners at no cost. The original
photo remains with the owner. 

All photos need to be dry and removed from picture frames and albums. Those that
cannot be extracted will still be copied, but the quality may suffer. Photos
that are stuck together can be separated by soaking, but should first be tested
on a corner to see if the emulsion is stable enough to soak. Further
instructions on care can be found on Operation Photo Rescue`s homepage:
www.operationphotorescue.org. 

Following family and pets, photos are the next most cherished possession, as the
memories captured in photos are all that remain after a natural disaster. Chase,
through its Technology for Social Good program, is supplying the imaging
stations, software and volunteers to help make the photos available
electronically. The School of Visual Arts is also providing imaging technology
in addition to volunteers and the space. DigMyPics will donate all of the
printing and shipping of restored photos; PhotoShelter will provide free online
storage of the damaged as well as restored photos; and Imagingetc and Ken Allen
Studios will both provide volunteer staff who are experienced in handling and
digitizing delicate photographs in addition to equipment. 

Operation Photo Rescue (OPR) is a federally registered 501(c)(3) not-for-profit
charity that restores photographs that have been damaged by natural disasters.
OPR was founded in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in January 2006 by two
photojournalists, Dave Ellis and Becky Sell. Since then, the organization has
grown into a network of over 2,000 volunteers from across the globe. Volunteers
from all 50 U.S. states and 76 other countries have returned over 9,000 restored
photos to survivors of hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and wildfires. More
information is available at http://www.operationphotorescue.org.

School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York City is an established leader and
innovator in the education of artists. From its inception in 1947, the faculty
has been comprised of professionals working in the arts and art-related fields.
SVA provides an environment that nurtures creativity, inventiveness and

&lt;p&gt;* Chevron sole bidder for Lithuanian shale oil or gas field&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Baltic state wants to reduce reliance on Russian energy
imports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VILNIUS Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Chevron
 was the sole applicant for a permit for exploration and
extraction rights of shale gas or oil in a field in Lithuania,
an official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithuania wants to reduce its dependence on energy imports
from regional giant Russia as well as make the most of any
hydrocarbon reserves. Other eastern European countries including
Poland also want to explore their shale gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lithuanian exploration contract would give Chevron 7
years to explore unconventional hydrocarbon reserves in the
1,800 square kilometre Silute-Taurage field. It would also grant
it 10 years to explore for conventional oil in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of the State Geological Survey Juozas Mockevicius
told Reuters locally-registered company, Chevron Exploration &amp;
Production Lietuva, was the only participant in the tender which
closed on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The winner in the tender should be confirmed in the three
months after the application has been checked. Then a contract
should be finalised and signed in three more months," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winner has to invest at least 80 million litas ($31
million) in the exploration under the permit's terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by the U.S. Energy Information Administration has
said Lithuania could have recoverable shale gas reserves of 113
billion cubic metres. Mockevicius told Reuters that in Lithuania
finding shale oil was more likely than shale gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron last October bought 50 percent of
Lithuania-registered oil company LL Investicijos, which holds a
licence to prospect for oil and gas at the 2,400 square km
Rietavas field.&lt;/p&gt;

HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD) today announced that its wholly
owned affiliate, Enterprise Marine Services LLC, has entered into a multi-year
contract with SeaRiver, Inc. to provide the ExxonMobil subsidiary with
transportation services. Under the terms of the agreement, which took effect
January 1, 2013, Enterprise is committing five tugs and 10 barges for the
transportation of refined products and other hydrocarbon products along the
nation`s inland waterway system. 

"We are very pleased to execute this long-term agreement with SeaRiver, one of
the largest consumers of marine transportation services in the energy industry,"
said Gerald R. "Jerry" Cardillo, president of Enterprise Marine Services LLC.
"We believe our selection as one of SeaRiver`s preferred vendors reflects our
quality fleet, operational reliability and experienced personnel. We believe the
agreement is also an acknowledgement of Enterprise Marine`s `best in the
industry` financial strength based on our affiliation with Enterprise Products
Partners, one of the largest publicly traded partnerships, with an enterprise
value of $62 billion and investment-grade debt ratings."

of inland waterways, as well as the Gulf of Mexico. Its fleet of double-hulled
barges is among the youngest in the industry and meets or exceeds federal
requirements for safety. Reflecting Enteprise`s commitment to growing its Marine
Services business, Enterprise`s 64th tug, the Dan L, named after founder Dan
Duncan, was placed into service in 2012. Four more tugs and six barges are under
construction and expected to be completed in 2013. 

Enterprise Products Partners L.P. is one of the largest publicly traded
partnerships and a leading North American provider of midstream energy services
to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, refined products and
petrochemicals. The partnership`s assets include approximately 50,700 miles of

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 15 (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mervyn
King said on Tuesday it was "depressing" that banks like Goldman
Sachs were planning to delay paying bonuses this year
until after a drop in income tax rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is considering such a delay in Britain until
after April 6, when the top rate of income tax falls to 45
percent from 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I find it a bit depressing that people who earn so much
seem to think that it's even more exciting to adjust the timing
of it to get the benefit of the lower tax rate," King told a
panel of UK lawmakers when asked about Goldman's plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said while this was not unlawful, the delay was being
done at a time when the rest of society was suffering most from
the consequences of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain had to shore up and nationalise banks during the
2007-09 financial crisis, sparking public anger over bonuses
when the government is freezing public pay and cutting
expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it would be rather clumsy, lacking in care and
attention to how other people might be," King told parliament's
Treasury Select Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And in the long run, financial institutions, like all large
institutions, do depend on good will and the rest of society.
They can't just exist on their own."&lt;/p&gt;

* 16% growth in European e-commerce as online Visa spending tops &#8364;200bn for the
first time
* UK e-commerce now represents a quarter of all spend on a Visa card
* Mass rollout of V.me by Visa digital wallet in 2013, giving UK cardholders
access to secure, simple and fast online payments through their own bank

LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Annual spend on Visa debit cards across Europe has exceeded &#8364;1trillion (&#8364;1.02
tn) for the first time. The figure represents an annual increase of 8.8%,
reports payments technology company Visa Europe, which today announces its
annual results for the year ending 30 September 2012. 

Despite the challenging economic climate, total spend by Visa cardholders grew
by 8.0% to &#8364;1.3 trillion. This was underpinned by a 16% growth in e-commerce,
the fastest growing part of the Visa Europe business. Online spending on Visa
cards in Europe topped &#8364;200 billion (&#8364;202bn) for the first time and accounts for
more than 20% of Visa Europe`s processed business. &#8364;1 in every &#8364;6.75 spent in
Europe is on a Visa card, a figure that rises to &#163;1 in every &#163;3 in the UK. 

Growth was also strong in other core areas of the Visa Europe business, with
spending on commercial cards increasing by 17.6% and on prepaid cards by 18.3%. 

In the UK, total spend increased by 6.1% to &#163;407bn with spend on debit cards
increasing by 7.1% to &#163;360bn. E-commerce grew by 11.5% to &#163;96bn, representing
almost a quarter of total spend.

As a membership organisation, Visa Europe operates a high volume, low cost
business model that provides services to its members. For the second year
running, Visa Europe revenues exceeded &#8364;1billion (&#8364;1.11bn) and the company
achieved a pre-tax surplus of &#8364;260 million that will be reinvested into the
business and to improve capital and reserves. 

Visa Europe has invested over &#8364;1billion in its technology and infrastructure
over the past six years, building a robust and secure European payments platform
from which to deliver the next generation of payment technologies. The company
continues to deliver unparalleled payments safety for consumers, merchants and
retailers, with its fraud to sales ratio at an all-time low for the second year
running (Europe-wide: 0.04%; UK 0.05%). 

2013 will see the rollout of V.me by Visa, Visa`s first integrated digital
wallet, in the UK, France and Spain. In the UK, banks representing 80% of all
consumers are already committed, while by 2020, Visa Europe believes that
one-third of all European consumers will be using the V.me wallet.

V.me by Visa allows consumers to complete online transactions with just one
click after login through the internet browser on their smart phones, tablets,
PCs or laptops, using cards from multiple providers. V.me is exceptionally
secure, shielding customers` card details from online merchants and supported by
multiple layers of Visa security technology. The V.me service will continue to
evolve to incorporate other Visa payment technologies, including contactless
transactions at the point of sale and person-to-person payments. 

2013 will also see the continued rollout of contactless payments for card and
mobile devices. Contactless transactions in Europe quadrupled in 2012 and Visa
Europe expects to repeat this growth in 2013. Across Europe, in 2013, there will
be 40 issuers offering mobile contactless payment services to consumers and by
the end of 2013 around 80 types of smartphone will be certified by Visa to carry
out contactless payments 

Peter Ayliffe, Chief Executive, Visa Europe said: 

"Visa Europe has performed strongly in the past year despite tough economic
conditions, demonstrating the continued resilience of our business.

"Debit, which accounts for almost 80% of Visa card spending in Europe, continues
to grow strongly while e-commerce has become the fastest growing part of our
business and is set to grow further as the market continues to mature.

"We have benefited from our investment in technology and security, which not
only helped us deliver 100% processing availability and record low levels of
fraud in 2012, but also enabled us to showcase mobile contactless payments at
the London Olympics.This investment also underpins the rollout of new payment
technologies in 2013.

"As we continue to see the explosive adoption of mobile devices, our priority in
2013 is to give consumers faster, safer mobile ways to pay.

"The past six years have been about preparing and building the European payments
infrastructure to support European commerce and the delivery of new payment
technologies. The year ahead will see us putting mobile contactless payments
into consumers` hands, and introducing digital wallets on a mass scale for the
first time.

"In the UK, where a quarter of all Visa card spend is online, banks representing
the vast majority of UK consumers are lined up to launch V.me in 2013, providing
a faster, simpler and safer way to pay online."

&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan downgraded palm oil firm Golden Agri-Resources

hurt by a muted recovery in crude palm oil (CPO) prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 0329 GMT, shares of Golden Agri were down 3.1 percent at
S$0.62, and have fallen about 4.6 percent since the start of the
year, compared to the Straits Times Index's 1 percent
rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan said it expects Golden Agri's fourth-quarter
earnings to miss expectations, and forecast a 20 percent
quarter-on-quarter decline in core net profit to $69 million as
average CPO prices fell 23 percent in the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also cut its 2013 and 2014 earnings per share estimates
by 10 percent to factor in lower CPO prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesian plantation companies, including Golden Agri, are

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's (JPM.N) Chief Executive, had his 2012 bonus cut in half after the bank's board decided he should shoulder blame for $6.2 billion of "London Whale" trading losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon's bonus cut, which cost him more than $10 million, came even as JPMorgan posted a 53 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit and record 2012 earnings. The fourth-quarter results were helped by increased mortgage lending profits and a decline in bad loan costs. Without these results, Dimon's pay would have been worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's 2012 pay of $11.5 million will fall from being high for the sector to being ordinary. John Stumpf, the CEO of Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N) made $18.9 million in 2011, while Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America (BAC.N), made $8.1 million. In 2011, Dimon was paid $23 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to posting earnings and disclosing Dimon's pay, JPMorgan released two company reports about the losing trades. The positions, known as the "London Whale" trades because they were so large relative to the market, lost a little more money for the bank in the fourth quarter. The reports added more detail to prior disclosures about the trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money managers that own the stock said they were satisfied with the pay cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been a long-time believer in linking pay to performance, and we think that linkage was made in this case," said Ricardo Duran, a spokesman for the California State Teachers' Retirement System, which owns JPMorgan shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London Whale reports took attention from what otherwise would have been an upbeat day of financial results for Dimon and the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank benefited from significant tailwinds during the fourth quarter, including the Federal Reserve's decision in September to buy $40 billion of mortgage bonds a month, which triggered more trading in fixed-income products and lowered mortgage lending rates at some points during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), the largest standalone U.S. investment bank, also posted stronger profits on Wednesday, helped by rising asset values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan also seemed to have outperformed rivals in some areas. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, in her first conference call for analysts, said JPMorgan had gained market share in deposits, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income rose to $5.69 billion, or $1.39 a share, from $3.73 billion, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had estimated, on average, that the company would report $1.16 a share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed at $46.82 in New York on Wednesday, up 1 percent for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIMON INSUFFICIENTLY SKEPTICAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite fourth quarter profit growth, Dimon said the bank plans to reduce its share buybacks in 2013 in a bid to build capital to meet stricter international standards by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if increased regulatory scrutiny spurred by the Whale loss had played a role in the bank's more conservative plan, Dimon said: "Not really."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report on the Whale loss by the bank's management task force primarily assigns blame to three executives beneath Dimon: Ina Drew, the former chief investment officer; Barry Zubrow, the former risk chief; and Douglas Braunstein, the former chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dimon was not without blame either, according to the task force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(He) could have better tested his reliance on what he was told," the task force said, while also praising him for responding "forcefully" when he learned of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dimon said on Wednesday that the Whale position was close to being a "non-issue" from a trading standpoint, regulators were still probing what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORTGAGE REVS JUMP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial results included a 51 percent surge in JPMorgan's revenue from mortgage production, excluding losses on repurchases of past loans, to $1.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, like Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N), which is the nation's largest home lender, has benefited from being a middleman in the U.S. Federal Reserve's drive to channel inexpensive money to borrowers to support the housing market and the economy. Revenue from making home loans has eased the squeeze on bank profit margins that has come with low interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The provision for credit losses plunged 70 percent to $656 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continued to see favorable credit conditions across our wholesale loan portfolios and strong credit performance in our credit card portfolio," Dimon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call, Dimon said the first quarter of 2013 is "probably okay" for the mortgage business. As the mortgage refinancing boom runs its course, some worry that lending for new purchases will not rise fast enough to offset the decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's stock has more than recovered all of the $26 billion in market value it lost in the first two weeks after the company acknowledged the Whale trade. Dimon said share buybacks were still a good deal at current prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial results and board action came alongside news showing that the bank has many issues to cleanup from the debacle. Reuters reported exclusively on Wednesday that JPMorgan has reached an out-of-court settlement over its lawsuit in London against Javier Martin-Artajo, a former boss of Whale trader Bruno Iksil. JPMorgan had said in July that it would seek to claw back pay from people responsible for the loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry and Emily Flitter in New York, Rick Rothacker in Charlotte, North Carolina and Kirstin Ridley in London.; Writing by Ben Berkowitz and Dan Wilchins; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

were still a good deal at current prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial results and board action came alongside news
showing that the bank has many issues to cleanup from the
debacle. Reuters reported exclusively on Wednesday that JPMorgan
has reached an out-of-court settlement over its lawsuit in
London against Javier Martin-Artajo, a former boss of Whale
trader Bruno Iksil. JPMorgan had said in July that it would seek
to claw back pay from people responsible for the loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman cites significant drop in commodity revenues
    * Lower prices, trading uncertainty weigh
    * Goldman commods VaR $20 mln vs $26 mln year ago
    * JPMorgan commods VaR $14 mln vs $20 mln


    By Barani Krishnan
    NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Wednesday
said its commodities revenue suffered in the final quarter of 2012, while
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co reported a plunge in trading risk from a year ago.
    Analysts said falling oil, metals and grains prices as well as higher
trading uncertainties as the United States appeared headed for a fiscal crisis
toward year-end created a weaker trading environment for commodities.
    Goldman Sachs, Wall Street's leading investment bank, said its value-at-risk
(VaR) in commodities stood at $20 million in the fourth quarter, down from $22
million in the third quarter and $26 million a year ago.
    It said net revenues in fixed income, currency and commodities client
execution totaled $9.91 billion for 2012, or 10 percent higher than in 2011.
    "These increases were partially offset by significantly lower net revenues
in commodities and slightly lower net revenues in currencies," Goldman said,
without providing details.
    It was a rare admission for a bank that was once a powerhouse in various
aspects of the commodities trading business.
    JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, said its commodities VaR was $14 million in
the fourth quarter compared with $13 million in the third quarter and $20
million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
    
    DEPRESSED PRICES, CLOUDY MARKET OUTLOOK
    Analysts have said falling commodity prices in the fourth quarter may be to
blame. 
    "As commodity prices come down, the risk factor diminishes so it's not
surprising to see banks reporting lower VaR numbers," said Peter Cardillo, chief
market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in Melville, New York.
    Commodities prices as indicated by the Thomson Reuters-Jefferies CRB index
 fell nearly 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 following a 9
percent gain in the third quarter.
    In the fourth quarter of 2011, the CRB, which tracks 19 commodities, rose
more than 2 percent.
    Market fears of the "fiscal cliff" and another U.S. economic recession in
2013 also kept markets on tenterhooks through December. A last-minute deal
avoided tax hikes and spending cuts that were scheduled to take effect on Jan.
1.
    "A lot of trading positions in oil, metals and grains were possibly not
taken up in the last quarter due to anxiety over the U.S. 'fiscal cliff,' and
that would have played into the risk levels," said Wojtek Zarzycki, chief
investment officer at Optimal Investing in Toronto.
    
    ONCE COMMODITY LEGENDS
    Over the past two years, commodity trading risks have fallen more than they
have risen at U.S. banks, after new laws passed to limit excessive risk-taking
by financial institutions.
    In their heyday, Goldman and Morgan Stanley ruled Wall Street's
commodities business with a scale, savvy and expertise unmatched by their peers.
    The two ran physical commodity operations, such as oil pipelines and crude
shipping, and also managed huge proprietary trading books that bet large sums of
the banks' own money on energy, metals and agricultural derivatives.
    But their fortunes in commodities began dwindling after the 2008 financial
crisis prompted U.S. regulators to crack down on risk-taking by banks. Since
then, many Wall Street banks have dumped their proprietary trading desks, while
trading and hedging only on clients' orders. 
    In recent years, JPMorgan has stolen some of commodities' luster from
Goldman and Morgan Stanley. 
    Trading mostly metals, before pushing into oil in 2009, JPMorgan has made a
series of risky acquisitions and hires to ramp up its commodities business. In
2011, it reported bumper revenue from the sector.
    
    MORGAN STANLEY, CITI, BOFA DUE NEXT
    Morgan Stanley will disclose its fourth-quarter commodities trading risk in
quarterly results due on Friday.
    Two other banks - Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc -
will issue results a day earlier, but their fourth-quarter risk in commodities
trading will be made known later in a regulatory filing.

Travel 2013: Tours.com's Travel-Intel Gives the Scoop on Air Travel, Vacation
Creation and Even What Disney Is Doing

SAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwire - January 16, 2013) - Airlines may be squishing
in the passengers these days but some recent reports show fewer and fewer
people may be traveling. What does this mean for prices, seat availability and
business travel? The latest issue of Tours.com's Travel-Intel examines just
what's up with flying for 2013 and beyond.

Travel-Intel also sheds light on Cal Jet, a new low-cost airline that is
taking up the challenge -- from California to Texas -- of sending Americans to
Mazatlan on the West Coast of Mexico for some needed RR. The popular
tourist town was hit hard by losing cruise ship business in recent years but
is making a comeback that just might bring with it some of best vacation deals
on the planet.

Disney has been in the limelight lately with a new wristband app that will
make park hopping a breeze. Travel-Intel checks out the "MyMagic+" bracelet
that will forever change the way visitors, plan, purchase, play and navigate
Disney theme parks.

While Travel-Intel looks at reports that show Americans are choosing smaller,
more frequent trips over annual travel extravaganzas, Family Travel editor
Stacey Zable sheds light on a warm place to head this winter for those quick
getaways, where kids -- and puppies -- are welcomed. A review of the
Ritz-Carlton Palm Beach shows that families can have it all, and their pets
can too.

And for those headed farther afield, a new luxury lodge on the Galapagos
Islands may be the perfect getaway from it all. Pikaia Lodge, a member of the
exclusive Kurtz-Ahlers collection, opens in October on a remote island in the
famous archipelago where there are more seals and penguins than people.

Travel-Intel, a division of Tours.com, monitors the travel industry with
weekly newsletters on trends, news and updates about the travel industry sent
to a database of more than 100,000 travel agent subscribers in the U.S. and
Canada.

Although Travel-Intel is direct-mailed, current features and archives can be
viewed at www.travel-intel.com.

"2013 is starting out with a bang," says Lark Ellen Gould, content director
for Travel-Intel and Tours.com. "There is, perhaps, an irrational enthusiasm
building around travel, possibly from pent up demand that is now seeing
action. We can't explain it. We just know that people are putting plans into
motion and the industry is responding with all it's got."

Travel-Intel brings in first-hand and well-researched stories from all over
the globe, reporting from international conferences and destinations and
talking to the brand managers at the helm of the industry.

Gould, a veteran travel journalist who has been covering the travel industry
for more than 20 years, puts her incisive perspective into the weekly
publication, with features and news updates on the 1st and 15th of each month.
These issues are complemented by the Travel-Intel "packages" publication

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) paid a smaller portion of its revenue to employees in 2012, signaling that management at the top Wall Street bank may be listening to shareholders calling for cost controls and higher returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank and asset manager said fourth-quarter earnings nearly tripled as it set aside less of its revenue for pay and earned more from trading. For the full year, employees were paid just 37.9 percent of the bank's revenue, the second-lowest proportion since Goldman went public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't look to overpay anybody," said Harvey Schwartz, a Goldman Sachs trading executive who will become the bank's chief financial officer at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if a smaller share of revenue went to employees, Goldman Sachs managed to increase average employee pay last year because it laid off staff and took in more revenue. In other words, the bank's remaining employees were more productive, but much of the benefit went to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said other banks are likely to feel pressure to keep their compensation expenses in check after Goldman's results. But for Morgan Stanley (MS.N), the second-biggest stand-alone U.S. investment bank, paying out a lower percentage of its revenue to employees could be tough because analysts believe its revenue fell last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman missed the worst pitfalls of the financial crisis but has suffered public relations embarrassments from trades it executed during the crisis and from executives' comments afterward. The bank is struggling to figure out how to navigate the post-crisis world, in which clients trade less and regulations and capital rules crimp profits in many businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAYOFFS, PAY CUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With many banks facing the same problems, analysts expect layoffs across Wall Street. Morgan Stanley plans 1,600 job cuts in 2013, while Goldman cut 900 jobs in 2012, equal to about 3 percent of its work force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But laying staff off will not be enough, and employee pay will likely fall too, analysts said. Brad Hintz, a former Morgan Stanley treasurer who is now an analyst at Bernstein Research, estimates that across Wall Street average pay in trading businesses could fall 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's only one way to get returns up on Wall Street, and that's to cut the compensation of the employees," Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have been pressuring banks to pay less of their revenue to employees. In 2011, investors pressed Morgan Stanley executives to pay somewhere closer to 30 percent of the bank's revenue to employees, instead of around 50 percent, according to one person at those meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman posted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.8 billion, or $5.60 per share, up from $978 million, or $1.84 per share, in the same period a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts' average earnings forecast was $3.78 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RETURN ON EQUITY RISES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting aside less money for pay helped Goldman post a return on equity of 16.5 percent for the fourth quarter on an annualized basis, the highest level in almost three years. The figure is closely watched by investors as a measure of how well the company is wringing profit from shareholders' equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fourth quarter of 2011, the annualized return on equity was 5.8 percent, but before the crisis that figure often topped 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call, Goldman's Schwartz said that what put the bank in a position to boost its return on equity "were the steps we took over the last two years in terms of managing expenses and being quite disciplined."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares rose $5.50 or 4 percent to $141.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant part of Goldman's earnings boom came from improvements in market values in the stock and bond markets, as well as increased activity from clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it took in "significantly higher" revenues from credit products and mortgages in its bond-trading business. Its investing and lending division, which earns money mostly from higher values on Goldman's stock and bond investments, reported nearly $2 billion worth of revenue in the fourth quarter, compared with $872 million a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But gains were broad, with revenue up across each of Goldman's business lines, from investment banking to investment management. Overall, revenue jumped 53 percent to $9.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said compensation expense, typically the biggest cost for Wall Street firms, fell 11 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. The expense was just 21 percent of net revenue, roughly half of what the firm usually pays out to employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the full year, the bank paid employees just 37.9 percent of revenue, the lowest percentage since 2009's 35.8 percent. That year was a record for earnings, but for the last five years the figure has averaged closer to 42 percent. In 2011, the figure was 42.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, Goldman employees earned $399,506 apiece in 2012, up from $367,057 in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the bank agreed to pay $330 million in cash and other assistance to troubled mortgage borrowers to end a case-by-case review of foreclosures required by regulators.

&lt;p&gt;* Staff cuts lower compensation costs in fourth quarter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Q4 profit $5.60 per share vs Street view $3.78 per share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Revenue climbs 53 percent on investment, trading, deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares rise 4 percent

 (Adds analyst quote, details on foreclosure settlement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Lauren Tara LaCapra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc paid a
smaller portion of its revenue to employees in 2012, signaling
that management at the top Wall Street bank may be listening to
shareholders calling for cost controls and higher returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment bank and asset manager said fourth-quarter
earnings nearly tripled as it set aside less of its revenue for
pay and earned more from trading. For the full year, employees
were paid just 37.9 percent of the bank's revenue, the
second-lowest proportion since Goldman went public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't look to overpay anybody," said Harvey Schwartz, a
Goldman Sachs trading executive who will become the bank's chief
financial officer at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if a smaller share of revenue went to employees,
Goldman Sachs managed to increase average employee pay last year
 because it laid off staff and took in more revenue. In other
words, the bank's remaining employees were more productive, but
much of the benefit went to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said other banks are likely to feel pressure to
keep their compensation expenses in check after Goldman's
results. But for Morgan Stanley, the second-biggest
stand-alone U.S. investment bank, paying out a lower percentage
of its revenue to employees could be tough because analysts
believe its revenue fell last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman missed the worst pitfalls of the financial crisis
but has suffered public relations embarrassments from trades it
executed during the crisis and from executives' comments
afterward. The bank is struggling to figure out how to navigate
the post-crisis world, in which clients trade less and
regulations and capital rules crimp profits in many businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAYOFFS, PAY CUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With many banks facing the same problems, analysts expect
layoffs across Wall Street. Morgan Stanley plans 1,600 job cuts
in 2013, while Goldman cut 900 jobs in 2012, equal to about 3
percent of its work force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But laying staff off will not be enough, and employee pay
will likely fall too, analysts said. Brad Hintz, a former Morgan
Stanley treasurer who is now an analyst at Bernstein Research,
estimates that across Wall Street average pay in trading
businesses could fall 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's only one way to get returns up on Wall Street, and
that's to cut the compensation of the employees," Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have been pressuring banks to pay less of their
revenue to employees. In 2011, investors pressed Morgan Stanley
executives to pay somewhere closer to 30 percent of the bank's
revenue to employees, instead of around 50 percent, according to
one person at those meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman posted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.8 billion, or
$5.60 per share, up from $978 million, or $1.84 per share, in
the same period a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts' average earnings forecast was $3.78 per share,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RETURN ON EQUITY RISES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting aside less money for pay helped Goldman post a
return on equity of 16.5 percent for the fourth quarter on an
annualized basis, the highest level in almost three years. The
figure is closely watched by investors as a measure of how well
the company is wringing profit from shareholders' equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fourth quarter of 2011, the annualized return on
equity was 5.8 percent, but before the crisis that figure often
topped 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call, Goldman's Schwartz said that what put
the bank in a position to boost its return on equity "were the
steps we took over the last two years in terms of managing
expenses and being quite disciplined."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares rose $5.50 or 4 percent to $141.09.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant part of Goldman's earnings boom came from
improvements in market values in the stock and bond markets, as
well as increased activity from clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it took in "significantly higher" revenues
from credit products and mortgages in its bond-trading business.
Its investing and lending division, which earns money mostly
from higher values on Goldman's stock and bond investments,
reported nearly $2 billion worth of revenue in the fourth
quarter, compared with $872 million a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But gains were broad, with revenue up across each of
Goldman's business lines, from investment banking to investment
management. Overall, revenue jumped 53 percent to $9.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said compensation expense, typically the biggest
cost for Wall Street firms, fell 11 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier. The expense was just 21 percent of
net revenue, roughly half of what the firm usually pays out to
employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the full year, the bank paid employees just 37.9 percent
of revenue, the lowest percentage since 2009's 35.8 percent.
That year was a record for earnings, but for the last five years
the figure has averaged closer to 42 percent. In 2011, the
figure was 42.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, Goldman employees earned $399,506 apiece in
2012, up from $367,057 in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the bank agreed to pay $330 million in cash and
other assistance to troubled mortgage borrowers to end a

settlement stems from the Litton Loan Servicing business that

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fourth-quarter 2012 (4Q'12) operating results for The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
(Goldman) were better-than-expected, thanks to strengthening revenues combined
with operating efficiency measures, according to Fitch Ratings. Other key
financial characteristics were in line with Fitch's assumptions: notably
conservative liquidity management and solid capital measures. These latest
results have no rating implications. 

Revenues for the latest quarter benefited from higher investment banking
revenues, solid revenue generation in institutional client services combined
with larger gains emanating from the investing and lending segment. Debt
underwriting activity remained strong reflecting tight credit spreads and low
absolute interest rates. Equity underwriting recovered from a weak 3Q'12, while
Goldman retained its relative strength in advisory. 

Institutional client services remained the largest contributor to the revenue
mix despite the effects on customer volumes from macro concerns and the typical
seasonal slowdown. Revenues in this segment declined moderately on a linked
quarter basis when excluding DVA and the 4Q'12 gain of $500 million on the sale
of the hedge fund administration business. This segment posted much better
results year-over-year given the difficult market conditions in 4Q'11. 

Investing and lending revenues were positively affected by realized gains and
mark-to-market adjustments in both equity and credit-related positions. The
contribution from this area tends to be volatile from quarter to quarter
depending on moves in equity markets and credit spreads. Realized gains related
to private equity investments are expected to decrease over time as Goldman
reduces these and similar investment types in anticipation of the Volcker rule.
Asset management revenues improved, owing to higher incentive fees combined with
growth in management fees/assets under supervision. 

Goldman continues to manage liquidity conservatively, while improving already
solid capital ratios. Management is taking a cautious approach to overall risk
levels as indicated by a restrained average VaR. The subdued VaR also reflects
reduced market volatility in recent periods. Operating expenses declined
significantly on a linked quarter basis and were up just 3% year-over-year
reflecting operating efficiency initiatives including a reduction in staff among
other measures. 

Global core excess liquidity, including unencumbered, highly liquid securities
and cash, stood at $175 billion (19% of total assets) at year-end, moderately
higher than the prior quarter. Goldman's Tier I common ratio improved to 14.5%.
Under Basel III, Goldman's Tier I common ratio was estimated at nearly 9%,
compared with 8.5% at prior quarter end.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley will pay a total of $557 million in cash and other assistance to troubled borrowers to end a case-by-case review of past foreclosures required by U.S. regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that the two banks will pay $232 million to eligible borrowers and $325 million in loan modifications and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement is similar to the $8.5 billion deal reached between the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and 10 other bank servicers on January 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deals help the financial industry move a step closer to ending the housing crisis-related problems that have dogged it for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's portion of the settlement is $227 million, according to a person familiar with the agreement, including $97 million in cash and $130 million in the other measures. Goldman will pay $330 million, with $135 million in cash and $195 million from the other pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed had previously ordered Goldman and Morgan Stanley to review foreclosures conducted by mortgage servicing businesses that the two investment banks bought in the run-up to the subprime mortgage crisis and have since sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had owned Litton Loan Servicing LP and Morgan Stanley owned Saxon Capital Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011 and 2012 the government required banks that collect payments on mortgages, known as servicers, to review loan files after widespread mistakes were discovered across the industry in the way they had processed home seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviews were initially expected to determine which borrowers were harmed and compensate them based on their individual experiences, but the reviews proved slow and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, some 220,000 borrowers whose homes were in foreclosure in 2009 and 2010 with Litton or Saxon will receive compensation ranging from hundreds of dollars up to $125,000 depending on the type of possible error, the Fed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Wednesday, Goldman reported fourth-quarter profit of $5.60 per share, boosted by lower compensation combined with big revenue gains. [ID:nL1E9CG1FK] It shares were up 2.8 percent at $139.35 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators said last week the payouts will be based on whether a borrower falls into one of 11 categories. The categories include whether the person was eligible for protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, whether the borrower was not in default, or whether he or she was denied a loan modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed and the OCC are expected to reach similar agreements with other servicers that had been asked to conduct the reviews, including HSBC Holdings Inc, Ally Financial Inc, EverBank Financial Corp and OneWest Bank FSB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said it was pleased to have settled the matter. A Goldman representative had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eligible borrowers should be contacted by the end of March with payment details, the Fed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The risk controls may have changed but many of the preconditions for JP Morgan's epic speculative loss remain - for all too-big-to-fail banks.&lt;/p&gt;

Deposits have poured into the largest banks at least in part because of the, correct, perception that they are too big to be allowed to ever go under.

What is a lot less clear is whether a bank, given lots of government-enabled cash to play with and a malfunctioning central business model, will be able to abstain in future from trading escapades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHRINKING NET INTEREST MARGINS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan reported a 53 percent increase in profits, with standout areas including surging revenue from fees for investment banking and for originating home mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deposits are up 6 percent in the year and the loan to deposit ratio has shrunk to 61 percent, among the lowest in the world and indicating the bank is putting proportionally less of its money to work. JP Morgan's loan-to-deposit ratio was at 75 percent as recently as 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time those loans the bank is making are less profitable. The bank's net interest margin fell again in the quarter, to 2.85 percent, continuing a steady and depressing decline. At the end of 2010 it was 3.51 percent and 3.91 percent for all of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not just JP Morgan's problem. Bank of New York Mellon saw its shares tumble 2.8 pct on Wednesday after it announced a surge in revenues but a worrying decline in margins. Net interest margin at BNY Mellon dwindled to 1.09 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 1.27 percent in the same quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the same story last week with Wells Fargo, which reported strong earnings but saw its shares sell off based largely on poor and declining margins. NIM at Wells fell to 3.56 percent from 3.89 percent a year ago and 3.66 percent in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three banks together form quite a trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what happens from here?

&lt;p&gt;By James Saft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 16 (Reuters) - The risk controls may have changed but
many of the preconditions for JP Morgan's epic speculative loss
remain - for all too-big-to-fail banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPM on Wednesday released both its fourth-quarter earnings
and a 129-page report into the details of its $6.2 billion loss

are a good pair, demonstrating why banks are likely to fall into
the same pattern of taking on principal risk to make up for the
declining profitability of core banking.

here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to understand why JP Morgan found itself so
far out on a limb without reckoning with two facts: it, and
other banks, are awash in deposits, but face dwindling profits
from loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both phenomena can be traced to government policy. Deposits
have poured into the largest banks at least in part because of
the, correct, perception that they are too big to be allowed to
ever go under. Declining net-interest margins, the gap between
what a bank charges on a loan and what it pays for funds, is a
natural offshoot of the very low interest rate environment, a
sort of perverse outcome engineered by the Federal Reserve's
zero interest rate policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all of this is that banks, especially the
largest, are sitting on huge amounts of cash but aren't making
all that much on their loans. That piles on pressure to make
money elsewhere, arguably one of the key forces behind the CIO
debacle. The first thing to understand is that the CIO office
exists exactly because of this imbalance between deposits and

reasonable return equated to revenues of $3.3 billion and

force in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012 the CIO was charged with reducing so-called
risk-weighted assets, a measure the bank wanted to take because
upcoming regulations will place greater strictures on RWA
levels. When push came to shove, however, Ina Drew, head of the
CIO, blanched at the losses cutting back on risk implied and
instead instructed her team to "be more sensitive to the
profit-and-loss impact of their trading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest is history, history ending with a large and
embarrassing loss and entailing failure of management, of models
and of risk controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan may, or may not, have put in new policies which
will address these shortcomings. They certainly say they have.
What is a lot less clear is whether a bank, given lots of
government-enabled cash to play with and a malfunctioning
central business model, will be able to abstain in future from
trading escapades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHRINKING NET INTEREST MARGINS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan reported a 53 percent increase in profits, with
standout areas including surging revenue from fees for
investment banking and for originating home mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deposits are up 6 percent in the year and the loan to
deposit ratio has shrunk to 61 percent, among the lowest in the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 16 (IFR) - Pfizer unit Zoetis on Wednesday
drew strong demand for its debut bond offering, a $3.65 billion
four-part deal that attracted an order book of about $30 billion
and allowed it to sharply tighten pricing from original
guidance, according to market sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which develops and makes animal health
medicines and vaccines, built the order book within hours of
announcing the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That in turn allowed it to tighten guidance by 30-45 basis
points from initial price guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The response to this transaction seems to show that even
though the underlying tone is cautious in the high-grade market,
there is still demand for new names with a growth story," said
one banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of factors seem to have supported the Baa2/BBB-
rated company's first ever bond offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal comes at a time when Zoetis is in the process of
finalizing a $2 billion initial public offering, expected to
launch in the next few days and price before month-end,
according to several sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are leading
the offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will exchange Zoetis Class A shares with affiliates
of the underwriters for outstanding indebtedness of Pfizer. The
underwriters would then sell the shares in the offering and
they, and not Zoetis or Pfizer, will receive the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the offering, Pfizer has said it may make a tax-free
distribution to its shareholders of all or part of its remaining
equity stake in Zoetis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With revenue of $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31
and products sold in more than 120 countries and across eight
core species and five major product categories, Pfizer says
Zoetis is the world's biggest animal health and vaccines
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-IPO bond transaction entails Zoetis selling three-,
five-, 10- and 30-year bonds. Initial price talk was for
Treasuries plus 125 basis points on the three-year, plus 150bp
on the five-year, plus 175bp on the 10-year and plus 205bp on
the 30-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These levels were tightened and the bond sizes set at $400
million of three-years at plus 80bp; $750 million of five-years
at plus 115bp; $1.35 billion of 10-years at plus 145bp; and
$1.15 billion of 30-years at plus 175bp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan 16 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has signed
production-sharing contracts with CNOOC Ltd for two
exploration blocks in the South China Sea, expanding its
presence in the prospective oil and gas region even after
drilling three dry holes there last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through its deal with the Chinese offshore oil firm, Chevron
will own and operate the shallow-water blocks that cover about
2,233 square miles in the Pearl River Mouth Basin, the
second-largest U.S. oil company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploration of the blocks was part of Chevron's plan to
expand in the Asia Pacific region, where it is developing
liquefied natural gas projects as well as deepwater, shale and
sour gas resources, Chevron Vice-Chairman George Kirkland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company will fund and
conduct 3D seismic data surveys in the blocks during the
exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has stakes in several exploration areas in China as
well as operating interests in three deepwater blocks in the
South China Sea, where it drilled the dry holes last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A top Chevron executive said last year that some of the
results of that drilling were "encouraging" and would be used to
help with site selection for a follow-on drilling program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares were up 0.6 percent at $114.14 in afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNOOC has the right to take an interest of up to 51 percent
should oil be found in commercial quantities in the blocks, the
Chinese company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is engaged in disputes with neighbors, including the
Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia, over claims
to parts of South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan 16 - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) recorded net income of $5.7
billion for 4Q'12, flat with the prior quarter, but up 52.7% from the prior
year, according to Fitch Ratings. Performance was supported by strong loan and 
deposit growth, record debt underwriting fees in the investment bank, and
continued stabilization in credit, including a $700 million pre-tax benefit from
lower mortgage reserves in real estate portfolios. Significant items, including 
the reserve benefit, the Independent Foreclosure Review (IFR) settlement, debit 
valuation adjustments (DVA), and other tax benefits, were essentially a wash in 
the quarter. 

JPM began reporting results along its new business lines in the quarter. The 
Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) which combines the former Investment Bank 
and Treasury and Security Services segments had solid performance, which was 
down modestly from the prior quarter when adjusting for the DVA impact and other
factors. Investment banking fees were up on strong debt underwriting and 
advisory revenue, but markets and investor services revenue declined with 
reduced fixed income and equity revenue and included a modest loss on the 
transferred CIO portfolio. The CIB VaR declined in 4Q'12 due to run-off of the 
CIO synthetic credit portfolio and lower volatility in the look-back period. 

Results for the Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment, which includes the
former Retail Financial Services and Card and Auto segments, including mortgage,
were down on a sequential basis given the impact of runoff portfolios and higher
expenses associated with mortgage-related costs. Card, merchant services, and 
auto had a solid quarter with growth in sales and processing volumes. Net 
charge-offs in card hit another record low, but reserve releases in the segment 
were nil given management's expectations that loss rates were at-or-near bottom.


Mortgage banking income was down during the quarter, given the IFR settlement, 
which amounts to about $2 billion including approximately $750 million of cash 
payments. The settlement will reduce firm costs by about $100 million-$150 
million per quarter going forward. Origination volume was up during the quarter,
given the continuation of refinancing activity, and the mortgage repurchase 
liability declined $249 million due to improved cure rates on agency repurchase 
requests.

Loans were up 9% on a core basis, excluding run-off portfolios, and deposits 
continued to grow. Still, the core net interest margin was down 7 basis points 
from 3Q'12 given the low interest rate environment and more limited reinvestment
opportunities. 

Basel III capital ratios rose 30 basis points sequentially, to 8.7% at YE12, 
while the Basel I Tier 1 common ratio was up 60 basis points, to 11%, which 
Fitch considers solid. Fitch expects JPM to continue building capital in 
anticipation of additional capital requirements as a globally systemically 
important financial institution. The firm is targeting a Basel III capital ratio
of 9.5% by YE13. JPM was out of the market for some time in 2012 following 
losses in CIO, but Fitch believes share repurchase activity will be more regular
in 2013. Management indicated that repurchase volume will be less than $3 
billion per quarter, given the appetite to meet Basel III capital targets more 
quickly, which Fitch views favorably. 

Separate from earnings, JPM entered into consent orders with its regulators 
related to reviews associated with CIO trading losses and the Bank's BSA/AML 
policies procedures and controls. The latter order was not anticipated by Fitch 
and related to OCC identified deficiencies associated with BSA/AML compliance 
programs. Fitch believes the firm will work closely with regulators to remediate
any issues associated with the orders, including submitting a written plan 
detailing enhancements to board oversight of compliance with BSA/AML.  

JPM's management task force and board also completed a review of CIO and 
released their respective reports. Many recommendations were consistent with 
those included in the consent orders and have been or are in the process of 
being implemented. Weaknesses highlighted in the reports were also drivers of 
Fitch's downgrade of JPM in May 2012. However, Fitch believes a variety of 
actions have since been taken to strengthen corporate governance at the firm, 
although there is still work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) will pay a total of $557 million in cash and other assistance to troubled borrowers to end a case-by-case review of past foreclosures required by U.S. regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that the two banks will pay $232 million to eligible borrowers and $325 million in loan modifications and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement is similar to an $8.5-billion deal agreed between the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and 10 other bank servicers on January 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deals help the financial industry move a step closer to ending the housing crisis-related problems that have dogged it for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's portion of the settlement is $227 million, according to a person familiar with the agreement, including $97 million in cash and $130 million in the other measures.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Aruna Viswanatha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Jan 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 and Morgan Stanley will pay a total of $557
million in cash and other assistance to troubled borrowers to
end a case-by-case review of past foreclosures required by U.S.
regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that the two
banks will pay $232 million to eligible borrowers and $325
million in loan modifications and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement is similar to an $8.5-billion deal agreed
between the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
and 10 other bank servicers on Jan. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deals help the financial industry move a step closer to
ending the housing crisis-related problems that have dogged it
for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's portion of the settlement is $227 million,
according to a person familiar with the agreement, including $97
million in cash and $130 million in the other measures. Goldman
will pay $330 million, with $135 million in cash and $195
million from the other pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed had previously ordered Goldman and Morgan Stanley to
review foreclosures conducted by mortgage servicing businesses
that the two investment banks bought in the run-up to the
subprime mortgage crisis and have since sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman had owned Litton Loan Servicing LP and Morgan
Stanley owned Saxon Capital Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011 and 2012 the government required banks that collect
payments on mortgages, known as servicers, to review loan files
after widespread mistakes were discovered across the industry in
the way they had processed home seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviews, initially expected to determine which borrowers
were harmed and to compensate them based on their individual
experiences, proved slow and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, some 220,000 borrowers whose homes were in
foreclosure in 2009 and 2010 with Litton or Saxon will receive
compensation ranging from hundreds of dollars up to $125,000
depending on the type of possible error, the Fed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Wednesday, Goldman reported fourth-quarter profit of
$5.60 per share, boosted by lower compensation combined with big
revenue gains. The bank's shares were up 2.8
percent at $139.35 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators said last week the payouts will be based on
whether a borrower falls into one of 11 categories. The
categories include whether the person was eligible for
protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, whether
the borrower was not in default, or whether he or she was denied
a loan modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed and the OCC are expected to reach similar agreements
with other servicers that had been asked to conduct the reviews,
including HSBC Holdings Inc, Ally Financial Inc
, EverBank Financial Corp and OneWest Bank FSB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In separate statements, both Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs said they were pleased to have settled the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eligible borrowers should be contacted by the end of March
with payment details, the Fed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) has reached an out-of-court settlement over its lawsuit against the former boss of Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the "London Whale" for huge bets he took that cost the bank $6.2 billion, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Javier Martin-Artajo, who was Iksil's immediate supervisor, had been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed at London's High Court on October 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said last July it was seeking to claw back pay from those people it held responsible for the losses.

Martin-Artajo and the former CIO head in Europe, Achilles Macris, were among those who left, along with Iksil himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan on Wednesday released a detailed report on the loss from trading positions taken from London for the CIO.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 16 (Reuters) - Peter Weiland, the most senior
risk officer in JPMorgan Chase's Chief Investment Office before
the "London Whale" scandal broke last April, quietly resigned in
October, according to a report released by the bank on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His resignation has not been previously reported in the
press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiland, who was the head of market risk for the CIO until
mid-January 2012, was the most senior risk officer in the bank's
moneymaking office when the derivatives trades that eventually
cost it $6.2 billion were being made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-January 2012, JPMorgan appointed Irvin Goldman chief
risk officer of the CIO, placing him in a position above
Weiland. Goldman held that position until May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report JPMorgan released in conjunction with its
fourth-quarter earnings cited failures in risk management inside
the CIO and by JPMorgan's senior management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CIO risk management made a number of key missteps," the
report said, adding that "the firm did not ensure that the
controls and oversight of CIO evolved commensurately with the
increased complexity and risks of CIO's activities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CIO lost $6.2 billion when positions in a small, opaque
derivatives market quickly lost value under a squeeze by several
hedge funds. From the time the squeeze was first reported in
April to a series of midsummer statements by JPMorgan and CEO
Jamie Dimon, a number of managers inside the bank lost their
jobs or changed positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank conducted an internal investigation into the
incident, and regulators in the U.S. and the U.K. opened their
own inquiries. The bank revealed in July it had found evidence
that some CIO employees in London may have tried to hide losses
in the CIO's books by trying to mismark the values of some
derivatives trades. An investigation by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of investigation is
ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By at least August, Weiland had hired a lawyer to represent
him in the investigations into the trading losses. He continued
to work in risk management in the CIO until October, when he
resigned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiland's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request
for a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 16 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co plans to
reduce share buybacks in 2013 in a bid to build capital to meet
stricter international standards by the end of the year, Chief
Executive Jamie Dimon said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan plans to buy back as much as $3 billion of its own
shares in the first quarter of this year, but less after that,
Dimon said on a conference call with analysts after the largest
U.S. bank reported quarterly results. The bank has been buying
back stock at the rate of about $3 billion per quarter, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has also asked the U.S. Federal Reserve for
approval to increase its quarterly dividend of 30 cents per
share, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves come as part of the capital plan that JPMorgan
submitted to the Fed earlier this year for an annual "stress
test" of major banks' ability to withstand adverse economic
scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more conservative capital stand comes after JPMorgan,
the largest U.S. bank, temporarily halted share buybacks in May,
following trading losses in its Chief Investment Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The losses - known as the "London Whale" trades after the
nickname that hedge fund traders gave to JPMorgan trader Bruno
Iksil - topped $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The losses also led to the bank cutting Dimon's annual bonus
in half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed gave JPMorgan permission in November to resume
buybacks. When asked if increased regulatory scrutiny spurred by
the trades had played a role in the bank's conservative capital
plan, Dimon said: "Not really."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody is doing it, and obviously we should not lag,"
Dimon said of other banks' efforts to meet new Basel III capital
standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank expects its Tier 1 common equity ratio - a measure
of core capital - to exceed 9.5 percent by the end of the year,
making it compliant with the new rules ahead of schedule. The
ratio was at 8.7 percent at the end of the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also wants to make sure it has enough capital under
Fed stress test models, Dimon said, even though the bank doesn't
fully understand them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government's review aims to determine whether 19 large
U.S. banks would have enough capital to weather a severe
recession and continue lending. Bankers have complained that the
Fed's projections differ from their own internal stress tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think under severe stress we'd have plenty of capital,
but last time the Fed's numbers were very different," Dimon
said. "We don't understand that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 19 banks were required to submit their data to the Fed
by Jan. 7, including requests to increase dividends and buy back
more shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed is expected to release stress test results in March.
Banks will also release the results of their own tests this year
under a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.&lt;/p&gt;

dropped to record lows on Wednesday after JP Morgan said it
would include the country's debt in an emerging market index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bond yields have now fallen by around one percentage point
since a December parliamentary election gave leftist Prime
Minister Victor Ponta a mandate to conclude a new deal with the
International Monetary Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JP Morgan announcement overnight drove a further rally
in Romania leu-denominated bonds on Wednesday that took 10-year
yields below 6 percent for the first time, the latest in a
series of successive lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said Romania's potential weight in its flagship
GBI-EM Global Diversified index could be 0.54 percent, given a
market capitalisation of $3.5 billion. The bonds will be 
included from March 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Werner Gey van Pittius, who co-manages Investec's emerging
debt funds, took an overweight position in Romania last year
anticipating its inclusion and estimated the JP Morgan move
could bring almost $1 billion of inflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From benchmark-relative investors like us, there is a lot
of money that will come in for sure but the question is how many
people will have anticipated this already," van Pittius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romania had already been included in a Barclays index in
November and its inclusion in both should increase the pool of
investors and boost the small secondary market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigeria's 10-year yields have fallen more than 4 percentage
points since JP Morgan said last August it would include
Nigerian naira bonds in its GBI-EM index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romania is paying about 5.5-5.6 percent on five-year debt,
already the lowest since the 1989 fall of communism, even though
its benchmark official interest rate is 5.25 percent, far higher
than those of emerging EU peers Poland and Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite recent falls, yields in Hungary - where Prime
Minister Viktor Orban's unconventional policy mix has alarmed
investors - remain a little higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Romanian rally has also helped the leu currency
strengthen to a one-year high of 4.32 against the euro
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Bucharest dealer said there was already high interest in
new Romanian debt issues "and because of Romania's inclusion in
JPM's index, the secondary market will see a boost together with
foreign investors' interest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borrowing costs rose and the currency fell through 2012,
largely because of concerns about policymaking and Ponta's
failed attempt to impeach President Traian Basescu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ponta's election win should bring more predictability to
policymaking and he is expected to replace a 5 billion euro
($6.7 billion) deal with the IMF with a new agreement after
March, which would act as an important vote of confidence in his
economic policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts and dealers expect Bucharest to take advantage of
the market rally to front-load sales and say bonds could rally
to 5.25 percent for paper longer than one year, with the leu
strengthening as far as 4.25 per euro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a budget gap set to fall below 3 percent of gross
domestic product for 2012 and gross debt at one of the lowest
levels in the European Union, Romania has already sold 6.9
billion lei ($2.1 billion) in local currency debt in January,
more than a third of its target for the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also wants to raise 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion) on
international markets for the whole year.

&lt;p&gt;* Inclusion in JPMorgan's debt index boost Romanian bonds
    * Leu hits one-year high, Romanian yields at record lows
    * Verbal interventions, expected rate cuts pressure zloty

    By Sam Cage and Karolina Slowikowska
    BUCHAREST/WARSAW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Romanian bond yields
fell to record lows on Wednesday and the leu hit a one-year high
after JPMorgan included the country's debt in its
emerging market index.
    The news pushed Romanian yields 15 basis points lower. It
and a similar move by Barclays in November should increase the
pool of investors and increase liquidity in the small market.
    Yields on Romania's five-year bonds were down to about
5.5-5.6 percent, the lowest level since 1989.
    "Because of Romania's inclusion in JPMorgan's index, the
secondary market will see a boost together with foreign investor
interest," said a Bucharest dealer.
    Bond yields have already fallen by up to 50 basis points
along the curve since the December 9 election, which calmed
unease over the country's governance and political stability,
and more strength is expected ahead. 
    "We expect the rally to continue, due to a convergence
trade, a realignment of local rates, support from inclusion in
the local bond indices and reasonable fundamentals," said
UniCredit analyst Dan Bucsa.
    The Romanian leu also drew support from JPMorgan's move,
outperforming other currencies in the region, which are under
pressure from verbal interventions and expected rate cuts ahead.
    At 1430 GMT, the leu traded at 4.32 against the
euro, its highest level since January 2012.
    Elsewhere in the region, the Hungarian forint and Poland's
zloty, which have all lost more than 1 percent in January on the
prospect of lower interest rates and official comments seeking
to weaken currencies, fell on Wednesday.
    The forint led the region's losses, also hit by
expectations that a soon-to-be-appointed new central bank
governor will flood the economy with cheap credit using
unconventional tools 
    The forint shed 0.5 percent against the euro.
    The zloty was down 0.4 percent against the euro,
under pressure from finance ministry officials who have been
highlighting threats from the strong currency to the slowing
economy. 
    Expectations that Friday's industrial output data may
disappoint also undermined the zloty, dealers said. Analysts
polled by Reuters forecast a 7 percent annual drop in output in
December. 
     The Czech crown was relatively stable on
Wednesday.

Sprint receives 2012 Customer Value Enhancement Award; its growing cloud
portfolio helps businesses work easier
OVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(Business Wire)--
Sprint (NYSE: S) has received the 2012 North American Customer Value Enhancement
Award in Mobile Communications and Collaboration for its cloud-enabled Microsoft
Office 365 offer, which includes the unique Carefree Cloud "white glove"
migration and onboarding assistance, along with online support resources and a
user friendly portal to manage the services. Specifically, Frost &amp; Sullivan`s
report states, "Its Microsoft Office 365 solution reflects a sharpened
understanding of U.S. small business needs and offers the most attractive
offering in a hotly contested field."

Frost &amp; Sullivan`s research reveals that the key factors that have contributed
to Sprint`s excellence in customer value enhancement are as follows: 1) Products
with capabilities that are designed to meet the specific requirements and needs
of smaller U.S. businesses, 2) Expert, hands-on support - especially during the
onboarding and deployment stage, and 3) An emphasis on providing affordability
and minimizing risk exposure. Click here to view more details about Frost &amp;
Sullivan`s research. 

"We felt we offered a unique approach that would minimize the risk for small and
mid-sized businesses to adopt cloud services, as well as offer them the level of
migration and ongoing support they need. We`re pleased to receive this
validation from Frost &amp; Sullivan," said John Dupree, senior vice president of
business sales - Sprint. "Sprint is focused on simplifying cloud solutions for
businesses with an enhanced experience and continued network investment they can
trust not just today, but as their cloud and mobile data demands and business
challenges evolve." 

"We firmly believe that Sprint stands out among its peers by offering not only a
tightly integrated, professional communications solution in Microsoft Office
365; the wireless provider also meets real small business needs by providing its
personalized "Carefree Cloud" onboarding and migration services at no additional
charge," said Jeanine Sterling, Principal Analyst - Frost &amp; Sullivan. "Too
often, technology can act as a barrier instead of as an enabler. Sprint doesn`t
leave small businesses to just cope with day-to-day demands on their own, but
instead serves as a true growth partner. These actions place the company in a
leadership position, enhancing the value that its fortunate customers receive in
this much-needed solution category." 

Small to mid-sized businesses enjoy Microsoft Office 365 offered by Sprint

Businesses enjoy predictable monthly costs with no up-front infrastructure
expense, pay-as-you-go plans and savings by bundling all of the necessary tools
as well as a single bill and single point-of-contact for all Sprint-bundled
services. Productivity Suites from Sprint build on the features of Office 365 by
adding extended technical support through IT Helpdesk from Sprint to keep a
business up and running without the expense of a dedicated IT staff or
outsourced consultant. 

Sprint simplifies the purchase, early life, and ongoing support processes with
Carefree Cloud along with online support resources and a user-friendly portal to
manage the services. Carefree Cloud is available with ALL Office 365 plans
offered by Sprint at no additional charge (the onboarding and migration services
portion of Carefree Cloud is provided at no additional charge when used within
the first 90 days of purchase) to all employees within a business so companies
have the flexibility to receive the level of migration and ongoing support they
need. 

A comprehensive approach to cloud

Teaming with leaders in software and cloud computing while enhancing the
services with seamless integration of mobility for virtually anytime, anywhere
access from any device is key to Sprint`s cloud strategy. With reliable, secure
connectivity over Sprint`s 3G, 4G and all-IP Global MPLS networks, businesses of
all sizes can confidently embrace a variety of hosted services to improve their
productivity and cost structures. 

Sprint has significantly expanded its cloud-based solutions portfolio this year,
focusing on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with Microsoft Office 365,
Unified-Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS) with Sprint Complete Collaboration
and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) to be launched in the coming months.
Sprint also delivers an innovative private-label cloud services platform to
wholesale customers today, enabling them to quickly deliver simple and
affordable brand-name software services to SMBs.

&lt;p&gt;If you have a bit of time today, the official JP Morgan post mortem on the London Whale affair is well worth reading. The whole thing is 132 pages long, although the executive summary  which is very clearly written  is only 17 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing the report certainly does is reinforce my conviction that you cant hedge tail risk. The losses all took place in something called the Synthetic Credit Portfolio, which was described as a &#8220;Tail Risk Book&#8221;  something designed to make money when the market environment moves more than three standard deviations from the mean based on predictions from a normal distribution of historical prices. In other words, JP Morgan is well aware that market moves are not normally distributed, and therefore it has a whole derivatives book in place to protect itself against inevitable unexpected events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole point about tail risk, however (a/k/a black swans) is that you cant anticipate exactly what its going to look like before you see it. In this case, the biggest tail event was the publication of stories, in the WSJ and Bloomberg, talking about JP Morgans positions. Those stories had a massive effect on the mark-to-market valuation of JP Morgans positions At the beginning of the first trading day after the stories appeared, it looked as though JP Morgan might be facing a one-day loss of $700 million; in the event, the final official number was $412 million. Ina Drew, the person in charge of the portfolio, sent an email to JP Morgans CEO and CFO, in which she observed that the move was an eight-standard-deviation event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report doesnt say how many eight-sigma events the CIO has ever seen: my guess is that this is the only one. But heres an idea of how crazy eight-sigma events are: under a normal distribution, theyre meant to happen with a probability of roughly one in 800 trillion. The universe, by contrast, is roughly 5 trillion days old: you could run the universe a hundred times, under a normal distribution, and still never see an eight-sigma event. If anything was a black swan, this was a black swan. And it didnt help JP Morgans tail risk book one bit. Quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing the report does is show just how difficult it is for any large organization to actually implement what managers want. At JP Morgan, for instance  where the CEO has an unusually large degree of power and knowledge of what is going on  the whole firm was meant to be reducing its &#8220;risk-weighted assets&#8221;, or RWA, since the higher a banks RWA, the more capital it needs under Basel III. And yet somehow, by the time this directive trickled down to the London Whale, it had been watered down and misinterpreted to the point at which the offices RWA actually went up  substantially  rather than down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whats more, theres a constant theme running through the report of managers being told what they want to hear, rather than the truth, especially with regard to substantial losses. When those appear, no one wants to tell Ina Drew about them; instead, the traders do everything they can to try to either fudge the numbers or attempt to trade their way out of the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, one way that numbers were fudged was to use the favorite tool of quants around the world, the Monte Carlo analysis. After the Bloomberg and WSJ stories appeared, for instance, one trader drew up an analysis of just how bad the position could get. He modeled nine extreme event like a &#8220;bond market crash&#8221; or a &#8220;Middle East shock&#8221;, and found that in six of them, the portfolio lost money, with the losses ranging from $350 million to $750 million. This analysis did not go down well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trader sent his loss estimates to the other on April 7. According to the trader who prepared the loss estimates, the other trader responded that he had just had a discussion with Ms. Drew and another senior team member, and that he (the latter trader) wanted to see a different analysis. Specifically, he informed the trader who had generated the estimates that he had too many negative scenarios in his initial work, and that he was going to scare Ms. Drew if he said they could lose more than $200 or $300 million. He therefore directed that trader to run a so- called &#8220;Monte Carlo&#8221; simulation to determine the potential losses for the second quarter. A Monte Carlo simulation involves running a portfolio through a series of scenarios and averaging the results. The trader who had generated the estimates did not believe the Monte Carlo simulation was a meaningful stress analysis because it included some scenarios in which the Synthetic Credit Portfolio would make money which, when averaged together with the scenarios in which it lost money, would result in an estimate that was relatively close to zero. He performed the requested analysis, however, and sent the results to the other trader in a series of written presentations over the course of the weekend. This work was the basis for a second-quarter loss estimate of -$150 million to +$250 million provided to senior Firm management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event, of course, the portfolio ended up losing not $150 million, not even $750 million, but more like $6 billion, with some $800 million of those losses taking place in the six trading days leading up to April 30, long before the decision was made to liquidate the position. Which just goes to show how useful stress tests are. (Remember, the initial worst-case estimates were put together after the WSJ and Bloomberg stories appeared, which means that JP Morgan was acutely aware, at this point, of the risk that the market would move against them just because their positions were public.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one big omission in the report  and thats any discussion of how the ultimate losses in the portfolio grew to be so enormous. Where did the initial $2 billion estimate come from, and how did it grow to $6 billion by the time all was said and done? The report basically ends when the potential losses were made public, and doesnt spend any time discussing how Jamie Dimon and his senior executives handled everything from there on in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of JP Morgans shareholders, there are two big things to worry about in this whole episode. The first is weaknesses in risk management, which the report goes into in great detail. The second is the way that senior management responds to a crisis, and whether it can do so while keeping its head and minimizing losses. On that front, the report is silent. Did a panicked reaction to the early losses result in a dump everything immediately response which ended up causing an extra $4 billion in damage? Who was responsible for those $4 billion in losses, and how avoidable were they? Those questions are never asked, let alone answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan has looked in great detail at its crisis-prevention architecure: its time, now, too look at its crisis-response architecture, too. Because sometimes, it seems, the latter can cause more damage than the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Seeks $1 billion price&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jessica Toonkel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group is
seeking a buyer for a majority stake of its $1.4 billion
reinsurance group, according to a copy of its January
presentation to potential buyers that was viewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is trying to sell 75 percent of Goldman Sachs
Reinsurance Group, now renamed Global Atlantic, for around $1
billion, according to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment. The Insurance
Insider first reported Goldman was looking to sell the
reinsurance group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move to sell control of the reinsurance unit, which
generates a steady stream of fees, comes less than a year after
Goldman bought Ariel Re's Bermuda-based insurance and
reinsurance operations in April. Banks including Goldman Sachs
are looking to sell businesses they see as non-core to meet new
capital requirements..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic is composed of a $950 million life and

its fourth-quarter earnings release Wednesday morning, marking

tripled, driven by big gains in stock and bond values, increased
revenue from deal making and lower compensation expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported earnings of
$2.8 billion, or $5.60 per share, up from $978 million, or $1.84

&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs earnings jump&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Japan airlines ground Dreamliners after emergency landing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Dell buyout talks advance, shares slip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Futures off: Dow 45 pts, S 4.6 pts, Nasdaq 1 pt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures
slipped on Wednesday with shares of Boeing set to weigh
on the market after two Japanese airlines grounded their
Dreamliner fleets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co said fourth-quarter net income
jumped 53 percent and earnings for 2012 set a record, while
earnings at Goldman Sachs nearly tripled. Goldman shares
rose 2.2 percent in premarket trading; JPMorgan slipped 0.9
percent in choppy trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly, the near-term focus is on earnings more than
anything else, specifically on financials," said Art Hogan,
managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Dow component Boeing slumped 4.7 percent in
premarket trading on concerns about the safety of its new
Dreamliner passenger jets. Japan's two leading airlines grounded
their fleets of 787s on Wednesday after one of the aircraft made
an emergency landing, adding to safety concerns triggered by a
ream of recent incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's hard to know if it is a series of coincidences, but it
is certainly putting pressure on Boeing this morning," Hogan
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S 500 futures fell 4.6 points and were below fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 45
points, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1 point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow and S 500 rose Tuesday after
stronger-than-expected retail data, with the S closing at a
fresh five-year high of 1,472.34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks to take Dell Inc private were at an advanced
stage, with at least four major banks lined up to provide
financing, two sources with knowledge of the matter told
Reuters. Shares fell 3.2 percent in premarket trading, after
jumping more than 21 percent over the past two sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the data front, the Labor Department releases December
Real Earnings and Consumer Price Index at 8:30 a.m. ET(1330
GMT). Economists in a Reuters survey expect an unchanged CPI
reading, while excluding food and energy items CPI is seen up
0.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real Earnings are seen a 0.3 percent higher, compared with a
0.5 percent rise in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slow economic recovery in developed nations is holding
back the global economy, the World Bank said, as it sharply cut
its outlook for world growth in 2013. Global gross domestic
product will rise 2.4 percent this year, the bank said, down
from its June forecast of 3.0 percent growth in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said its

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported

revenue rising 53 percent to $9.2 billion from $6 billion in the

Net Revenues

Investment Banking

Full Year
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $4.93 billion for 2012, 13% higher than
2011. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $1.98 billion, essentially
unchanged compared with 2011. Net revenues in the firm`s Underwriting business
were $2.95 billion, 25% higher than 2011, due to strong net revenues in debt
underwriting. Net revenues in debt underwriting were significantly higher
compared with 2011, primarily reflecting higher net revenues from
investment-grade and leveraged finance activity. Net revenues in equity
underwriting were lower compared with 2011, primarily reflecting a decline in
industry-wide initial public offerings. 

Fourth Quarter
Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.41 billion for the fourth quarter of
2012, 64% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011 and 21% higher than the third
quarter of 2012. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $508 million, 8% higher
than the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting an increase in
industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions. Net revenues in the firm`s
Underwriting business were $897 million, more than double the amount in the
fourth quarter of 2011. Net revenues in both debt underwriting and equity
underwriting were significantly higher compared with the fourth quarter of 2011,
primarily reflecting an increase in industry-wide activity. 

The firm`s investment banking transaction backlog increased compared with both
the end of the third quarter of 2012 and the end of 2011. (8)

Institutional Client Services

Full Year
Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $18.12 billion for 2012, 5%
higher than 2011. 

Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were
$9.91 billion for 2012, 10% higher than 2011. These results reflected strong net
revenues in mortgages, which were significantly higher compared with 2011. In
addition, net revenues in credit products and interest rate products were solid
and higher compared with 2011. These increases were partially offset by
significantly lower net revenues in commodities and slightly lower net revenues
in currencies. Although broad market concerns persisted during 2012, Fixed
Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in a generally
improved environment characterized by tighter credit spreads and less
challenging market-making conditions compared with 2011. 

Net revenues in Equities were $8.21 billion for 2012, essentially unchanged
compared with 2011. Net revenues in securities services were significantly
higher compared with 2011, reflecting a gain of approximately $500 million on
the sale of the firm`s hedge fund administration business. In addition, equities
client execution net revenues were higher than 2011, primarily reflecting
significantly higher results in cash products, principally due to increased
levels of client activity. These increases were partially offset by lower
commissions and fees, reflecting lower market volumes. During 2012, Equities
operated in an environment generally characterized by an increase in global
equity prices and lower volatility levels. 

The net loss attributable to the impact of changes in the firm`s own credit
spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $714
million ($433 million and $281 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and
Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively) for
2012, compared with a net gain of $596 million ($399 million and $197 million
related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities
client execution, respectively) for 2011. 

Fourth Quarter
Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $4.34 billion for the fourth
quarter of 2012, 42% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011 and 4% higher than
the third quarter of 2012. 

Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were
$2.04 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012, 50% higher than the fourth quarter
of 2011, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in credit products and
mortgages compared with difficult market-making conditions during the fourth
quarter of 2011, and higher net revenues in currencies. These increases were
partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in commodities and lower
net revenues in interest rate products. During the fourth quarter of 2012, Fixed
Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in an environment
characterized by generally tighter credit spreads and improved activity levels
in credit products and mortgages compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. 

Net revenues in Equities were $2.30 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012, 36%
higher than the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting significantly higher net
revenues in securities services and equities client execution. The increase in
securities services net revenues compared with the fourth quarter of 2011
reflected a gain of approximately $500 million on the sale of the firm`s hedge
fund administration business. The increase in equities client execution net
revenues compared with the fourth quarter of 2011 reflected significantly higher
net revenues in derivatives and higher net revenues in reinsurance. These
increases were partially offset by lower commissions and fees, reflecting lower
market volumes. During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment
generally characterized by low volatility levels and an increase in equity
prices in Asia and Europe. 

The net loss attributable to the impact of changes in the firm`s own credit
spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $126
million ($79 million and $47 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and
Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively) for
the fourth quarter of 2012. The net gain attributable to the impact of changes
in the firm`s own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option
was elected was $20 million (all related to equities client execution) for the
fourth quarter of 2011. 

Investing &amp; Lending

Full Year
Net revenues in Investing &amp; Lending were $5.89 billion for 2012. Investing &amp;
Lending net revenues were positively impacted by tighter credit spreads and an
increase in global equity prices. Results for 2012 included a gain of $408
million from the firm`s investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC), net gains of $2.39 billion from other
investments in equities, primarily in private equities, net gains and net
interest income of $1.85 billion from debt securities and loans, and other net
revenues of $1.24 billion, principally related to the firm`s consolidated
investment entities. 

Fourth Quarter
Net revenues in Investing &amp; Lending were $1.97 billion for the fourth quarter of
2012. Investing &amp; Lending net revenues were positively impacted by generally
tighter credit spreads and an increase in equity prices in Asia and Europe.
Results for the fourth quarter of 2012 included a gain of $334 million from the
firm`s investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, net gains of $789 million from
other investments in equities, primarily in private equities, net gains and net
interest income of $485 million from debt securities and loans, and other net
revenues of $365 million, principally related to the firm`s consolidated
investment entities. 

Investment Management

Full Year
Net revenues in Investment Management were $5.22 billion for 2012, 4% higher
than 2011, due to significantly higher incentive fees, partially offset by lower
transaction revenues and slightly lower management and other fees. During the
year, assets under supervision (9) increased $70 billion to $965 billion. Assets
under management increased $26 billion to $854 billion, reflecting net market
appreciation of $44 billion, primarily in fixed income and equity assets,
partially offset by net outflows of $18 billion. Net outflows included outflows
in equity, alternative investment and money market assets, partially offset by
inflows in fixed income assets (10). Other client assets increased $44 billion
to $111 billion, primarily due to net inflows (10). 

Fourth Quarter
Net revenues in Investment Management were $1.52 billion for the fourth quarter
of 2012, 20% higher than the fourth quarter of 2011 and 26% higher than the
third quarter of 2012. The increase in net revenues compared with the fourth
quarter of 2011 was primarily due to significantly higher incentive fees and
higher management and other fees. During the quarter, assets under supervision
increased $14 billion to $965 billion. Assets under management decreased $2
billion to $854 billion, reflecting net outflows of $7 billion (10), partially
offset by net market appreciation of $5 billion. Net outflows included outflows
in fixed income, equity and alternative investment assets, partially offset by
inflows in money market assets. Other client assets increased $16 billion to
$111 billion, primarily due to net inflows. 

Expenses

Operating expenses were $22.96 billion for 2012, essentially unchanged compared
with 2011. 

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, discretionary
compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits)
were $12.94 billion for 2012, 6% higher than 2011. The ratio of compensation and
benefits to net revenues for 2012 was 37.9% compared with 42.4% for 2011. Total
staff (11) decreased 3% compared with the end of 2011. 

Non-Compensation Expenses

Full Year
Non-compensation expenses were $10.01 billion for 2012, 4% lower than 2011. The
decrease compared with 2011 primarily reflected the impact of expense reduction
initiatives, lower brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, lower
occupancy expenses and lower impairment charges. These decreases were partially
offset by higher other expenses and increased reserves related to the firm`s
reinsurance business. The increase in other expenses compared with 2011
primarily reflected higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory
proceedings and higher charitable contributions. 

Fourth Quarter
Non-compensation expenses were $2.95 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012, 14%
higher than the fourth quarter of 2011 and 24% higher than the third quarter of
2012. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2011 was due to higher
other expenses. The increase in other expenses primarily reflected higher net
provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and higher charitable
contributions. 

The fourth quarter of 2012 included $260 million of net provisions for
litigation and regulatory proceedings (including the settlement with the Federal
Reserve Board regarding the independent foreclosure review) and $157 million of
charitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives. The fourth quarter of 2011
included $47 million of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings
and $78 million of charitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives. Compensation
was reduced in both 2012 and 2011 to fund the charitable contribution to Goldman
Sachs Gives. 

Provision for Taxes

The effective income tax rate for 2012 was 33.3%, essentially unchanged from
33.5% for the first nine months of 2012 and up from 28.0% for 2011. The increase
from 28.0% to 33.3% was primarily due to the earnings mix and a decrease in the
impact of permanent benefits. 

Capital

As of December 31, 2012, total capital was $243.02 billion, consisting of $75.72
billion in total shareholders` equity (common shareholders` equity of $69.52
billion and preferred stock of $6.20 billion) and $167.30 billion in unsecured
long-term borrowings. Book value per common share was $144.67, an increase of
approximately 11% compared with the end of 2011 and approximately 3% compared
with the end of the third quarter of 2012. Tangible book value per common share
(3) was $134.06, an increase of approximately 12% compared with the end of 2011
and approximately 3% compared with the end of the third quarter of 2012. Book
value and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares
outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no
future service requirements, of 480.5 million as of December 31, 2012. 

On October 24, 2012, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.) issued 34,000
shares of perpetual 5.95% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series I (Series I

an average cost per share of $110.31, for a total cost of $4.64 billion,
including 12.7 million shares during the fourth quarter at an average cost per
share of $120.11, for a total cost of $1.53 billion. The remaining share
authorization under the firm`s existing repurchase program is 21.5 million
shares. (12)

Under the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to bank holding
companies (Basel 1), the firm`s Tier 1 capital ratio (6) was 16.7% (5) and the
firm`s Tier 1 common ratio (7) 
      was 14.5% (5) as of December 31, 2012, up from 15.0% and 13.1%,
respectively, compared with September 30, 2012.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead
represent only the firm`s beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by
their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm`s control. It is
possible that the firm`s actual results and financial condition may differ,
possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition
indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the
risks and important factors that could affect the firm`s future results and
financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm`s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. 

Certain of the information regarding the firm`s capital ratios, risk-weighted
assets, total assets, level 3 assets and global core excess liquidity consist of
preliminary estimates. These estimates are forward-looking statements and are
subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its financial
statements. 

Statements about the firm`s investment banking transaction backlog also may
constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk
that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be
completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually
earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those
currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the
terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case
of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general
economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities
markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the
securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the
securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse
development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a
required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that
could adversely affect the firm`s investment banking transactions, see "Risk
Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of the firm`s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2011.

 (3)    Tangible common shareholders' equity equals total shareholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Tangible book value per common  
        share is computed by dividing tangible common shareholders` equity by the number of common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with 
        no future service requirements. Management believes that tangible common shareholders` equity and tangible book value per common share are meaningful because they are    
        measures that the firm and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common shareholders` equity and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP measures  
        and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The table below presents the reconciliation of total shareholders' equity to tangible     
        common shareholders' equity:

 (6)     The Tier 1 capital ratio equals Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. The firm`s risk-weighted assets under the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve       
         System`s risk-based capital requirements (Basel 1) were approximately $400 billion as of December 31, 2012. For a further discussion of the firm's capital ratios, see    
         "Equity Capital" in Part I, Item 2 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for 
         the period ended September 30, 2012.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (7)     The Tier 1 common ratio equals Tier 1 common capital divided by risk-weighted assets. As of December 31, 2012, Tier 1 common capital was $58.05 billion, consisting of    
         Tier 1 capital of $66.98 billion less preferred stock of $6.20 billion and junior subordinated debt issued to trusts of $2.73 billion. Management believes that the Tier 1 
         common ratio is meaningful because it is one of the measures that the firm and investors use to assess capital adequacy. The Tier 1 common ratio is a non-GAAP measure and 
         may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. For a further discussion of the firm's capital ratios, see "Equity Capital" in Part I, Item 2 
         "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30,    
         2012.                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 (8)     The firm`s investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of the firm`s future net revenues from investment banking transactions where management believes 
         that future revenue realization is more likely than not.

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported net income for the
fourth-quarter of 2012 of $5.7 billion, compared with net income of $3.7 billion
in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings per share were $1.39, compared with
$0.90 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenue1 for the quarter was $24.4 billion,
up 10% compared with the prior year. The Firm`s return on tangible common
equity1 for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 15%, compared with 11% in the prior
year. 

Net income for full-year 2012 was a record $21.3 billion, compared with $19.0
billion for the prior year. Earnings per share were a record $5.20 for 2012,
compared with $4.48 for 2011. Revenue1 for 2012 was $99.9 billion, flat compared
with 2011. 

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. also announced today that the Firm`s Management Task Force
and the independent Review Committee of the Firm`s Board of Directors (the
"Board Review Committee") have each concluded their reviews relating to the 2012
losses by the Firm`s Chief Investment Office ("CIO") and have released their
respective reports. Both reports are available on the Firm`s website and are
discussed at greater length in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC today. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the financial
results: "For the third consecutive year, the Firm reported both record net
income and a return on tangible common equity1 of 15%. The Firm`s results
reflected strong underlying performance across virtually all our businesses for
the fourth quarter and the full year, with strong lending and deposit growth. We
also maintained our leadership positions and continued to gain market share in
key areas of our franchise. As we highlight upfront in this release, there were
several significant items that affected our results this quarter, but they
largely offset each other." 

Dimon added: "We continued to see favorable credit conditions across our
wholesale loan portfolios and strong credit performance in our credit card
portfolio, where charge-off rates remain at historic lows. The real estate
portfolios, while at elevated levels of losses, continued to show improvement as
the housing market and economy continued to recover. As a result, we reduced the
related allowance for credit losses by $700 million in the fourth quarter and we
are likely to continue to see reductions in the allowance as the environment
improves." 

Commenting on the balance sheet, Dimon said: "We strengthened our fortress
balance sheet, ending the fourth quarter with a strong Basel I Tier 1 common
ratio1 of 11.0%, up from 10.4% in the third quarter. We estimate that our Basel
III Tier 1 common ratio1 was approximately 8.7% 3 at the end of the fourth
quarter, up from 8.4% in the third quarter." 

Dimon added: "During the course of 2012, JPMorgan Chase was able to make more of
an impact on our communities than ever before. The Firm provided credit1 and
raised capital of over $1.8 trillion for our clients during the year. This
included $20 billion for small businesses, up 18%. We also originated more than
920,000 mortgages; provided credit cards to about 6.7 million people; and raised
capital and provided credit1 of approximately $85 billion for nearly 1,500
not-for-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities,
hospitals and universities. As part of the 100,000 Jobs Mission, which JPMorgan
Chase helped launch, since the beginning of 2011, the Firm has hired nearly
5,000 U.S. veterans and members of the National Guard and Reserve; and, through
our nonprofit partners, we have provided 386 mortgage-free homes for deserving
veterans and their families." 

"We are committed to doing our part to speed the recovery of the housing market.
This includes working with struggling homeowners to modify their loans, or
pursue other options to allow them to prevent foreclosure. Through these
efforts, since 2009, we have offered more than 1.4 million mortgage
modifications and completed 610,000 for both loans we own and those we service
for others. With respect to Chase-owned mortgages, through modifications and
short-sales, we have effectively forgiven more than $10 billion of principal and
reduced borrowers` interest payments by approximately $2 billion. Our efforts
are not only helping people, they are also helping set the stage for a recovery
in America`s housing market, which will ultimately reward our customers,
shareholders and communities alike." 

Dimon concluded: "We are particularly proud that, through the turbulence of
recent years, we never stopped serving clients and investing in the future of
our franchise - opening new offices and branches, adding bankers in key markets,
innovating and gaining market share. The capital strength and earnings power of
the Firm is as strong as it has ever been, and our 260,000 employees are doing
more than ever to serve our customers and clients, and support our communities
around the world. Challenges still exist, but as we look forward to 2013, we
remain optimistic."

Firm, information is presented on a managed basis. For more information about

 Discussion of Results:                                                       
 
Net income was $2.0 billion, compared with $1.6 billion in the prior year.  


Net revenue was $12.4 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 10%, compared
with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.3 billion, down $220 million, or
3%, driven by lower deposit margins and lower loan balances due to portfolio
runoff, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $5.1
billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 37%, driven by higher mortgage fees and
related income. 

The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, compared with $1.8 billion in
the prior year and $1.9 billion in the prior quarter. The current-quarter
provision reflected a $700 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses
and total net charge-offs of $1.8 billion. The prior-quarter provision reflected
a $955 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net
charge-offs of $2.8 billion, including $880 million of incremental charge-offs
reported in accordance with regulatory guidance for Chapter 7 loans. For more
information, see the Consumer Credit Portfolio section of the Firm`s Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. 

Noninterest expense was $8.0 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion from the prior
year, driven by costs related to mortgage-related matters, including the impact
of the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement and the write-off of intangible
assets associated with a non-strategic relationship in Credit Card.

Consumer &amp; Business Banking reported net income of $756 million, a decrease of
$36 million, or 5%, compared with the prior year. 

Net revenue was $4.3 billion, down 1% from the prior year. Net interest income
was $2.6 billion, down 3% compared with the prior year, driven by the impact of
lower deposit margin, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest
revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by higher debit card revenue
and investment sales revenue, partially offset by lower deposit-related fees. 

The provision for credit losses and net charge-offs were both $110 million
(2.36% net charge-off rate), compared with $132 million (3.02% net charge-off
rate) in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, up 2% from the prior year, largely driven
by new branch builds.

Mortgage Banking reported net income of $418 million, compared with a net loss
of $269 million in the prior year. 

Net revenue was $3.3 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion compared with the
prior year. Net interest income was $1.2 billion, down $94 million. Noninterest
revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, driven by higher mortgage
fees and related income. 

The provision for credit losses reflected a benefit of $269 million2, compared
with provision expense of $647 million in the prior year. The current quarter
reflected a $700 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. 

Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion from the prior
year. The current quarter included approximately $900 million of expense for
mortgage-related matters, including approximately $700 million for the impact of
the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement. 

Mortgage Production reported pretax income of $789 million, an increase of $628
million from the prior year. Mortgage production-related revenue, excluding
repurchase losses, was $1.6 billion, an increase of $543 million, or 51%, from
the prior year. These results reflected wider margins, driven by favorable
market conditions, and higher volumes due to historically low interest rates and
the Home Affordable Refinance Programs ("HARP"). Production expense2 was $876
million, an increase of $358 million from the prior year, reflecting higher
volumes and an expense for additional litigation reserves. Repurchase losses for
the current quarter reflected a benefit of $53 million, compared with a loss of
$390 million in the prior year and a loss of $13 million in the prior quarter.
The current quarter reflected a $249 million reduction in the repurchase
liability and lower realized repurchase losses compared with prior year and
prior quarter, primarily driven by improved cure rates on Agency repurchase
demands. 

Mortgage Servicing reported a pretax loss of $913 million, compared with a
pretax loss of $586 million in the prior year. Mortgage servicing revenue,
including amortization, was $618 million, a decrease of $98 million, or 14%,
from the prior year. Mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") risk management income
was $42 million, compared with a loss of $377 million in the prior year.

8% from the prior quarter; Retail channel originations (branch and
direct-to-consumer) were $26.4 billion, up 14% from the prior year and 4% from
the prior quarter.

portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Real Estate Portfolios reported pretax income of $812 million, compared with a
pretax loss of $18 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by a
benefit from the provision for credit losses, reflecting the continued
improvement in credit trends. 

Net revenue was $965 million, a decrease of $95 million, or 9%, from the prior
year. The decrease was driven by a decline in net interest income, resulting
from lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff. 

The provision for credit losses reflected a benefit of $283 million, compared
with provision expense of $646 million in the prior year. The current-quarter
provision reflected a $700 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses
due to improved delinquency trends and lower estimated losses, primarily in the
home equity portfolio. Net charge-offs totaled $417 million. Home equity net
charge-offs were $257 million (1.49% net charge-off rate1), compared with $579
million (2.90% net charge-off rate1) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net
charge-offs were $92 million (4.35% net charge-off rate1), compared with $143
million (5.74% net charge-off rate1). Prime mortgage, including option ARMs, net
charge-offs were $66 million (0.63% net charge-off rate1), compared with $151
million (1.33% net charge-off rate1). 

Nonaccrual loans were $7.9 billion, compared with $5.9 billion in the prior year
and $8.1 billion in the prior quarter. The current-quarter and prior-quarter
nonaccrual loans reflected the effect of regulatory guidance implemented in the
third and first quarters of 2012 as a result of which the Firm began reporting
Chapter 7 loans and performing junior liens that are subordinate to nonaccrual
senior liens as nonaccrual loans. For more information, see the Consumer Credit
Portfolio section of the Firm`s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 2012. Excluding the impact of the regulatory guidance noted
above, nonaccrual loans would have been $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down
from $5.9 billion in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $436 million, up by $4 million from the prior year.

4.14%, compared with 6.58%.

Card, Merchant Services &amp; Auto net income was $840 million, a decrease of $211
million, or 20%, compared with the prior year. The decrease was driven by higher
provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $4.8 billion, flat compared with the prior year. Net interest
income was $3.5 billion, down $45 million, or 1%, from the prior year. The
decrease was driven by lower average credit card loan balances and narrower auto
loan spreads. These decreases were offset by lower revenue reversals associated
with lower net charge-offs in credit card and lower funding costs. Noninterest
revenue was $1.3 billion, an increase of $39 million, or 3%, from the prior
year. The increase was driven by higher net interchange and merchant servicing
revenue, partially offset by higher amortization of loan origination costs. 

The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, compared with $1.1 billion in
the prior year and $1.2 billion in the prior quarter. The current-quarter
provision reflected lower net charge-offs. The prior-year provision included a
$500 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The Credit Card net
charge-off rate1 was 3.50%, down from 4.29% in the prior year and 3.57% in the
prior quarter; the 30+ day delinquency rate1 was 2.10%, down from 2.81% in the
prior year and 2.15% in the prior quarter. The Auto net charge-off rate was
0.36%, down from 0.37% in the prior year and 0.74% in the prior quarter. The
prior quarter included the impact of incremental charge-offs related to auto
loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 

Noninterest expense was $2.2 billion, an increase of $146 million, or 7%, from
the prior year, driven by the write-off of intangible assets associated with a
non-strategic relationship.

Net income was $2.0 billion, up significantly from the prior year. These results reflected higher net revenue and benefit from the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was $7.6 billion, compared with $6.3 billion in the prior year. Net revenue included a $567 million loss from debit valuation adjustments ("DVA") on certain structured and derivative liabilities resulting from the tightening of the Firm`s credit spreads; the prior year included the same    
 size loss from DVA of $567 million. Excluding the impact of DVA, net income was $2.4 billion1, up $1.0 billion, or 77%, from the prior year, and net revenue was $8.2 billion1, up $1.3 billion, or 19%, from the prior year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   


Banking revenue was $3.2 billion, compared with $2.4 billion in the prior year.
Investment banking fees were $1.7 billion (up 54%), which consisted of record
debt underwriting fees of $990 million (up 79%), equity underwriting fees of
$265 million (up 57%), and advisory fees of $465 million (up 17%). Treasury
Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 1% from the prior year. Lending revenue
was $382 million, compared with $279 million in the prior year, driven by higher
fees and net interest income, as well as lower mark-to-market losses from hedges
of retained loans. 

Markets &amp; Investor Services revenue was $4.5 billion, up 16% from the prior
year. Fixed Income and Equity Markets combined revenue was $4.1 billion, up 19%
from the prior year, driven by solid client revenue and improved performance in
credit-related products. The portion of the synthetic credit portfolio
transferred from the Chief Investment Office in Corporate to the CIB on July 2,
2012 experienced a modest loss during the current quarter, which was included in
Fixed Income Markets revenue. Securities Services revenue was $995 million, up
2% from the prior year. Credit Adjustments &amp; Other was a net loss of $586
million, compared with a loss of $532 million in the prior year; both periods
were driven predominantly by the impact of DVA. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $445 million, compared with a
provision for credit losses in the prior year of $291 million. The
current-period benefit was primarily driven by recoveries and a reduction in the
allowance for credit losses, both related to certain restructured nonperforming
loans. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans
retained was 1.19%, compared with 1.35% in the prior year. Excluding the impact
of the consolidation of Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade
finance loans, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans
retained was 2.52%1, compared with 3.06%1 in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $5.0 billion, up 10% from the prior year, driven by
higher compensation expense on stronger revenue performance. The compensation
ratio for the current quarter was 27%, excluding the impact of DVA1.

Net income was $692 million, an increase of $49 million, or 8%, from the prior year. The improvement was driven by an increase in net revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.  


Net revenue was a record $1.7 billion, an increase of $58 million, or 3%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $1.2 billion, an increase of $51
million, or 5%, driven by growth in loan balances, partially offset by spread
compression on loan products. Noninterest revenue was $578 million, up $7
million, or 1%, compared with the prior year. 

Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $838 million, an increase of $28 million,
or 3%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $312
million, an increase of $13 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year.
Revenue from Corporate Client Banking was $406 million, an increase of $80
million, or 25%, from the prior year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $113
million, a decrease of $2 million, or 2%, from the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $3 million compared with a $40
million expense in the prior year. Net charge-offs were $50 million in the
current quarter (0.16% net charge-off rate), compared with net charge-offs of
$99 million (0.36% net charge-off rate) in the prior year and net recoveries of
$18 million (0.06% net recovery rate) in the prior quarter. The allowance for
loan losses to period-end loans retained was 2.06%, down from 2.34% in the prior
year and 2.15% in the prior quarter. Nonaccrual loans were $673 million, down by
$380 million, or 36%, from the prior year due to repayments and loan sales, and
down by $203 million, or 23%, from the prior quarter due to repayments and
charge-offs. 

Noninterest expense was $599 million, an increase of $20 million, or 3%, from
the prior year, reflecting higher headcount-related2 expense.

Net income was $483 million, an increase of $181 million, or 60%, from the prior year. These results reflected higher net revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.  


Net revenue was a record $2.8 billion, an increase of $469 million, or 21%, from
the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $2.2 billion, up $363 million, or 20%,
from the prior year due to higher performance fees, the effect of higher market
levels and net client inflows. Net interest income was $552 million, up by $106
million, or 24%, due to higher loan and deposit balances. 

Revenue from Private Banking was $1.4 billion, up 19% from the prior year.

Assets under supervision were $2.1 trillion, an increase of $174 billion, or 9%,
from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.4 trillion, an increase of
$90 billion, or 7%, due to the effect of higher market levels and net inflows to
long-term products, partially offset by net outflows from liquidity products.
Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were $669 billion, up
$84 billion, or 14%, due to the effect of higher market levels and custody and
brokerage inflows. 

The provision for credit losses was $19 million, compared with $24 million in
the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $1.9 billion, an increase of $191 million, or 11%, from
the prior year, due to higher performance-based compensation and higher
headcount-related2 expense.

Private Equity reported net income of $50 million, compared with a net loss of
$89 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $72 million, compared with a loss
of $113 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower net valuation losses
on both private and public investments and higher gains from sales. 

Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $157 million, compared with net income
of $417 million in the prior year. Net revenue was a loss of $110 million,
compared with net revenue of $845 million in the prior year. Net revenue
included net securities gains of $103 million from sales of available-for-sale
investment securities during the current quarter and principal transactions
revenue of $99 million. Net interest income was a loss of $388 million due to
low interest rates and limited reinvestment opportunities. 

Other Corporate reported net income of $605 million, compared with a net loss of
$95 million in the prior year. The current quarter included an after-tax benefit
of $620 million for tax adjustments, which was partially offset by a pretax

(*) Presented on a managed basis. See notes on page 14 for further explanation
of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $23,653 million,
$25,146 million, and $21,471 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, third
quarter of 2012, and fourth quarter of 2011, respectively.

 Discussion of Results:                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 
Net income was $5.7 billion, up $2.0 billion, or 53%, from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.  


Net revenue was $24.4 billion, up $2.2 billion, or 10%, compared with the prior
year. Noninterest revenue was $13.1 billion, up $3.2 billion, or 32%, from the
prior year, due to higher mortgage fees and related income, higher investment
banking fees and higher principal transactions revenue. The current-quarter
revenue includes a $567 million loss from DVA on certain structured and
derivative liabilities resulting from the tightening of the Firm`s credit
spreads. Net interest income was $11.3 billion, down $989 million, or 8%,
compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of low interest rates, as
well as runoff of higher-yielding loans, faster mortgage-backed securities
repayments and limited reinvestment opportunities, partially offset by lower
deposit costs. 

The provision for credit losses was $656 million, down $1.5 billion, or 70%,
from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $1.1
billion, down $745 million from the prior year. The decrease in the consumer
provision reflected a $700 million reduction of the allowance for loan losses
related to the mortgage portfolio due to improved delinquency trends and lower
estimated losses, primarily in the home equity portfolio. Consumer net
charge-offs were $1.8 billion, compared with $2.6 billion in the prior year,
resulting in net charge-off rates1 of 1.99% and 2.74%, respectively. The
decrease in consumer net charge-offs was primarily due to improved delinquency
trends. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $430 million,
primarily driven by recoveries and a reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, both related to certain restructured nonperforming loans, compared with
an expense of $353 million in the prior year. Wholesale net recoveries were $158
million, compared with net charge-offs of $346 million in the prior year,
resulting in a net recovery rate of 0.21% and a net charge-off rate of 0.52%,
respectively. The Firm`s allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans
retained1 was 2.43%, compared with 3.35% in the prior year. 

The Firm`s nonperforming assets totaled $11.7 billion at December 31, 2012, down
from the prior-quarter level of $12.5 billion and up compared with the
prior-year level of $11.3 billion. Before the impact of the reporting changes
noted below, nonperforming assets would have been $8.7 billion at December 31,
2012, down from $9.5 billion in the prior quarter and $11.3 billion in the prior
year. The current quarter and the prior quarter included the effect of
regulatory guidance implemented in the third and first quarters of 2012 as a
result of which the Firm began reporting Chapter 7 loans and performing junior
liens that are subordinate to senior liens that are 90 days or more past due as
nonaccrual loans. Such Chapter 7 loans and performing junior liens totaled $3.0
billion in the current quarter and $3.0 billion in the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $16.0 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 10%, compared with
the prior year. The current quarter reflected $900 million pretax expense for
mortgage-related matters, of which approximately $700 million was related to the
Independent Foreclosure Review settlement. The current quarter also included an
after-tax benefit of $620 million for tax adjustments.

 a.  In addition to analyzing the Firm`s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm`s results and the results of the lines of business on a "managed" basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm`s definition of managed basis starts with 
     the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments 
     that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt     
     sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 b.  The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired ("PCI") loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans.           
     Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio totaled $5.7 billion at December 31, 2012, September 30, 2012, and December 31, 2011. In Corporate &amp;      
     Investment Bank, the ratio for the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans is calculated excluding the impact of trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB`s    
     allowance coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 c.  Tangible common equity ("TCE") represents common stockholders` equity (i.e., total stockholders` equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible   
     common equity measures the Firm`s earnings as a percentage of TCE. In management`s view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm`s use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers.        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 d.  The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by Basel I risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock,       
     noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the      
     Firm`s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common capital along with other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued its final version of  
     the Basel Capital Accord, commonly referred to as "Basel III." In June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies published final rules on Basel 2.5 that went into effect on January 1, 2013 and result in additional capital requirements for trading positions  
     and securitizations. Also, in June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies published for comment a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the "NPR") for implementing Basel III, in the United States. The Firm`s estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is 
     a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects the Firm`s current understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal   
     banking agencies, and therefore excludes the impact of any changes the Firm may make in the future to its businesses as a result of implementing the Basel III rules. The Firm`s estimates of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolve over time as the    
     Firm`s businesses change, and as a result of further rule-making on Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimate as a key measure to assess the Firm`s capital position in conjunction with its capital      
     ratios under Basel I requirements, in order to enable management, investors and analysts to compare the Firm`s capital under the Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies.                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 e.  In Consumer &amp; Community Banking, supplemental information is provided for Card Services to provide more meaningful measures that enable comparability with prior periods. The net charge-off and 30+ day delinquency rates presented include loans held-for     
     -sale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 f.  In the Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, the following metrics are provided excluding the impact of debit valuation adjustments ("DVA"): net revenue, net income, compensation ratio, and return on equity. These measures are used by management, investors and     
     analysts to assess the underlying performance of the business.                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 2.  Additional notes on financial measures:                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 a.  Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 b.  Asset Management pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management`s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into             
     consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of AM against the performance of their respective peers.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 c.  Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of the third quarter of 2012.                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 d.  The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer &amp; Business Banking; Card,      
     Merchant Services &amp; Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Corporate &amp; Investment Bank and Commercial        
     Banking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 e.  Mortgage Banking credit costs are included in the functional results of Real Estate Portfolios and in production expense for Mortgage Production.

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported net income for the
fourth-quarter of 2012 of $5.7 billion, compared with net income of $3.7 billion
in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings per share were $1.39, compared with
$0.90 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenue1 for the quarter was $24.4 billion,
up 10% compared with the prior year. The Firm`s return on tangible common
equity1 for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 15%, compared with 11% in the prior
year. 

Net income for full-year 2012 was a record $21.3 billion, compared with $19.0
billion for the prior year. Earnings per share were a record $5.20 for 2012,
compared with $4.48 for 2011. Revenue1 for 2012 was $99.9 billion, flat compared
with 2011. 

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. also announced today that the Firm`s Management Task Force
and the independent Review Committee of the Firm`s Board of Directors (the
"Board Review Committee") have each concluded their reviews relating to the 2012
losses by the Firm`s Chief Investment Office ("CIO") and have released their
respective reports. Both reports are available on the Firm`s website and are
discussed at greater length in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC today. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the financial
results: "For the third consecutive year, the Firm reported both record net
income and a return on tangible common equity1 of 15%. The Firm`s results
reflected strong underlying performance across virtually all our businesses for
the fourth quarter and the full year, with strong lending and deposit growth. We
also maintained our leadership positions and continued to gain market share in
key areas of our franchise. As we highlight upfront in this release, there were
several significant items that affected our results this quarter, but they
largely offset each other." 

Dimon added: "We continued to see favorable credit conditions across our
wholesale loan portfolios and strong credit performance in our credit card
portfolio, where charge-off rates remain at historic lows. The real estate
portfolios, while at elevated levels of losses, continued to show improvement as
the housing market and economy continued to recover. As a result, we reduced the
related allowance for credit losses by $700 million in the fourth quarter and we
are likely to continue to see reductions in the allowance as the environment
improves." 

Commenting on the balance sheet, Dimon said: "We strengthened our fortress
balance sheet, ending the fourth quarter with a strong Basel I Tier 1 common
ratio1 of 11.0%, up from 10.4% in the third quarter. We estimate that our Basel
III Tier 1 common ratio1 was approximately 8.7% 3 at the end of the fourth
quarter, up from 8.4% in the third quarter." 

Dimon added: "During the course of 2012, JPMorgan Chase was able to make more of
an impact on our communities than ever before. The Firm provided credit1 and
raised capital of over $1.8 trillion for our clients during the year. This
included $20 billion for small businesses, up 18%. We also originated more than
920,000 mortgages; provided credit cards to about 6.7 million people; and raised
capital and provided credit1 of approximately $85 billion for nearly 1,500
not-for-profit and government entities, including states, municipalities,
hospitals and universities. As part of the 100,000 Jobs Mission, which JPMorgan
Chase helped launch, since the beginning of 2011, the Firm has hired nearly
5,000 U.S. veterans and members of the National Guard and Reserve; and, through
our nonprofit partners, we have provided 386 mortgage-free homes for deserving
veterans and their families." 

"We are committed to doing our part to speed the recovery of the housing market.
This includes working with struggling homeowners to modify their loans, or
pursue other options to allow them to prevent foreclosure. Through these
efforts, since 2009, we have offered more than 1.4 million mortgage
modifications and completed 610,000 for both loans we own and those we service
for others. With respect to Chase-owned mortgages, through modifications and
short-sales, we have effectively forgiven more than $10 billion of principal and
reduced borrowers` interest payments by approximately $2 billion. Our efforts
are not only helping people, they are also helping set the stage for a recovery
in America`s housing market, which will ultimately reward our customers,
shareholders and communities alike." 

Dimon concluded: "We are particularly proud that, through the turbulence of
recent years, we never stopped serving clients and investing in the future of
our franchise - opening new offices and branches, adding bankers in key markets,
innovating and gaining market share. The capital strength and earnings power of
the Firm is as strong as it has ever been, and our 260,000 employees are doing
more than ever to serve our customers and clients, and support our communities
around the world. Challenges still exist, but as we look forward to 2013, we
remain optimistic."

 Discussion of Results:                                                       
 
Net income was $2.0 billion, compared with $1.6 billion in the prior year.  


Net revenue was $12.4 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 10%, compared
with the prior year. Net interest income was $7.3 billion, down $220 million, or
3%, driven by lower deposit margins and lower loan balances due to portfolio
runoff, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $5.1
billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 37%, driven by higher mortgage fees and
related income. 

The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, compared with $1.8 billion in
the prior year and $1.9 billion in the prior quarter. The current-quarter
provision reflected a $700 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses
and total net charge-offs of $1.8 billion. The prior-quarter provision reflected
a $955 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net
charge-offs of $2.8 billion, including $880 million of incremental charge-offs
reported in accordance with regulatory guidance for Chapter 7 loans. For more
information, see the Consumer Credit Portfolio section of the Firm`s Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. 

Noninterest expense was $8.0 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion from the prior
year, driven by costs related to mortgage-related matters, including the impact
of the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement and the write-off of intangible
assets associated with a non-strategic relationship in Credit Card.

Consumer &amp; Business Banking reported net income of $756 million, a decrease of
$36 million, or 5%, compared with the prior year. 

Net revenue was $4.3 billion, down 1% from the prior year. Net interest income
was $2.6 billion, down 3% compared with the prior year, driven by the impact of
lower deposit margin, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest
revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by higher debit card revenue
and investment sales revenue, partially offset by lower deposit-related fees. 

The provision for credit losses and net charge-offs were both $110 million
(2.36% net charge-off rate), compared with $132 million (3.02% net charge-off
rate) in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, up 2% from the prior year, largely driven
by new branch builds.

Mortgage Banking reported net income of $418 million, compared with a net loss
of $269 million in the prior year. 

Net revenue was $3.3 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion compared with the
prior year. Net interest income was $1.2 billion, down $94 million. Noninterest
revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, driven by higher mortgage
fees and related income. 

The provision for credit losses reflected a benefit of $269 million2, compared
with provision expense of $647 million in the prior year. The current quarter
reflected a $700 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. 

Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion from the prior
year. The current quarter included approximately $900 million of expense for
mortgage-related matters, including approximately $700 million for the impact of
the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement. 

Mortgage Production reported pretax income of $789 million, an increase of $628
million from the prior year. Mortgage production-related revenue, excluding
repurchase losses, was $1.6 billion, an increase of $543 million, or 51%, from
the prior year. These results reflected wider margins, driven by favorable
market conditions, and higher volumes due to historically low interest rates and
the Home Affordable Refinance Programs ("HARP"). Production expense2 was $876
million, an increase of $358 million from the prior year, reflecting higher
volumes and an expense for additional litigation reserves. Repurchase losses for
the current quarter reflected a benefit of $53 million, compared with a loss of
$390 million in the prior year and a loss of $13 million in the prior quarter.
The current quarter reflected a $249 million reduction in the repurchase
liability and lower realized repurchase losses compared with prior year and
prior quarter, primarily driven by improved cure rates on Agency repurchase
demands. 

Mortgage Servicing reported a pretax loss of $913 million, compared with a
pretax loss of $586 million in the prior year. Mortgage servicing revenue,
including amortization, was $618 million, a decrease of $98 million, or 14%,
from the prior year. Mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") risk management income
was $42 million, compared with a loss of $377 million in the prior year.

8% from the prior quarter; Retail channel originations (branch and
direct-to-consumer) were $26.4 billion, up 14% from the prior year and 4% from
the prior quarter.

portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Real Estate Portfolios reported pretax income of $812 million, compared with a
pretax loss of $18 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by a
benefit from the provision for credit losses, reflecting the continued
improvement in credit trends. 

Net revenue was $965 million, a decrease of $95 million, or 9%, from the prior
year. The decrease was driven by a decline in net interest income, resulting
from lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff. 

The provision for credit losses reflected a benefit of $283 million, compared
with provision expense of $646 million in the prior year. The current-quarter
provision reflected a $700 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses
due to improved delinquency trends and lower estimated losses, primarily in the
home equity portfolio. Net charge-offs totaled $417 million. Home equity net
charge-offs were $257 million (1.49% net charge-off rate1), compared with $579
million (2.90% net charge-off rate1) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net
charge-offs were $92 million (4.35% net charge-off rate1), compared with $143
million (5.74% net charge-off rate1). Prime mortgage, including option ARMs, net
charge-offs were $66 million (0.63% net charge-off rate1), compared with $151
million (1.33% net charge-off rate1). 

Nonaccrual loans were $7.9 billion, compared with $5.9 billion in the prior year
and $8.1 billion in the prior quarter. The current-quarter and prior-quarter
nonaccrual loans reflected the effect of regulatory guidance implemented in the
third and first quarters of 2012 as a result of which the Firm began reporting
Chapter 7 loans and performing junior liens that are subordinate to nonaccrual
senior liens as nonaccrual loans. For more information, see the Consumer Credit
Portfolio section of the Firm`s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 2012. Excluding the impact of the regulatory guidance noted
above, nonaccrual loans would have been $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down
from $5.9 billion in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $436 million, up by $4 million from the prior year.

4.14%, compared with 6.58%.

Card, Merchant Services &amp; Auto net income was $840 million, a decrease of $211
million, or 20%, compared with the prior year. The decrease was driven by higher
provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $4.8 billion, flat compared with the prior year. Net interest
income was $3.5 billion, down $45 million, or 1%, from the prior year. The
decrease was driven by lower average credit card loan balances and narrower auto
loan spreads. These decreases were offset by lower revenue reversals associated
with lower net charge-offs in credit card and lower funding costs. Noninterest
revenue was $1.3 billion, an increase of $39 million, or 3%, from the prior
year. The increase was driven by higher net interchange and merchant servicing
revenue, partially offset by higher amortization of loan origination costs. 

The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, compared with $1.1 billion in
the prior year and $1.2 billion in the prior quarter. The current-quarter
provision reflected lower net charge-offs. The prior-year provision included a
$500 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The Credit Card net
charge-off rate1 was 3.50%, down from 4.29% in the prior year and 3.57% in the
prior quarter; the 30+ day delinquency rate1 was 2.10%, down from 2.81% in the
prior year and 2.15% in the prior quarter. The Auto net charge-off rate was
0.36%, down from 0.37% in the prior year and 0.74% in the prior quarter. The
prior quarter included the impact of incremental charge-offs related to auto
loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 

Noninterest expense was $2.2 billion, an increase of $146 million, or 7%, from
the prior year, driven by the write-off of intangible assets associated with a
non-strategic relationship.

Net income was $2.0 billion, up significantly from the prior year. These results reflected higher net revenue and benefit from the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net revenue was $7.6 billion, compared with $6.3 billion in the prior year. Net revenue included a $567 million loss from debit valuation adjustments ("DVA") on certain structured and derivative liabilities resulting from the tightening of the Firm`s credit spreads; the prior year included the same    
 size loss from DVA of $567 million. Excluding the impact of DVA, net income was $2.4 billion1, up $1.0 billion, or 77%, from the prior year, and net revenue was $8.2 billion1, up $1.3 billion, or 19%, from the prior year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   


Banking revenue was $3.2 billion, compared with $2.4 billion in the prior year.
Investment banking fees were $1.7 billion (up 54%), which consisted of record
debt underwriting fees of $990 million (up 79%), equity underwriting fees of
$265 million (up 57%), and advisory fees of $465 million (up 17%). Treasury
Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 1% from the prior year. Lending revenue
was $382 million, compared with $279 million in the prior year, driven by higher
fees and net interest income, as well as lower mark-to-market losses from hedges
of retained loans. 

Markets &amp; Investor Services revenue was $4.5 billion, up 16% from the prior
year. Fixed Income and Equity Markets combined revenue was $4.1 billion, up 19%
from the prior year, driven by solid client revenue and improved performance in
credit-related products. The portion of the synthetic credit portfolio
transferred from the Chief Investment Office in Corporate to the CIB on July 2,
2012 experienced a modest loss during the current quarter, which was included in
Fixed Income Markets revenue. Securities Services revenue was $995 million, up
2% from the prior year. Credit Adjustments &amp; Other was a net loss of $586
million, compared with a loss of $532 million in the prior year; both periods
were driven predominantly by the impact of DVA. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $445 million, compared with a
provision for credit losses in the prior year of $291 million. The
current-period benefit was primarily driven by recoveries and a reduction in the
allowance for credit losses, both related to certain restructured nonperforming
loans. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans
retained was 1.19%, compared with 1.35% in the prior year. Excluding the impact
of the consolidation of Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade
finance loans, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans
retained was 2.52%1, compared with 3.06%1 in the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $5.0 billion, up 10% from the prior year, driven by
higher compensation expense on stronger revenue performance. The compensation
ratio for the current quarter was 27%, excluding the impact of DVA1.

Net income was $692 million, an increase of $49 million, or 8%, from the prior year. The improvement was driven by an increase in net revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.  


Net revenue was a record $1.7 billion, an increase of $58 million, or 3%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $1.2 billion, an increase of $51
million, or 5%, driven by growth in loan balances, partially offset by spread
compression on loan products. Noninterest revenue was $578 million, up $7
million, or 1%, compared with the prior year. 

Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $838 million, an increase of $28 million,
or 3%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $312
million, an increase of $13 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year.
Revenue from Corporate Client Banking was $406 million, an increase of $80
million, or 25%, from the prior year. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $113
million, a decrease of $2 million, or 2%, from the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $3 million compared with a $40
million expense in the prior year. Net charge-offs were $50 million in the
current quarter (0.16% net charge-off rate), compared with net charge-offs of
$99 million (0.36% net charge-off rate) in the prior year and net recoveries of
$18 million (0.06% net recovery rate) in the prior quarter. The allowance for
loan losses to period-end loans retained was 2.06%, down from 2.34% in the prior
year and 2.15% in the prior quarter. Nonaccrual loans were $673 million, down by
$380 million, or 36%, from the prior year due to repayments and loan sales, and
down by $203 million, or 23%, from the prior quarter due to repayments and
charge-offs. 

Noninterest expense was $599 million, an increase of $20 million, or 3%, from
the prior year, reflecting higher headcount-related2 expense.

Net income was $483 million, an increase of $181 million, or 60%, from the prior year. These results reflected higher net revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.  


Net revenue was a record $2.8 billion, an increase of $469 million, or 21%, from
the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $2.2 billion, up $363 million, or 20%,
from the prior year due to higher performance fees, the effect of higher market
levels and net client inflows. Net interest income was $552 million, up by $106
million, or 24%, due to higher loan and deposit balances. 

Revenue from Private Banking was $1.4 billion, up 19% from the prior year.

Assets under supervision were $2.1 trillion, an increase of $174 billion, or 9%,
from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.4 trillion, an increase of
$90 billion, or 7%, due to the effect of higher market levels and net inflows to
long-term products, partially offset by net outflows from liquidity products.
Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were $669 billion, up
$84 billion, or 14%, due to the effect of higher market levels and custody and
brokerage inflows. 

The provision for credit losses was $19 million, compared with $24 million in
the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $1.9 billion, an increase of $191 million, or 11%, from
the prior year, due to higher performance-based compensation and higher
headcount-related2 expense.

Private Equity reported net income of $50 million, compared with a net loss of
$89 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $72 million, compared with a loss
of $113 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower net valuation losses
on both private and public investments and higher gains from sales. 

Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $157 million, compared with net income
of $417 million in the prior year. Net revenue was a loss of $110 million,
compared with net revenue of $845 million in the prior year. Net revenue
included net securities gains of $103 million from sales of available-for-sale
investment securities during the current quarter and principal transactions
revenue of $99 million. Net interest income was a loss of $388 million due to
low interest rates and limited reinvestment opportunities. 

Other Corporate reported net income of $605 million, compared with a net loss of
$95 million in the prior year. The current quarter included an after-tax benefit
of $620 million for tax adjustments, which was partially offset by a pretax

(*) Presented on a managed basis. See notes on page 14 for further explanation
of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis totaled $23,653 million,
$25,146 million, and $21,471 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, third
quarter of 2012, and fourth quarter of 2011, respectively.

 Discussion of Results:                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 
Net income was $5.7 billion, up $2.0 billion, or 53%, from the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher net revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.  


Net revenue was $24.4 billion, up $2.2 billion, or 10%, compared with the prior
year. Noninterest revenue was $13.1 billion, up $3.2 billion, or 32%, from the
prior year, due to higher mortgage fees and related income, higher investment
banking fees and higher principal transactions revenue. The current-quarter
revenue includes a $567 million loss from DVA on certain structured and
derivative liabilities resulting from the tightening of the Firm`s credit
spreads. Net interest income was $11.3 billion, down $989 million, or 8%,
compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of low interest rates, as
well as runoff of higher-yielding loans, faster mortgage-backed securities
repayments and limited reinvestment opportunities, partially offset by lower
deposit costs. 

The provision for credit losses was $656 million, down $1.5 billion, or 70%,
from the prior year. The total consumer provision for credit losses was $1.1
billion, down $745 million from the prior year. The decrease in the consumer
provision reflected a $700 million reduction of the allowance for loan losses
related to the mortgage portfolio due to improved delinquency trends and lower
estimated losses, primarily in the home equity portfolio. Consumer net
charge-offs were $1.8 billion, compared with $2.6 billion in the prior year,
resulting in net charge-off rates1 of 1.99% and 2.74%, respectively. The
decrease in consumer net charge-offs was primarily due to improved delinquency
trends. The wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $430 million,
primarily driven by recoveries and a reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, both related to certain restructured nonperforming loans, compared with
an expense of $353 million in the prior year. Wholesale net recoveries were $158
million, compared with net charge-offs of $346 million in the prior year,
resulting in a net recovery rate of 0.21% and a net charge-off rate of 0.52%,
respectively. The Firm`s allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans
retained1 was 2.43%, compared with 3.35% in the prior year. 

The Firm`s nonperforming assets totaled $11.7 billion at December 31, 2012, down
from the prior-quarter level of $12.5 billion and up compared with the
prior-year level of $11.3 billion. Before the impact of the reporting changes
noted below, nonperforming assets would have been $8.7 billion at December 31,
2012, down from $9.5 billion in the prior quarter and $11.3 billion in the prior
year. The current quarter and the prior quarter included the effect of
regulatory guidance implemented in the third and first quarters of 2012 as a
result of which the Firm began reporting Chapter 7 loans and performing junior
liens that are subordinate to senior liens that are 90 days or more past due as
nonaccrual loans. Such Chapter 7 loans and performing junior liens totaled $3.0
billion in the current quarter and $3.0 billion in the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $16.0 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 10%, compared with
the prior year. The current quarter reflected $900 million pretax expense for
mortgage-related matters, of which approximately $700 million was related to the
Independent Foreclosure Review settlement. The current quarter also included an
after-tax benefit of $620 million for tax adjustments.

 a.  In addition to analyzing the Firm`s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm`s results and the results of the lines of business on a "managed" basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm`s definition of managed basis starts with 
     the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments 
     that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt     
     sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 b.  The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excludes the following: loans accounted for at fair value and loans held-for-sale; purchased credit-impaired ("PCI") loans; and the allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans.           
     Additionally, Real Estate Portfolios net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. The allowance for loan losses related to the PCI portfolio totaled $5.7 billion at December 31, 2012, September 30, 2012, and December 31, 2011. In Corporate &amp;      
     Investment Bank, the ratio for the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans is calculated excluding the impact of trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, to provide a more meaningful assessment of the CIB`s    
     allowance coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 c.  Tangible common equity ("TCE") represents common stockholders` equity (i.e., total stockholders` equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on tangible   
     common equity measures the Firm`s earnings as a percentage of TCE. In management`s view, these measures are meaningful to the Firm, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Firm`s use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers.        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 d.  The Basel I Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by Basel I risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 common capital is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock,       
     noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, and trust preferred capital debt securities. Tier 1 common capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of the      
     Firm`s capital with the capital of other financial services companies. The Firm uses Tier 1 common capital along with other capital measures to assess and monitor its capital position. On December 16, 2010, the Basel Committee issued its final version of  
     the Basel Capital Accord, commonly referred to as "Basel III." In June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies published final rules on Basel 2.5 that went into effect on January 1, 2013 and result in additional capital requirements for trading positions  
     and securitizations. Also, in June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies published for comment a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the "NPR") for implementing Basel III, in the United States. The Firm`s estimate of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III is 
     a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects the Firm`s current understanding of the Basel III rules and the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted based on information currently published by the Basel Committee and U.S. federal   
     banking agencies, and therefore excludes the impact of any changes the Firm may make in the future to its businesses as a result of implementing the Basel III rules. The Firm`s estimates of its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will evolve over time as the    
     Firm`s businesses change, and as a result of further rule-making on Basel III implementation from U.S. federal banking agencies. Management considers this estimate as a key measure to assess the Firm`s capital position in conjunction with its capital      
     ratios under Basel I requirements, in order to enable management, investors and analysts to compare the Firm`s capital under the Basel III capital standards with similar estimates provided by other financial services companies.                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 e.  In Consumer &amp; Community Banking, supplemental information is provided for Card Services to provide more meaningful measures that enable comparability with prior periods. The net charge-off and 30+ day delinquency rates presented include loans held-for     
     -sale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 f.  In the Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, the following metrics are provided excluding the impact of debit valuation adjustments ("DVA"): net revenue, net income, compensation ratio, and return on equity. These measures are used by management, investors and     
     analysts to assess the underlying performance of the business.                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 2.  Additional notes on financial measures:                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 a.  Headcount-related expense includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 b.  Asset Management pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in management`s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into             
     consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the performance of AM against the performance of their respective peers.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 c.  Credit card sales volume is presented excluding Commercial Card. Rankings and comparison of general purpose credit card sales volume are based on disclosures by peers and internal estimates. Rankings are as of the third quarter of 2012.                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 d.  The amount of credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments. The amount of credit provided to small businesses reflects loans and increased lines of credit provided by Consumer &amp; Business Banking; Card,      
     Merchant Services &amp; Auto; and Commercial Banking. The amount of credit provided to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities, represents that provided by the Corporate &amp; Investment Bank and Commercial        
     Banking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 e.  Mortgage Banking credit costs are included in the functional results of Real Estate Portfolios and in production expense for Mortgage Production.

&lt;p&gt;  CHICAGO, IL, Jan 16 (Marketwire) -- 
CohesiveFT, a leader in enterprise application-to-cloud migration and
application software defined networking (SDN), today announced the
availability of the OS Catalog on their two Server3 SaaS implementations.
The OS Catalog is part of an image management system based on
CohesiveFT's Server3 offering, providing cloud users with improved import
experience and expanded operating system support. 

    The OS Catalog is available both in IBM SCE on Smart.ElasticServer.com
and AWS EC2 along with many other clouds on beta.ElasticServer.com. Users
can choose to build and customize their own VM starting with the
available base OS images and add custom software component stacks. Cloud
and software providers can offer cloud users improved import experience
and expanded operating system support. Currently, cloud users can select
images from the CentOS Server family to build and deploy to a cloud of
their choice. Additional operating system families will be rolled out
over the coming weeks.

    Smart.ElasticServer.com and beta.ElasticServer.com are partner and
community focused implementations of the Server3 Image Automation
platform. Server3 allows users to import, transform, and deliver virtual
machines to the large variety of cloud deployment targets.

    The OS Catalog is unlike any other provider catalogues because it: 


--  Allows easy navigation and selection of OS images for cloud deployment
--  Showcases software providers' message and supporting content
--  Guides users to make a more informed/in-system decision on which base
    image to use for a particular deployment.
--  Provides Cloud Service Providers both an operational function, (image
    deployment to user's cloud account), and a marketing function,
    (branding and messaging relating to their OS and software content
    offerings).
--  Gives users choices ranging from CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu and launch these images as either Desktop
    or Server version in 32 or 64bit format.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Jan 17 (Reuters) - Mexican bottler Coca-Cola
FEMSA SAB De CV said on Thursday that it has agreed to
buy Grupo Yoli, maker of a popular lime-flavored soft drink, in
a deal valued at around $700 million where the Coke giant will
pay with shares and absorb debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grupo Yoli, which operates in the western states of Guerrero
and Oaxaca, will get 42.4 million of newly-issued Coca-Cola
FEMSA L Shares, each valued at 184 pesos. Additionally,
Coca-Cola FEMSA will absorb 1 billion pesos in net debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, Coca-Cola FEMSA will also gain a
10.14 percent stake in Promotora Industrial Azucarera, boosting
its holding in one of Mexico's top sugar producers to 36.3
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yoli deal must still be approved by regulators and
shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mexican bottler has recently expanded its footprint in
Mexico and abroad via acquisitions. In December, Coca-Cola FEMSA
reached a deal to buy 51 percent in Coca-Cola Co's Philippine
bottling operations for $688.5 million in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MEXICO CITY, Jan 17 (Marketwire) -- 
Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV: KOFL) (NYSE: KOF) ("Coca-Cola
FEMSA," "KOF," or the "Company"), the largest public bottler of Coca-Cola
products in the world, and Grupo Yoli, S.A. de C.V. and its shareholders
("Grupo Yoli"), one of the oldest family-owned Coca-Cola bottlers in
Mexico, operating mainly in the state of Guerrero as well as in parts of
the state of Oaxaca, have agreed to merge their operations. Grupo Yoli
sold approximately 99 million unit cases of beverages in Mexico in 2012.

    The merger agreement has been approved by both Coca-Cola FEMSA's and
Grupo Yoli's Boards of Directors and is subject to the completion of
confirmatory legal, financial, and operating due diligence and to
customary regulatory and corporate approvals, including the approval of
The Coca-Cola Company and the Comision Federal de Competencia, the
Mexican antitrust authority. Both Coca-Cola FEMSA and Grupo Yoli will
call for an extraordinary shareholders meeting for the approval of this
merger.

    The aggregate enterprise value of this transaction is Ps. 8,806 million.
As a result of the merger, Grupo Yoli will receive approximately 42.4
million newly issued KOF series L shares at a value of Ps. 184.0 per
share, calculated based on the average closing price of the KOF series L
share over the 10 trading days preceding December 12, 2012, date on which
we reached a non-binding agreement. The number of shares may be adjusted
within agreed upon thresholds, pending the completion of the due
diligence process. As part of the transaction, Coca-Cola FEMSA will
assume Ps. 1,009 million in net debt.

    As a result of this transaction, Coca-Cola FEMSA will become the owner of
a 10.14% stake in Promotora Industrial Azucarera, S.A. de C.V. ("PIASA"),
a participant in the Mexican sugar industry. Assuming this additional
stake, Coca-Cola FEMSA will own 36.3% of one of Mexico's leading sugar
producers. 

    "Since our founding almost 100 years ago, our goal has been to fulfill
our clients and consumers evolving needs in the non-alcoholic beverage
industry, while enhancing the well-being of our talented team of
professionals and the communities we serve. At this point in our history,
we are proud to merge with Coca-Cola FEMSA, a like-minded company with a
diversified geographic presence, an experienced management team, and
industry-leading growth prospects. Loyalty to our company and to our
employees, our devotion to quality and excellence, our guiding principles
of integrity and honesty, and our commitment to create economic, social,
and environmental value are fully aligned with the values of our new
partner. In addition to our shared values, we are certain that, together,
we can combine the best practices and talent that we have developed at
Grupo Yoli with the expertise and track record of Coca-Cola FEMSA to
solidify our merged company's market leadership and create value for all
of our stakeholders," said the shareholders of Grupo Yoli.

    "As we enter a new year, for our company and the Mexican Coca-Cola
bottling system, we are pleased to announce our merger with another of
the oldest franchise territories in Mexico. Once again, we are honored
that a highly respected family with vast operating experience in the soft
drink industry favored us as an investment vehicle with which to merge
their business. Together, we will capitalize on the geographic proximity
of our contiguous territories, the mutual benefit of our shared best
practices, and the broad consumer appeal of our integrated multi-category
portfolio of beverages to create value for all of our stakeholders. This
transaction underscores our commitment to continue expanding within Latin
America. Moreover, our advisory board will gain from the considerable
experience and expertise of Grupo Yoli's shareholders," said Carlos
Salazar Lomelin, Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

    Grupo Yoli was founded in the state of Guerrero in 1918 under the name of
"La Vencedora." The Coca-Cola Company granted the first franchise
agreement to these territories in 1938. Currently, Grupo Yoli operates 2
bottling facilities and 20 distribution centers, with close to 3,500
employees serving more than 69,000 clients. Within its franchise
territories, Grupo Yoli serves Acapulco and Ixtapa Zihuatanejo, two of
the most important tourist destinations in the coast of the Pacific Ocean.

    In 2012, Grupo Yoli sold approximately 99 million unit cases of beverages
and generated slightly above Ps. 4,000 million in net revenues. In
addition, on a 2012 estimated pro forma consolidated basis, it reached an
EBITDA of Ps. 814 million.

    Proyectos Financieros Especializados, S.C. (Profit) and Creel,

advisors, respectively, to Grupo Yoli on this transaction.

    Deloitte Galaz, Yamazaki, Ruiz Urquiza, S.C. and Raz Guzman Abogados

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - This is how capitalism is supposed to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has cut back sharply on employees' piece of the revenue pie, taking it to 21 percent for the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For long-suffering shareholders, this is the best news out of Wall Street in, well, maybe forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman paid out 37.9 percent of revenues in compensation in 2012, down from 42.4 percent from a year ago. It is the lowest payout ratio since the firm went public in 1999. The bank did it by shedding people. Average compensation actually rose 9 percent to just under $400,000, helped by a 19 percent increase in revenues. (See story link.reuters.com/pet35t)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, it is not clear that Goldman has bought into the notion that the wunderkinds of Wall Street are overpaid, rather instead into what must be a more comfortable conclusion: that the ship was carrying too many passengers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, with continued pressure from shareholders - a given - Goldman may well find that, even in a recovery, it must allot a declining share of incremental revenue to employees. In other words, when investment banking booms again, it may be forced to staff up but still keep a lid on overall compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Goldman, the most prestigious firm on Wall Street, takes this tack, the pressure on its rivals to follow suit will be intense. Shareholders seem to like the idea, bidding Goldman shares up by about 4 percent since the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compensation has long been a peculiar institution on Wall Street, with employees capturing more of the revenue than in many other businesses employing similarly highly trained workers. It is also a heads-we-win-tails-you lose arrangement: Morgan Stanley actually allocated 62 percent of its revenue to pay in 2009, a year when its stock was trading at about 40 percent of its 2007 peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High pay on Wall Street drives a variety of ills. Investors are only willing to value investment banking earnings very conservatively, partly because they are volatile but also because of a conviction that they are not getting their share of the loot. Very high pay also arguably drives excessively risky behavior among bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW REALITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incentive to take risk today - heedless of the potential costs to shareholders - is being addressed across broad swaths of Wall Street by making deferred compensation a higher percentage of bonus payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is reportedly deferring 100 percent of 2012 bonuses for employees making over $350,000 with at least $50,000 in bonus. Half of that bonus is to be paid in cash, the other half in stock. Payouts are to begin in May and extend over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's good news and serves two purposes, cutting the value of compensation and making employees more likely to have a medium-term outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move may be because Morgan Stanley is facing its own pressure over compensation. Famed hedge fund investor Daniel Loeb, of Third Point LLC, has taken a stake in the company and is reported by the Wall Street Journal to be applying heat over pay, going so far as to reviewing the compensation of specific top officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which reports earnings on Friday, is expected to still be paying out slightly more than half its revenues in compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loeb's move is a smart one, and I expect others to get on the bandwagon, pressuring banks over pay. The financial crisis has likely changed a few fundamental things in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a company is one of the lucky in the too-big-to-fail group, a larger percentage of its value is in its franchise. An entire team can defect, but they will never be able to beat the funding costs of an entrenched TBTF bank at their new firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, new regulations are going to force banks to offer simpler products, and to pursue simpler strategies for their own balance sheets. That is the clear lesson of JP Morgan's London Whale debacle, under which it lost $6.2 billion on a credit speculation gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the extent that Wall Street products become commodities, prices fall, and with them falls compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart investors need to realize that, far from being a bad thing, a simpler, lower-revenue-oriented Wall Street will likely be a far better investment. Banks will be less likely to go bust, a higher percentage of revenue will flow to the bottom line. The market will make a far better price for those earnings, driving shares higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman deserves credit for understanding this, accepting it, and for gaining first-mover advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this kind of thing keeps up, the next decade might actually be a good one for investors in financial services, with stocks enjoying expanding price/earnings multiples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And maybe even less volatile earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(At the time of publication James Saft did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.

notion that the wunderkinds of Wall Street are overpaid, rather
instead into what must be a more comfortable conclusion: that
the ship was carrying too many passengers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, with continued pressure from shareholders  a given -
Goldman may well find that, even in a recovery, it must allot a
declining share of incremental revenue to employees. In other
words, when investment banking booms again, it may be forced to
staff up but still keep a lid on overall compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Goldman, the most prestigious firm on Wall Street, takes
this tack, the pressure on its rivals to follow suit will be
intense. Shareholders seem to like the idea, bidding Goldman
shares up by about 4 percent since the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compensation has long been a peculiar institution on Wall
Street, with employees capturing more of the revenue than in
many other businesses employing similarly highly trained
workers. It is also a heads-we-win-tails-you lose arrangement:
Morgan Stanley actually allocated 62 percent of its
revenue to pay in 2009, a year when its stock was trading at
about 40 percent of its 2007 peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High pay on Wall Street drives a variety of ills. Investors
are only willing to value investment banking earnings very
conservatively, partly because they are volatile but also
because of a conviction that they are not getting their share of
the loot. Very high pay also arguably drives excessively risky
behavior among bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW REALITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incentive to take risk today  heedless of the potential
costs to shareholders  is being addressed across broad swaths
of Wall Street by making deferred compensation a higher
percentage of bonus payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is reportedly deferring 100 percent of 2012
bonuses for employees making over $350,000 with at least $50,000
in bonus. Half of that bonus is to be paid in cash, the other
half in stock. Payouts are to begin in May and extend over the
next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thats good news and serves two purposes, cutting the value
of compensation and making employees more likely to have a
medium-term outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move may be because Morgan Stanley is facing its own
pressure over compensation. Famed hedge fund investor Daniel
Loeb, of Third Point LLC, has taken a stake in the company and
is reported by the Wall Street Journal to be applying heat over
pay, going so far as to reviewing the compensation of specific
top officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which reports earnings on Friday, is
expected to still be paying out slightly more than half its
revenues in compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loebs move is a smart one, and I expect others to get on
the bandwagon, pressuring banks over pay. The financial crisis
has likely changed a few fundamental things in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a company is one of the lucky in the too-big-to-fail
group, a larger percentage of its value is in its franchise. An
entire team can defect, but they will never be able to beat the
funding costs of an entrenched TBTF bank at their new firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, new regulations are going to force banks to offer
simpler products, and to pursue simpler strategies for their own
balance sheets. That is the clear lesson of JP Morgans
London Whale debacle, under which it lost $6.2 billion on a
credit speculation gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the extent that Wall Street products become commodities,
prices fall, and with them falls compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart investors need to realize that, far from being a bad
thing, a simpler, lower-revenue-oriented Wall Street will likely
be a far better investment. Banks will be less likely to go
bust, a higher percentage of revenue will flow to the bottom
line. The market will make a far better price for those
earnings, driving shares higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman deserves credit for understanding this, accepting
it, and for gaining first-mover advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this kind of thing keeps up, the next decade might
actually be a good one for investors in financial services, with
stocks enjoying expanding price/earnings multiples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And maybe even less volatile earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Four "bottom of the barrel" investment bankers from Goldman Sachs doomed Dragon Systems' sale to Lernout &amp; Hauspie nearly 13 years ago, a lawyer for the software company's founders said on Thursday in his closing argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dragon was small potatoes. So (Dragon) got Goldman's D-team," lawyer Alan Cotler said in a scathing rebuke of the iconic Wall Street bank. "They got the bottom of the barrel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 20th day of the trial in U.S. District Court in Boston also featured John Donovan, Goldman's top lawyer in the case, who portrayed Dragon as a desperate company looking for a white knight, even though top executives had misgivings about Belgium-based Lernout &amp; Hauspie's ethics and skyrocketing revenue in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is it the role of the investment bank to detect fraud?" Donovan said in his closing argument. "The answer is, 'No.' You turn to accountants for accounting questions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dragon founders Jim and Janet Baker have accused Goldman Sachs Group Inc of being negligent after Lernout &amp; Hauspie paid $580 million in stock for Dragon and then went bankrupt in the wake of an accounting scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the job of Goldman bankers to sniff out the accounting fraud that ultimately doomed Lernout &amp; Hauspie and made the remaining stock held by the Bakers worthless, Donovan argued. He also pointed out that the plaintiffs previously received $77 million from "the people actually responsible for the fraud" in a case several years ago against L, their bankers and accountants, that did not involve Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLOSING ARGUMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bakers owned 51 percent of the company but only were able to sell a few million dollars worth of L stock before the company collapsed in an accounting fraud. The Bakers and two other early Dragon employees are seeking several hundred million dollars in damages. The jury could begin deliberations as early as Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donovan criticized Janet Baker, who had been Dragon's chief executive and then just chairman, for cutting Rich Wayner, Goldman's lead banker on the assignment, out of the loop. She began negotiating with L directly and hashed out an all-stock deal on a cocktail napkin. Donovan said Janet Baker acted as her own investment banker and blamed Goldman for her own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Donovan said Wayner implored Dragon to have an outside accounting firm do a deep dive into Lernout &amp; Hauspie's financial statements. That advice fell on deaf ears, though, Donovan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cotler, however, portrayed Wayner, who left Goldman more than a decade ago, as uncaring and unwilling to scrutinize Lernout &amp; Hauspie's revenue projections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wayner didn't care. He was thinking about starting his own company. He wasn't connecting the dots," Cotler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said Goldman's team misrepresented one of its London-based analysts as an expert on Lernout &amp; Hauspie. That analyst later testified he wasn't following the company when he got on a conference call with Dragon executives and made positive comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, he said he didn't know about a big spike in Lernout &amp; Hauspie's revenue in Asia. Had he known that, he said he would have been skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's negligence and misrepresentation," Cotler told jurors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cotler also said Wayner didn't tell Dragon executives he was dissatisfied with the information he was getting from Lernout &amp; Hauspie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They didn't give financial advice," Cotler said. "They acted like they were giving financial advice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The story corrects to knight, not night, in third paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/zlqhq2/global_government) has
announced the addition of the "Global Government Cloud Computing Market
2012-2016" report to their offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Government Cloud Computing market to
grow at a CAGR of 6.2 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors
contributing to this market growth is the need for reduced total cost of
ownership. The Global Government Cloud Computing market has also been witnessing
the emerging hybrid approach to cloud solutions. However, increasing concern
about data security could pose a challenge to the growth of this market. 

The key vendors dominating this market space are Amazon.com Inc., Google Inc.,
IBM Corp., Microsoft Corp., and Salesforce.com Inc. 

The other vendors mentioned in the report are Cisco Systems, NetSuite Inc.,
Oracle Corp., Rackspace Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., VMware Inc., ATandT
Corp., CA Technologies Inc., and Infor Global Solutions. 

Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Enterprise Computing team
said: ''One of the major trends being witnessed in the Global Government Cloud
Computing market is the increased adoption of the hybrid model for the
deployment of cloud-based solutions. The cloud computing vendors are providing
capabilities to deploy enterprise network resources into the public and the
private clouds. The public cloud provides government organizations with
much-needed elasticity and reduced cost of running these applications. Also, the
public cloud approach does not have the same capabilities for control and
compliance as offered through the private cloud architecture model. Thus, many
organizations are embracing a hybrid cloud approach to utilize benefits offered
by the private as well as public cloud models. Thus, the Global Government Cloud
Computing market is witnessing a trend where many vendors are offering a hybrid
model for utilizing cloud infrastructure services.'' 

According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the need for
reduced total cost of ownership. With cloud computing, the risk and resource
requirements associated with the responsibility for continuous operation,
backups, updates, and infrastructure maintenance is shifted from internal IT to
vendors or service providers.

&lt;p&gt;MADRID Jan 17 (Reuters) - Procter &amp; Gamble is
cutting around 150 jobs in Spain and Portugal following the
decision to integrate hygiene company Arbora &amp; Ausonia (A)
into its existing operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P, which makes a host of well-known household products
from prescription drugs to Fairy washing-up liquid, has already
said it would lay off thousands of workers worldwide in a
cost-cutting plan designed to reinvigorate its performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P acquired 100 percent of A, which makes nappies, Tampax
tampons and adult incontinence products, last year after food
company Agrolimen sold its 50 percent stake in the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A succession of companies in Spain are slashing jobs in
response to a painful recession. Airline Iberia plans
to cut up to 4,500 posts, while 12,000 banking jobs are expected
to go this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic growth is not expected until 2014 in Spain, where
one in four of the workforce is jobless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P said the plan focused on 300 jobs at A's main offices
in Barcelona and Lisbon and in its sales networks. The company -
which employs a total of around 2,500 in Spain - said it
expected to offer new jobs for around 150 workers, while the
rest would be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A's plants in the Spanish towns of Montornes, Mequinenza
and Jijona would carry on operating without significant changes
to their structure, P said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A has sales of more than 500 million euros ($665
million)in Spain and 100 million in Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P reports results on Jan. 25, when it will likely update
on its restructuring efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-listed P's shares were up 0.5 percent at $69.6 by
1629 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Coca-Cola will give 3 million euros ($4 million) to conservation group WWF over the next three years to help kickstart a campaign to protect the Arctic from the impacts of global warming, the world's biggest soft-drinks maker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Europe-wide campaign, which launched on Thursday in London, is aimed at raising awareness and funding to help protect the natural habitat of the polar bear, which is under threat from climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists say the Arctic is currently warming twice as fast as the global average and summer sea ice is disappearing at a rate of about 11 percent a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice thawed to a record low last year due to climate change. Most experts estimate the ice could disappear completely in summer in 30 to 40 years, though some scientists say it might thaw as soon as 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shrinking ice mass threatens many Arctic ecosystems and species. The polar bear, a well-worn symbol of global warming's effects on the region, is already feeling threatened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ice retreats, polar bears are forced to spend more time on land hunting for food.

&lt;p&gt;* Europe-wide campaign to help protect polar bears&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Arctic summer ice thawed to record low last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 17 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola will give 3
million euros ($4 million) to conservation group WWF over the
next three years to help kickstart a campaign to protect the
Arctic from the impacts of global warming, the world's biggest
soft-drinks maker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Europe-wide campaign, which launched on Thursday in
London, is aimed at raising awareness and funding to help
protect the natural habitat of the polar bear, which is under
threat from climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists say the Arctic is currently warming twice as fast
as the global average and summer sea ice is disappearing at a
rate of about 11 percent a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice thawed to a record low last year due to climate change.
Most experts estimate the ice could disappear completely in
summer in 30 to 40 years, though some scientists say it might
thaw as soon as 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shrinking ice mass threatens many Arctic ecosystems and
species. The polar bear, a well-worn symbol of global warming's
effects on the region, is already feeling threatened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ice retreats, polar bears are forced to spend more time
on land hunting for food. As a result, people in some Arctic
communities have encountered more bears which can be dangerous
for the people and the bears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign aims to raise awareness and funds in European
countries for the plight of the polar bear. The money raised
will go towards protecting an area in the Arctic where summer
sea ice should last the longest, WWF and Coca-Cola said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That area covers 1.4 million km sq in northern Greenland and
northern Canada - equivalent to a region bigger than both France
and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money will also help WWF to study the polar bear
population and habitat and help Arctic communities living close
to an increasingly hungry polar bear population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola said it hopes the campaign will bring the Arctic
into people's homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as a new TV commercial in Europe, the company is
launching more than 300 million Coca-Cola packs and cans showing
a polar bear family travelling across the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Polar bears have been a much-loved part of our iconic
Coca-Cola advertising for over 90 years and because of this
strong tie, and our partnership with the WWF, we want to help
create a future for polar bears and their Arctic home," said
Hilary Quinn, Coca-Cola's Brand Director for North West Europe
and the Nordics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of the campaign are available at www.arctichome.eu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Agnes T. Crane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has gone soft on Jamie Dimon over the so-called whale trade. The bank&#8217;s 132-page report into $6.2 billion-worth of losses dishes out blame to several now departed managers. But it just echoes the chairman and chief executive&#8217;s own mea culpa. The more than $10 million docked from Dimon&#8217;s pay will sting, but the board could do more &#8211; like removing one of his hats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Dimon didn&#8217;t shy away from his and the bank&#8217;s failings. After initially calling news of the money-losing trades in JPMorgan&#8217;s chief investment office last year &#8220;a tempest in a teapot,&#8221; he faced up to them, defending the bank in front of the media, lawmakers and shareholders and accepting he had not paid enough attention. The lapse was a particular blow because JPMorgan had been considered the best managed bank on Wall Street through the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s task force report heaps a good portion of the blame on people who reported directly to Dimon, including former CIO head Ina Drew, ex-finance chief Douglas Braunstein and former Chief Risk Officer Barry Zubrow. Drew was bundled out, Zubrow is retiring, and Braunstein was replaced as finance chief. Yet when it came to Dimon, the task force said its views were &#8220;consistent with the conclusions (Dimon) himself has reached&#8221; about the firm&#8217;s and his own shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board has made a statement by paying Dimon only half what he pocketed for 2011 &#8211; though $11.5 million is still a pretty good living, and reflects the bank&#8217;s record profit in 2012. Yet when a big risk management failure occurs, directors need to consider options more radical than the mostly procedural and reporting changes that have already been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One could be to split the roles of chairman and CEO. A well-chosen chairman provides a check on a CEO&#8217;s powers. In one indication that this can work, GMI Ratings last year concluded that an executive pulling double duty can earn 50 percent more than the total pay of two people performing the top jobs separately. An independent chairman could galvanize and maybe refresh JPMorgan&#8217;s board. Perhaps most importantly at a complex bank, a chairman could also share the load as the bank&#8217;s figurehead, allowing Dimon to spend more time making sure the next whale trade doesn&#8217;t fall through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;

* JPMorgan Chase gifted The Foundry $40,000 to continue spurring economic
development in the state, and to develop Salt Lake City`s Granary District as a
new business hub in Utah`s capital city 
* Innovative business incubator program The Foundry has trained more than 200
aspiring entrepreneurs since its founding in 2010, and launched 35 successful
companies still in operation

SALT LAKE CITY--(Business Wire)--
The Foundry is an innovative business incubator and entrepreneur-training
program created by the University of Utah`s David Eccles School of Business to
foster economic development in Utah while giving students hands-on experience
launching startup companies. It has been thriving since its formation in 2010. 

The business community has taken notice, and long-time business school supporter
JPMorgan Chase recently continued its partnership with The Foundry through a
$40,000 contribution. The gift will help the program continue sparking economic
activity in Utah, in particular the further development of the Granary District
of Salt Lake City, where The Foundry makes its home, into an entrepreneurial hub
in Utah`s capital city. 

This is just the latest effort by JPMorgan Chase to support the David Eccles
School of Business. In the past, the company has contributed to the school`s tax
clinic, scholarship program and several events hosted by the school. In 2012,
JPMorgan Chase contributed $35,000 to The Foundry to help increase the program`s
outreach to low- and moderate-income students and community members. 

"It`s incredibly gratifying to see that businesses like JPMorgan Chase recognize
the work of our student entrepreneurs, and want to join them in creating a
vibrant economy in Utah," said Taylor Randall, dean of the David Eccles School
of Business. "There is no greater force for economic progress than the
development of savvy, civic-minded entrepreneurs, and The Foundry has created
many great successes in contributing to Utah`s economy in its first three
years." 

The Foundry has been a success from its 2010 launch, attracting aspiring
entrepreneurs from inside the David Eccles School of Business and from other
Utah universities hoping to take advantage of all The Foundry has to offer,
including business training, office space and access to The Foundry`s business
partners who provide a wide array of services and knowledge like organizational
strategy, financing and marketing expertise. 

Since its beginning, 213 entrepreneurs have gone through The Foundry`s program,
50 companies have filed articles of incorporation, and 35 companies remain in
operation. The program employs a peer-driven coaching model, with Foundry
members coaching one another through the business-building process, with
educators and professionals filling in any knowledge gaps for the students
involved. And even if some students don`t start a new company at the end of
their stint in The Foundry, they often find themselves getting interest from
companies recognizing their participation in the unique program, earning
internships and full-time jobs as a result. 

This gift from JPMorgan Chase will help The Foundry in developing relationships
with small businesses and residents of Salt Lake City`s Granary District. By
partnering with non-profits and government agencies, The Foundry will be able to
offer spaces in the area for new startups begun through The Foundry, and lend
business expertise to the diverse business community helping restore life to the
neighborhood that began as a railroad-reliant region of Salt Lake City before
interstate highways forced the railroad to move west in the Salt Lake Valley,
leaving the Granary District as an attractive but underused area in need of
revitalization. 

The Foundry, using the gift from JPMorgan Chase, will be able to promote that
revitalization while offering its students hands-on experiences unrivaled in
higher education in Utah. 

About the David Eccles School of Business

Founded in 1917 in Salt Lake City, the David Eccles School of Business has
programs in entrepreneurship, technology innovation and venture capital
management. Emphasizing interdisciplinary education and experiential learning,
it launched the country`s largest student-run venture capital fund with $18.3
million, and is home to the Pierre Lassonde Entrepreneur Center and the Sorenson
Center for Discovery and Innovation. Approximately 3,500 students are enrolled
in its undergraduate, graduate and executive degree programs as well as joint
MBA programs in architecture, law and health administration. For more

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Top executives at Goldman Sachs (GS.N) have been considering deep cuts to staffing levels and pay for at least two years, but feared too many layoffs would leave the firm unprepared for an eventual pickup in business, people familiar with the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They instead chipped away at staff levels and focused on non-personnel expenses that are less painful to cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But investors pressured the bank to cut costs further, the sources said, and on Wednesday, Goldman gave in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest standalone investment bank said in the fourth quarter it cut the percentage of revenues it pays to employees in half to 21 percent. That brings the ratio for the entire year to its second-lowest level since the bank went public in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less money going to employees, more was available for shareholders. The bank's annualized return on equity - which measures how well the bank uses shareholder money to generate profit - jumped to 16.5 percent in the fourth quarter from 5.8 percent a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Arguably for the first time, Wall Street's shareholders are getting the lion's share of the profitability," said Brad Hintz, a former Morgan Stanley treasurer who is now an analyst at Bernstein Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's quarterly profit tripled, helped by gains from investments and bond trading as well, and investors sent its shares up 4 percent to $141.09, their highest level since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said other banks are likely to feel pressure to keep their compensation expenses in check after Goldman's results. But for Morgan Stanley (MS.N), the second-biggest stand-alone U.S. investment bank, paying out a lower percentage of its revenue to employees could be tough because analysts believe its revenue fell last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman missed the worst pitfalls of the financial crisis but has suffered public relations embarrassments from trades it executed during the crisis and from executives' comments afterward. The bank, along with the rest of the industry, is struggling to figure out how to navigate the post-crisis world, in which clients trade less and regulations and capital rules crimp profits in many businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether Goldman maintains its discipline on pay will be a test for Harvey Schwartz, who succeeds David Viniar as CFO at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call with investors, Schwartz declined to provide a target for compensation levels, but emphasized that shareholder returns would be one crucial factor in deciding how much revenue goes to employee pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't look to overpay anybody," Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YEARS OF COST-CUTTING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman first publicly signaled its intent to get serious about cost-cutting in July 2011, when Viniar outlined a plan to reduce costs by $1.2 billion a year, partly by laying off employees. Since then, Goldman expanded that cost-cutting plan by $500 million and has winnowed staff almost every quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff reductions have targeted big earners, including dozens of partners, who have left since the start of 2011. Sources inside the bank expect that exodus to continue this year as Goldman makes way for younger employees to move up the ladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say that strategy is common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The polite way to characterize it is a &#8216;generational change' - where you promote the young guys and you don't pay them," said Hintz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, as the bank's revenue dropped, average pay per employee fell as well. While the average Goldman worker brought home nearly $622,000 in pay in 2006, that figure dropped to $367,057 per person in 2011, with the biggest decline happening between 2007 and 2008. But the percentage of revenue that the bank paid to employees did not stop falling until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth-quarter drop meant that for all of 2012, Goldman paid employees 37.9 percent of the bank's revenue, down from 42 percent in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Management appears to be doing a superb job at keeping all expenses down and, in particular, retaining quality people without giving all the revenue away in the form of compensation," said Joe Terril, president of St. Louis-based investment firm Terril &amp; Co, who invests in bank stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WALL STREET WOES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many banks are facing the same long-term revenue pressure as Goldman, and analysts expect layoffs across Wall Street. Morgan Stanley plans 1,600 job cuts in 2013, while Goldman cut 900 jobs in 2012, equal to about 3 percent of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But laying off staff may not be enough, and employee pay may have to fall too. Hintz, the Bernstein Research analyst, estimates that across Wall Street average pay in trading businesses could fall 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's only one way to get returns up on Wall Street, and that's to cut the compensation of the employees," Hintz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have been pressuring banks to pay less of their revenue to employees. In 2011, investors pressed Morgan Stanley executives to pay somewhere closer to 30 percent of the bank's revenue to employees, instead of around 50 percent, according to one person at those meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Dan Wilchins, Paritosh Bansal and Ryan Woo)&lt;/p&gt;

Thursday, when the shares were granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The award was 53 percent larger than the 61,702 restricted
shares Blankfein received last year when Goldman's shares traded
at $113.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Blankfein did not get the biggest award. Vice Chairman
Michael Sherwood, who is co-head of Goldman's international
division, received 109,461, according to a separate filing. That
award was worth $15.4 million as of Thursday's closing price of
$141.01.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock awards for executives will be delivered in three
equal installments through 2016 and generally cannot be sold for
five years. Fo r board members, the shares will be delivered on
the first trading day of the third quarter the year after they
retire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn and outgoing Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar each received 85,136 restricted
shares worth $12 million. Vice Chairmen Michael Evans, who is
global head of growth markets, and John Weinberg, who is a
co-head of investment banking, each received 75,208 restricted

Goldman's board in November, to 3,829 shares worth roughly
$539,927 for lead director James Schiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the directors received 28,741 restricted shares

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded three classes and affirmed 10 classes of JP Morgan
Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities (JP Morgan) commercial mortgage
pass-through certificates series 2003-CIBC6. A detailed list of rating actions
follows at the end of this press release. 

Key Rating Drivers 

The downgrades reflect an increase in Fitch expected losses across the pool.
Fitch modeled losses of 2.8% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the
original pool balance total 2.7%, including losses already incurred. The pool
has experienced $7.4 million (0.7% of the original pool balance) in realized
losses to date. Fitch has designated 19 loans (12.2%) as Fitch Loans of Concern,
which includes three specially serviced assets (1.6%). 

As of the December 2012 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal
balance has been reduced by 25.4% to $793.2 million from $1.06 billion at
issuance. Per the servicer reporting, 28 loans (42.4% of the pool) are defeased.
Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes N through NR. 

The largest contributor to expected losses is secured by a 43,169 square foot
(SF) office property in Sacramento, CA (0.7% of the pool). The collateral had
transferred to special servicing in April 2012 due to payment default. The
property experienced cash flow issues when the buildings largest tenant,
Sacramento County (48% of the net rentable area [NRA]), had vacated upon its
lease expiration in February 2012. The property became REO in November 2012. The
servicer is currently working to stabilize the property and has hired a
third-party management company to assist with property management and leasing. 

The next largest contributor to expected losses is secured by a portfolio of
three Colorado mobile home parks containing a total of 246 pads (0.5%). The
subject loan transferred to special servicing in January 2011 due to payment
default. The entire portfolio is currently 51% occupied. One of the parks
located in Fort Morgan, CO (80 units; 27% of allocated balance) has been forced
to shut down because of water safety issues with remaining occupancy currently
at 11%. A receiver is in place, and the servicer is pursuing foreclosure. 

Fitch downgrades the following classes and assigns Recovery Estimates (REs) as
indicated: 

--$5.2 million class L to 'CCCsf' from 'B-sf'; RE 100%; 

--$3.9 million class M to 'CCsf' from 'CCCsf'; RE 50%; 

--$1.3 million class N to 'Csf' from 'CCsf'; RE 0%. 

Fitch affirms the following classes but revises Rating Outlooks as indicated: 

--$15.6 million class H at 'BBBsf'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$5.2 million class J at 'BBsf'; Outlook to Negative from Stable; 

--$7.8 million class K at 'Bsf'; Outlook to Negative from Stable. 

Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated: 

--$610.6 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$31.2 million class B at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$32.5 million class C at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$11.7 million class D at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$14.3 million class E at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$10.4 million class F at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$13 million class G at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable. 

The class A-1 certificate and the interest only class X-2 certificate have paid
in full. Fitch does not rate the class NR, BM-1, BM-2, BM-3, AC-1, AC-2 and AC-3
certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only class
X-1 certificates.

&lt;p&gt;By Richard Beales and Martin Hutchinson
The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was supposed to be among the best managers of bank risk in the world. This week it published an internal report into the failings which led to $6.2 billion of trading losses at its chief investment office in 2012. If the mix revealed  conflicting mandates, discredited theory, inadequate checks and primitive technology  is really as good as it gets, financial watchdogs and investors everywhere should worry. There are plenty of lessons for regulators and bank executives who want things done right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the controls should match the mission of a unit that manages excess cash, as the CIO did, and is trying to make money in the process. The report suggests JPMorgan&#8217;s supervision was set for the days when the CIO was a sleepier and much smaller operation which engaged in simple, old-fashioned hedging. Not enough changed when the CIO morphed into a trading operation that was a force in the market for complex synthetic credit default swaps. One trader was nicknamed the London Whale in press reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the CIO was under pressure to minimize reported risk. Models are used to calculate the measures of risk: risk-weighted assets (RWA), used to calculate capital strength, and value-at-risk (VaR), used to estimate likely losses. When the models suggested that some assets should be sold to keep the risk at an acceptable level, the unit&#8217;s traders sometimes just tried to change the models. But the bank&#8217;s senior risk staff did not summon up the necessary skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the CIO&#8217;s VaR models relied on flawed theory. Credit default swaps simply don&#8217;t behave in line with the normal, or Gaussian, distribution typically assumed. The so-called tail risks, or the chances of extreme events, are bigger than that theory predicts. Ina Drew, who ran the CIO, referred to one day&#8217;s mark-to-market losses as an eight standard deviation event, according to the report. That translates mathematically into something that should only happen once every several trillion years. It makes no more sense than Goldman Sachs finance chief David Viniar&#8217;s famous remark as the crisis unfolded in 2007 about seeing 25 standard deviation events, several days in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, not only was the VaR approach flawed, but JPMorgan did not calculate VaR correctly. At least one model was stored on Excel spreadsheets with formulae that hadn&#8217;t been properly checked. Inputs were supposed to be updated manually, but some numbers were out of date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone in another part of JPMorgan even spotted an error in the CIO&#8217;s VaR calculation. For the person in question to take the time to identify the mistake, the VaR number must have looked badly off-kilter. Yet CIO managers dismissed it as a one-off. At best, the CIO&#8217;s systems last year look alarmingly amateurish. At worst, the managers didn&#8217;t understand or care much about the risks. Either way, these problems provide definitive talking points for regulators examining other companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next comes the pricing of illiquid positions. It&#8217;s a fact of a financial firm&#8217;s life that when there is room for judgment or different answers, it is in a trader&#8217;s interest to provide the rosiest possible numbers. That clearly happened in the CIO. It did not follow best industry practice of asking outsiders to provide prices for illiquid positions. Managers should not rely on traders themselves, as the CIO largely did  but JPMorgan is surely not the only institution to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illiquid assets are also hard to shift, and for the CIO&#8217;s massive trades even accurate models would not have been reliable indicators of actual market prices. Other traders and financial media were already picking up on the CIO&#8217;s huge positions, but Jamie Dimon, the bank&#8217;s chief executive, agreed that these rumblings were just &#8220;a tempest in a teapot.&#8221; It was a big teapot: certain derivative positions may have had a nominal value of as much as $10 trillion, although there were other offsetting trades. Small mistakes about market prices could, and did, lead to large losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon and his subordinates understandably wanted to believe that everything was indeed under control; unfortunately they believed it without first asking enough hard questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, JPMorgan&#8217;s report concludes that its compensation system wasn&#8217;t a problem. But it looks as though the incentive system didn&#8217;t help. Some traders were reluctant to unwind positions fully because it would crystallize losses, which would in turn normally hurt bonuses. Drew did nothing to reassure them. In any case, for bank traders, closing positions feels like housekeeping, which is never as well paid as making profitable trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank bosses and regulators alike need to ensure that measuring, managing and minimizing risk is part of the culture of any trading room. JPMorgan&#8217;s whale debacle shows how not to do it. Dimon has taken steps designed to change things. With luck, the lessons will help other banks avoid similar troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia denied entry to a former commander of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in retaliation against U.S. moves to punish Russian human rights violators, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Denisov said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States finalized the Magnitsky Act, named after an anti-corruption lawyer who died in a Moscow prison in 2009, in December to bar entry for alleged Russian rights violators and freeze any assets they hold in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia denied a visa to Rear Admiral Jeffrey Harbeson, former commander at the Guantanamo U.S. Naval Base in Cuba who now oversees Europe, NATO and Russia affairs at the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, a state-linked newspaper said in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Izvestia said Harbeson was denied a visa at the end of 2011, when Washington had already denied visas to some Russians believed to be linked to Sergei Magnitsky's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have already denied entry to some American general, who was commander at the Guantanamo base," Denisov said in response to a question about blacklisted Americans, Interfax news agency said. He did not specify the timing or give the general's name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the Magnitsky Act, Russia rushed through a law introducing similar measures against Americans it accuses of violating the rights of Russians abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also imposed a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian orphans, citing cases of mistreatment by adoptive parents there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 60 U.S. citizens are now barred from entering, Alexei Pushkov, head of the lower chamber of parliament's foreign affairs committee and a member of President Vladimir Putin's ruling party, was quoted as saying by the Itar-Tass news agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It includes judges, agents, representatives of security services, prosecutors ... as well as congressmen who were the authors of the Magnitsky Act and Americans who have violated the rights of children adopted from Russia," he said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pushkov said the first such list had appeared in October 2012 and included 11 Americans linked to the Guantanamo U.S. Naval Base in Cuba and alleged secret CIA prisons in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campaigners say the indefinite detentions of inmates at the U.S. base, including alleged September 11 conspirators, are illegal. U.S. President Barack Obama vowed on taking office in 2009 to close the prison and bring inmates to trial in civilian courts but has faced opposition from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin, a former KGB spy, has repeatedly criticized Washington for its treatment of Guantanamo inmates, suggesting the United States had no moral right to lecture Russia on human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked for comment, the Russian Foreign Ministry said its policy was not to name those barred from entering Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Moscow declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow and Washington attempted to mend relations when Obama first entered the White House, but ties have cooled since Putin, an ardent critic of the West, returned to the Kremlin last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adoptions ban upset Russian rights campaigners who accuse the government of politicizing the issue. Putin's adviser on child rights said this week the ban will not be overturned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexei Anishchuk; Additional reporting by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Louise Ireland)&lt;/p&gt;

worth nearly $100 million as part of their 2012 bonus awards,
according to securities filings on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein received 94,320

&lt;p&gt;Jan 18 - Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services said today that General Electric
Co.'s (GE; AA+/Stable/A-1+) fourth-quarter 2012 results do not affect our
ratings or outlook on the company. 

Industrial sales were up 2% year over year. Industrial organic revenue growth 
in the quarter was 4%. The equipment backlog and service backlog both rose 
sequentially; the total reached a record $210 billion (service backlog was 
$157 billion). Profitability trends were good. While order pricing for power 
and water and health care were down, the rest of industrial segments were up. 
Overall order price rose 0.5%. Industrial segment profit was up 12%, and 
margins in the quarter rose to 17.3%, up year over year and sequentially. For 
the year, segment margins were up 30 basis points. 

Industrial cash from operating activities (CFOA excluding dividends from GE 
Capital) was $11.4 billion, down 5% for the year (after pension 
contributions). We assumed industrial CFOA for all of 2012 would be at least 
$11 billion after pension contributions. 

GE reported consolidated earnings from continuing operations of $4.4 
billion--up 10% from the same period in 2011. Industrial segment profits were 
all up year over year in the quarter and for all of 2012. We assume margins 
will improve again in 2013 because of product mix and pricing. This would be 
consistent with GE's expectation of about a 70 basis point margin expansion 
this year.

GE ended the fourth quarter with industrial parent-level cash of $15.5 
billion--well above our assumed ongoing cash balances at the industrial parent 
of about $8 billion or more. This higher balance largely reflects parent-level 
debt issued in the fourth quarter to repay the February 2013 maturity of $5 
billion.

GE previously reduced its expectation for required pension funding 
significantly between 2012 and 2013, and contributed about $400 million in 
2012. Our rating assumption continues to be that GE will address its large 
postretirement obligation (which represents a majority of adjusted industrial 
debt), causing credit metrics to improve. The company has stated that its 
pension strategy (including plan changes) continues to focus on being fully 
funded in its primary plan. 

General Electric Capital Corp.'s improved performance continued. Pretax 
earnings were $1.9 billion, up 11% from 2011, while ending net investment was 
$419 billion (excluding cash) down 6%. The real estate segment profit was $309 
million, compared with a loss in 2011.

KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(Business Wire)--
Commerce Bank is offering Visa&#174; Signature Credit Card holders more convenience
and safety when traveling abroad with the addition of the chip-enabled Visa
Signature Credit Card to its line of credit card products. The card is embedded
with a Europay, MasterCard&#174; and Visa (EMV&#174;) microchip that provides customers
with greater acceptance at international merchants where chip card terminals
have become the standard. The microchip contains encrypted data which is more
difficult to counterfeit if the card is lost or stolen, thereby providing
enhanced credit card security for those customers traveling abroad. 

"We are excited to offer our customers a product that will make international
transactions more convenient and secure," said Carl Bradbury, Director of
Consumer Card Products. "As the payments industry continues to evolve, Commerce
Bank understands the utmost importance of protecting our customers against
fraudulent activity. We view the chip-enabled Visa Signature Credit Card as a
way for customers to experience greater card acceptance, enhanced security, and
overall increased peace of mind while travelling internationally." 

The chip-enabled credit card includes elements that offer each transaction an
additional layer of security for regular purchases in stores as well as those
made at unattended terminals such as automated ticket dispensers commonly found

&lt;p&gt;Jan 18 (IFR) - Zoetis and Goldman Sachs drew huge orders for
their new bonds this week, showing demand for US high-grade
paper remains red-hot despite recent indications that investors
are increasingly turned off by the relatively meagre returns
available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoetis, a unit of Pfizer, on Wednesday sold its
debut bond offering, a US$3.65bn four-part deal. The order book
of about US$30bn allowed it to sharply tighten pricing from
original guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same day Goldman Sachs printed a self-led
US$6bn three-part trade that had a US$15bn book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The response to these deals was ridiculous," said one
senior banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Receiving orders north of US$30bn for Zoetis is a
staggering result. This demand is clearly at odds with all that
speculation that investments are moving out of bonds into
equities and that the high-grade issuance party is over. Clearly
it is not over yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After these latest two deals, bankers are wondering whether
they were hasty in calling an end to the flurry of issuance seen
in the high-grade market over the past couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, many bond deals have priced with wider new
issue concessions, and bankers have been increasingly talking
about an absence of momentum in investment-grade credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reasons for the wariness include an unexpected gush of
issuance in the first two weeks of January and uncertainty about
the direction of interest rates. Yields were also touching new
lows and a sell-off in US Treasuries - even as corporate spreads
have tightened - has meant total returns on high-grade
investments have turned negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of January 16, the yield-to-worst for high-grade paper
was 2.73%, near the all-time lowest level, while the
year-to-date total return for high-grade investments is a
negative 0.11%. Those who invested in high-yield, on the other
hand, are sitting on a year-to-date return of 1.31%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays analysts captured that increasingly negative view
of investment-grade debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think recent weeks have supported our underweight
allocation to investment-grade credit. Our view since last
September has been that the additional spread offered by global
credit is insufficient to compensate for the lack of liquidity,
particularly in the higher quality credits, leading us to favour
the high-yield segment of the market," the analysts said in a
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AUSPICIOUS DEBUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response to Zoetis and Goldman might suggest that not
every investor shares that view, though there are specific
reasons for piling into the former's debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal came a day before Zoetis - one of the world's
biggest animal health and vaccines businesses - said it expected
to price its IPO of 86.1m Class A shares at between US$22 and
US$25 per share to raise US$2.15bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will exchange Zoetis Class A shares with affiliates
of the underwriters for outstanding indebtedness of Pfizer. The
underwriters would then sell the shares in the offering and
they, and not Zoetis or Pfizer, will receive the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baa2/BBB- rated Zoetis had revenue of US$4.2bn for the year
ended December 31. It sold products in more than 120 countries
and across eight core species and five major product categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though the bonds were rated Triple B minus, the fact that 
much higher-rated credit Pfizer would still hold about 80% in
the company made the bonds attractive," said one banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, the risk entailed in the transaction was that Pfizer
was looking at an exit from the company. But for now it looked
like a decent deal coming from a company operating in a sector
that had no representation in terms of outstanding bonds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-IPO bond transaction saw Zoetis selling three-,
five-, 10- and 30-year bonds. Initial price talk was for
Treasuries plus 125bp on the three-year, plus 150bp on the
five-year, plus 175bp on the 10-year and plus 205bp on the
30-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These levels were tightened and the bond sizes set at
US$400m of three-years at plus 80bp; US$750m of five-years at
plus 115bp; US$1.35bn of 10-years at plus 145bp; and US$1.15bn
of 30-years at plus 175bp. In the end, Zoetis priced the deal
around the level of other pharmaceutical comparables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman made its move the same day with an unusually late
deal announcement following the completion of an analyst
conference call to go over its stellar earnings. Rated A3/A-/A-,
it ended up pricing a US$6bn three-part that included a tap of
outstanding 1.6% November 2015s. The demand was huge for the
transaction enabling the bank to price its bonds with new issue
concession ranging from a negative 5bp to flat to outstandings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other related fixed-income quotations, stories and

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Jan 18 (Marketwire) -- 
Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALGN) announced today that
SmartTrack(TM), the next generation of Invisalign clear aligner material,
will be available commercially on January 21, 2013. SmartTrack is a
highly elastic, proprietary new aligner material that delivers gentle,
more constant force to improve control of tooth movements with Invisalign
clear aligner treatment. In October 2012 Align announced SmartTrack would
become the new standard Invisalign aligner material for Invisalign clear
aligner products in North America, Europe, and other international
markets in the first quarter of 2013. 

    Compared to conventional aligner materials which relax and lose a
substantial percent of energy in the initial days of aligner wear,
SmartTrack maintains more constant force over the two weeks that a
patient wears the aligners. The flexible SmartTrack material is designed
to more precisely conform to tooth morphology, attachments, and
interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement throughout
treatment. The highly elastic SmartTrack material also makes it easier to
insert and remove aligners and delivers improved patient comfort. A
study* of more than 1,000 patients treated with Invisalign aligners made
with SmartTrack shows statistically significant improvement in control of
tooth movements such as rotations and extrusions compared to patients
treated with aligners made with current Invisalign material. 

    More than 5,200 Invisalign providers in North America pre-registered for
a series of SmartTrack "Ask the Expert" webinars taking place today. The
webinars are hosted by John Morton, Align director of research and
development, and Dr. Clark Colville, an orthodontist in Seguin, Texas and
participant in the SmartTrack study. The archived webinar and more
information on SmartTrack will be available at
www.aligntechinstitute.com/SmartTrack starting January 21st.

&lt;p&gt;
http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20130118:nBw185392a

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human
Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has adopted a positive opinion
regarding the conditional marketing authorization of bosutinib in the European
Union (EU) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase (CP),
accelerated phase (AP), and blast phase (BP) Philadelphia chromosome positive
chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph+ CML) previously treated with one or more
tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) (TKIs) and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and
dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options. 

The positive opinion for bosutinib was based on data from Study 200, a global,
single-arm, open-label, multi-cohort, Phase 1/2 study of bosutinib in more than
500 patients with Ph+ CML with separate cohorts for chronic, accelerated and
blast phase disease previously treated with one or more prior TKIs. 

Conditional approvals in the EU are granted to medicinal products with a
positive benefit/risk assessment that address unmet medical needs and whose
availability would result in a significant public health benefit. 

CML accounts for 15 percent of all leukemia cases.1 Despite the availability of
existing treatments for CML, there remains a need for additional treatment
options. During the course of initial treatment some patients may never respond,
may develop drug-resistant disease or may not be able to tolerate their
therapy.2,3

"We are very pleased with this positive recommendation on bosutinib by the CHMP.
We believe that bosutinib, if approved by the European Commission, would
represent an important option for patients with CML who have progressed on prior
treatment and are not candidates for alternative treatments. The development of
bosutinib is evidence of our commitment to bringing meaningful new medicines to
patients with hematologic cancers," said Mace Rothenberg, MD, senior vice
president of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs, Pfizer Oncology Business
Unit. "We believe many doctors and CML patients will find this treatment, if
approved, to be a welcome addition, offering a distinct adverse event profile
and a convenient once-daily dosing regimen." 

The CHMP`s positive opinion will be reviewed by the European Commission, which
has the authority to approve medicines for the EU. Pfizer anticipates a decision
from the Commission in the coming months. 

About Bosutinib

Bosutinib is an oral, once-daily, kinase inhibitor, which limits cancer cell
growth by inhibiting the Abl and Src signaling pathways.4 Bosutinib was first
approved as BOSULIF&#174; in the United States (U.S.) in September 2012 for the
treatment of adult patients with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase Ph+ CML
with resistance, or intolerance to prior therapy. Bosutinib is an
investigational agent under review in other markets. 

Bosutinib (BOSULIF&#174;) U.S. Important Safety Information

Contraindication: Hypersensitivity to BOSULIF. Anaphylactic shock occurred in
less than 0.2% of treated patients. 

Gastrointestinal Toxicity: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can
occur. In the clinical trial, median time to onset for diarrhea was 2 days,
median duration was 1 day, and median number of episodes per patient was 3
(range 1-221). Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including
antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and/or fluid replacement. Withhold, dose reduce, or
discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. 

Myelosuppression: Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia can occur. A
complete blood count should be performed weekly for the first month and then
monthly or as clinically indicated. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue
BOSULIF as necessary. 

Hepatic Toxicity: Twenty percent of patients experienced an increase in either
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Liver enzyme
elevation usually occurs early in treatment. Perform monthly hepatic enzyme
tests for the first 3 months and as clinically indicated. In patients with
transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Drug-induced
liver injury has occurred. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as
necessary. 

Fluid Retention: Fluid retention can occur and may cause pericardial effusion,
pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema. Monitor and manage
patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF
as necessary. 

Embryofetal Toxicity: BOSULIF may cause fetal harm when administered to a
pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential
hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving BOSULIF. 

Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions observed in greater than
20% of patients in the Phase 1/2 safety population (N=546) were diarrhea,
nausea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, anemia, pyrexia, and
fatigue. 

The most common Grade 3/4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities
observed in greater than 10% of patients were thrombocytopenia, anemia, and
neutropenia. 

Drug Interactions: Avoid concurrent use with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors
or inducers. 

Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs): Consider using short-acting antacids or H2
blockers instead of PPIs. Separate antacid or H2 blocker dosing and BOSULIF
dosing by more than 2 hours. 

Substrates of P-glycoprotein: BOSULIF may increase the plasma concentrations of
drugs that are P-gp substrates, such as digoxin. 

Nursing Mothers: Given the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing
infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or BOSULIF. 

Hepatic Impairment: Treat with a dose of 200 mg daily in patients with any
baseline hepatic impairment.

&lt;p&gt;DOHA Jan 20 (Reuters) - JP Morgan will act as lead
manager for Doha Bank's upcoming share sale, the
lender's chief executive said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doha Bank announced earlier this month plans to increase its
capital by 50 percent, with a quarter raised through a local
rights issue and the remainder from a share sale in London.
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's one composite deal. For the rights issue, we have the
know-how in house. The capital raising is another aspect, and
the lead management for that will come from JP Morgan," Doha
Bank chief executive Raghavan Seetharaman told a news conference
in the Qatari capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lender, part-owned by the Gulf state's sovereign wealth
fund, plans to increase capital by 25 percent by issuing new
shares to current shareholders at 30 riyals per share - a
discount to its market price of 54 riyals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doha Bank's capital levels are lower than its Qatari peers
and proceeds from the share issue are expected to be used mainly
to plug that shortfall, the bank said earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer is not the right leader for the world's largest software company but holds his grip on it by systematically forcing out any rising manager who challenges his authority, claims a former senior executive who has written a book about his time at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For Microsoft to really get back in the game seriously, you need a big change in management," said Joachim Kempin, who worked at Microsoft between 1983 and 2002, overseeing the sales of Windows software to computer makers for part of that time. "As much as I respect Steve Ballmer, he may be part of that in the end."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a senior vice president in charge of a crucial part of the company's business with direct access to co-founder Bill Gates, Kempin is the most senior former Microsoft executive to write a book critical of the company, which is famous for the loyalty of its ex-employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His criticism echoes that of investor David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who called for Ballmer to step down in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kempin left Microsoft under a cloud in 2002 as some of the aggressive contracts he crafted with PC makers were seen as fodder for the U.S. government's antitrust prosecution of the company, which started in 1998 and was largely resolved by 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His book, titled 'Resolve and Fortitude: Microsoft's "secret power broker" breaks his silence', is scheduled to be published on Tuesday. He talked with Reuters by phone on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEFEND THE THRONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kempin charges Ballmer with purposefully ousting any executives with potential to wrest him from the CEO seat, which he has occupied since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he saw the process first with Richard Belluzzo, a former Hewlett-Packard executive credited with launching the Xbox game console who rose to chief operating officer at Microsoft but left after only 14 months in the post, in the same year Kempin left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He (Belluzzo) had no room to breathe on the top. When you work that directly with Ballmer and Ballmer believes 'maybe this guy could someday take over from me', my God, you will have less air to breathe, that's what it comes down to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft representatives declined comment. Attempts to reach Belluzzo were not successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several leading executives, touted by outsiders at one time or another as potential successors to Ballmer, have left the company in the last few years, most recently Windows unit chief Steven Sinofsky, who departed in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Sinofsky, Windows and online head Kevin Johnson went to run Juniper Networks Inc, Office chief Stephen Elop went to lead phone maker Nokia Oyj, while Ray Ozzie, the software guru Gates designated as Microsoft's big-picture thinker, left to start his own project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ozzie is a great software guy, he knew what he was doing. But when you see Steve (Ballmer) and him on stage where he (Ozzie) opposed Steve, it was Steve's way or the highway," said Kempin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kempin said he spoke to Ballmer around two years ago and expressed his concerns about his management style and direction of the company, but has seen no changes since.

I don't think so. Microsoft's board is a lame duck board, has been forever. They hire people to help them administer the company, but not to lead the company. That's the problem," said Kempin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need somebody maybe 35-40 years old, a younger person who understands the Facebook Inc generation and this mobile community.

&lt;p&gt;* Exxon Mobil, Baghdad at odds over Kurdish deals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* U.S. major seeking to sell stake in West Qurna oilfield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ahmed Rasheed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil has asked
Iraq's prime minister if it can keep running a huge southern
oilfield despite disagreements over rival contracts signed with
the country's autonomous Kurdistan region, the government said
on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The face-to-face talks between Shi'ite premier Nuri
al-Maliki and Exxon's top executive in Baghdad come as the U.S.
major offers to sell its stake in the West Qurna-1 oilfield in
the south after clashing with Baghdad over its deals with the
self-ruled Kurdish enclave in the north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq has been clear it considers deals oil companies like
Exxon sign with the Kurdish enclave illegal. But the meeting may
suggest Exxon is testing its room to balance investments with
OPEC-member's central government and those with the
self-governed Kurdistan region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon Mobil asked to meet with the prime minister to know
his opinion on the company's contracts in the south and in the
northern region and if there was a possibility to keep working
on both contracts," Maliki's media adviser Ali al-Moussawi said
after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The prime minister's answer was clear to the head of Exxon
that they can't keep operating on both deals at the same time
and they should observe Iraq's laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statement from the government said only that Exxon Chief
Executive Rex Tillerson had "expressed his company's keenness to
continue and expand its work in Iraq."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials had said late last year that China National
Petroleum Corp, or CNPC, had emerged as the favourite in
negotiations to take over Exxon's 60 percent stake in the $50
billion the West Qurna-1 project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq's Arab-led central government and Kurdistan Regional
Government run by ethnic Kurds are caught in a dispute over
control of oil revenues, oilfields and territory that is testing
Iraq's federal union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq's government says it alone has the constitutional
authority to export crude oil and sign deals, but Kurdistan says
the constitution allows it to agree to contracts and ship oil
independently of Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempts to resolve the dispute have failed in part because
of disagreements over a long-delayed oil and gas law meant to
set a clearer framework for managing the country's vast oil
reserves, the world's fourth largest.&lt;/p&gt;

Taking the technology partnership into the digital space for the first time,
ExxonMobil and NASCAR will launch a new branded content platform that explores
NASCAR`s world-class automotive technology via the "NASCAR Automotive Technology

THE WOODLANDS, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP (Chevron Phillips Chemical) announced it is
studying the possibility of expanding its normal alpha olefins (NAO) capacity -
targeting at least a 20 percent increase in a phased approach - at its Cedar
Bayou Chemical Complex in Baytown, Texas, and the company has filed the
necessary environmental permit application with Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (TCEQ). Construction would be targeted to commence in the
first quarter of 2014, and the project would be completed in the fourth quarter
of 2015. Final approval would be sought in the third quarter of 2013. 

"This study echoes Chevron Phillips Chemical`s strong commitment to the NAO
business and to meeting the growing demand of our customers," said Mitch

synergy with the 1-hexene plant currently being built at our Cedar Bayou
complex."

largest on-purpose 1-hexene plant capable of producing up to 250,000 metric tons
(551,000,000 lbs) per year at its Cedar Bayou complex. This project is
anticipated to start up during the first half of 2014 and utilizes Chevron
Phillips Chemical`s proprietary, 2nd generation, on-purpose 1-hexene technology
to produce comonomer grade 1-hexene with exceptional product purity from
ethylene.

&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD Jan 21 (Reuters) - Iraq's Prime Minister Nuri

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs's insurance
arm has agreed to insure 115 million pounds ($182 million) of
liabilities of food distributor Vestey Group's retirement fund,
making it the biggest player in the UK market for so-called bulk
purchase annuities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vestey's final salary-linked retirement plan, known as the
Western United Group Pension Scheme, is paying Goldman's
Rothesay Life for a form of investment policy that will generate
income to cover payments to its 14,000 members, the insurer said
on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction exchanged UK gilts for a bulk annuity
insurance policy to cover a portion of the pension liabilities
associated with Vestey's pension scheme, Rothesay Life said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rothesay, which launched in 2007 and acquired rival
Paternoster in 2011, said it wrote over 1 billion pounds of new
bulk annuity business in 2012, and expects a "strong pipeline of
opportunities" for 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand for bulk annuities has grown strongly in recent years
as pension funds, hit by longer lifespans and volatile financial
markets, seek to offload some of their obligations to insurers,
which are financially stronger and more expert in handling risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, British firms offering final salary-linked
pensions - known as defined benefit schemes - are struggling to
cope with rising deficits, exacerbated by weak economic growth
and repeated rounds of central bank easing, which have
contributed to a drop in the yield on British government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, UK specialist insurer Pension Insurance
Corporation completed a bulk annuity deal, which covers up to 30
million pounds of liabilities for the pension fund of metals
company Vesuvius, the insurer said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is the second bulk annuity transaction Pension Corp
has completed with the Vesuvius retirement fund - called the
Cookson Group Pension Plan - following a 320 million pension
insurance transfer deal in July 2012, Pension Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent deal will cover the liabilities of employees that
retire in each of the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defined benefit pension scheme deficits doubled to 231
billion pounds last year, according to the Pension Protection
Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rothesay and Pension Corp compete with the likes of Legal &amp;
General, Aviva and Prudential in the
bulk annuity market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - IBM, the world's largest technology services company, gave a better than expected 2013 outlook after a solid fourth quarter that analysts say has more to do with Big Blue's smooth execution than a vibrant tech spending environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies had been widely expected to hold back on IT purchases in December in part because of worries about the so-called U.S. fiscal cliff. Automatic tax increases and spending cuts would have been triggered had Congress not made a deal to avert the cliff and could have pushed the weak U.S. economy into recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But International Business Machines Corp said on Tuesday that its quarterly results beat forecasts and it plans to achieve earnings of at least $16.70 a share for the full year, above analysts' consensus forecast of $16.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some analysts said IBM's earnings may be a sign of an improved tech spending environment, others said the strong results were specific to IBM's business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM is better positioned in a tough environment than most tech companies are," said Cindy Shaw, managing director at Discern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM made a bold strategic move a decade ago when it bought PriceWaterhouse's consulting business and then decided to exit the PC business, betting its future was in finding solutions to business problems with the help of software and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That strategy appears to have paid off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What IBM does better than anyone, with the exception of Accenture, is solving problems and I am not talking about taking out some costs, but really driving revenue," Shaw said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, she said, IBM was strong in "hot growth markets" such as data analytics, cloud computing, emerging markets and what IBM calls smarter planet, which aims to improve areas such as traffic, power grids and food production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu agreed, saying the success appeared to be more specific to IBM than the industry in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results show that the IBM advantage and business model - vertical integration of hardware and software - is difficult to replicate," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM has been doing this the longest and customers are very accustomed to it.

    By Nicola Leske
    Jan 22 (Reuters) - IBM, the world's largest
technology services company, gave a better than expected 2013
outlook after a solid fourth quarter that analysts say has more
to do with Big Blue's smooth execution than a vibrant tech
spending environment.
    Companies had been widely expected to hold back on IT
purchases in December in part because of worries about the
so-called U.S. fiscal cliff. Automatic tax increases and
spending cuts would have been triggered had Congress not made a
deal to avert the cliff and could have pushed the weak U.S.
economy into recession. 
    But International Business Machines Corp said on Tuesday
that its quarterly results beat forecasts and it plans to
achieve earnings of at least $16.70 a share for the full year,
above analysts' consensus forecast of $16.57.
    While some analysts said IBM's earnings may be a sign of an
improved tech spending environment, others said the strong
results were specific to IBM's business model.
    "IBM is better positioned in a tough environment than most
tech companies are," said Cindy Shaw, managing director at
Discern.
    IBM made a bold strategic move a decade ago when it bought
PriceWaterhouse's consulting business and then decided to exit
the PC business, betting its future was in finding solutions to
business problems with the help of software and technology.
    That strategy appears to have paid off.
    "What IBM does better than anyone, with the exception of
Accenture, is solving problems and I am not talking about taking
out some costs, but really driving revenue," Shaw said.
    In addition, she said, IBM was strong in "hot growth
markets" such as data analytics, cloud computing, emerging
markets and what IBM calls smarter planet, which aims to improve
areas such as traffic, power grids and food production.
    Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu agreed, saying the success
appeared to be more specific to IBM than the industry in
general.
    "The results show that the IBM advantage and business model
- vertical integration of hardware and software - is difficult
to replicate," he said.
    "IBM has been doing this the longest and customers are very
accustomed to it. They have a much stronger offering and brand
name."
    As a result quarterly net income rose 10 percent to $6.1
billion, or $5.39 a share from $4.71 a year earlier. Revenue
dropped 1 percent to $29.3 billion due to the sale of its retail
business in the third quarter.    
    Analysts had expected the Armonk, New York-based company to
report net income of $5.95 billion, or $5.25 a share, on revenue
of $29.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
    Revenue grew in particular because of an 11 percent increase
in IBM's growth markets in Brazil, India, Russia and China.
    Software revenue was up 3 percent in the quarter.  
    
 
    Some analysts said IBM's better than expected results were a
sign that tech spending might not have been as bleak as
expected.
    "It is better than what people had feared," said Brian
Marshall, an analyst at ISI Group.
    "Virtually every segment did a little bit better than people
expected. It supports the fact that things are getting better
out there at least from a tech industry standpoint."
    Andrew Bartels, an analyst with research firm Forrester
Research, said: "We were expecting a lot of companies were
sitting on their wallets until it became clear what was going to
become of the fiscal cliff.
    "Given the fact it's Q4 with a cloud of the fiscal cliff,
it's a positive indication that tech software will be doing
better in the next couple of months."
    IBM shares rose more than 4 percent to $204.50 after closing
at $196.08 on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 23 (Reuters) - Britain's national health costs
watchdog has recommended Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Pfizer's anti-clotting pill Eliquis for preventing
strokes in patients with an irregular heartbeat condition called
atrial fibrillation (AF)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft guidance from the National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence (NICE) opens up a potential new market
for Eliquis, which belongs to a new class of medicines designed
to replace the decades-old blood thinner warfarin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NICE has previously recommended it for use in Britain's
National Health Service (NHS) for preventing blood clots after
hip and knee surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AF is the most common form of irregular heart beat. It
occurs when the electrical impulses controlling the heart rhythm
become disorganised, so that the heart cannot efficiently pump
blood around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 1.2 million people in the UK suffer from AF and
experts estimate that more than 20 percent of the 130,000
strokes each year in England and Wales are due to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliquis competes with other clot preventers such as Xarelto
from Johnson &amp; Johnson and Bayer, and Pradaxa
from Germany's privately-held Boehringer Ingelheim. Both these
drugs have also been approved by NICE to be made available on
Britain's taxpayer-funded NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NICE said decisions about whether to start treatment with 
the Eliquis drug, known generically as apixaban, should be made
after an informed discussion about its risks and benefits
compared with warfarin, Pradaxa and Xarelto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency's guidance is not yet final and is open to appeal
before a final decision is communicated to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and BMS issued a joint statement welcoming the NICE

Production

In 2012, Walter Energy produced 11.7 million metric tons (MMTs) of met coal,
up 34% percent from 8.7 million MMTs of met coal produced in 2011. In the
fourth quarter of 2012, Walter Energy produced 2.5 MMTs of met coal which
reflected implementation of a reduced operating schedule in response to lower
global demand and pricing.

Sales Volume and Price 

In 2012, Walter Energy sold 10.4 MMTs of met coal, up 20% from 8.7 MMTs of met
coal sales in 2011. Fourth quarter 2012 met coal sales volume totaled 2.5
MMTs. However, approximately 200,000 metric tons of contracted shipments were
delayed into 2013 due to issues with rail and port availability and are not
included in 2012 sales. Reflecting current trends in global coal markets,
Walter Energy's met coal prices for the fourth quarter of 2012 averaged
approximately $152 per metric ton (MT) for hard coking coal as compared with
$198 per MT in the third quarter of 2012. The fourth quarter prices for
low-vol PCI averaged approximately $129 per MT as compared with $160 per MT in
the third quarter of 2012.

&lt;p&gt;* Q4 revenue of $29.3 bln vs Street view $29.05 bln&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Q4 EPS was $5.39 vs $5.25, sees 2013 EPS of at least
$16.70&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares up more than 4 percent

 (Recasts; adds more analyst comments, stock price, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Nicola Leske&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 22 (Reuters) - IBM, the world's largest
technology services company, promised better than expected
full-year growth after its fourth-quarter results beat
estimates, a sign that fears of corporate delays in technology
spending may have been overblown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies had been widely expected to hold back on IT
purchases in December in part because of worries about the
so-called U.S. fiscal cliff. Automatic tax hikes and spending
cuts would have been triggered had Congress not arrived at a
deal to avert the cliff, and could have pushed the weak U.S.
economy into recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp said on Tuesday that it
plans to achieve earnings of at least $16.70 a share for the
full year, above analysts' consensus forecast of $16.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its quarterly net income rose 10 percent to $6.1 billion, or
$5.39 a share from $4.71 a year earlier. Revenue dropped 1
percent to $29.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts had expected the Armonk, New York-based company to
report net income of $5.95 billion, or $5.25 a share, on revenue
of $29.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue in Brazil, India, Russia and China increased by 7
percent in 2012, or 12 percent adjusted for currency
fluctuations. It grew 11 percent in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said IBM's results were a sign that tech
spending was improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is better than what people had feared," said Brian
Marshall, an analyst at ISI Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Virtually every segment did a little bit better than people
expected. It supports the fact that things are getting better
out there at least from a tech industry standpoint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Bartels, an analyst with research firm Forrester
Research, said "we were expecting a lot of companies were
sitting on their wallets until it became clear what was going to
become of the fiscal cliff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the fact it's Q4 with a cloud of the fiscal cliff,
it's a positive indication that tech software will be doing
better in the next couple of months," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said the success appeared to
be more specific to IBM than the industry in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results show that the IBM advantage and business model
- vertical integration of hardware and software - is difficult
to replicate," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has shifted its focus to higher-margin software and
services from tech products over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM has been doing this the longest and customers are very
accustomed to it. They have a much stronger offering and brand
name."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares rose more than 4 percent to $204.36 after closing
at $196.08 on the New York Stock Exchange.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded three classes and affirmed 16 classes of J.P.
Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2006-CIBC17 commercial
mortgage pass-through certificates due to increased expected losses on the
specially serviced assets. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end
of this press release. 

RATING SENSITIVITY/KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Fitch modeled losses of 17.7% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the
original pool balance total 17.4%, including losses already incurred. The pool
has experienced $16.3 million (0.6% of the original pool balance) in realized
losses to date. Fitch has designated 40 loans (29.8%) as Fitch Loans of Concern,
which includes 20 specially serviced assets (22.6%). 

As of the December 2012 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal
balance has been reduced by 5.4% to $2.4 billion from $2.54 billion at issuance.
No loans have defeased since issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently
affecting classes A-J through NR. 

The largest contributor to expected losses is the specially-serviced Bank of
America Plaza (11% of the pool), a 1.3 million square foot (sf), class A office
property located in downtown Atlanta, GA. The loan was transferred to special
servicing in February 2011 for imminent default due to the expected revenue
decline associated with Bank of America downsizing its space. Since then, the
third largest tenant, Paul Hastings (11%) vacated at lease expiration in October
2012. The property is currently real estate owned (REO) and is 52% occupied. The
special servicer continues to market the vacant space. 

The next largest contributor to expected losses is the specially-serviced City
View Portfolio loan (2.4%), which is secured by seven multifamily properties
consisting of 2,226 units located in the Greenspoint section of Houston, TX. The
loan was transferred to special servicing in February 2010 due to imminent
default. The property was foreclosed upon in July 2010. As of January 2012, the
portfolio was 89.7% occupied. 

The third largest contributor to expected losses is the specially serviced The
Towers loan (1.9%), which is secured by a 184,577 sf office tower located in
Great Neck, NY. Major tenants include Garfunkel Wild &amp; Travis (20% NRA),lease
expiration Sept. 30, 2020; Sterling Equities Inc. (14% NRA), expiration April
30, 2017; and Flextrade Systems Inc. (7% NRA), expiration Oct. 31, 2016. The
loan was transferred to special servicing in November 2009 due to monetary
default as a result of the borrower's failure to pay operating expenses and
establish a lockbox. A receiver was appointed in 2010 and a property management
firm was hired. As of October 2012, the property is 73.1% occupied. 

Fitch downgrades the following classes and assigns or revises Recovery Estimates
(REs) as indicated: 

--$253.7 million class A-M to 'BBsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Negative; 

--$203 million class A-J to 'CCsf' from 'CCCsf'; RE 35%; 

--$44.4 million class B to 'Csf' from 'CCsf'; RE 0%. 

Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated: 

--$84.1 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$1.2 billion class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$67.9 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$279.8 million class A-1A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; 

--$19 million class C at 'Csf'; RE 0%; 

--$34.9 million class D at 'Csf'; RE 0%; 

--$31.7 million class E at 'Csf'; RE 0%; 

--$34.9 million class F at 'Csf'; RE 0%; 

--$31.7 million class G at 'Csf'; RE 0%; 

--$31.7 million class H at 'Csf'; RE 0%; 

--$9.5 million class J at 'Csf'; RE 0%; 

--$9.5 million class K at 'Csf'; RE 0%; 

--$9.5 million class L at 'Csf'; RE 0%; 

--$3.2 million class M at 'Csf'; RE 0%; 

--$6.3 million class N at 'Csf'; RE 0%; 

--$6.3 million class P at 'Csf'; RE 0%. 

The class A-1 certificates have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the class NR
certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only class X
certificates.

quarterly net income rose 10 percent to $6.1 billion, or $5.39 a
share from $4.71 a year earlier. Revenue dropped 1 percent to
$29.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts had expected the Armonk, New York-based company to

spending environment was improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is better than what people had feared," said Brian
Marshall, an analyst at ISI Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Virtually every segment did a little bit better than people
expected. It supports the fact that things are getting better
out there at least from a tech industry standpoint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nicola Leske; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Lauren Tara LaCapra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc named R.
Martin Chavez, a quantitative analyst who co-heads the bank's
equity trading business, to its management committee, according
to an internal memo obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee helps the bank form its strategy and Chavez's
appointment signals he may be in line for more senior positions
in the future. Members of the management committee are
hand-picked by Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and Chief
Operating Officer Gary Cohn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez joined Goldman in 1993 as a senior quantitative
analyst in its commodity and energy brokerage business, then
known as J. Aron. He left in 1998 for a job at Credit Suisse and
then launched a commodities risk-management technology company
called Kiodex, which was eventually bought by SunGard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Harvey Schwartz, then head of the financing
business at Goldman, wooed Chavez back to the bank. Schwartz
will be chief financial officer at the end of this month, and
also got his start at J. Aron, as did Blankfein and Cohn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez currently serves on the partnership committee, and
represents Goldman as a director of the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, a lobbying group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Nate Raymond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 22 (Reuters) - Lawyers for former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc board member Rajat Gupta are urging a
federal appeals court to reverse his insider trading conviction,
arguing that a judge shouldn't have allowed wiretaps to be heard

Fans Can't Determine the Winner of the Big Game, But They Can Choose Who Wins
the Coke in a Colorful Fan-driven Race for the Ultimate Refresher
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
During the most hotly contested gridiron game next month, teams on the quest for
the ultimate refreshment will be battling online rather than on the field. This
year, Coca-Cola is "gamifying" the Big Game. Through an unprecedented second
screen experience, fan engagement within digital, social and mobile will drive
the outcome of Coca-Cola`s Big Game broadcast television commercials in real
time. 

The Company will launch a 30-second trailer for the campaign on January 23,
across all major television outlets. The trailer, a call to action for fans to
kick-off the Coke Chase, encourages them to log on to CokeChase.com to vote for
their favorite team and sabotage their fictional foes. The first-of-its-kind
campaign follows three factions of characters - a band of Cowboys, a gang of
"Badlanders" and a pack of Vegas-style Showgirls - as they chase after an
elusive bottle of Coca-Cola. The campaign`s 60-second commercial, entitled
"Mirage," will live online at CokeChase.com until its television debut on
February 3rd, during the first half of the game. Fans` actions will determine
how the storyline plays out, and following the final whistle of the Big Game,
one of three produced 30-second payoff ads will air to complete the narrative. 

"TheBig Game is the ultimate platform for showcasing brands` preeminent
advertising, but this year we`re also using America`s biggest stage to kick-off
Coca-Cola`s marketing efforts for the entire year that will focus on Coke as the
ultimate refresher," said Pio Schunker, Senior Vice President of Integrated
Marketing Communications, Coca-Cola North America. "We`re raising the bar from
last year`s Big Game campaign, we`re being bolder than ever before, and we`re
experimenting with even more second-screen innovation." 

The Mirage

In "Mirage," the Cowboys, Badlanders and Showgirls spot and pursue a distant
vision of an ice-cold bottle of Cola-Cola in the middle of a blazing hot desert.
All that stands in their way is the sand, the heat&#8230;and each other. With sweat on
their brows and refreshment on their minds, the groups set off on horseback,
dune buggies and even a glamorous, glittery bus toward the object of their
affection. Members from each faction are caught up in playful skirmishes and
melees as they speed across the sand, until they finally arrive at their
destination&#8230;which turns out not to be an actual Coke, but a billboard promising
refreshment a mere 50 miles ahead. Undeterred, the Showgirls, Badlanders and
Cowboys are seen following the direction of the sign, igniting the chase, and
turning fans to CokeChase.com to get in on the game. Real-time updates on the
Chase and character engagement will take place on every major form of digital
and social media. While the stars of "Mirage" make their big TV debut, they also
will spring to life on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube and Instagram, giving
fans more ways to interact with a Coca-Cola campaign than ever before. 

As the final whistle blows and the winner of the Big Game is celebrated,
Coca-Cola will reveal the winner of the Coke Chase based on fan participation
throughout the game via a 30-second commercial that completes the journey. Each
of the three 30-second spots depicts a different faction capturing the few
remaining bottles of Coke available at the remote Oasis Mart. All three will be
cued and ready for broadcast while The Coca-Cola Company representatives
tabulate fan votes and deduct points for sabotages. As the winning team is
determined, Coca-Cola will work with the network to air the spot that earned the
most fan support. 

After the winning 30-second commercial hits the airwaves, anyone who Likes or
Follows the Coke Chase will be rewarded with additional content, and the first
50,000 people who participated in the Chase and log on to, or sign-up for,
MyCokeRewards will receive a coupon for a free bottle of their choice of
Coca-Cola, Diet Coke or Coke Zero as a thank you. 

Creating connections with retailers is another key initiative for this year`s
Big Game campaign. Partnering with Coca-Cola in the lead up to their biggest
selling day of the year, Domino`s Pizza and Coca-Cola will bring "Mirage" to
life together online. From MyCokeRewards Instant Wins to Coca-Cola being
integrated directly into Domino`s Online Ordering page and Pizza Tracker,
Domino`s and Coca-Cola have created a winning strategy. Another first, Domino`s
will be exclusively integrated into Coca-Cola`s Big Game creative execution on
CokeChase.com. 

"This year`s Coca-Cola Big Game campaign represents the way our Company is
evolving as a marketer," said Stuart Kronauge, General Manager of Sparkling
Beverages, Coca-Cola North America. "We`re celebrating the liquid and reminding
people that Coca-Cola is the ultimate refresher and engaging them in an
unprecedented social experience. This fully integrated fan experience transcends
simple TV advertising, hands over the power to our fans and creates new
connections with retail on America`s biggest advertising stage." 

The Coke Chase

Coca-Cola will begin driving fans to CokeChase.com through a 30-second teaser
spot that will flood television networks 11 days before the Game Day coin toss.
In addition, creative will appear on the Coca-Cola Digital Network outdoor
boards encouraging audiences to log on and vote. Coca-Cola will begin driving
visitors to CokeChase.com through social media and a paid media campaign that
kicks off with a YouTube takeover on January 23. At CokeChase.com, visitors will
get a first look at the 60-second ad and can begin voting for their favorite
faction immediately. Voting will remain open until the final whistle of the Big
Game blows. 

Once they`ve cast a vote, visitors can extend the fun by committing an act of
"sabotage" against an opposing group. An act of sabotage delays rival teams
giving fans an opportunity to truly impact the outcome while engaging in fun
content. Fifteen different sabotages depicting a light-hearted scenario, event
or detour were filmed - five adversely affecting each faction. Nine will be
unlocked for gaming prior to February 3rd. 

Fans can share the fun with their social networks by casting a vote for their
favorite group on Twitter by using hashtags supporting the #CokeShowgirls,
#CokeCowboys or #CokeBadlanders. Those who cast a vote on game-day by tweeting
@CocaCola with their favorite faction`s hashtag will receive responses from the
team, including a link to the sabotage page on CokeChase.com where they can
continue the rally. The Company`s Facebook, YouTube and Twitter platforms will
play a major role in delivering real-time updates on the factions` progress, and
additional Chase and character content will appear on Tumblr and Instagram.
Across these channels, fans will find themselves in the middle of the action and
receive a "behind-the-scenes" look at the characters in their pursuit of the
ultimate refreshment on Game Day.The entire digital experience is optimized for
desktop, mobile and tablets to provide the best possible experience on any
device. 

This is the seventh consecutive year Coca-Cola commercials will appear during
the Big Game broadcast. Coca-Cola worked with Wieden + Kennedy in Portland, Ore.
to create and produce "Mirage," its three 30-second alternate endings, all 15
sabotage scenes and the program centerpiece, CokeChase.com. 

"Mirage" exemplifies what people have come to expect - and demand - from such an
iconic brand. It also follows the launch of two new groundbreaking ads, "Be Ok"
and "Coming Together," which reinforce The Company`s role in addressing the
important issues of our time while continuing to create engaging campaigns that
educate our fans and build brand love.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Robert Iger got a 20 percent bump in his 2012 pay, totaling $40.2 million, regulatory filings showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger's package included $2.5 million in base salary, with an additional $9.5 million in stock awards, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (r.reuters.com/sac45t)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger also received a cash-and-stock bonus of about $24.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;92 percent of Iger's total package was based on the company's financial results and stock performance, Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our meetings with shareholders, there was broad agreement that Mr. Iger's performance as chief executive officer has been excellent," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During his tenure, the company's financial results have been outstanding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger, who turns 62 in February, succeeded Michael Eisner as CEO in October 2005. His reign has seen acquisitions of filmmaker George Lucas's Lucasfilm Ltd and its "Star Wars" franchise, "Toy Story" creator Pixar, and the comic book powerhouse Marvel. (r.reuters.com/tac45t)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's stock has more than doubled since Iger took over at the helm. It jumped 33 percent in 2012 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company earned $3.07 per share, excluding items, on revenue of $42.28 billion for its fiscal year ended September 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger is scheduled to step down from his role as CEO in March 2015, and chairman in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sagarika Jaisinghani in Bangalore; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dell&#8217;s not-so-secret attempt to go private is getting even more interesting. Microsoft will reportedly kick in between $1 billion and $3 billion to help make the deal happen, according to CNBC&#8217;s David Faber.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The software giant is in talks with Silver Lake, the leading investors behind Dell&#8217;s buyout, and founder Michael Dell. Faber notes that Microsoft&#8217;s stake would be a mezzanine investment. Mezzanine financing often takes the form of debt or preferred stock, and it would be a way for Microsoft to soften the blow of the deal for Silver Lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that it would be convertible into a significant equity stake in Dell,&#8221; Faber said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#8217;ve reached out to Microsoft and Dell for comment, but given the nature of this deal, we don&#8217;t expect much of a response. Rumors of Dell going private have been floating around for some time now, but earlier this month they also managed to jump Dell&#8217;s stock by 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the scant details about Microsoft&#8217;s investment, it&#8217;s likely that discussions are still ongoing. Faber notes that the &#8220;outlook is fairly positive&#8221; that Microsoft will reach a deal with Dell, and it could be finalized by the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given Microsoft&#8217;s significant investment in Nokia to help make Windows Phone a success, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see the company join forces with Dell. Windows 8 needs support from big players like Dell, and a (relatively) small investment like this could pay off for Microsoft down the line. Just look at how Microsoft&#8217;s $240 million investment in Facebook has helped it land significant deals like putting Bing searches within the social network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Via Business Insider&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: Business, Deals, VentureBeat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 22 (Reuters) - Lawyers for former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc board member Rajat Gupta are urging a
federal appeals court to reverse his insider trading conviction,
arguing that a judge shouldn't have allowed wiretaps to be heard
at trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a brief filed Friday at the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New York, Gupta's lawyers argued wiretaps of
now-imprisoned hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam amounted to
"hearsay statements" and should not have been presented to the
jury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without a proper basis for admission, these untestable,
unreliable hearsay statements had no place in a criminal trial,
and their admission alone compels reversal," Gupta's lawyers
wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal jury convicted Gupta, 64, in June of leaking
Goldman boardroom secrets to Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group hedge
fund manager at the center of a wide-ranging U.S. probe into
insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, who was at one time head of management consultancy
McKinsey &amp; Co, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff
to two years in prison. The 2nd Circuit in December said Gupta
could remain free on bail while he appeals his
conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 11 in a separate civil
lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the four counts Gupta was charged with in the criminal
case, his lawyers said Friday that the jury only convicted him
on the two backed by wiretaps of Rajaratnam, who is serving an
11-year sentence following his own conviction in May 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta's lawyers say the wiretaps amounted to hearsay
evidence, since they were of conversations between Rajaratnam
and other Galleon Group employees, rather than with Gupta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta's lawyers said he was also prevented from presenting
evidence of an alternative perpetrator and of Gupta's integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defense lawyers say they weren't allowed to present
testimony by Gupta's daughter about a conversation where her
father said he was angry at Rajaratnam for allegedly cheating
him out of millions of dollars through a joint investment fund
known as Voyager Capital Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation took place three days before one of the
alleged tips Gupta was convicted on and a month before a second,
the brief said. Gupta contends that if the testimony had been
presented, the jury would have been led to question Gupta's
motives to tip Rajaratnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Rajaratnam had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
declined comment. The government is scheduled to respond with
its own appellate brief March 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Rajat Gupta, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, No 12-4448.&lt;/p&gt;

MONTERREY, Mexico--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings believes that the agreement reached by Coca Cola Femsa, S.A.B. de
C.V. (KOF) and Grupo Yoli, S.A. de C.V. (Grupo Yoli) to merge their bottling
operations does not have any material impact on the credit quality of KOF. 

The all share transaction was valued at MXN8.8 billion. The shareholders of
Grupo Yoli will receive around 42.4 million of new KOF's shares (series L) at a
value of MXN184 per share. The consolidation of Grupo Yoli will add to KOF's
balance sheet a net debt of approximately MXN1 billion. 

Grupo Yoli operates mainly in the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca which includes
the territories of Acapulco and Ixtapa Zihuatanejo. The company has two bottling
plants and 20 distribution centers. Grupo Yoli had a sales volume of around 99
million units cases in 2012 that generated net revenues and EBITDA of
approximately MXN4 billion and MXN814 million, respectively. 

KOF's ratings are supported by the company's substantial free cash flow
generation, solid financial position, ample financial flexibility and strong
business profile. The company's foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is
higher than the 'A-' country ceiling of Mexico, where the company is domiciled.
Transfer and convertibility risks are mitigated by KOF's strategic relationship
with The Coca-Cola Company (KO, rated 'A+'/Stable) and the explicit and implicit
financial support KOF has received from KO; in addition, the ratings consider
the geographical diversification of the EBITDA generated outside Mexico, as well
as its strong credit profile. 

Fitch currently rates KOF as follows 

--Foreign Currency IDR 'A'; 

--Local Currency IDR 'A'; 

--National Scale Long Term Rating 'AAA(mex)'; 

--National Scale Short Term Rating 'F1+(mex)'; 

--Senior Notes for USD500 million 'A'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Grupo Yoli operates mainly in the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca which includes
the territories of Acapulco and Ixtapa Zihuatanejo. The company has two bottling
plants and 20 distribution centers. Grupo Yoli had a sales volume of around 99
million units cases in 2012 that generated net revenues and EBITDA of
approximately MXN4 billion and MXN814 million, respectively.

KOF's ratings are supported by the company's substantial free cash flow
generation, solid financial position, ample financial flexibility and strong
business profile. The company's foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is
higher than the 'A-' country ceiling of Mexico, where the company is domiciled.
Transfer and convertibility risks are mitigated by KOF's strategic relationship
with The Coca-Cola Company (KO, rated 'A+'/Stable) and the explicit and implicit
financial support KOF has received from KO; in addition, the ratings consider
the geographical diversification of the EBITDA generated outside Mexico, as well
as its strong credit profile.

Fitch currently rates KOF as follows

--Foreign Currency IDR 'A';
--Local Currency IDR 'A';
--National Scale Long Term Rating 'AAA(mex)';
--National Scale Short Term Rating 'F1+(mex)';
--Senior Notes for USD500 million 'A'.

The Rating Outlook is Stable.

&lt;p&gt;  BALTIMORE, MD, Jan 22 (Marketwire) -- 
Goldman Small Cap Research, a stock market research firm focused on the
small cap and micro cap sectors, has issued an updated research report on
of WrapMail, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: WRAP), a pioneer in the email branding and
marketing solutions arena. 

    WrapMail, which boasts over 6,200 clients, including Verizon, Re/Max and
Toshiba, has a proprietary cloud-based technology platform that enables
users to transform their emails into branding and marketing tools. The
Company is the first vendor to broadly offer rich, one-on-one email
wrapping to organizations and individuals and create a new advertising
revenue stream by incorporating 3rd party ads inside personal one-on-one
emails. 

    In the Goldman Opportunity Research report on the Company, analyst Rob
Goldman outlines his investment thesis. 

    "The innovative WRAP approach is based upon a direct, person-to-person
contact from a trusted source rather than an opt-in or mass email
campaign. In essence, WrapMail offers the most cost-effective marketing
solution on the market by simply turning every regular one-on-one email
into a marketing tool. What has impressed us the most is the recent
flurry of new initiatives for Facebook and LinkedIn users, along with its
new sports and celebrity affinity solutions. These strategic steps
greatly enhance the Company's reach, its business model, and could
ultimately shorten WRAP's time to achieving profitability."

Best Programs to Receive Seed Money to Expand Reach
DAVOS, Switzerland--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today encouraged the members of the World Economic Forum`s
Global Shapers Community to return to the Forum`s 2014 Annual Meeting in Davos
with proof points of the work they have done to help address the world`s
problems. In return, one project will be granted $50,000 in seed money to expand
its reach while five projects will be granted $10,000 to sustain and expand
their efforts. 

Global Shapers, a major initiative launched by the World Economic Forum to
engage young people between the ages of 20 and 30 to deliver local and global
change, will facilitate the challenge by encouraging Shaper "hubs" in more than
200 communities around the world to document the results of their community
projects focused on societal problems ranging from health to environment to
education to economic growth. 

Selection of the most impactful projects will be done by a panel of leading
individuals representing the Global Shapers, the Schwab Foundation for Social
Entrepreneurship, The Coca-Cola Company, governments and other members of civil
society. Judging criteria will include the severity of issues addressed, the
number of lives impacted, overall return on investment and the ability of the
project to be scaled more broadly. Results and impact achieved by all finalist
projects will be shared publicly in January 2014. 

"A challenge to spark and expand innovative ideas from the world`s young leaders
is exactly what our world needs today as we look to create much-needed growth in
the global economy," said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and CEO, The Coca-Cola Company.
"With more than half of the world`s population under age 27, it`s clear that
solving current and future challenges is dependent upon involving the ideas and
energy of the millennial generation. Our support of the Global Shapers
recognizes a belief that talent and leadership to create new growth and solve
societal problems can come from anywhere, not just from governments or
businesses." 

Added Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman, the World Economic Forum:
"Young people are a tremendous source of innovation and can serve as a catalytic
force for restoring economic growth, addressing social injustice and creating
sustainable change. The Coca-Cola Company recognizes this, and we appreciate its
active role in supporting our Global Shapers Community. The growth of the
Shapers - now with more than 200 community hubs worldwide - is an exciting and
positive development for the Forum, embracing our spirit of entrepreneurship in
the global public interest and our commitment to find solutions to the world`s
biggest problems." 

Launched in 2011, the Global Shapers Community engages entrepreneurial
"millennials" in developing projects that positively impact local communities,
in addition to participating in a global conversation with world leaders to help
shape the future. 

The Shapers have made extraordinary progress. Already at the international
level, nine Shapers sit on the World Economic Forum`s Global Agenda Councils,
the largest brainstorming network of world-class academics. More than 300
Shapers have already participated in meetings organized by the World Economic
Forum, including in the closing plenary session of the World Economic Forum
Annual Meeting 2012. And in January 2013, more than 50 Global Shapers from
around the world are participating in the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting
2013 in Davos. 

Local Shapers programs address a wide range of social and economic problems
ranging from a project to open 200 public libraries in the Philippines to work
to provide relief efforts following Hurricane Sandy in the United States to
support for marginalized communities, including an orphanage for children under
seven in Bamako, Mali.

Pfizer Celebrates 10th Anniversary of this Signature Social Investment Program
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. is proud to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its Global Health
Fellows Program (GHF) as part of its corporate social investment strategy that
focuses on leveraging the full range of the company`s resources - people,
medicines, expertise and funding - to broaden access to medicines and strengthen
health care delivery for underserved people around the world. 

GHF is Pfizer`s signature corporate volunteer program that pairs colleagues from
technical and functional areas across Pfizer in three- to six- month fellowships
with international development organizations to improve health services for
people in greatest need. 

"Since the first year of the Pfizer GHF Program, Project HOPE has benefited from
the extraordinary expertise of Pfizer employees, working in our field sites in
Latin America, Africa, Asia and Central Europe," said Cary Kimble, Associate
Vice President, Development, Project HOPE. "These members of the Pfizer family
have helped improve Project HOPE`s monitoring and evaluation systems and our
health education curricula and materials, have helped measure and validate the
impact of our work, have helped develop business and marketing plans, and have
allowed us to reach more people, more effectively." 

The 10th anniversary Fellows class is from technical and business functions from
across six Pfizer locations: United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Canada
and the United States. Combined, the 2013 class will be sharing 156 years of
Pfizer experience with eleven GHF partner organizations to optimize supply
chains and scale-up promising health prevention approaches, such as diabetes and
cardiovascular disease awareness and screening initiatives and business strategy
and development functions in China, India and East Africa. 

"The tenth anniversary of this vibrant program vividly demonstrates our
commitment to promoting access, quality and efficiency of health services for
the world`s neediest people," said Caroline Roan, President of the Pfizer
Foundation and Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility. "It also
offers clear evidence that by coordinating our efforts and partnering with other
stakeholders, the impact of our effort is magnified and we all benefit." 

A 2012 study by Boston University`s Center for International Health and
Development revealed that 100 percent of partners reported Global Health Fellows
helped them to accelerate sustainable change in their health service delivery
efforts. In addition, partnership organizations reported "extremely significant"
and "significant" capacity gains in Human Resources training and development;
Leadership and Governance; and Health Management Information Systems. 

"Fellows become an integral part of the regional GBCHealth team, working closely
with us to deliver on their complex scopes of work," said Elizabeth Sorensen,
Vice President, Human Resources, GBCHealth. "Their impact has been described as
lifesaving, significant, insightful, and amazing." 

Since 2003, 317 colleagues have completed an estimated 325,000 hours of
skills-based volunteering, which is valued at approximately $47.6M of pro-bono
service to partner organizations throughout the developing world. Through GHF,
Pfizer has partnered with more than 40 international development organizations
in more than 40 countries over the life of the program.

Modules from Next-Gen Product Suite Make it Easy for Businesses to Select
Components as Needed, Benefit from Hosted Environment


SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Global business literally runs on Microsoft Office, and the newest iteration of
the software giant`s productivity suite is especially cloud-friendly. That`s
welcome news for organizations that rely on Infinitely Virtual, a leading
provider of virtual server cloud computing services. 

Infinitely Virtual today unveiled its hosted implementation of Microsoft Office
2013 and announced user pricing for the product family - unchanged from the
Microsoft Office 2010 suite and its various components. 

Individual per-month pricing for Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 is
$15.99; Microsoft Office Standard 2013 is $13.99; Microsoft Word, Access and
Excel are $6.19 each; Microsoft Publisher is $4.39; and Microsoft Outlook is
$2.69. 

Microsoft Office 2013 features enhanced enterprise-grade security, side-by-side
support for previous versions of Office, streamlined update experiences, and IT
controls that enable organization to manage Office on their terms and with their
tools and processes. 

"With Office 2013`s embrace of cloud computing, Microsoft is rightly touting the
suite`s ability to deliver productivity on demand," said Adam Stern, Infinitely
Virtual CEO. "Now more than ever, Office recognizes the way individuals and
organizations work in a hosted environment. We`re pleased to be able to hold the
line on pricing and to continue our policy of offering Office modules on an ala
carte basis. It`s all part of our broader mission to make migration to the cloud
as effortless and cost-effective as we can." 

Among the highlights of Microsoft Office 2013:

* Easier deployment. The newest version of Office was built from the ground up
to be the easiest version ever to deploy. Office is designed so current add-ins
and customizations operate seamlessly. Powerful new Office telemetry tools
inspect file and application compatibility, and optimized provisioning allows IT
to quickly deploy broadly without uninstalling existing Office applications. 
* Designed for the cloud. Businesses can use existing IT tools and processes for
delivering software, so there`s no need to change management infrastructure
before installing. Automation and Group Policy management tools give users full
control over how Office is installed and configured. 
* New telemetry tools for centralized performance monitoring. New Office
telemetry tools give IT more power to monitor the health and performance of
Office across the organization and support users as they migrate from earlier
versions of Office. Proactive controls help ensure that Office performs at peak
levels to keep users productive. 
* Keeping data even more secure. Enhanced security and multifactor
authentication protects files, devices, and individuals, letting users easily
access the information they need while meeting security and compliance
requirements.

Last year, Infinitely Virtual unbundled its hosted, licensed Microsoft Office
suite products, to enable customers to choose those products they need, at a
per-product price. Bundled products often require businesses to buy more than
they need, in order to obtain the one or two applications they really want.
That`s why Microsoft Office Suite products are available a la carte - and
businesses have the opportunity to save more than 40 percent by choosing a
single product rather than a full suite. 

Customers can choose from Microsoft Excel, Access, Publisher or Outlook as
"menu" items, creating a package that precisely fits their needs. For additional
details on Microsoft Office 2013, visit www.infinitelyvirtual.com.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Jan 21 (Reuters) - The CEO of Mexico's leading
broadcaster, Televisa, said the company would increase its
sports coverage in 2013, focusing on soccer, and launch an
English-language channel developed by Univision and ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Emilio Azcarraga did not say when the new
channel will be launched. The venture will bank on the rising
number of Hispanic viewers in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa provides most of Univision's primetime programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Mexican broadcaster will move heavily into
social media and audience participation to improve its sports
coverage, again concentrating on soccer, an area it and No.2
broadcaster, TV Azteca, have ruled for years, but now face
rising competition from the world's richest man, Carlos Slim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are launching a new soccer social media platform...where
everybody can add content," Azcarraga said without elaborating
during a televised interview on Televisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Televisa and TV Azteca are owners of big
money-making professional soccer franchises and have been
accused by smaller teams of overcharging for transmission rights
and advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slim has made three soccer investments in recent months: he
bailed out troubled Spanish team, Real Oviedo, and purchased
stakes in Mexican clubs Leon and Pachuca. In the case of Leon,
he also bought transmission rights for the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Azcarraga said that Televisa is
planning an event to display its state-of-the-art technology
advances. Rivals Telefonica and Slim's Telmex, owned by
America Movil, host similar annual events in Mexico
City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Televisa purchased half of cellphone provider
Iusacell for $1.6 billion, owned by TV Azteca CEO Ricardo
Salinas, as it tapped a market dominated by Slim's America
Movil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has named a
new head of compliance and shifted reporting lines for control
officers as it sharpens its focus on regulatory obligations amid
multiple government investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy Armine, co-chief control officer, will replace Martha
Gallo, who has been chief compliance officer for the past two
years, according to an internal announcement to employees on
Wednesday. Gallo, who has been with the bank for more than 30
years, is considering taking another senior job at the bank,
according to the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannon Warren, the other co-chief control officer, will now
have that role solely. Christine Larsen, who had been involved
with an operational performance drive, will now be responsible
for management of the company's most significant regulatory
matters, the memo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is shifting responsibility for its compliance
functions from its legal group to its two co-chief operating
officers, Frank Bisignano and Matt Zames. The moves will place
compliance, oversight and control functions under the same
management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The compliance function is a critical component of how we
manage risk across our firm," the memo said. It said the moves
were "consistent with our increased focus on meeting our
regulatory obligations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan found flaws in its risk management systems last
year after losing $6.2 billion in derivatives positions known in
the market as the "London Whale" trades for their size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO Jamie Dimon has apologized for the debacle and last week
the bank agreed to orders from the U.S. Federal Reserve and
Comptroller of the Currency that it improve its risk management
and oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank still faces continuing investigations of the
debacle by other authorities in the United States and United
Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) wants to block a shareholder vote on a proposal to require an independent chairman, trying to halt the latest effort to split the CEO and chairman positions, currently held by Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the New York investment bank headed off a similar proposal from another group by appointing a lead independent director on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beverly O'Toole, Goldman Sachs associate general counsel, sent a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on January 16 seeking permission to exclude the shareholder proposal from the annual proxy, calling it "inherently vague and indefinite."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CtW Investment Group, which works with union pension funds with more than $200 billion in assets, submitted the resolution in December. The group's proposal called for a board policy requiring the chairman to be a director who has not previously been the CEO and who is independent of management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders will vote on proposals included in the proxy filing at the company's annual stockholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Pryce-Jones, senior research analyst with CtW, said the group was disappointed with Goldman's effort to block the proposal for what he called "nit-picky" reasons. The company needs an independent chairman because that position would set the board's agenda and provide additional oversight, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last March, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees dropped its proposal to split the posts after Goldman agreed to create the lead independent director position, which is held by former insurance executive James Schiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naming a lead director "was a move in the right direction, but it's clearly not enough," Pryce-Jones said. Goldman Sachs and the SEC declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a number of banks have faced shareholder proposals to split the chairman and CEO positions, in hopes of creating more checks and balances on top management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resolutions have produced mixed results. In 2009, former Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) CEO Ken Lewis lost his chairmanship after shareholders approved such a proposal. Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N) shareholders last year voted down such a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N) plans to omit a proposal to split the chairman and CEO jobs because the shareholder did not show that he met the minimum share ownership requirement, according to a letter sent to the SEC.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A federal jury on Wednesday gave Goldman Sachs Group Inc a sweeping legal victory in the $580 million sale of Dragon Systems Inc to Lernout &amp; Hauspie, saying the Wall Street bank was not negligent in arranging a deal that ultimately collapsed 13 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury cleared Goldman of claims of negligence, intentional misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty, and others, in the civil case, according to the verdict announced in U.S. District Court in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dragon founders Jim and Janet Baker, pioneers in the field of speech recognition software, accused Goldman investment bankers of being negligent in the 2000 sale of their company to Belgium-based Lernout &amp; Hauspie, which collapsed in a massive accounting fraud. The Bakers and two early Dragon employees sought several hundred million dollars in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased the jury rejected these claims. We fulfilled all our advisory duties to Dragon Systems," Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Donovan, Goldman's lead lawyer on the case, declined to comment. But on a frigid day outside the federal courthouse, Donovan joined his legal team and smiled for a group picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bakers were not available for comment. Before the verdict was read, the couple sat closely together, as they had throughout the 23-day trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their lawyers portrayed Goldman's investment bankers as a "bottom of the barrel" team that failed to properly vet concerns about Lernout &amp; Hauspie's claims of skyrocketing sales in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEAL DOOMED BY BUYER'S FRAUD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But lawyers for Goldman said it was not the investment bank's job to sniff out the accounting fraud that ultimately doomed Lernout &amp; Hauspie and made the remaining stock held by the Bakers worthless. In fact, Goldman said Dragon rushed into the sale and brushed aside advice to hire outside accountants to examine Lernout &amp; Hauspie's books in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bakers owned 51 percent of the company, but were able to sell only a few million dollars' worth of the L shares they received in the all-stock deal before the collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeovers can carry a variety of risks for buyers and sellers, as illustrated by large charges recently reported by a pair of corporate America's biggest names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Caterpillar Inc told investors it will take a $580 million charge in its just-ended fourth quarter after uncovering an accounting fraud in a subsidiary of a Chinese company it acquired last summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co took an even bigger hit, in November warning it would book an $8.8 billion charge after discovering "serious accounting improprieties" at Autonomy, a British software company it bought the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In counter claims brought by Goldman, the jury found that Janet Baker had made negligent misrepresentations to Paul Bamberg and Robert Roth, Dragon employees who held 5.54 percent and 2.75 percent, respectively, of the company's stock. The jury said Baker caused damages, but no figure was given in the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury also said Goldman proved that Janet Baker breached her fiduciary duty to Bamberg and Roth. The jury said Jim Baker breached his fiduciary duty to Bamberg, but not to Roth, according to the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial, jurors heard testimony, largely by video, from a lineup of Goldman Sachs executives, including Gene "Tiger" Sykes, who today runs the bank's mergers and acquisition business and who denied any role in the Dragon deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dragon's attorneys said the bank had assigned "D-team" investment bankers to advise Dragon, which they argued the bank made because the software company was one of its smaller clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is regrettable that the plaintiffs went to such lengths to unfairly and publicly attack the reputations of the Goldman Sachs bankers who advised Dragon Systems," said Goldman's Galvin on Wednesday. "Those bankers have our full support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Cotler, a lawyer for the Bakers, told the jury the couple lost their life's work when Lernout &amp; Hauspie collapsed and went into bankruptcy. The Bakers tried to get their technology back, but were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dragon software is now owned by Nuance Communications Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Aaron Pressman and Scott Malone in Boston; editing by Phil Berlowitz, Nick Zieminski, Leslie Adler and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

others, in the civil case, according to the verdict announced in
U.S. District Court in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dragon founders Jim and Janet Baker, pioneers in the field
of speech recognition software, accused Goldman investment
bankers of being negligent in the 2000 sale of their company to
Belgium-based Lernout &amp; Hauspie, which collapsed in a massive
accounting fraud. The Bakers and two early Dragon employees
sought several hundred million dollars in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased the jury rejected these claims. We fulfilled
all our advisory duties to Dragon Systems," Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Donovan, Goldman's lead lawyer on the case, declined to
comment. But on a frigid day outside the federal courthouse,
Donovan joined his legal team and smiled for a group picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bakers were not available for comment. Before the
verdict was read, the couple sat closely together, as they had
throughout the 23-day trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their lawyers portrayed Goldman's investment bankers as a
"bottom of the barrel" team that failed to properly vet concerns
about Lernout &amp; Hauspie's claims of skyrocketing sales in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEAL DOOMED BY BUYER'S FRAUD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But lawyers for Goldman said it was not the investment
bank's job to sniff out the accounting fraud that ultimately
doomed Lernout &amp; Hauspie and made the remaining stock held by
the Bakers worthless. In fact, Goldman said Dragon rushed into
the sale and brushed aside advice to hire outside accountants 
to examine Lernout &amp; Hauspie's books in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bakers owned 51 percent of the company, but were able to
sell only a few million dollars' worth of the L shares they
received in the all-stock deal before the collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeovers can carry a variety of risks for buyers and
sellers, as illustrated by large charges recently reported by a
pair of corporate America's biggest names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Caterpillar Inc told investors it will 
take a $580 million charge in its just-ended fourth quarter
after uncovering an accounting fraud in a subsidiary of a 
Chinese company it acquired last summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co took an even bigger hit, in
November warning it would book an $8.8 billion charge after
discovering "serious accounting improprieties" at Autonomy, a
British software company it bought the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In counter claims brought by Goldman, the jury found that
Janet Baker had made negligent misrepresentations to Paul
Bamberg and Robert Roth, Dragon employees who held 5.54 percent
and 2.75 percent, respectively, of the company's stock. The jury
said Baker caused damages, but no figure was given in the
verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury also said Goldman proved that Janet Baker breached
her fiduciary duty to Bamberg and Roth. The jury said Jim Baker
breached his fiduciary duty to Bamberg, but not to Roth,
according to the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial, jurors heard testimony, largely by video,
from a lineup of Goldman Sachs executives, including Gene
"Tiger" Sykes, who today runs the bank's mergers and acquisition
business and who denied any role in the Dragon deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dragon's attorneys said the bank had assigned "D-team"
investment bankers to advise Dragon, which they argued the bank
made because the software company was one of its smaller
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is regrettable that the plaintiffs went to such lengths
to unfairly and publicly attack the reputations of the Goldman
Sachs bankers who advised Dragon Systems," said Goldman's Galvin
on Wednesday. "Those bankers have our full support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Cotler, a lawyer for the Bakers, told the jury the
couple lost their life's work when Lernout &amp; Hauspie collapsed
and went into bankruptcy. The Bakers tried to get their
technology back, but were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dragon software is now owned by Nuance Communications
Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc wants to
block a shareholder vote on a proposal to require an independent
chairman, trying to halt the latest effort to split the CEO and
chairman positions held by Lloyd Blankfein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the New York investment bank headed off a similar
proposal from another group by appointing a lead independent
director on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beverly O'Toole, Goldman Sachs associate general counsel,
sent a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on
Jan. 16 seeking permission to exclude the shareholder proposal
from the annual proxy, calling it "inherently vague and
indefinite."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CtW Investment Group, which works with union pension funds
with more than $200 billion in assets, submitted the resolution
in December. The group's proposal called for a board policy
requiring the chairman to be a director who has not previously
been the CEO and who is independent of management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders will vote on proposals included in the proxy
filing at the company's annual stockholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CtW could not immediately be reached for comment. The SEC
and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last March, the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees dropped its proposal to split the posts
after Goldman agreed to alter its board structure to create a
lead independent director, who among other things would be in
charge of evaluating the CEO's performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a number of banks have faced shareholder
proposals to split the chairman and CEO positions, in hopes of
creating more checks and balances on top management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resolutions have produced mixed results. In 2009, former
Bank of America Corp CEO Ken Lewis lost his chairmanship
after shareholders approved such a proposal. Wells Fargo &amp; Co
 shareholders last year voted down such a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded one and affirmed five classes of J.P. Morgan Chase
Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. series 2001-CIBC1 commercial mortgage
pass-through certificates. A detailed listing of rating actions follows at the
end of this release. 

RATING SENSITIVITY/KEY RATING DRIVERS 

Fitch modeled losses of 7.1% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the
original pool balance total 6%, including losses already incurred. The pool has
experienced $58.3 million (5.8% of the original pool balance) in realized losses
to date. Fitch has designated 3 loans (35.6%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which
includes one specially serviced asset (15.9%). 

As of the January 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance
has been reduced by 97% to $30.1 million from $1 billion at issuance. Per the
servicer reporting, one loan (2% of the pool) is defeased. Interest shortfalls
are currently affecting classes H through NR. 

The downgrade to the class G notes reflects the increased event risk of a
significant loss on a loan as the pool has become more concentrated with only
nine loans remaining. 

The largest contributor to expected losses is a 63,059 square foot (sf) retail
strip center (15.9% of the pool) located in Tupelo, MS. The loan transferred to
the special servicer in January 2010 due to imminent maturity default. The
borrower filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2011. The loan is expected
to be corrected and transfer back to the trust. 

Fitch downgrades the following class: 

--$27.6 million class G notes to 'CCCsf' from 'Bsf'; RE 100%. 

Fitch affirms the following classes: 

--$2.6 million class H notes at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; 

--$0 class J notes at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; 

--$0 class K notes at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; 

--$0 class L notes at 'Dsf'; RE 0%; 

--$0 class M notes at 'Dsf'; RE 0%. 

The class A-1, A-2, A-3, B, C, D, E, F, and X2 notes have paid in full. Fitch
previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only class X1 certificates. 

Additional information on Fitch's criteria for analyzing U.S. CMBS transactions
is available in the Dec. 21, 2011 report, 'Surveillance Methodology for U.S.
Fixed-Rate CMBS Transactions', which is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'
under the following headers: 

Structured Finance &gt;&gt; CMBS &gt;&gt; Criteria Reports 

Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. The ratings above
were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been
compensated for the provision of the ratings. 

Applicable Criteria and Related Research:

Cloud software is used to identify staff in the relevant Freedom access control
zone to send an emergency assistance message on their Windows phone.

Microsoft Global Security and to share in this honor," noted Stephen Pineau,
President and CEO of Viscount. "Viscount`s part of the Good Samaritan project
focused on applying Microsoft`s leading edge Cloud and mobile platforms to the
security industry. This project and our other R initiatives have resulted in
the company filing numerous patents in the past year that relate to the Cloud,
mobile devices, NFC, converged logical/physical identity management, smart
cards, identity management and visitor management. As we begin to commercialize
these products we believe that we are well positioned to become the leading
provider of mobile and cloud solutions to the physical security industry."

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/n789kj/offshore_oil_and) has
announced the addition of the "Offshore Oil and Gas Industry in Germany" report
to their offering. 

Germany is one of the biggest consumers of energy in the world. It is a major
natural gas pipeline transit center for Russian and North Sea imports. With the
German government actively promoting the growth of renewable energy in the
country, Germany has successfully managed to reduce its dependence on oil and
gas for meeting its primary energy consumption to a substantial level. 

However, oil and gas is still a major contributor to Germany energy consumption
pie and it looks set to continue being like this for the next couple of years.
The German government is aiming to produce the majority of its energy through
renewable resources by the year 2050. 

In this industry scenario, Taiyou Research analyzes the Offshore Oil and Gas
Industry in Germany. The report covers the following: 

- A profile of the oil and gas industry in Europe, which helps to place the
growth of the German oil and gas industry in respective of other countries in
Europe. The section contains an industry definition, market profile, market
value and volume analysis and industry segmentation. 

- An analysis of the offshore oil and gas industry in Germany, in which we
analyze the offshore oil and gas production, offshore oil and gas cumulative
production, offshore remaining production of oil and gas, the oil and gas
production wells in Germany, offshore drilling of wells, and offshore oil and
gas expenditure in Germany. 

- A market ranking and market share of the major companies in the offshore oil
and gas industry in Germany by production in 2010. 

- We analyze several players that are active in the Danish offshore oil and gas
industry, including BP Plc, RWE AG, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Wintershall
AG, and others.

&lt;p&gt;* Google and IBM both rally after reporting results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* S 500 and Dow closed at five-year highs on Tuesday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Apple results due after market closes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Coach shares plummet after weak quarterly sales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Indexes: Dow up 0.4 pct, S flat, Nasdaq up 0.4 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ryan Vlastelica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on
Wednesday as IBM and other tech companies continued a trend of
results that beat Wall Street's  expectations and propelled the
market to a five-day advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet search company Google Inc added to the
advance, rising 5.1 percent to $738.65 a day after Google
reported its core business outpaced expectations.  Revenue was
also higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp late Tuesday
forecast better-than-anticipated 2013 results and also posted
fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations. The
results helped to allay concerns about the tech sector after
Intel Corp gave a weak outlook last week. IBM, the
world's largest technology services company, rose 3.8 percent to
$203.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tech companies are really shattering expectations, which is
obviously helping markets. There doesn't seem to be an end to
this rally," said Todd Schoenberger, managing partner at
LandColt Capital in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But gains were limited in the S 500 a day after it closed
at a level not seen since December 2007. Many investors were
also holding off to see earnings from Apple Inc, the
most valuable U.S. company which was due to report after the
market closes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald's edged higher 0.2 percent to $93.11 after
reporting a rise in fourth-quarter earnings, lifted by an
increase in same-store sales. United Tech's earnings
fell from the prior year, hurt by large restructuring charges.
Shares edged up at $87.91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the downside, Coach Inc slumped 15 percent to
$51.40 as the S's biggest percentage loser after reporting
sales that missed expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the market closes, investors will scour Apple's
results for signs the tech giant can continue to grow at an
accelerated pace. The stock has been pressured recently by
questions raised about demand for Apple's prospects. The stock
has fallen 5 percent since the start of the year, compared with
gains of 4.6 percent in the S 500. It rose 0.4 percent to
$507.04 on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Apple comes out with a blockbuster number, that would
reinforce the argument that stocks are poised to do well in the
first part of 2013," Schoenberger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average was up 55.48 points,
or 0.40 percent, at 13,767.69. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index
 was up 0.06 points, or 0.00 percent, at 1,492.62. The
Nasdaq Composite Index was up 10.89 points, or 0.35
percent, at 3,154.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the S 500 and Dow Jones industrial average hit
five-year closing highs on Tuesday, with recent gains largely
fueled by a strong start to the earning season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the latest Thomson Reuters data, of the 74 S
500 companies that have reported earnings so far, 62.2 percent
have topped expectations, roughly even with the 62 percent
average since 1994, but below the 65 percent average over the
past four quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, S 500 fourth-quarter earnings rose 2.6 percent,
according to Thomson Reuters data. That estimate is above the
1.9 percent forecast from the start of earnings season, but well
below the 9.9 percent fourth-quarter earnings forecast from Oct.
1, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives aim
on Wednesday to pass a bill to extend the U.S. debt limit by
nearly four months, to May 19. The White House welcomed the
move, saying it would remove uncertainty about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debt limit issue has hung over the market for weeks,
with many investors worried that if no deal is reached to raise
the limit, it could have a negative impact on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Exxon CEO met Iraq PM Monday, Kurd president Tuesday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Iraq official says Exxon moving on right course&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* No details of possible improved Baghad terms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Peg Mackey and Isabel Coles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON/ARBIL, Iraq, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil may be
moving closer to Baghdad's side in its bitter feud with
autonomous Kurdistan, industry sources said, with a sweeter deal
to keep it operating in southern Iraq on the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson has met with Iraqi Prime
Minister Nuri al-Maliki to ask about staying at the West Qurna 1
field - a greater potential prize than its deals with the
northern Kurds if Baghdad could mould the deal closer to the
Kurdish model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson met Kurdistan President Masoud Barzani on Tuesday
in Davos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After the meeting with Maliki, we can now say that Exxon is
moving along the right course the central government has set for
foreign oil companies working in the country," an Iraqi oil
source said on Wednesday, without giving any details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Exxon offered to sell its stake in the $50
billion southern oilfield after fighting with Baghdad over its
contracts with Kurdistan, deals which the central government in
Baghdad rejects as illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Baghdad wants to lure Exxon in. Will they bite?" said one
oil industry source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Western oil executive from a company involved in the
south said Exxon would likely need to see improved conditions on
its West Qurna deal to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any shift in Exxon's positioning would be a major win in
favour of Baghdad over Kurdistan in their political battle over
control of the country's oil resources that is straining Iraq's
uneasy federal unity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials were tight-lipped on details of any offer,
but Baghdad has been clear in the past foreign oil companies
operating in the south should give up their contracts with the
Kurdish region or risk losing assets in the rest of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the same time we understand Exxon has to fix its issues
with the Kurdistan Regional Government before we can reach a
final agreement on continuing working in the south," the Iraqi
oil official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statement on the website of the Kurdistan Regional
Government (KRG) said Tillerson met with Kurdish leader Barzani
to discuss the company's operations, without giving any further
details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't engage at CEO level unless there is something
substantial on the table," a chief executive of a rival oil
company operating in the south said about Exxon's meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONG DISPUTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon was the first major oil company to test the waters by
signing for six blocs with the Kurdistan Regional Government
(KRG) in 2011, upsetting Baghdad which says only the central
government has the right to oilfield deals and to control
exports of the OPEC member's crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its move heralded an increase in tensions between the
Arab-led central government and the self-governed region run by
ethnic Kurds since 1991, where they have their own armed forces
but rely on Baghdad for a share of the national budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two regions late last year sent troops from their
respective armies to reinforce positions along their disputed
internal border in a major escalation of tensions. Talks to
defuse the crisis are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear whether Baghdad's offer was conditional on
Exxon putting its Kurdish assets on hold, and further details
were not immediately available, but Iraq's oil minister hinted a
week ago that sweeter terms could be on offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wish Exxon would stay and work with us. When we talk
about West Qurna, we are talking about double of what is going
to be achieved in the Kurdistan region," Abdul Kareem Luaibi
told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have started our preparations for the fifth licensing
round, which is going to be with completely different contract
shapes that are going to be very attractive to the oil
companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil majors have been lured north by better contract terms,
security and an easier working environment compared with the
bureaucracy and infrastructure bottlenecks which hamper oil
projects in the rest of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials said late last year that China National
Petroleum Corp, or CNPC, had emerged as the favourite in
negotiations to take over Exxon's 60 percent stake in the $50
billion West Qurna-1 project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq's central government and the KRG have long feuded over
control of oil revenues, oilfields and territory, but the Exxon
talks come with the country caught in a crisis over
power-sharing among Shi'ite Muslims, Sunnis and ethnic Kurds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any Exxon offer from Baghdad would emerge at a time when
Shi'ite premier Maliki is struggling to manage increasing
political pressure from Sunni street protests that have
complicated his government's fight with Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Iraq's government says it alone has the legal authority
to export crude and sign deals, Kurdistan says its right to
grant contracts and ship oil is enshrined in the constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempts to resolve the dispute have failed in part because
of disagreements over a long-delayed oil and gas law meant to
set a clearer framework for managing the world's fourth largest
oil reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

Coalition Releases 4th Quarter 2012 Hiring Number Today
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


The 100,000 Jobs Mission announced today that its coalition companies have
collectively hired 51,835 veterans through 2012. Launched in March 2011 by
eleven major employers, the coalition of private sector companies is already
more than half of the way to its goal of hiring at least 100,000 U.S. military
veterans by 2020. 

"This is a major milestone in our mission to hire 100,000 veterans in ten
years," said Frank Bisignano, Chief Operating Officer for JPMorgan Chase, a
founding member of the 100,000 Jobs Mission. "To have achieved more than half of
our goal in two years is a testament both to the talent of our returning service
men and women and to the commitment of the 100,000 Jobs Mission companies. We
will continue to make the most of this momentum in 2013." 

The coalition has grown to 94 companies, up from 76 in the third quarter of
2012. The 100,000 Jobs Mission is a unique grassroots effort originating in
corporate America to combat the high unemployment rate among U.S. military
veterans, especially those returning from service in Iraq and Afghanistan. The
member companies represent a wide array of industries across the U.S., including
financial services, defense, healthcare, telecommunications, technology,
transportation, retail and energy - and they are hiring at all levels within
their companies. There is no monetary cost for joining the coalition. Each
company has made a commitment to hire veterans, share best hiring practices with
other member companies and report their results quarterly. The 100,000 Jobs
Mission is focused on the entire employment continuum - not just recruiting and
hiring military talent but also retaining them long-term. 

Leaders from the coalition companies have stated that hiring veterans is not
only the right thing to do; it makes sense for their businesses. 

"EMC is extremely proud to be a founding member of the 100,000 Jobs Mission as
we reach this significant step towards our goal," said ML Krakauer, Executive
Vice President of Human Resources at EMC Corporation. "Veterans offer a strong
set of skills that significantly contribute to future innovation and success at
our company. As a member of the coalition, we have had the opportunity to learn,
collaborate and share best practices with other leading companies around
attracting, developing and retaining our talented veterans. We look forward to
continuing the positive momentum this year." 

"Intel joined the 100,000 Jobs Mission in October 2012 and we have seen value in
a short time. We`ve shared our own best practices and learned from the other 93
top companies in the coalition," said Ardine Williams, vice president of Human
Resources and director of HR Enterprise Services for Intel. "Veterans are
innovative, resourceful and reliable. Their experience and training make them an
excellent fit for our culture. Joining this effort will give us a louder voice
to support veteran hiring."

&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD Jan 23 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is moving "along the
right path" after meeting with Iraq's Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki, but must deal with its disputed Kurdistan deals
before any final agreement on it staying in southern oilfields,
an Iraqi oil official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon had been seeking to pull out of the country's huge
West Qurna 1 oilfield after fighting with Baghdad's central
government over deals it signed with autonomous Kurdistan in the
north, contracts Iraq's oil ministry rejects as illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's top executive on Monday met with Maliki and industry
sources said the Iraqi government has made an offer to Exxon now
in an apparent bid to keep the U.S. company working in the
southern field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After the meeting with Maliki, we can now say that Exxon is
moving along the right course the central government has set for
foreign oil companies working in the country," the Iraqi oil
source said without giving any details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the same time we understand Exxon has to fix its issues
with the Kurdistan Regional Government before we can reach a
final agreement on continuing working in the south."&lt;/p&gt;

DAVOS, Switzerland--(Business Wire)--
Two hospitality giants - Hilton Worldwide and Marriott International - addressed
global business and travel industry leaders today at the World Economic Forum in
Davos to urge governments to move quickly to adopt "Smart Visa" policies which
stimulate global travel, create new jobs and spur economic development. The two
companies represent more than 7,000 hotels in 90 countries, which include
600,000 employees at these owned, managed and franchised properties. They are
working together with the World Economic Forum Governors for the aviation,
travel and tourism industry to promote global action toward "Smart Visa"
policies regionally by 2015 and globally by 2020. 

Smart Visas refer to safe, secure and sustainable solutions that promote
mobility, maximize the use of technology, and expand programs that facilitate
travel while removing process inefficiencies caused by arduous visa
requirements. As a result of Smart Visa policies, more data is collected and
shared across borders, creating enhanced security, efficiencies that reduce
government spending and a better customer experience. 

"In 2012, the UN World Tourism Organization reported that more than one billion
people traveled outside their borders - a tremendous catalyst for global
commerce and new jobs," said Christopher J. Nassetta, president and CEO, Hilton
Worldwide. "We are here at the World Economic Forum to tackle complex and
challenging economic, social, environmental and political issues. Enabling
greater international travel is the low-hanging fruit that can create
significant economic growth and employment." 

"Smart governments are thinking about international travel and tourism as trade,
and they are doing everything they can to remove barriers and be more strategic
in addressing visas and other access issues that discourage people from
traveling and doing business," said Arne Sorenson, president and CEO, Marriott
International. "While we recognize that security remains a top concern, we call
on the world leaders here at Davos to be visionary about a future world of
interconnected markets where moving travelers more easily will allow more people
to see the world and result in 2 billion world travelers in the next decade." 

Many countries are recognizing the economic benefits of international travel and
tourism and making secure and convenient travel a policy priority, including
Turkey, which has more than doubled international visitation in a decade by
providing visas on arrival; China, which has implemented visa-free travel for
three days to Beijing for 45 countries; Russia, which is encouraging visa-free
travel to and from the European Union; and Australia and the United Arab
Emirates, which have been utilizing electronic visas, where the process is
on-line and takes minutes, not days or weeks. The ASEAN nations are moving to a
common regional visa to promote economic development. 

Last year, President Obama announced the development of a national travel and
tourism policy. Since then, the United States has made significant progress,
with an increase in international arrivals as the visa waiver program was
expanded to Taiwan and wait times for in-person interviews, most notably in
China, Brazil, and Mexico, were brought down to under one week. 

"We applaud those governments who are taking visionary approaches to
facilitating travel, enhancing economies and providing employment opportunities
worldwide. We view the private sector and Forum leaders as powerful partners to
ensure progress continues so that global visa and entry policies are augmenting
and enhancing the free-flow of goods, services, and people," said Nassetta and
Sorenson. 

Globally, at $6.3 trillion in 2011, or 9.1% of total worldwide GDP, travel and
tourism contributes more to world economies than some of the largest
manufacturing sectors, including automotive and chemicals. The industry directly
employs 98 million people, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/ARBIL, Iraq Jan 23 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil's 
top executive has met with the president of Iraqi Kurdistan
after Baghdad made the U.S. major an offer in an apparent bid to
keep it operating in the south of the country, industry sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting took place in Davos on Tuesday, a day after
Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson met Iraqi Prime Minister
Nuri al-Maliki and asked whether the U.S. major could stay in
the south despite signing deals with the Kurdish region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Exxon offered to sell its stake in the huge
southern West Qurna-1 oilfield after fighting with Baghdad over
its contracts with autonomous Kurdistan, deals which the central
government in Baghdad rejects as illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Baghdad wants to lure Exxon in. Will they bite?" said one
oil industry source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Western oil executive from a company involved in the
south said Exxon would likely need to see improved conditions on
its West Qurna deal to stay in the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any change in Exxon's position would be a major win in
favour of Baghdad in the bitter dispute over oil between Iraq's
government and Kurdistan that is straining Iraq's uneasy federal
unity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statement on the website of the Kurdistan Regional
Government (KRG) said Tillerson met with President Masoud
Barzani to discuss the company's operations, without giving any
further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon was the first major oil company to test the waters by
signing for six blocs with the Kurdistan Regional Government
(KRG) in 2011, upsetting Baghdad which says only the central
government has the right to oilfield deals and to control
exports of the OPEC member's crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't engage at CEO level unless there is something
substantial on the table," a chief executive of a rival oil
company operating in the south said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq has been clear in the past that foreign oil companies
operating in the south should give up their contracts with the
Kurdish region or risk losing assets in the rest of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear whether Baghdad's offer was conditional on
Exxon putting its Kurdish assets on hold, and further details
were not immediately available, but Iraq's oil minister hinted a
week ago that sweeter terms could be on offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wish Exxon would stay and work with us. When we talk
about West Qurna, we are talking about double of what is going
to be achieved in the Kurdistan region," Abdul Kareem Luaibi
told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have started our preparations for the fifth licensing
round, which is going to be with completely different contract
shapes that are going to be very attractive to the oil
companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BETTER TERMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil majors have been lured north by better contract terms,
security and an easier working environment compared with the
bureaucracy and infrastructure bottlenecks which hamper oil
projects in the rest of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials said late last year that China National
Petroleum Corp, or CNPC, had emerged as the favourite in
negotiations to take over Exxon's 60 percent stake in the $50
billion West Qurna-1 project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq's central government and the KRG have long feuded over
control of oil revenues, oilfields and territory, but the Exxon
talks come with the country caught in a crisis over
power-sharing among Shi'ite Muslims, Sunnis and ethnic Kurds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any Exxon offer from Baghdad would emerge at a time when
Shi'ite premier Maliki is struggling to manage increasing
political pressure from Sunni street protests that have
complicated his government's fight with Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Iraq's government says it alone has the legal authority
to export crude and sign deals, Kurdistan says its right to
grant contracts and ship oil is enshrined in the constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempts to resolve the dispute have failed in part because
of disagreements over a long-delayed oil and gas law meant to
set a clearer framework for managing the world's fourth largest
oil reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan 23 - Fitch Ratings has assigned South Korea-based KT Corporation's (KT)
JPY5bn notes due 2015, JPY18.2bn notes due 2016, and JPY6.8bn notes due 2018 final ratings of
'A'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final ratings follow the receipt of documents conforming to information already
received, and are in line with the expected ratings assigned on 8 January 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notes are rated at the same level as KT's Issuer Default Rating of 'A' as they represent
direct, unconditional, unsecured, and unsubordinated obligations of the company, ranking equally
with other senior unsecured debt and subject to a negative pledge clause. However, as is common
in Korean global bond issuance, the negative pledge clause does not protect bondholders from
subordination through future grants of senior-ranking security interests to either debt
denominated in Korean won or debt in any currency with a maturity less than one year from the
date of issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratings reflect KT's position as a fully diversified telecommunications operator in
South Korea, with leading market positions in the fixed-line and broadband businesses, and the
second-largest market share in the wireless segment. However, Fitch believes that the company
has little rating headroom and that further declines in telecom service margins or EBITDA are
likely to lead to a negative rating action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch does not foresee any material improvement to KT's operating margins in 2013. This is
because telecom operators are likely to continue to pursue aggressive marketing policies to
expand their long term evolution subscriber base to improve average revenue per user. However,
marketing efforts in early 2013, continuing from Q412, are unlikely to be as severe as witnessed
in Q212-Q312, largely due to regulatory curb on excessive competition. For Q113, the regulatory
body has suspended all telecom operators from subscriber acquisition for about 20 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch forecasts that KT's net debt will continue to decline in 2013 with net debt/operating
EBITDAR below 1.5x (1.7x at end-2011), mainly due to cash received from the securitisation of
handset instalment receivables, as well as reduced capex. KT, on a core telecom basis, has
reduced net debt to KRW7.6trn at end-September 2012 from KRW8.5trn at end-2011. However, if KT
makes a sizable debt-funded acquisition to expand its geographical footprint, or to diversify
business portfolio, this would result in a negative rating action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Could Trigger A Rating Action?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative
rating action include&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- further deterioration in the operating environment causing core telecom service margins or
EBITDA to decline further&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- debt-funded acquisitions leading to core telecom adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR over
1.5x on a sustained basis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- negative pre-dividend free cash flow on a sustained basis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive: Given the company's difficult regulatory and market environment, positive rating
actions are unlikely in the medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Jan 24 (Reuters) - Mexico's Coca-Cola FEMSA
said on Thursday that it had closed on its $688.5 million
acquisition of a 51 percent stake in Coca-Cola Co's Philippines
bottling operations, part of a recent shopping spree to expand
its global footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola FEMSA will have the option to acquire
the remaining 49 percent of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc
(CCBPI) at any time during the next seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Coca-Cola FEMSA said it had agreed to
buy Grupo Yoli, the maker of a popular lime-flavored soft drink,
in a deal valued around $700 million in which the Coke giant
will pay with shares and absorb debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May last year, the company closed the acquisition of the
drinks unit of Mexico's Grupo Fomento Queretano in a $501
million deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's quarterly profit edged lower as Office software sales slowed ahead of a new launch, offsetting a solid but unspectacular start for its Windows 8 operating system and sending the company's shares down 1.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results mark a stark change from the 1990s, when Microsoft was the unchallenged king of computing and the release of a new Windows operating system would supercharge sales, generate excitement and generally boost its stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of that appears to be true now, as Microsoft has been overtaken by Apple Inc and Google Inc in the rush toward mobile computing, while sales of traditional desktop computers are in decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still no sign that Windows 8 is a gangbuster," said Andrew Bartels, an analyst at Forrester Research. "Compared to prior periods, where you saw a big increase when a new one came out, you're not seeing that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit at the world's largest software company slid to $6.4 billion, or 76 cents per share, in the fiscal second quarter, from $6.6 billion, or 78 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street had expected 75 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall sales rose 3 percent to $21.5 billion, Microsoft said on Thursday, in line with analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest factor weighing on Microsoft was a 10 percent decline in sales at its Office unit to $5.7 billion, which took into account the loss of deferred revenue relating to discounted upgrades to the new version of the software, expected shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a pause before a product launch, which is typical," said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WINDOWS SHRUG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows sales jumped 24 percent to $5.9 billion, slightly ahead of analysts' average expectations, which had been gradually lowered over the last few months. That also included some deferred revenue relating to discounted upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it has sold more than 60 million Windows 8 licenses since its late-October launch, an unexceptional start for a product which has not gripped the public's imagination in the way of Apple's iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company already announced 60 million Windows 8 sales two weeks ago, broadly in line with Windows 7 sales three years before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 8 continues to have an uphill battle in convincing investors this is going to be the key to the growth story for Microsoft," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. "It continues to be a major prove-me product cycle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not detail sales of its new Surface tablet - a direct competitor to the iPad - although chief financial officer Peter Klein said the company was expanding production and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows executives suggest that Windows will win more people over when new touch-screen devices start hitting the shelves in coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Demand is stronger than supply across a number of key device types, whether Windows tablets, convertibles, or all-in-ones," Tami Reller, chief financial officer of Microsoft's Windows unit, told Reuters earlier this month. "Most of the opportunity is still ahead of us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts seem prepared to give Microsoft more time to prove its point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been disruptive but the PC market is far from dead," said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. "Even if they have minimal success with Surface, they don't need much to move the needle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares have fallen 2 percent since Windows 8 was launched on October 26, compared to a 5 percent gain in the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index. They fell to $27.06 in after-hours trading, after closing at $27.23 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jennifer Saba; Editing by Richard Chang and Bob Burgdorfer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MEXICO CITY, Jan 24 (Marketwire) -- 
Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV: KOFL) (NYSE: KOF), the largest
franchise bottler of Coca-Cola products in the world, has finalized the
acquisition of 51% of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. (CCBPI) from
The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO), the world's largest beverage company,
for an amount of US$688.5 million in an all-cash transaction. The closing
of this transaction will be effective on January 25, 2013.

    This purchase price represents an aggregate enterprise value for 100% of
the bottler of US$1,350 million. As part of the agreement, Coca-Cola
FEMSA will have an option to acquire the remaining 49% of CCBPI at any
time during the seven years following the closing and will have a put
option to sell its ownership to The Coca-Cola Company any time during
year six.

    "Our company has started 2013 on the right foot. We recently announced a
merger agreement with Grupo Yoli and its shareholders, one of the oldest
family-owned bottlers in the Coca-Cola system in Mexico, which serves
both Acapulco and Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, two of the most important tourist
destinations in the coast of the Pacific Ocean. This marks our fifth
transaction in the Coca-Cola bottling space in the last 18 months,
representing an aggregate investment of more than US$3,500 million.
Today, we are pleased to announce the closing of the transaction with our
partner, The Coca-Cola Company, to strengthen our position in the global
beverage industry through the acquisition of a majority stake in their
bottling operations in the Philippines. After almost 200 years, we now
have the opportunity to reconnect the Manila-Acapulco route through the
exchange of our cultures and operating best practices. More recently, we
had the privilege to express our firm belief and confidence in the
Philippines to President Benigno Aquino III himself, looking forward to a
successful relationship with the Philippine government. We are certain
that our operators have the skills and operational capabilities to take
on the challenges and capture the opportunities that we have identified
in our Philippine operation. Our values and culture will extend to our
growing family of employees as we reinforce our commitment to generate
economic, social, and environmental value together," said Carlos Salazar
Lomelin, Chief Executive Officer of Coca-Cola FEMSA.

    Coca-Cola FEMSA will recognize the results of CCBPI through the equity
method as of the closing date.

    Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. produces and distributes Coca-Cola,
Fanta, Sprite, Del Valle, and other trademark beverages of The Coca-Cola
Company in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including Mexico
City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (Guatemala
City and surrounding areas), Nicaragua (nationwide), Costa Rica
(nationwide), Panama (nationwide), Colombia (most of the country),
Venezuela (nationwide), Brazil (greater Sao Paulo, Campinas, Santos, the
state of Mato Grosso do Sul, part of the state of Goias, and part of the
state of Minas Gerais), Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and
surrounding areas) and Philippines (nationwide), along with bottled
water, juices, teas, isotonics, beer, and other beverages in some of
these territories. The Company has 60 bottling facilities and serves
close to 315 million consumers through more than 2,500,000 retailers with
more than 100,000 employees worldwide.

said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WINDOWS SHRUG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows sales jumped 24 percent to $5.9 billion, slightly
ahead of analysts' average expectations, which had been
gradually lowered over the last few months. That also included
some deferred revenue relating to discounted upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it has sold more than 60 million Windows 8
licenses since its late-October launch, an unexceptional start
for a product which has not gripped the public's imagination in
the way of Apple's iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company already announced 60 million Windows 8 sales two
weeks ago, broadly in line with Windows 7 sales three years
before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 8 continues to have an uphill battle in convincing
investors this is going to be the key to the growth story for
Microsoft," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.
"It continues to be a major prove-me product cycle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not detail sales of its new Surface tablet - a
direct competitor to the iPad - although chief financial officer
Peter Klein said the company was expanding production and
distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows executives suggest that Windows will win more people
over when new touch-screen devices start hitting the shelves in
coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Demand is stronger than supply across a number of key
device types, whether Windows tablets, convertibles, or
all-in-ones," Tami Reller, chief financial officer of
Microsoft's Windows unit, told Reuters earlier this month. "Most
of the opportunity is still ahead of us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts seem prepared to give Microsoft more time to prove
its point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been disruptive but the PC market is far from dead,"
said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. "Even if they
have minimal success with Surface, they don't need much to move
the needle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares have fallen 2 percent since Windows 8 was
launched on Oct. 26, compared to a 5 percent gain in the
tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index. They fell to $27.06 in
after-hours trading, after closing at $27.23 on Nasdaq.

 (Adds analyst quote, earnings details, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's 
quarterly profit edged lower as Office software sales slowed
ahead of a new launch, offsetting a solid but unspectacular
start for its Windows 8 operating system and sending the
company's shares down 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results mark a stark change from the 1990s, when
Microsoft was the unchallenged king of computing and the release
of a new Windows operating system would generate excitement and
generally boost its stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither appears to be true now, as Microsoft has so far lost
out to Apple Inc and Google Inc in the battle
for the mobile computing generation (see graphic link.reuters.com/jad55t).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profit at the world's largest software company slid to $6.4
billion, or 76 cents per share, in the fiscal second quarter,
from $6.6 billion, or 78 cents per share, in the year-ago
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street had expected 75 cents per share, on average,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall sales rose 3 percent to $21.5 billion, Microsoft
said on Thursday, in line with analysts' estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a pause before a product launch, which is typical,"
said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the loss of some deferred revenue to account for
discounted upgrades to new software, Office revenue fell about
10 percent to $5.7 billion, which is not unusual ahead of a new
launch, expected in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows sales, which included some deferred revenue from the
launch of Windows 8 last October, jumped 24 percent to $5.9
billion, slightly ahead of analysts' average expectations, which
were lowered over the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it has sold more than 60 million Windows 8
licenses since its late-October launch, an unexceptional start
for a product which has not gripped the public's imagination in
the way of Apple's iPad. Microsoft did not detail sales of its
competing Surface tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Windows 8 continues to have an uphill battle in convincing

&lt;p&gt;Jan 24 - Fitch Ratings has assigned IDRs of 'A/F1' to Goldman Sachs
International (GSI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
(Goldman). Fitch has affirmed GSI's existing ratings including the 'A/F1' long-
and short-term ratings associated with GSI's senior secured note program. A
complete list of GSI's ratings follows this release. The Rating Outlook for GSI
is Stable, in line with the Outlook of Goldman. 

RATING RATIONALE

The IDRs for GSI and Goldman are equalized, which reflects Fitch's view that GSI
is core and integral to Goldman's business strategy and operations. Fitch 
believes Goldman would fully support GSI in the event of need.

GSI is Goldman's major non-U.S broker-dealer and a critical part of Goldman's 
global operations. GSI's activities cover the broad spectrum of investment 
banking and capital market activities including advisory and underwriting; 
market making in equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities; investment
management; and investing/lending activities. 

Fitch believes there is a high level of management/operational integration with 
other core Goldman operations. GSI maintains comfortable liquidity and 
capitalization, which are augmented by the capacity to tap liquidity and 
additional capital from Goldman in the event of need.

SENSITIVITY/RATING DRIVERS

Given Fitch's view that GSI is a core subsidiary of Goldman, GSI's IDRs would 
change in conjunction with any changes to Goldman's IDRs. In the unlikely event 
that Fitch no longer considers GSI to be a core part of Goldman's operations, 
GSI's IDRs could be negatively affected. Rated notes issued under GSI's secured 
note program are guaranteed by Goldman.

Goldman's IDRs were affirmed on Oct. 10, 2012 with a Stable Outlook as part of 
Fitch's Global Trading and Universal Bank (GTUB) periodic review. The IDRs 
continue to be supported by Goldman's leading investment banking franchise, 
strong risk management, solid liquidity position, and better-than-average 
capital position. These factors are reflected in Goldman's 'a' viability rating.
Goldman's IDRs are further underpinned by the prospect of U.S. government 
support in the event of need.

Goldman's IDRs have limited upward potential, given the company's business focus
on the capital markets. Goldman's IDRs could be negatively pressured if its 
financial profile deteriorates and Fitch's view of its support changes. For 
additional details, see 'Fitch Affirms Goldman Sachs' IDRs at 'A/F1'; Outlook 
Stable' dated Oct. 10, 2012. 

Fitch assigns the following ratings with a Stable Outlook

Goldman Sachs International
--Long-term IDR 'A';
--Short-term IDR 'F1'.

Fitch affirms the following ratings:
Goldman Sachs International
--Senior Secured Long-term Notes at 'A';
--Senior Secured Short-term Notes at 'F1';
--Short-term Debt at 'F1'.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A federation of U.S. labor unions is looking to force JPMorgan Chase's board to consider breaking up the company after the disastrous "London Whale" affair, but the bank is trying to ensure that its shareholders do not get to vote on the union's proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects name of the Fox Business Network in paragraph 8)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Rick Rothacker and David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 24 (Reuters) - A federation of U.S. labor unions is
looking to force JPMorgan Chase's board to consider
breaking up the company after the disastrous "London Whale"
affair, but the bank is trying to ensure that its shareholders
do not get to vote on the union's proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank is seeking permission from the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission to omit the proposal from the
measures that shareholders vote on this spring, according to a
letter sent to the agency on January 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AFL-CIO's Reserve Fund, a union fund that owns JPMorgan
shares, wants the bank's board to form a committee that would
explore "extraordinary transactions that could enhance
stockholder value," including breaking off one or more of the
company's businesses. The panel should hire third-party advisers
and make a report to shareholders 120 days after this spring's
annual shareholder meeting, according to the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has become too big manage, the proposal said,
citing more than $6 billion in losses last year by a trader
nicknamed the "London Whale" in the bank's Chief Investment
Office in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our view, the evidence is mounting that JPMorgan has
reached the point where stockholders would benefit from
restructuring," the AFL-CIO said in its proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its letter to the SEC, lawyers for JPMorgan said the
proposal should be blocked from being included in the bank's
proxy filing because it involves the company's ordinary
business, an exclusion allowed under SEC rules. The letter also
says the proposal includes "false and misleading" statements and
is "vague and indefinite."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokespersons for JPMorgan and the SEC declined to comment
on the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to a question in an interview on Fox Business
Network on Thursday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said there is no
reason for the bank to break up or spin-off businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are in four businesses. They are all doing very well,"
he said. "There is a lot of cross-sell. We have good returns on
capital, third year of record profits. There is no reason for us
to contemplate something like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heather Slavkin Corzo, senior legal and policy advisor with
the AFL-CIO, said the union is preparing a response to
JPMorgan's letter for the SEC. The union hasn't previously
submitted a proposal calling for this kind of action, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think it's important that they take a look at some
potential extraordinary transactions that could maximize
shareholder value," Slavkin Corzo said.

- Patent-Pending Plug-in Gives Marketers a Bi-Directional Data Exchange Between
Excel and the Anametrix Real-Time Digital Analytics Platform -
SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
Anametrix, the first cloud-based, real-time digital analytics platform,
introduces Anametrix Plug-in for Microsoft Excel, which embeds new marketing
analytics capabilities directly into the Excel user interface. The product
enables Anametrix users to easily create, refresh, upload and schedule reports
from multichannel marketing data in Anametrix, and it delivers real-time access
to all vendor and corporate data directly within the application marketers most
frequently use for data analysis and reporting. 

NEWS HIGHLIGHTS

* Available now to both new and existing clients, the patent-pending Anametrix
Plug-in for Excel enables bi-directional data exchange between Excel and
multichannel marketing data in Anametrix. The product embeds four new buttons
directly onto the Excel interface to give marketers real-time access to all
vendor and corporate data while taking advantage of standard Excel
functionality:

* Query button launches the new Anametrix Data Wizard to automate the process of
exporting to Excel marketing data from any source connected to the Anametrix
platform - web analytics, advertising, email marketing, social media, search
engine marketing, surveys, live chat, CRM, marketing automation, U.S. Census,
and third-party research. The Data Wizard helps marketers quickly map data
fields from disparate sources using a minimum common denominator, which then
allows the data to be easily correlated and analyzed within Excel. Other tabs
enable users to filter data and create parameters for analysis. Marketers can
spend more time analyzing data and less time collecting it, with quicker and
more accurate visibility into performance metrics across all channels without
manual manipulation. 
* Refresh button updates data in report templates on any interval a marketer
specifies to ensure access to most current data, regardless the complexity or
number of Excel sheets within the report template. Marketers save time by
updating reports with real-time data from all sources. Reports can be refreshed
automatically with the most current data without re-formatting or
re-calculating. Errors can be avoided with automatic update of pre-processed and
pre-formatted data and calculations. 
* Upload button protects the integrity of data in the Anametrix platform while
allowing marketers to add datasets to Anametrix. Unlike analytics tools that
only allow exports to Excel, the Anametrix Plug-in for Excel offers true
bi-directional data exchange. While in Excel, marketers can add to Anametrix new
data, such as responses collected from an in-store survey mapped to responses
from an online survey. Users can only add, edit or delete the data they upload
from Excel, but they are prevented from modifying data within the Anametrix
platform, eliminating risk of data loss or breach of integrity. The Anametrix
Plug-in for Excel enables marketers to compare performance across channel,
product and geography, and against goals and budget to make more meaningful
decisions. It allows them to easily account for offline data, while offering
finance organizations more accountable measurements, including year-over-year
comparisons and budgeting. 
* Schedule button saves marketers time and enables collaboration by refreshing
the data from Anametrix on specified intervals; publishing the reports to .xls,
.pdf and other formats; and emailing the results to select colleagues. Reports
can be automatically refreshed and emailed to recipients with complete security
and automation.

* By increasing visibility into multichannel marketing data, the Anametrix
Plug-in for Excel helps B2C CMOs and marketers demonstrate and increase their
ROMI by improving campaign effectiveness, lowering customer acquisition costs,
expanding lifetime value and uncovering new revenue opportunities. 
* Pricing for the Anametrix platform is based on the number of data sources
being connected. Pricing plans include unlimited users to ensure universal
access for all marketers and executives. The new Anametrix Plug-in for Excel is
included at no additional fee to clients and is available immediately. 
* Anametrix is completely cloud-based. Users can access their marketing data in
real time through an in-browser UI, Microsoft Excel, or any iOS, Android or
Blackberry mobile device. There is no software to install or manage.

QUOTES 

Pelin Thorogood, Anametrix`s CEO 

"The Anametrix digital-analytics platform was designed by marketers for
marketers. We know marketers use Excel, so, rather than trying to force
customers to use only the Anametrix interface, our new Anametrix Plug-in for
Excel delivers bi-directional data access between Anametrix and Excel.
Optimizing ROMI with real-time business insights just got easier." 

Andrew Edwards, CEO of Technology Leaders and Co-Founder of the Digital
Analytics Association

"Excel has long been a favorite of the marketing data analyst, and for good
reason. It provides a great deal of power to a very widely distributed user
base. With Anametrix supplying rich data to Excel through its new plug-in, that
power only gets compounded, and Anametrix wins new visibility to users who want
a familiar interface."

Results help IT professionals develop 2013 resource plans
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
nCircle, the leader in information risk and security performance management,
today announced the results of a 36-month analysis of Microsoft patch data. The
analysis reviewed bulletins and CVEs releases and examined specific emergency
and program updates. 

Key patch trend findings include:

* IE patches increased 17% from 2011 to 2012
* Out-of-band patches decreased by 75% from 2010 levels in 2011 and 2012
* Total bulletin volume decreased by 17% over the last 18 months

"It`s pretty clear that Microsoft`s secure software development efforts are
paying off," said Andrew Storms, director of IT security operations for nCircle.
"Over the last two years, Microsoft patch volume has become fairly predictable
-- a huge change from the dramatic volume swings we used to see in 2010 and the
first half of 2011. Barring unforeseen changes, the patch volume in 2013 should
look a lot like 2012, which should be helpful for IT resource plans."

&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA (Reuters) - Foreign innovators who want to set up new companies in Canada will be able to immigrate under a new start-up visa program that Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said on Thursday was the first of its kind in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new program, to be launched on April 1, is part of a government push to better align the immigration system with Canada's economic goals. Last year, the government revamped the skilled worker program to try to make it meet employers' needs more nimbly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our new start-up visa will help make Canada the destination of choice for the world's best and brightest to launch their companies," Kenney said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recruiting dynamic entrepreneurs from around the world will help Canada remain competitive in the global economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this program, would-be immigrants would require the support of a Canadian venture capital fund or angel investor group, which would invest in new companies started by the immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once candidates for the program are identified by these groups, the government would try to clear them for entry into Canada within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to unite Canadian money and foreign brains. An initial source of candidates could be frustrated foreigners in the high-tech sector in the United States who have not been able to land resident status there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Canadian start-up visa would grant permanent resident status, which can then lead to citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Ottawa will work with two umbrella groups that will identify which members of their associations will be eligible to participate in the program. They are Canada's Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity Association (CVCA) and the National Angel Capital Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Through this program, we want to attract high-quality entrepreneurs from around the globe and help build best-in-class companies in Canada," said Peter van der Velden, president of CVCA and managing general partner of Lumira Capital, which helps build health and life-science companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney has put a moratorium on issuing on Canada's existing entrepreneur visa, which only required an immigrant to hire one person for one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Randall Palmer; Editing by Peter Galloway)&lt;/p&gt;

solar generation project for Portland General Electric (PGE) in Lake County,
Oregon. Constellation financed as well as owns and operates the solar power
system. In return, PGE purchases and receives all of the electricity generated
by the solar panels at a fixed rate from Constellation under a 25-year solar
power purchase agreement (PPA).

kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. (Photo: Constellation)

"Portland General Electric is working hard to diversify its portfolio of
renewable generating resources while maintaining a reliable supply of power for
its customers," said Jim Lobdell, PGE`s vice president for power operations and
resource strategy. "The project marks a significant addition to that effort, and
will help us serve homes and businesses in our service area for years to come." 

"Constellation congratulates Portland General Electric for its commitment to
renewable energy," said Michael D. Smith, vice president of solar and energy
efficiency sales for Constellation. "This project is a great example of the
success of public and private partnerships in boosting the development of
renewable generation." 

The project was supported in part through a grant from the Energy Trust of
Oregon and a business energy tax credit from the Oregon Department of Energy.
Through its PPA with Constellation, PGE did not have to commit upfront capital
to build the project and retains the environmental attributes of the project to
meet the state of Oregon`s renewable portfolio standard requirements. 

The solar project was co-developed by Obsidian Finance Group and Smart Energy
Capital. Belectric, Inc., provided engineering, procurement, construction
services and construction financing before Constellation acquired the project.
Approximately 75 people were employed during construction. Belectric, Inc., will
also provide operations and maintenance services for the project. 

The solar power system comprises more than 20,000 ground-mounted photovoltaic
panels. The project is expected to generate approximately 10 million
kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. Generating the same amount of
electricity using nonrenewable sources would result in the release of an
estimated 2,250 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, or the equivalent
emissions from 379 passenger vehicles, according to U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency data. 

Constellation currently owns and operates more than 126 megawatts of solar
installations that have been completed or are under construction for commercial
and government customers throughout the United States. Constellation commercial
customers, universities, school systems, hospitals and government agencies
interested in on-site solar installations of 1 megawatt or larger may contact
Constellation at sustainable-solutions@constellation.com or 1-877-427-2005.

New Data Add to Evidence Supporting PRISTIQ as a Treatment Option for MDD
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that a Phase 4 study evaluating the
efficacy of PRISTIQ&#174; (desvenlafaxine) Extended Release Tablets met its primary
endpoint. The study supports the efficacy of 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day doses of
PRISTIQ compared with placebo over eight weeks of treatment in adult patients
with major depressive disorder (MDD) as measured by the 17-item Hamilton Rating
Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) total score.1

In this study, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events observed were
consistent with the known safety and tolerability profile of PRISTIQ.1

"These positive top-line results add to the growing body of evidence that
supports PRISTIQ as a treatment option for adults with major depressive
disorder," said Steven J. Romano, M.D., senior vice president, head of Medicines
Development Group, Global Primary Care Business Unit, Pfizer Inc. "We know how
challenging it can be to treat and manage major depressive disorder. We continue
to study PRISTIQ in order to provide clinicians with more information that can
better guide their treatment decisions for MDD patients." 

The Phase 4 study was designed as a multi-center, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, eight-week, parallel group study in adult patients with
MDD.1 The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HAM-D17
total score at week eight.1 The HAM-D17 is a validated assessment tool used to
rate the severity of a patient's major depressive symptoms.2 The study enrolled
924 patients who were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following
treatment arms: PRISTIQ 50 mg/day, PRISTIQ 100 mg/day or placebo.1

Results from this PRISTIQ Phase 4 study will be submitted for presentation at
upcoming scientific congresses and for publication in a peer-reviewed medical
journal. 

About Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)

An estimated 33 to 35 million U.S. adults are likely to experience major
depression at some point during their lifetime.3 The criteria for MDD include
having five or more of the symptoms of depression listed below during the same
two-week period and representing a change from previous functioning. Depressed
mood or diminished interest or pleasure must be among the depression symptoms
reported from the following list: depressed mood; diminished interest or
pleasure; significant weight loss or change in appetite; insomnia/hypersomnia;
psychomotor agitation; fatigue or loss of energy; feelings of worthlessness or
excessive/inappropriate guilt; difficulty concentrating; and recurrent thoughts
of death.4

About PRISTIQ&#174; (desvenlafaxine)

PRISTIQ, a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is
a prescription medication that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 2008 for the treatment of MDD in adults.5 The
recommended dose for PRISTIQ is 50 mg once daily, with or without food. In
clinical studies, doses of 50-400 mg/day were shown to be effective, although no
additional benefit was demonstrated at doses greater than 50 mg/day and adverse
events and discontinuations were more frequent at higher doses.5

Important Safety Information About PRISTIQ

WARNING: SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS

Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and
behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents and young adults in short-term
studies of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders.
Anyone considering the use of PRISTIQ or any other antidepressant in a child,
adolescent or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need.
Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with
antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a
reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and
older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves
associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are
started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed
closely for clinical worsening, suicidality or unusual changes in behavior.
Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and
communication with the prescriber. PRISTIQ is not approved for use in pediatric
patients.

Contraindications

* PRISTIQ is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to
PRISTIQ or venlafaxine. 
* Serotonin syndrome and MAOIs: Do not use monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
intended to treat psychiatric disorders with PRISTIQ or within seven days of
stopping treatment with PRISTIQ. Do not use PRISTIQ within 14 days of stopping
an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders. In addition, do not start
PRISTIQ in a patient who is being treated with an MAOI such as linezolid or
intravenous methylene blue.

Selected Warnings and Precautions

* All patients treated with antidepressants should be monitored appropriately
and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality and unusual changes in
behavior, especially during the first few months of treatment and when changing
the dose. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly
discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse
or includes symptoms of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia,
irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania,
mania or suicidality that are severe, abrupt in onset or were not part of the
patient's presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated
with antidepressants should be alerted about the need to monitor patients.
* The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been
reported with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including with PRISTIQ, both when
taken alone, but especially when co-administered with other serotonergic agents
(including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol,
tryptophan, buspirone and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism
of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric
disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). If
such events occur, immediately discontinue PRISTIQ and any concomitant
serotonergic agents, and initiate supportive treatment. If concomitant use of
PRISTIQ with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, patients should
be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly
during treatment initiation and dose increase. 
* Patients receiving PRISTIQ should have regular monitoring of blood pressure
since increases in blood pressure were observed in clinical studies.
Pre-existing hypertension should be controlled before starting PRISTIQ. Caution
should be exercised in treating patients with pre-existing hypertension or other
underlying conditions that might be compromised by increases in blood pressure.
Cases of elevated blood pressure requiring immediate treatment have been
reported. For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure,
either dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. 
* SSRIs and SNRIs, including PRISTIQ, may increase the risk of bleeding events.
Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
warfarin and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. 
* Mydriasis has been reported in association with PRISTIQ; therefore, patients
with raised intraocular pressure or those at risk of acute narrow-angle glaucoma
(angle-closure glaucoma) should be monitored. 
* PRISTIQ is not approved for use in bipolar depression. Prior to initiating
treatment with an antidepressant, patients should be adequately screened to
determine the risk of bipolar disorder. 
* PRISTIQ should be used cautiously in patients with a history or family history
of mania or hypomania or with a history of seizure disorder. 
* Caution is advised in administering PRISTIQ to patients with cardiovascular,
cerebrovascular or lipid metabolism disorders. Increases in blood pressure and
small increases in heart rate were observed in clinical studies with PRISTIQ.
PRISTIQ has not been evaluated systematically in patients with a recent history
of myocardial infarction, unstable heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension or
cerebrovascular disease. 
* Dose-related elevations in fasting serum total cholesterol, low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides were observed in clinical
studies. Measurement of serum lipids should be considered during PRISTIQ
treatment. 
* On discontinuation, adverse events, some of which may be serious, have been
reported with PRISTIQ and other SSRIs and SNRIs. Abrupt discontinuation of
PRISTIQ has been associated with the appearance of new symptoms. Patients should
be monitored for symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in
dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. 
* The recommended dose in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) is 50-mg every other day. The dose should not be escalated
in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or ESRD. 
* Products containing desvenlafaxine and products containing venlafaxine should

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has reclaimed its place as the largest U.S. publicly traded company by market value one year after losing it to Apple Inc, as shares of the technology giant extended their recent fall on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple's market capitalization has fallen by about $250 billion - roughly the total market value of Google Inc - since hitting a high last September, when the stock traded above $700.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple shares traded as low as $435 before closing down 2.4 percent on Friday at $439.88, for a market value of roughly $413 billion.

&lt;p&gt;* Apple's losses since peak equal market value of Google
    * Heavy Apple volume at the end of Friday's session
    * Apple shares trade as low as $435

 (Updates prices, adds financial details)
    By Rodrigo Campos
    NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has
reclaimed its place as the largest U.S. publicly traded company
by market value one year after losing it to Apple Inc,
as shares of the technology giant extended their recent fall on
Friday.
    Apple's market capitalization has fallen by about $250
billion - roughly the total market value of Google Inc 
- since hitting a high last September, when the stock traded
above $700.
    Apple shares traded as low as $435 before closing down 2.4
percent on Friday at $439.88, for a market value of roughly $413
billion. Exxon shares, up 0.4 percent on the day to $91.73,
added to a market value of about $418.2 billion.
    Apple "was clearly a momentum stock. Whenever the numbers
behind momentum stocks stop, the momentum players are out and
the stock tumbles," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research
analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
    There was heavy volume in Apple shares as they hit the 
session low shortly before the closing bell. The stock dropped
by as much as $7, to $435 from $442, within the span of 1 second
during the last minute of trading.
    More than 50 orders were executed on NYSE Arca at $435 a
share, according to Thomson Reuters time-and-sales data, in
blocks as small as 100 shares and as large as 10,494 shares.
    No other exchange executed orders at a price lower than $438
a share prior to the day's close. After those trades went
through, the stock resumed its earlier levels around $442 a
share before closing at $439.88.
    Apple shares slid 12.4 percent on Thursday - their biggest
percentage drop since late September 2008 - as disappointing
holiday-period iPhone sales reinforced fears the company is
losing its dominance in smartphones.  

 
    Apple shipped a record 47.8 million iPhones in the December
quarter, up 29 percent from a year earlier. But that lagged the
50 million that analysts on average had projected.
 
    "They make great products, expensive products, but as a
value investor I'm interested in the unloved stocks, just not
the recently unloved ones," Forrest said.
    Apple's reign as largest company by market value began in
the last week of January 2012, when it surpassed Exxon.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group is looking to raise up to $600 million from its wealthy customers for a publicly traded credit fund that will provide loans to mid-sized companies - believed to be the first fund of its kind for the Wall Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fund, in which Goldman could invest another $150 million of its own money, is being structured as a business development company, an investment vehicle that is specifically exempt from the so-called Volcker Rule that puts limits on some activities by Wall Street firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A January marketing brochure for the fund, reviewed by Reuters, said the fund will provide loans to "underserved middle market public and private companies" that commercial banks have largely refrained lending to since the financial crisis began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund is a way for Goldman to keep a hand in the credit business despite new constraints on trading credit products that are expected to come with the finalization of the Volcker Rule. The rule that would ban proprietary trading carries exemptions in its current form for lending and small business development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Goldman's asset management group, which is sponsoring the Goldman Sachs Liberty Harbor Capital fund, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund's portfolio, valued at around $50 million, already includes an average stake of about $8.5 million in six companies, with a weighted average yield of roughly 11 percent, according to the brochure. The investments are in both senior secured loans and unsecured high-yield debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new fund comes at a time that Wall Street firms are looking to find new ways to entice their best brokerage customers into new products. While business development companies are not a new innovation, the Goldman fund could be a sign of things to comes from Wall Street firms as they adjust to prospect of lesser trading dollars because of the Volcker rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule is named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule, which is still being hashed out by regulators, would limit the kind of activities Wall Street banks can engage in, including capping the amount of money firms like Goldman can invest in their own hedge funds and private equity funds and preventing them from trading certain kinds of financial products for their own accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes banks including Goldman have made in anticipation of the Volcker Rule's prop-trading ban have already altered the competitive landscape noticeably in the credit space. Last fall a managing director at the private equity firm Blackstone Group took a jab at Goldman and other Wall Street banks, thanking Volcker for taking away its largest competitor in the credit space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while it is unlikely that funds that extend loans to businesses will be impacted by the Volcker rule, Goldman is one of several Wall Street firms that has lobbied regulators to make clear that loans made by credit funds are no different from traditional bank loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaret Seiberg, senior policy analyst at Guggenheim Partners, said it would make sense for Wall Street's biggest banks to follow Goldman's lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lending is outside the scope of the Volcker Rule, so investing in loans seems like a smart strategy going forward," Seiberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its current form, the Volcker Rule also exempts investments that are designed primarily to help develop small businesses and, as the rule puts it, "promote the public welfare."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"'We like small business,' is the historical background," said Rick Carnell, a professor at Fordham Law School who focuses on regulation. "Banking law contains various exemptions for financing small business which go back decades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The managers of the Goldman fund are the same group of portfolio managers that have oversee group of credit hedge funds for Goldman's asset management group, some of which also make business loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Liberty Harbor group is led by Gregg Felton, who joined Goldman in 2006 for the now defunct hedge fund Amaranth Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business development companies function much like real estate investment trusts and pay out 90 percent of the ordinary income they generate by way of dividends. Publicly traded business development companies provide an opportunity for investors to easily move in and out of the fund by buying or selling shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the marketing materials, if Goldman takes the fund public, it expects to do so by July 1, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As opposed to a traditional credit fund, business development companies offer investors greater transparency into investments because the funds must comply with all Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory filing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matthew Goldstein and Emily Flitter; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

Prevnar 13 is the First and Only Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Approved for
This Age Group
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted approval for the expansion of the company`s
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevnar 13&#174;* (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate
Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]), for use in older children and adolescents
aged 6 years through 17 years for active immunization for the prevention of
invasive disease caused by the 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes contained
in the vaccine. For this age group, Prevnar 13 is administered as a one-time
dose to patients who have never received Prevnar 13.1

"As a global leader in pneumococcal disease prevention, extending the impact of
Prevnar 13 to older children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 years is a
reflection of our dedication to improving public health worldwide," said Susan
Silbermann, president, vaccines, Pfizer. "We continue to work tirelessly to make
this vaccine available to people at risk for invasive pneumococcal disease." 

The FDA approval followed submission and review of a Phase 3, open-label trial
of Prevnar 13 in 592 older children and adolescents, including those with
asthma.2 The study met all endpoints, demonstrating immunogenicity and
establishing a safety profile in children aged 6 years through 17 years
consistent with the safety profile established in previous trials in infants and
young children.2

About Prevnar 13

Prevnar 13 was first introduced for use in infants and young children in
December 2009 in Europe and in February 2010 in the U.S., and it is now approved
for such use in nearly 120 countries worldwide. It is the most widely used
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the world, and more than 500 million doses of
Prevnar/Prevnar 13 have been distributed worldwide. Currently, Prevnar 13 is
included as part of a national or regional immunization program in more than 60
countries, offering coverage against invasive pneumococcal disease to nearly 30
million children per year.3

Prevnar 13 is also approved for use in adults 50 years of age and older in more
than 80 countries and it is the first and only pneumococcal vaccine to be
granted World Health Organization prequalification in the adult population.3

About Pneumococcal Disease

Pneumococcal disease (PD) is a group of illnesses caused by the bacterium
Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), also known as pneumococcus.4 PD is
associated with significant morbidity and mortality.4 Invasive manifestations of
the disease include bacteremia (bacteria in the blood) and meningitis (infection
of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord).4 Invasive pneumococcal
disease can affect people of all ages, although older adults and young children
are at heightened risk.4,5,6

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI (Reuters) - Housing Development &amp; Infrastructure Ltd's debt metrics "look reasonable", J.P. Morgan Securities said on Friday, countering the market speculation of difficulties in debt repayments that had hit HDIL shares this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage's comments come after shares of the Indian property developer plummeted over the previous three sessions due to market speculation over its debt repayments following a partial stake sale by a top executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, HDIL shares recovered 11.4 percent and closed at 82.90 rupees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 38.5 percent slump in HDIL shares earlier in the week was sparked after the company's Vice Chairman Sarang Wadhawan said he had sold part of his stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said in a research report that details behind Wadhawan's stake sale would be critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our view, visibility on how critical it is to do the land purchase during what seems to be a lean liquidity period for the company will be key in determining the outcome. Most of these details will probably be out only in the 3Q results," JP Morgan wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steep falls prompted HDIL vice president of finance Hari Prakash Pandey to arrange an investor call on Thursday in which he denied the rumors of "bankruptcy and defaults," saying the company was on track with its debt repayments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assurances had failed to sway investors, with HDIL shares continuing to slump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HDIL's Pandey said on Thursday Wadhawan had sold part of his stake because the company had to meet immediate debt and principal repayments, as well as a final tranche of the payment for a land transaction in Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Rafael Nam and Abhishek Vishnoi; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Iraq tells Exxon must chose Kurdistan or southern
oilfields&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Exxon should make a final decision in few days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ahmed Rasheed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Iraq has told Exxon Mobil
 it must choose between working in its southern oilfields
or in Kurdistan, and Baghdad expects the U.S. oil major to make
a final decision in a few days, its oil minister said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We made it clear to Exxon in the last meeting that the
answer we expected from them is either to work in the Kurdistan
region or to work in southern Iraq," Oil Minister Abdul Kareem
Luaibi told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon Mobil cannot work in both fields at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon was the first major oil company to sign agreements
with the government of the autonomous Kurdistan region in the
north, a move that increased tensions between Baghdad and the
Kurds in a long-running dispute over oil, territory and
political autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad says any deals signed with Kurdistan are illegal,
but the government of Kurdistan says the constitution allows it
to sign oil agreements without permission from the central
government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's chief executive met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri
al-Maliki and with Kurdistan's president last week to discuss
operations in both, while industry sources said the U.S. oil
major was mulling an offer from Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials said at the time that Exxon was moving in
the right direction in its policy, but Kurdistan also said the
company remained committed to its Kurdish deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feud between Baghdad and the Kurdistan enclave, which
has run its own regional administration and armed forces since
1991, has escalated since the KRG began signing deals with oil
majors such as Exxon and Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These deals have also prompted the central government to
warn companies they risk losing their assets in the southern
part of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Other oil companies that signed deals in Kurdistan region
should face the same scenario, and we have informed them,"
Luaibi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXPORT CAPACITY, EXPLORATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luaibi also said Iraq had expanded crude export capacity at
its southern terminals on the Gulf, with the start of
simultaneous loading from two offshore Single Point Moorings
(SPMs), a significant step toward moving its expected increase
in exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today vessels have started to load crude from the two
Single Point Moorings at the same time, and that should
remarkably expand our export capacity," said Luaibi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minister spoke at the signing of a final exploration and
development contract with a Kuwait Energy-led group, part of
Iraq's drive to attract more foreign investment to upgrade its
oil and gas sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract provides rights to explore and develop oil
block 9, which is located in Iraq's southern Basra province.
Kuwait Energy will be the operator with a 70 percent working
interest, and Dragon Oil PLC will hold 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Block 9 contains substantial reserves of oil and gas, and
we have committed (that) $125 million will be invested at the
initial stage of exploration over the next two years," Manssour
Aboukhamseen, Kuwait Energy's chief executive, said at the
signing ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC member Iraq is expected to be the world's biggest
source of new oil supplies over the next few years. It plans to
open up more rounds of auctions for oil and gas blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are preparing now for a fifth bidding round for the
exploration and development of new blocks across Iraq," Luaibi
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful of international companies won bids last May at
Iraq's fourth auction, which had a poor showing because of tough
contract terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A former Ecuadorean judge has claimed that after stepping down from the bench, he illegally ghostwrote a judgment in which Chevron was ordered to pay $18.2 billion (11.5 billion pounds) for polluting the rain forest, and that the plaintiffs paid a $500,000 bribe to the judge who issued the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alberto Guerra, who presided over the case from 2003 to 2004, made the allegations in a sworn statement filed by Chevron on Monday in support of a lawsuit in Manhattan federal district court accusing the Ecuadorean plaintiffs and their lawyers of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another participant in the fraud has now come forward rather than wait to be exposed by others," Hewitt Pate, Chevron vice president and general counsel, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the plaintiffs, in a statement called Guerra a "disgraced former Ecuadorean judge who is being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by Chevron to make false allegations about the Ecuador trial court judgment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerra was not available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filing is the latest in an ever-escalating two-decade battle between Chevron and residents of Ecuador's Lago Agrio over oil extraction in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents claimed that Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001, polluted the rainforest and water supplies with hundreds of unlined waste pits from 1964 to 1992, damaging crops and public health including deaths from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron claimed that its share of the waste pits had been cleaned up and that its activities were not responsible for environmental and public health damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ecuadorean court entered the $18.2 billion judgment in 2011. The award was upped to $19 billion in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Court of Justice, Ecuador's highest court, last month appointed three judges to hear Chevron's final appeal in that country of the court decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them, Oscar Bermudez, told Reuters that they are not allowed to consider new evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our job is to make sure the sentence issued by the previous court complies with legal and constitutional precepts ... they can provide new evidence but the court cannot take it into account," he said, adding that Chevron may consider presenting Guerra's statement to Ecuador's attorney general for his consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, with no assets in Ecuador now, has fought a global campaign against the enforcement of the $19 billion award.

Guerra said Zambrano at times ask him to ghostwrite civil rulings for him for $1,000 a month, which he says was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was then given to another judge, Juan Nunez, who later had to recuse himself due to allegations of bribery brought by Chevron after Nunez was caught on tape discussing the case.

Kent Robertson, a spokesman for Chevron, confirmed Chevron has agreed to pay Guerra's family $10,000 for monthly living expenses and $2,000 for housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's a scoundrel," Fajardo told Reuters on Monday. "I've never met Mr. Guerra, but I know who he is and how he's being paid by Chevron."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement from the Ecuador plaintiffs last week, Fajardo said Guerra had at one point offered to provide testimony to the rainforest communities if they would pay him, though they had refused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zambrano could also not be contacted on Monday.

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4qjcsl/global_enterprise) has
announced the addition of the "Global Enterprise Service Bus Suite Market
2012-2016" report to their offering. 

TechNavio's analysts forecast the Global Enterprise Service Bus Suite market to
grow at a CAGR of 9.96 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors
contributing to this market growth is the need to integrate various enterprise
applications. The Global Enterprise Service Bus Suite market has also been
witnessing the emergence of cloud-based solutions. However, the complex IT
infrastructure of large enterprises could pose a challenge to the growth of this
market. 

The key vendors dominating this market space are IBM Corp., Microsoft Corp.,
Oracle Corp., and Software AG. 

The other vendors mentioned in the report are Tibco Software Inc., Progress
Software Inc., MuleSoft Inc., and Red Hat Inc. 

Commenting on the report, an analyst from TechNavio's Enterprise Computing team
said: ''The increase in the adoption of enterprise service bus (ESB) solutions
is fueled by the emergence of the cloud-based model that enables organizations
to use the solutions at a lower price. Hence, it offers cost benefits,
especially during an economic downturn. In addition to the increased adoption of
cloud-based solutions by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), they are
gradually being used by large enterprises. Cloud-based ESB solutions offer easy
scalability, flexibility, and reduced overhead costs, which is encouraging many
organizations to adopt such solutions. The pay-per-use facility offered by the
solutions is also an emerging trend in the easy adoption of the software.
Furthermore, many vendors in the market have begun to offer their ESB solutions
through the cloud-based model to expand their services and enter new markets.'' 

According to the report, one of the main drivers of the Global ESB Suite market
is the need for business process automation. ESB solutions enable companies
within or across organizations to blend and organize automated business
processes by exchanging business documents such as purchase orders and invoices
between disparate applications. Moreover, the major feature of ESB solutions is
to develop the required information that is stored in existing backend
applications and data stores for use by new business service applications.
Hence, the ability of ESB solutions to efficiently provide the required
information is principally driving the market.

Plaintiffs` Representatives Promised Presiding Judge $500,000 for a Fraudulent
Ruling against Chevron, Funded Ongoing Judicial Ghostwriting Scheme
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
A former Ecuadorian judge has acknowledged his direct involvement in
orchestrating a fraudulent judgment against Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) in the
environmental trial against the company in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. 

In a sworn declaration filed today in New York federal court, Alberto Guerra,
who presided over the case when it was first filed in 2003, reveals that he was
paid thousands of dollars by the plaintiffs` lawyers and a subsequent judge,
Nicholas Zambrano, for illegally ghostwriting judicial orders issued by Zambrano
and steering the case in the plaintiffs` favor. Guerra, who is no longer a
judge, attests that the plaintiffs` lawyers were permitted to draft the $18
billion judgment in their own favor after they promised to pay Zambrano a
$500,000 bribe out of the judgment`s enforcement proceeds, and that Guerra then
reviewed the plaintiffs` lawyers` draft for Zambrano before the judge issued it
as his own. 

"Another participant in the fraud has now come forward rather than wait to be
exposed by others," said Hewitt Pate, Chevron vice president and general
counsel. "Chevron urges additional whistleblowers in Ecuador, the United States,
and elsewhere to come forward. It is never too late to tell the truth." 

Guerra`s declaration, which is corroborated by computer, bank, and shipping
records, as well as the plaintiffs` lawyers` own internal e-mails, provides a
direct account of corruption that has tainted the trial for years. Guerra
describes multiple meetings with the plaintiffs` lawyers and representatives -
namely, New York-based Steven Donziger, Pablo Fajardo, and Luis Yanza - to
discuss payoffs, kickbacks, and the ghostwriting of court orders favorable to
the plaintiffs. Guerra attests:

* "I was Mr. Zambrano`s `ghostwriter` and I wrote the great majority of the
rulings issued in civil cases assigned to Mr. Zambrano, including the Chevron
case." 
* "Mr. Donziger thanked me for my work as ghostwriter in this case and for
helping steer the case in favor of the Plaintiffs`[sic]. The payments from the
Plaintiffs` representatives were given to me by Mr. Fajardo in cash, or were
deposited into my savings account at Banco Pichincha. I remember that while I
was writing court rulings for Mr. Zambrano I would regularly meet with Mr.
Fajardo, perhaps twice per month, to discuss my work." 
* "Mr. Zambrano told me he was in direct contact with Mr. Fajardo and that the
Plaintiffs` representatives had agreed to pay him USD $500,000 from whatever
money they were to collect from the judgment, in exchange for allowing them to
write the judgment in the Plaintiffs` favor." 
* "Approximately two weeks before the trial court in the Chevron case issued the
judgment, Mr. Zambrano gave me a draft of the judgment so that I could revise
it. It was through him that I found out that the attorneys for the Plaintiffs
had written that judgment and had delivered it to him." 
* "I worked on that document in Mr. Zambrano`s residence in Lago Agrio using Mr.
Fajardo`s computer." 
* "Based on what Mr. Zambrano told me, it is my understanding that the
Plaintiffs` attorneys made changes to the judgment up to the very last minute
before it was published." 
* "I knew at the time, and I know now, that the agreement in which I
participated, and by which the Plaintiffs` representatives drafted the judgment
in the Chevron case which Judge Zambrano issued, with my help, was a violation
of Ecuadorian law. According to Ecuadoran law, only a judge is authorized to
write rulings and judgments. For these same reasons I knew at the time, as I
know now, that the arrangement in which I participated, whereby I drafted court
rulings for Mr. Zambrano steering the case in favor of the Plaintiffs, and was
paid by the Plaintiffs` representatives for that work, was a violation of
Ecuadoran law. And I knew at that time, as I know now, that the agreement that
Mr. Zambrano told me he had reached with the representatives` attorneys, to let
them draft the judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs and against Chevron, in
exchange for him receiving USD $500,000 once they collected the money from the
judgment, was a violation of Ecuadoran law."

One year after issuing the judgment against Chevron, Zambrano was dismissed from
the bench as part of an organized crime commission investigation involving the
inappropriate release of narcotics traffickers from prison. 

Guerra`s account is corroborated by contemporaneous documentary evidence. For
example, his computer contains drafts of numerous court orders Zambrano issued,
including in the Lago Agrio case. And his bank records (here, here, here, and
here) document payments made to him by a representative of the plaintiffs.
Shipping records and Guerra`s calendar further corroborate his testimony. 

Sworn statements by several other witnesses also corroborate Guerra`s account.
Chevron`s Ecuadorian lawyers and others known to them now attest to the fact
that, at various times during Zambrano`s tenures on the case, Guerra directly
approached them to solicit bribes on Zambrano`s behalf in order to fix the Lago
Agrio judgment, and that Chevron refused Guerra`s approaches. Moreover,
contemporaneous declarations (here and here) from two of Chevron`s Ecuadorian
lawyers described the failed bribery solicitations at the time they occurred.
These several witnesses attest in their sworn statements that Chevron flatly
rejected Guerra`s repeated bribe solicitations on behalf of Zambrano. 

Guerra`s testimony and corroborating evidence confirm what the extensive overlap
between the plaintiffs` lawyers` internal files and the judgment itself already
supported - that the plaintiffs` lawyers corrupted the Ecuadorian court and
actually wrote the $18 billion judgment against Chevron. 

Contemporaneous e-mails between the plaintiffs` lawyers and representatives,
produced through court-ordered discovery in the United States, also corroborate
Guerra`s declaration. When another judge had to recuse himself from the case in
the midst of a bribery solicitation scandal and Zambrano was poised to resume
presiding over it, the plaintiffs` lawyers identified "Guerra" by name as a
potential target to influence the case`s ultimate ruling. The plaintiffs`
lawyers even assigned code names to Zambrano and Guerra, referring to them as
the "puppeteer" and the "puppet." On October 27, 2009, Fajardo sent Donziger and
Yanza an e-mail stating, "The puppeteer won`t move his puppet until the audience
doesn`t [sic] pay him something." On November 27, 2009, Yanza sent Donziger an
e-mail warning him about increased costs due to paying the "puppeteer." 

This revelation is the latest in a recent series of instances where individuals
and groups formerly aligned with the plaintiffs have either accused the
plaintiffs` lawyers of fraud or provided first-hand accounts of corruption
tainting the trial and judgment. Earlier this month, it was revealed that
Burford Capital, one of the largest financial backers of the plaintiffs, accused
the plaintiffs` lawyers of fraud and other misconduct in connection with their
pursuit of their case. In December, a former environmental consultant to the
plaintiffs came forward with additional proof of fraud and the fabrication of
evidence on the part of the plaintiffs` lawyers. 

Because of the risks to Guerra and his family from coming forward, Chevron has
taken reasonable measures, based on third-party assessments, to protect Guerra`s
safety and security, and that of his family, including relocating them from
Ecuador and providing other assistance. In exchange for collecting and turning
over hard evidence corroborating his account, including his personal computer,
two cell phones, his day calendars, and bank, phone and shipping records, Guerra
received a total of $38,000 from Chevron, but as Guerra affirms, he has "not . .
. received any money or compensation in exchange for signing this sworn
declaration." 

Additional evidence produced by the plaintiffs` American lawyers provides
corroborating proof that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs` representatives participated
in the drafting the judgment. In at least eight separate instances, the judgment
tracks the plaintiffs` lawyers` own documents, in some cases word-for-word,
reciting content from the plaintiffs` lawyers` internal materials that did not
form part of the record, as well as copying errors and idiosyncratic reference
citations that only appeared in the plaintiffs` internal documents. 

Chevron intends to provide all of this evidence to Ecuador`s Prosecutor General
and to request that his office investigate Zambrano and the plaintiffs` lawyers.
The company has provided similar evidence of fraud, corruption, and attorney
misconduct to authorities in Ecuador in the past, but to date, the government
there has taken no apparent action to enforce its laws. 

"Chevron once again calls on Ecuadorian authorities, and authorities wherever
these plaintiffs` lawyers are trying to advance their fraud, to investigate and
bring an end to this scheme," said Pate. "Ecuador should not tolerate American
lawyers using Ecuador`s institutions and citizens as puppets." 

In now coming forward, Guerra has also agreed to make himself available to
appear before other courts, tribunals, and investigators if requested to do so. 

Chevron is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company is involved in
virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and lubricants; manufactures and sells petrochemical

&lt;p&gt;DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh and India on Monday signed an extradition treaty and struck a deal to relax business visa restrictions between the neighboring countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extradition treaty could pave the way for Bangladesh to put on trial several crime bosses who crossed the border into India but are still running their gangs by telephone, a senior official at Bangladesh's Home Affairs Ministry told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also help India bring back fugitive separatists who have fled to Bangladesh including Ulfa leader Anup Chetia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are particularly grateful as the treaty will deal with Indian insurgent groups," Indian Home Minister Sushilkumar Rao Shinde told reporters at a joint press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both sides committed to act against elements inimical to both countries," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India has long been pressing for Chetia's deportation.

Kicking off the second year of its signature program, "Coca-Cola Pay it
Forward," the world`s most recognized brand enlists the help of some of today`s
leading African American history makers to offer exciting apprenticeship
experiences to aspiring youth. Magic Johnson, Common and Debra Lee will serve as
mentors, giving four lucky young people the opportunity to shadow them and their
teams for a week during the summer. The four apprenticeship experiences will
focus on: business (Johnson); music and community (Common); and
media/entertainment (Lee). Expanding this year`s program offering, the Company
has partnered with UNCF (United Negro College Fund), the country`s largest
minority education organization, for a text-to-donate program. 

"I have and always will remain committed to uplifting the urban community in my
business and nonprofit endeavors, and that makes the Coca-Cola `Pay It Forward`
program a perfect fit," said Johnson. "There is no better way to empower a
community than to arm its youth with the necessary skills to succeed." 

"Coca-Cola`s `Pay It Forward` program is a movement to uplift the next
generation," said Lauventria Robinson, vice president, Multicultural Marketing,
Coca-Cola North America Group. "It uncaps a world of possibilities for today`s
young people by offering once-in-a-lifetime apprenticeship experiences that only
Coca-Cola can provide. `Pay It Forward` inspires each of us to take an active
role in cultivating and empowering tomorrow`s leaders." 

Parents, relatives, friends, mentors and members of the community can go to My
Coke Rewards (www.mycokerewards.com/payitforward) now through March 2 to
nominate an aspiring young person for the exclusive "Pay It Forward"
apprenticeship experiences. You must be 16 years of age or older to nominate
somebody and the apprenticeship experiences are available for young people
between the ages of 16-21 (as of May 1, 2013). You can nominate up to five
people and you are automatically entered for a chance to win a $5,000
sweepstakes with each nomination. Eligible youth are also invited to nominate
themselves. 

Join the Coca-Cola Pay It Forward Movement

Coca-Cola invites African Americans across the country to join Johnson, Common
and Lee in its national movement to pay it forward to the next generation by
helping them achieve their education and career aspirations. The Company
suggests: nominating an eligible young person for the "Pay It Forward" program;
becoming a mentor; taking a teen to work; and/or giving to an academic
scholarship group such as UNCF, the nation`s most successful African American
scholarship organization. Share ways you are paying it forward and join the
conversation on Twitter, using the hashtag #CokePayItForward. 

Pay It Forward with UNCF Text Donations

Coca-Cola has been a partner to UNCF for more than 40 years. Over the last six
years, the Company`s contributions to the organization have provided more than
$1.5 million in scholarships, impacting more than 300 students.

partnered with UNCF this year to encourage donations for academic scholarships

&lt;p&gt;* New regulator calls for Exxon to replace local boss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Call comes amid delays at Exxon-led Cepu project&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Also after Exxon's failure to sell some local assets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Fergus Jensen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A senior Indonesian official has
called for U.S. energy group Exxon Mobil to replace its
country manager after delays at one of its major oilfields,
fuelling concerns about state meddling in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country, is
pushing firms to develop huge oil and gas resources more quickly
to fuel rapidly expanding domestic demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the former OPEC member has struggled to attract energy
investment since becoming a net oil importer in 2004 as the
government tightens its control over natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is banking on the Exxon-led Cepu block in Central
Java, the country's biggest oil find in the last decade, to stop
a decline in the country's crude output, which fell to 860,000
barrels per day (bpd) last year from over 1.2 million bpd a
decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gde Pradnyana, operations controller for new oil and gas
regulator SKKMigas, told Reuters on Monday there were more
delays at Cepu and, partly as a result, it had decided not to
extend the work permit for the head of Exxon Mobil's Indonesian
unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The permit for the chief executive, Richard Owen, was due
for renewal in February, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think it's probably better for Exxon to nominate
somebody else, to replace him," Pradnyana said. "We're not
intervening in the way Exxon is doing their business, but we are
expecting a result."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon representatives earlier said the company was "seeking
clarification from the Indonesian government" over Owen's
permit, but were not immediately available for comment on
Pradnyana's remarks on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cepu's Banyu Urip field is expected to reach peak output of
165,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2014, but as of Monday it was
only producing 24,000 bpd. Pradnyana said full production was
unlikely before August or September next year, behind the
initial target of May 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision on Owen also comes after several Indonesian
firms failed in their efforts to buy natural gas assets that
Exxon had put up for sale in Indonesia's Aceh province, sources
familiar with the industry said. Exxon declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He wasn't cooperative enough," said an SKKMigas official,
who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the
issue. "(Exxon) wanted to sell the assets, but then suddenly it
didn't happen ... a lot of domestic companies were interested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COOPERATE OR ELSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic energy self-sufficiency is a policy priority in
Asia's second-biggest crude oil producer and the world's
third-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resources are also a key issue in the run up to presidential
elections in 2014, and a rise in resource nationalism is a
growing risk for foreign operators in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy Minister Jero Wacik this month warned oil executives 
to be "cooperative".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you change directions too much you'll be replaced," he
told executives during an contract signing. "Lots of foreigners
have been sent home because they didn't want to cooperate ... If
you have work areas that are not being used we'll remind you. If
it happens several times we'll take your permit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changing investment environment appears to be impacting
other producers. U.S. group Chevron has sent letters to
SKKMigas reserving the right to reduce its investment if
conditions in the country failed to improve, Pradnyana said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is Indonesia's largest producer, accounting for 45
percent of the country's total crude output in 2012. The company
was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon in 2011 put declining natural gas assets in Sumatra up
for sale, with total output of about 215 million standard cubic
feet of gas per day, drawing interest from state gas distributor
PGN, state energy firm Pertamina and Indonesia's Medco
Energi. Pertamina and Medco said the price Exxon was
looking for was too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources close to the matter say Pertamina is eyeing control
of assets, though it likely lacks the expertise to develop a
technically difficult and costly project such as the huge Natuna
gas field off Borneo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some lawmakers are now pushing for Pertamina to get its
hands on the huge Mahakam gas block in Indonesian Borneo after a
contract giving Total and Japan's Inpex the right to
operate it expires in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stakes in such projects would not just secure energy
supplies, but could also boost budget revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the oil and gas sector contributed 266.6 trillion
Indonesian rupiah ($27.6 billion) to domestic revenue, or 22
percent of the total, one of the top sources of state income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government is becoming more intrusive in the management
of companies," said James Castle, chairman of CastleAsia, a 
corporate consultancy in Indonesia with clients including
Exxon's Owen. "There's virtually no investment ... It's going
very slow because of resource nationalism, legal uncertainty - I
don't see it changing anytime soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move on Exxon came weeks after the energy industry was
shocked by the constitutional court's ruling that scrapped
energy regulator BPMigas, following a challenge by Muslim groups
and others that said foreign firms were getting too good a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia's parliament plans this year to issue a new law on
oil and gas that will set new ground rules for the energy
sector. The government has said it will retain a supervisory
role over the regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Coca-Cola campaign taps local celebrities to raise awareness and support the
world-class sporting event
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Let the games begin! On January 29, Special Olympics 2013 World Winter Games
will be underway in PyeongChang, Republic of Korea. In support of the Games, The
Coca-Cola Company is activating a fully integrated marketing campaign to help
raise awareness and interest in this world-class sporting event that showcases
the unlimited potential of people with intellectual disabilities. 

The campaign, created by Coca-Cola Korea, includes celebrity activations,
in-store displays, fundraising activities, employee volunteer programs and a TV
commercial. 

Through its "Coke Red Ribbon Friends" campaign, Coca-Cola Korea enlisted 100 of
the country`s top celebrities as ambassadors for Special Olympics World Winter
Games. Celebrities like 2010 Olympic gold medal figure skater Yuna Kim and
Korean American actress Yunjin Kim, of the ABC hit TV series "Lost," used their
star power, social media networks and public appearances to promote Special
Olympics 2013 World Winter Games. They educated their friends, families and
fans, and raised funds for the 2013 World Winter Games Organizing Committee. The
campaign and other Coca-Cola fundraising activities generated more than $800,000
in support for Special Olympics. 

"The Coca-Cola Company and Special Olympics have been strong partners for 45
years," said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola
Company. "We are privileged to celebrate and share with the world moments of
connection, community and optimism in support of the amazing young men and women
whose sacrifice, determination and sheer love of life inspire us all." 

More than 2,300 athletes, from 110 countries will compete in eight Olympic-type
sports including alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing,
speed skating, figure skating, floor hockey and a demonstration sport of
floorball. 

At Games time, Coca-Cola Korea expects to refresh the athletes and the tens of
thousands of family, friends, volunteers and fans in attendance. Coca-Cola will
welcome Special Olympics athletes and their families, as well as fans and
consumers, to the Happiness House within the Olympic venue. The Happiness House
will serve as a place for visitors to refresh, relax and have fun. 

In the U.S., The Coca-Cola Company recently played host to Special Olympics
Georgia, celebrating two very special athletes. Marnie Hornsby and Sissy Cooley
are two of the Georgia athletes embarking on the 7,000 mile, 15-hour journey to
South Korea to compete in the 2013 World Winter Games. Hornsby will be competing
in Alpine Skiing and Cooley in speed skating. 

Hornsby, who was born with epilepsy, describes a childhood frustrated by years
of working to find the right medications at the right levels to stave off the
seizures that result from the brain disorder. She began competing with Special
Olympics in 2006 and her mother, Paige Hornsby recalled the change she saw in
her. "Marnie was a child that if she spoke, it was very quietly. She didn`t look
at you eye to eye." She called Special Olympics, "a lifesaver." 

The Coca-Cola Company has a longstanding history with Special Olympics which was
founded by Eunice Kennedy Shriver in 1968. As a global sponsor from the
beginning, the Company has provided monetary and in-kind contributions, hands-on
volunteer assistance, equipment, uniforms and other materials and services for
Special Olympics competitions and community activities around the world.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) launched a sale of about $1 billion worth of Hong Kong-traded shares in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK) on Monday, according to a source with knowledge of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, looking to reduce further its stake in the world's largest bank, offered the shares in ICBC at HK$5.77 each, equivalent to a discount of 3 percent to Monday's close of HK$5.95, added the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank has held a stake in ICBC since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale would be Goldman's second in less than a year, after the New York-based investment bank raised $2.5 billion from a partial selldown of ICBC in April of 2012, most of which was bought by Singapore state investor Temasek TEM.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale last year was part of an effort by Goldman to derisk, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said at the time. The deal left Goldman with a stake valued at about $2 billion in April last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of ICBC have gained about 18 percent since the previous Goldman sale, in line with the performance of the Hang Seng Financial Index .HSHFI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Flaherty and Elzio Barreto; Editing by Robert Birsel and Hans-Juergen Peters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Raushan Nurshayeva&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASTANA Jan 28 (Reuters) - Output at Chevron-led 
Tengizchevroil (TCO), Kazakhstan's largest oil producer, is set
to rise by 12 million tonnes per year in the 2018-19 timeframe
from last year's 24.2 million tonnes, TCO General Director Tim
Miller said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data released by TCO project partner Lukoil this
month said the venture's production stood at 25.1 million tonnes
(about 503,000 barrels per day) in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our 2012 production was 24.2 million tonnes. This was 3.7
pct lower than our business target of 25.1 million tonnes,"
Miller told an enlarged meeting of Kazakhstan's Oil &amp; Gas
Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The primary reasons for this were mechanical problems ...
severe weather conditions and transportation restrictions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The huge Tengiz oilfield, located onshore in western
Kazakhstan, is one of three main drivers of Kazakhstan's plans
to raise its oil output by 60 percent by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan is now the second-largest post-Soviet oil
producer after Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast Central Asian nation of 17 million plans to raise
output to 130 million tonnes by 2020 through expansion at the
Kashagan offshore field in the Caspian, higher output at Tengiz
and the Karachaganak oil and gas field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kazakh Oil &amp; Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev said earlier on
Monday Kazakhstan's total oil output was set to rise to 82
million tonnes in 2013 from last year's 79.2 million tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TCO's output is set to remain at the current level for a few
years as the venture has first to implement the Wellhead
Pressure Management Project (WPMP) to install a pressure boost
facility and drill additional wells post-WPMP to lay the
groundwork for the crucial Future Growth Project (FGP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Future Growth Project will expand production capacity
by 12 million per year," Miller said. "Start-up of the FGP
operation will be in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are targeting the final investment decision for the
fourth quarter of 2013," he said without specifying the sum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron holds a 50-percent stake in the venture, while
ExxonMobil owns 25 percent, Kazakh state oil company
KazMunaiGas has 20 percent and Lukarco, controlled by
Lukoil, the remaining 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since TCO's creation in April 1993, the venture's cumulative
payments to Kazakhstan had totalled $74.2 billion, Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2012, total payments exceeded $14 billion for the second
consecutive year," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

Industrial and Commercial Bank of China on Monday,
according to a source with knowledge of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, looking to reduce further its stake in the world's

from a partial selldown of ICBC in April of 2012, most of which
was bought by Singapore state investor Temasek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale last year was part of an effort by Goldman to

The deal left Goldman with a stake valued at about $2 billion in
April last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of ICBC have gained about 18 percent since the
previous Goldman sale, in line with the performance of the Hang
Seng Financial Index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Siemens (SIEGn.DE) has picked Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to advise on the sale of its Water Technologies unit, part of the engineering conglomerate's efforts to streamline operations and stay competitive in a weak global economy, two people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale may be launched officially in the second quarter, the sources added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siemens and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siemens, Germany's second-most valuable company which makes products ranging from fast trains and gas turbines to hearing aids, in November announced it plans to sell the water unit with annual sales of about 1 billion euros ($1.35 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, several possible bidders have approached the Munich-based group and investment bankers have started to work on the topic, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siemens built up its water technology operations through a flurry of acquisitions over the last decade. Among others, it bought the water systems and services division of US Filter from Veolia Environnement (VIE.PA) for $1 billion in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since much of Siemens's water business is focused on North America, industry sources expect U.S.-based peers Xylem (XYL.N) and Pentair (PNR.N) to take a look at the asset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Asian companies are also likely to throw their hats into the ring," one of the people said. The region was experiencing rapid economic growth, climate change impacts, rising populations and stricter energy and water regulations and is therefore expected to see heavy investment in water treatment equipment in coming years, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurita (6370.T), Hyflux (HYFL.SI), Hitachi (6501.T), Marubeni (8002.T) are seen as possible suitors, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big private equity groups like KKR, Bain or Permira are also expected to show interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Permira in 2011 bought Israel-based Netafim, a maker of irrigation technology, for 800 million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siemens Water Technologies offers technology ranging from conventional water treatment to emergency water supply and water disinfection systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report published in 2010 by Global Water Intelligence, an industry journal, put the size of the global water market at more than $500 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7421 euros)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Arno Schuetze; Additional reporting by Jens Hack; Editing by Hans-Juergen Peters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (XOM.N) Indonesia's Cepu block will likely not reach full production until August or September 2014, behind the initial schedule for May 2014, an official from the oil and gas regulator told Reuters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Initially we were expecting the project would deliver (full) production in May 2014, but I'm not sure if we can deliver it in May or not ... Probably going up to August or September," said Gde Pradnyana, operations controller at the regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cepu is producing 24,000 barrels per day and its target production of 165,000 is hoped will boost Indonesia's dwindling crude output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pradnyana said Cepu was a top priority for the government, and that its management and delays in production were one of the reasons why the regulator had decided not to extend its assignment for ExxonMobils local CEO, Richard Owen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Fergus Jensen)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp launched new Office software for home users on Tuesday, featuring constantly updated, online access to documents from all kinds of devices as the world's largest software company attempts to tailor its most profitable product to a mobile generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Office suite of applications - including desktop staples Outlook email, Excel, Word and PowerPoint - is aimed at home users rather than businesses, and is designed to extend Microsoft's domination of the workplace to the home office and beat back growing competition from Google Inc's free online apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The notion of an always up-to-date streaming version of Office comes directly from how people are using devices today," said Kurt DelBene, head of Microsoft's Office unit, in a phone interview. "You really want all your content to roam with you. We see that as an opportunity to deliver what customers are asking for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The version of the new software launched on Tuesday, called Office 365 Home Premium, is the first major overhaul of Office since 2010. Big companies, which generally buy Microsoft's software under multi-year contracts, already got the latest features of the new Office in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was the first look for individual customers, and initial reactions were positive at Microsoft's flagship Seattle store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks badass. And that whole touch-screen thing now," said Kouichi Armga, 25, who works at Trader Joe's grocery store and studies at the University of Washington in Tacoma, after seeing the new Office run on touch-screen hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was actually very impressive," said Jeremy Payne, 26, from Olympia, Washington, who works in retail and is studying public relations at the local Evergreen State College. "The biggest thing was the new PowerPoint. I was really excited to see the new PowerPoint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payne, an avowed Apple Inc enthusiast, said the new Office was "really rad," but it might be hard to drag Mac users away from their Apple-centered world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have their work cut out for them pulling people from Apple," he said. "The Apple system is so integrated to my way of thought."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOWNLOAD UPDATES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After downloading the basic programs online, users can access the latest versions of all Office applications from up to five devices on a subscription basis for $100 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software will be updated online, marking a change from the past where users had to wait years for upgrades to installed software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the latest step in what Chief Executive Steve Ballmer called Microsoft's "transformation to a devices and services business," making the company more like Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Office largely adopts the look of last year's Windows 8, with a cleaner, more modern-looking design and includes touch-screen capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "ribbons" showing commands in Word and Excel are mostly unchanged. For the first time the package includes online calling and video service Skype, which Microsoft bought in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users' work can be stored on their devices but also in remote data centers - known as the cloud - and the latest version of a document can accessed from any licensed device with a browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE KILLER?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two and a half years in the making, the new Office is designed to extend Microsoft's domination of the business market and counter the growing popularity of Google Apps, a collection of online-only, Office-style applications Google provides free for home users and sells to businesses for $50 per user per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is hoping its move into online services, alongside its new Surface tablets, will push it into the forefront of mobile computing, which has been led by Google's Android software and Apple's combination of slick hardware and apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft Office remains the gold standard for productivity applications," said Avi Greengart, research director at Current Analysis. "It is bringing Office fully into today's connected, cloud-based environment. But it still has more work to do to make it fully finger-friendly for use on its own Windows tablets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Office will run natively on Microsoft's own Surface tablets - both the 'RT' and Pro versions running on ARM Holdings and Intel Corp chips respectively - but it will not run natively on Apple's iPad, disappointing some iPad users who are also Office fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not said that we will do rich client software on the iPad at this point," said DelBene, although he did not rule out producing such software in the future. "We've been very logical in our approach. I'm pleased with the software we have delivered for the iPad to date," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's SkyDrive online storage system and its OneNote note-taking software are available as iPad apps, and iPad users can use limited Web versions of some Office applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iPad issue has been a long-time quandary for Microsoft, which might gain more mobile users by making Office available on the iPad but would have to give Apple a cut of its subscriptions. Availability of Office on iPads would also take away a major incentive to buying its own competing Surface tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft estimates that 1 billion people worldwide use some part of Office and the unit that produces Office is Microsoft's most profitable, edging out the flagship Windows division for the last few years. It now accounts for more than half of Microsoft's overall profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales dipped last quarter as consumers held off in anticipation of the new Office, but analysts expects sales to ramp up this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the immediate next year or two, this version of Office should help many of the core small and midsize enterprise customers stay with Office," said Al Hilwa at tech research firm IDC. "The value proposition for the consumer space has always stemmed from synergies with the enterprise. I don't think this is going to change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric M.

&lt;p&gt;  EDMONTON, ALBERTA, Jan 29 (MARKET WIRE) --
Serenic Corporation (the "Company" or "Serenic") (TSX VENTURE:SER), an
international software developer specializing in integrated financial
management and human capital management ("HCM") solutions for Non-Profit
organizations, government agencies, and Microsoft Dynamics NAV users,
announces its financial results for the three months and nine months
ended November 30, 2012.

    Volume and Cloud-based Business Model

    In July 2012, Microsoft announced significant changes to their strategies
to market and sell their financial, accounting and enterprise resource
planning software (together, "ERP") products, which will impact Serenic
and its future strategies. Microsoft's expectation is to significantly
increase its penetration within ERP markets, similar to their past
experience in having dominated office automation applications (word
processing, spreadsheet, Power Point, e-mail), data base applications
(Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL), and segments of the customer
relationship management ("CRM") markets. Microsoft's objective is to
deploy its ERP applications to a wider range of customers, from small to
medium size businesses ("SMB") to major enterprise organizations (Fortune
500 and equivalent), and allow customers to utilize on-premise licensed
installations, software-as-a-service ("SaaS" or "Cloud") applications, or
any combination thereof. Microsoft's underlying technologies are designed
to use any browser-enabled device to access these ERP solutions which
feature seamless integration to operating and office systems (e.g., full
integration with Windows 8, Office, SharePoint, CRM etc.) and thereby
result in simplified access and a superior user experience. We expect
these technologies and strategies will provide Serenic with a competitive
advantage.

    In order to accomplish their objectives, Microsoft has initiated
significant changes to its business and sales models. To address the SMB
market, Microsoft is adopting new strategies to achieve much higher
volume sales than has been attained historically. Microsoft has rolled
out a Global Road to Repeatability ("GR2R") program, through which
Microsoft is assisting Serenic and other selected resellers to prepare to
exploit the volume market by revamping products, pricing, lead
generation, marketing, sales, deployment and implementation strategies.
The GR2R model is inclusive of both on-premise and cloud based
deployment. To simplify the purchase experience for new customers,
Microsoft has introduced "Perpetual Product Licensing" with its latest
release of Dynamics NAV. Historically, a customer was provided with
numerous choices regarding inclusion or exclusion of functionality
choices, which resulted in complexities to the purchase process. Now a
prospective client will simply choose between a basic or comprehensive
functionality solution, select the number of users required by their
organization and select whether they wish to use an on-premise or
cloud-based computing environment. Serenic has paralleled this strategy
for its own products, which will be offered commencing with the next
release of Serenic Navigator anticipated in the first half of calendar
2013.

    Serenic's business model has historically been closely aligned with and
an integral part of Microsoft's global eco-system of ERP reseller
partners and service providers. Management believes that Serenic's
go-forward strategies should continue to align with Microsoft's in order
to maximize our opportunities by leveraging Microsoft's global
credibility and market presence within businesses.

    Serenic began to enhance its historical business model in Q2 of Fiscal
2013 by supplementing the traditional on-premise deployment of Serenic
Navigator to larger non-profits and NGOs with a version that management
anticipates will have strong appeal in the SMB market. While management
believes this evolution represents an exciting opportunity for Serenic in
the longer term, it presents some challenges in the shorter term.

    With respect to the SMB market for Serenic products, certain aspects of
our historical operational model will need to be revamped to transition
from the highly consultative and resource intensive approach to a more
prescriptive and automated process that will enable Serenic to engage
more efficiently with a higher volume of new customers while expending
fewer resources. The volume regime mandates lower product and services
pricing, higher automation with respect to marketing and sales processes,
shorter sales cycles, and streamlined deployment, implementation and
training cycles. It also mandates offering cloud-based solutions that are
attuned to this fast growing segment of our markets.

    Serenic's Navigator and HCM products for SMB have been undergoing
re-development during the past few years in anticipation of the imminent
paradigm shift to Microsoft's cloud-based technology and are essentially
ready for deployment under Microsoft's Azure platform. Azure is
Microsoft's new global software hosting program, which is expected to be
released to market by mid calendar 2013. As we progress through adoption
of GR2R, Serenic's products will continue to be modified to simplify
customer decision making and the deployment of our solutions for the
cloud and volume models. As part of this initiative, Serenic has
re-developed DonorVision as a new stand-alone, cloud based product based
on Microsoft CRM, which is anticipated to be released to market within
the next three months. To better address the larger Enterprise customers
on a go-forward basis, Serenic Navigator will be enhanced with
appropriate changes to incorporate new functionality requirements that
have been identified for this market.

    While much work to prepare for the volume model has already been
completed, certain challenges still remain to be resolved. This
transition is expected to be underway for a period of time that is
currently unknown, although Management anticipates some momentum from
cloud- based products within one or two quarters after Microsoft makes
Azure generally available in the market. Until then, we anticipate that
confusion amongst new customers about differences between historical and
GR2R product strategies, pricing and services may delay some new
customers who may elect to wait until all components of the GR2R model
are fully operational before finalizing their buying decisions. Thus, a
segment of Serenic's new customer pipeline may temporarily continue to be
"on hold" pending further progress in this regard. Management anticipates
that future individual sales will be lower in price relative to
historical averages, but also anticipates that revenue and profits
overall will increase once the efficiencies of the GR2R strategy take
hold and the volume of transaction increases.

    The Company has continued to focus on two primary objectives during the
quarter: to maximize organic revenue while implementing the above-noted
significant transition, and to investigate opportunities to enhance
shareholder value. During the quarter, international Serenic Navigator
software license sales improved, while in North America, Serenic
Navigator licenses slowed. HCM license sales remained essentially on par
with the corresponding period last year. The Company announced to its
prospective customers that its new version of Serenic Navigator will be
made available early in calendar 2013, that it has revised pricing and a
greatly simplified ordering process, and has features that are necessary
for the Company's transition to cloud and volume based business models as
discussed in the previous section. Certain prospective clients appear to
be waiting for the new version to be released before making their final
buying decisions, and this was a contributing factor affecting new
license sales and revenue during the quarter. Additionally, the Company
faced increased competition in its market and is therefore taking steps
to refine its sales methodology to improve initial customer engagement.
Client services revenue was also lower in the quarter, as a result of
lower demand for services being heavily dependent upon direct license
sales. Maintenance revenues continued to grow during the quarter, due to
the ongoing addition of new customers and the high renewal rate of
existing maintenance contracts. Additionally, two of the Company's larger
customers elected to retroactively renew maintenance contracts and the
recognition of the lapsed period revenue positively impacted revenue in
the quarter. Recurring maintenance revenue has grown significantly during
the past few years and now comprises approximately 53% of our annual
revenues.

    Expenses remained in line with expectations and budgets. The reduced
revenue resulted in lower than planned gross profit which caused the
Company to record a net loss and negative EBITDA in the quarter. Due to
the operating loss in the quarter, the Company's cash balances reduced to
$3.4 million at quarter-end from $3.8 million at the beginning of the
quarter.

    The Company's marketing group remained very active in generating new
leads. Members of the marketing team, along with members of our senior
management team participated in several seminars hosted by Microsoft, for
the purpose of transitioning to the GR2R business model. Development of
Serenic's new cloud based donor management product based on Microsoft CRM
continued during the quarter, and is anticipated to be released to market
in the first half of calendar 2013. This new offering will be deployed as
a cloud-based solution, and will be marketed both as an integrated module
of Serenic Navigator and as a stand-alone application for organizations
who may not yet be ready to upgrade their existing financial systems.
Management believes that this product will compete strongly with
prevalent high-volume products offered by certain competitors, and that
sales may contribute significantly to our organic growth revenues.

    The Company continued to investigate certain corporate development
initiatives during the quarter, in accordance with the Company's
objective to enhance and realize value for shareholders. The Company also
continued to purchase shares pursuant to its Normal Course Issuer Bid
("NCIB") program, wherein 551,000 shares have been acquired for
cancellation during the current fiscal year through January 3, 2013.

    Outlook

    Management believes that Serenic's pursuit of cloud and volume
strategies, combined with its traditional sale of on-premise software
licenses, represents the best opportunity to deliver maximum value for
Serenic stakeholders over the longer term. Despite the short term
challenges that we expect will continue during the next several quarters,
Management believes that the longer term outlook for Serenic stakeholders
remains very positive. Our strategy for the balance of Fiscal 2013 is to
remain focused on maximizing revenues by operating our historical
business model, while concurrently supplementing it with the GR2R
strategy and continuing to manage resources and risks in a prudent
manner.

    From a corporate development perspective, we intend to continue to pursue
potential scenarios to maximize value for our shareholders beyond what
organic growth would produce. The primary objective remains to be that of
optimizing shareholder value, which might entail a capital structure
change, new strategic ventures, and/or merger and acquisition scenarios.
Management strongly believes that the current market capitalization of
the Company as reflected in its current share price does not adequately
reflect Serenic's fair value, and we intend to take appropriate action
that would best serve the interests of shareholders as soon as a suitable
arrangement can be identified and acted upon.

    We believe the Company remains adequately financed to operate as
anticipated. We continue to be excited about our future opportunities and
remain confident in our belief that our intended course of action will
ultimately result in the achievement of greater value for all of our
stakeholders.

Serenic Aligns With Microsoft's Volume and Cloud Based Business Models;
Reports Results for the Three and Nine Months Ended November 30, 2012

EDMONTON, ALBERTA--(Marketwire - Jan. 29, 2013) - Serenic Corporation (the
"Company" or "Serenic") (TSX VENTURE:SER), an international software developer
specializing in integrated financial management and human capital management
("HCM") solutions for Non-Profit organizations, government agencies, and
Microsoft Dynamics NAV users, announces its financial results for the three
months and nine months ended November 30, 2012.

Volume and Cloud-based Business Model

In July 2012, Microsoft announced significant changes to their strategies to

The Company has continued to focus on two primary objectives during the
quarter: to maximize organic revenue while implementing the above-noted
significant transition, and to investigate opportunities to enhance
shareholder value. During the quarter, international Serenic Navigator
software license sales improved, while in North America, Serenic Navigator
licenses slowed. HCM license sales remained essentially on par with the
corresponding period last year. The Company announced to its prospective
customers that its new version of Serenic Navigator will be made available
early in calendar 2013, that it has revised pricing and a greatly simplified
ordering process, and has features that are necessary for the Company's
transition to cloud and volume based business models as discussed in the
previous section. Certain prospective clients appear to be waiting for the new
version to be released before making their final buying decisions, and this
was a contributing factor affecting new license sales and revenue during the
quarter. Additionally, the Company faced increased competition in its market
and is therefore taking steps to refine its sales methodology to improve
initial customer engagement. Client services revenue was also lower in the
quarter, as a result of lower demand for services being heavily dependent upon
direct license sales. Maintenance revenues continued to grow during the
quarter, due to the ongoing addition of new customers and the high renewal
rate of existing maintenance contracts. Additionally, two of the Company's
larger customers elected to retroactively renew maintenance contracts and the
recognition of the lapsed period revenue positively impacted revenue in the
quarter. Recurring maintenance revenue has grown significantly during the past
few years and now comprises approximately 53% of our annual revenues.

Expenses remained in line with expectations and budgets. The reduced revenue
resulted in lower than planned gross profit which caused the Company to record
a net loss and negative EBITDA in the quarter. Due to the operating loss in
the quarter, the Company's cash balances reduced to $3.4 million at
quarter-end from $3.8 million at the beginning of the quarter.

The Company's marketing group remained very active in generating new leads.
Members of the marketing team, along with members of our senior management
team participated in several seminars hosted by Microsoft, for the purpose of
transitioning to the GR2R business model. Development of Serenic's new cloud
based donor management product based on Microsoft CRM continued during the
quarter, and is anticipated to be released to market in the first half of
calendar 2013. This new offering will be deployed as a cloud-based solution,
and will be marketed both as an integrated module of Serenic Navigator and as
a stand-alone application for organizations who may not yet be ready to
upgrade their existing financial systems. Management believes that this
product will compete strongly with prevalent high-volume products offered by
certain competitors, and that sales may contribute significantly to our
organic growth revenues.

The Company continued to investigate certain corporate development initiatives
during the quarter, in accordance with the Company's objective to enhance and
realize value for shareholders. The Company also continued to purchase shares
pursuant to its Normal Course Issuer Bid ("NCIB") program, wherein 551,000
shares have been acquired for cancellation during the current fiscal year
through January 3, 2013.

Outlook

Management believes that Serenic's pursuit of cloud and volume strategies,
combined with its traditional sale of on-premise software licenses, represents
the best opportunity to deliver maximum value for Serenic stakeholders over
the longer term. Despite the short term challenges that we expect will
continue during the next several quarters, Management believes that the longer
term outlook for Serenic stakeholders remains very positive. Our strategy for
the balance of Fiscal 2013 is to remain focused on maximizing revenues by
operating our historical business model, while concurrently supplementing it
with the GR2R strategy and continuing to manage resources and risks in a
prudent manner.

From a corporate development perspective, we intend to continue to pursue
potential scenarios to maximize value for our shareholders beyond what organic
growth would produce. The primary objective remains to be that of optimizing
shareholder value, which might entail a capital structure change, new
strategic ventures, and/or merger and acquisition scenarios. Management
strongly believes that the current market capitalization of the Company as
reflected in its current share price does not adequately reflect Serenic's
fair value, and we intend to take appropriate action that would best serve the
interests of shareholders as soon as a suitable arrangement can be identified
and acted upon.

We believe the Company remains adequately financed to operate as anticipated.
We continue to be excited about our future opportunities and remain confident
in our belief that our intended course of action will ultimately result in the
achievement of greater value for all of our stakeholders.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - There is a new twist in the London Whale trading scandal that cost JPMorgan Chase $6.2 billion in trading losses last year. Some of the firm's own traders bet against the very derivatives positions placed by its chief investment office, said three people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations, which launched an inquiry into the trading loss last fall, is looking into the how different divisions of the bank wound up on opposite sides of the same trade, said one of the people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee is expected to release a report on its investigation in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people familiar with the situation did not comment on the dollar value of the opposing trades placed by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's (JPM.N) investment bank traders, which was much smaller than the total positions put on by the CIO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intra-bank trading was not mentioned in a 129-page report JPMorgan released on January 16, which chronicled some of the bank's risk management failures. The scandal has led to a number of management changes at JPMorgan and has sullied CEO Jamie Dimon's image as a hands-on risk manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment on the investment bank's trading positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the Senate committee, led by Michigan Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat, declined to comment on its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was widely known that a group of about eight credit-focused hedge funds, such as BlueMountain Capital Management and Saba Capital Management, were on the other side of the trades that JPMorgan's London-based Whale team made on an index tied to corporate default rates. But the role JPMorgan's own investment bank may have played in the messy unwinding of the derivatives trade has not come out until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the three people familiar with the matter claimed that JPMorgan managers discussed merging the two sets of trades in an attempt to offset some of the CIO's losses. Those talks ended about a month before Bloomberg News first reported the CIO trades on April 5 last year, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Lemkau said that this "never came up in our exhaustive internal investigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last July, the bank fired the three London-based traders in the CIO most closely tied to the trading, including Bruno Iksil, dubbed the London Whale by hedge fund traders because of the size of the trades he placed for the CIO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people familiar with Iksil and his boss, Javier Martin-Artajo, said the two CIO employees complained about the investment bank's actions in the spring of 2012, accusing its traders of deliberately trying to move the market against the CIO by leaking information on its position to hedge funds. Iksil made his complaint to a member of JPMorgan's compliance department, one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those same sources said they had not seen any evidence to support that claim and JPMorgan's Lemkau declined to comment on the allegation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for Bruno Iksil declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear when the investment bank traders and the London Whale team became aware they were taking opposing sides on a trade that involved index linked to credit default swaps sold on corporate debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's internal report did note that, in deciding how to handle the CIO trades, JPMorgan eventually applied a valuation methodology from the investment bank and not the one the chief investment officer had been using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal authorities are currently investigating whether some employees in the CIO deliberately used misleading valuations to try to conceal some of the losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for large banks to hold opposing positions in the same market. That is sometimes done as a way of hedging a position or because different trading desks formulate opposing views about a trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the revelation that the bank was taking two sides on the same trade also is likely to rekindle the debate about whether banks such as JPMorgan Chase are too big to manage and should be scaled back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big banks have always had a habit of pitting people in the bank against each other," said Charles Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan College and a former banker. "When it's discovered it's not taken well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of JPMorgan shareholders led by the AFL-CIO labor federation is pushing for a vote at JPMorgan's annual shareholders meeting this spring on reducing it's overall size by spinning off one or more of its businesses. They cite the big trading losses in the London Whale scandal as evidence the bank is too big to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Emily Flitter.; Editing by Matthew Goldstein, Martin Howell and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Chevron filed a new&#160;motion for summary judgment&#160;in its fraud and racketeering case against the lawyers and expert witnesses who helped 47 Ecuadoreans from the Lago Agrio region of the rainforest obtain an $18 billion judgment against the oil company from an Ecuadorean court in 2011. The motion discloses what seems to be incredibly powerful evidence that the Ecuadorean judgment was illegitimate: A onetime presiding judge on the Ecuadorean case, Alberto Guerra, submitted&#160;a declaration&#160;asserting that he acted as the middleman in setting up a $500,000 bribe from plaintiffs lawyers to the Ecuadorean judge who entered the judgment against Chevron. Guerra claimed that the plaintiffs actually drafted the 2011 judgment and that he, as a behind-the-scenes ghostwriter, worked with plaintiffs lawyers to make it seem more like a court ruling. According to his declaration, filed before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan of Manhattan, Guerra had previously received regular payments from the plaintiffs in the Chevron case to ghostwrite other rulings subsequently issued by the presiding judge. And, to boot, Guerra asserted that Chevron  unlike the plaintiffs  didnt respond to his solicitation of bribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron filed additional new evidence to back Guerras declaration, including draft versions of the 2011 judgment found on the former judges computer, mail and bank records showing his contacts with the plaintiffs and sworn statements by other witnesses supposedly involved in the bribery scheme. Guerras testimony and corroborating evidence confirm what the extensive overlap between the (plaintiffs) internal files and the judgment already prove: that the (plaintiffs) corrupted the Ecuadorean court and wrote the $18 billion judgment against Chevron, wrote the oil companys lawyers at&#160;Gibson, Dunn  Crutcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guerra has some credibility issues, since, by his own admission, he was dismissed from the Ecuadorean court and has been in financial straits. His declaration disclosed a payment of $38,000 from Chevron to compensate him for his time and expenses, including the surrender of his computer, flash drives and cell phones. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs and their allies claimed&#160;that isnt all&#160;the former judge received. In a statement, Ecuadorean plaintiffs lawyer Pablo Fajardo said that Guerra previously offered to sell his testimony to his clients but they refused to pay. It always was obvious that Guerra wished to sell himself to the highest bidder, a fact which undermined his credibility and made him a profoundly unreliable witness, Fajardos statement said. The Ecuadoreans also claim (without supporting evidence, from what I can tell) that Chevron is using Guerras testimony to cajole and intimidate other former judges in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These latest disclosures are profoundly disheartening, regardless of which side you believe in this case. If you trust Chevron and the documentary evidence, the plaintiffs bought an $18 billion judgment from Ecuadorean judges. If you believe the plaintiffs, former Ecuadorean jurists are for sale to Chevron. Either way, Im increasingly skeptical that well ever know what happened all those decades ago in Lago Agrio. This case has been under way, in various permutations, in courts in Ecuador and the United States since 1993. There are binary questions at its heart: Either Chevron predecessor Texaco did or did not contaminate the Lago Agrio region and impair the health of its residents. Chevron has been just as adamant in denying liability as the Ecuadoreans have in asserting it. Yet the longer the case progresses, the more elusive an answer seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevrons bulldog lawyers at Gibson Dunn might disagree. Theyd say that with enough time, they will eventually prove all of the misbehavior they suspect of the Ecuadorean plaintiffs and their lawyers. Id counter that theyve been going full bore for about three years, using some of the most ingenious and aggressive litigation tactics ever deployed in a civil case. Chevron also makes no secret of its long-running investigation within Ecuador of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and lawyers. But for all of the resources the company has devoted to discrediting its foes, in court and out, Chevron only recently obtained evidence of Guerras supposed bribe-taking and ghostwriting  even though Guerras declaration asserts that he twice solicited a bribe from a Chevron lawyer in Ecuador. (The declaration does not reveal what, if anything, Chevrons Ecuadorean counsel told the company about Guerras approaches.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time, moreover, may not be on Chevrons side. The Ecuadoreans are pursuing attachment action in Canada and Brazil based on the $18 billion Ecuadorean judgment. (The oil company does not have assets in Ecuador.) Chevron wants Judge Kaplan in New York to rule that the Ecuadorean judgment is a fraud that should be nullified, but even the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, when it vacated a preliminary injunction barring the Ecuadorean plaintiffs from enforcing their judgment against Chevron, expressed concerns about international comity and the application of U.S. rulings in overseas courts. The circumstances are different now, especially with Chevrons new evidence that the Ecuadorean judgment was illegitimately procured, but even if Kaplan grants the companys summary judgment motion, the plaintiffs will likely press international courts to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment while appeals are under way in the United States. Meanwhile, Chevron is in a&#160;nasty court fight&#160;with a major shareholder, the New York State Common Retirement Fund, over whether to settle the Ecuadorean case. The New York pension fund argues that its too expensive and distracting for the company to continue litigating; Chevron responded with an ethics complaint in November against the funds administrator, New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, whom the oil company accuses of accepting campaign contributions from supporters of the Ecuadorean plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ive been writing about litigation long enough that I dont have any illusions about what it can achieve. Litigation doesnt often produce binary answers. Most cases settle because truth lies between the positions espoused by opposing sides. And in most cases, thats a just outcome. But Im not sure a settlement of the Chevron litigation, with all weve come to know about the Ecuadorean case and all that remains to be known, would bring justice to either side. In this case, truth and justice are too intertwined, and I dont believe that continuing to litigate will answer the ultimate question of whether Chevron is responsible for ongoing environmental catastrophe in Ecuador. The Chevron case, more than any other I know, stands as a paradigm not only of how hard two sides can fight but also of how little they can ultimately accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more of my posts, please go to&#160;Thomson Reuters News  Insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter profits as deals, cost cutting and strong sales of new products helped the pharmaceutical companies weather generic competition for once top-selling products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. drugmakers also issued 2013 forecasts on Tuesday that encouraged investors, who sent shares of both companies up more than 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 47 cents per share, topping analysts' average expectations by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. [ID:nL1N0AY1NQ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But global sales for the largest U.S. drugmaker fell 7 percent to $15.1 billion as sales of Lipitor, formerly the world's top selling prescription medicine at nearly $13 billion a year, plunged 71 percent to $584 million. Sales of the cholesterol fighter began tumbling in November 2011, when its U.S. patent expired and cheaper generics flooded the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's quarterly net profit quadrupled to $6.32 billion, or 86 cents per share, due to the November sale of its nutritional products business to Swiss food group Nestle SA (NESN.VX) for about $12 billion. It is also preparing to spin off its animal health business through an initial public offering expected to bring in billions more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the Lipitor expiration is an issue for our investors today," Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview. "We've done what we needed to do and (investors) are focused on the future," he added, referring to the company's decision to spin off the nutritional and animal health units in order to focus on its more-profitable core pharmaceuticals business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer recently won approvals for highly promising new products, including the blood clot preventer Eliquis, which it shares with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), and Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid to late-stage trials, it is testing treatments for cholesterol, psoriasis and numerous types of cancer. Read said Pfizer's biggest priority is developing the drug pipeline and getting the products to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer is doing exactly what you want them to do," said Bill Smead, portfolio manager of Seattle-based Smead Value Fund that owns Pfizer shares. "Pfizer is moving back to their core with a strong balance sheet and a bright future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly's fourth-quarter net profit fell more than 3 percent as sales of its Zyprexa schizophrenia drug - at one time one of the world's top five sellers - fell 49 percent to $385 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding one-time items such as asset impairments and restructuring charges, Lilly earned 85 cents per share, beating analysts' expectations by 7 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly's results and its 2013 forecast were dependent upon aggressive companywide cost controls. Strong sales of other drugs and animal health products helped offset the toll of generic Zyprexa in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are absolutely emerging from the loss of Zyprexa," Lilly Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice said in an interview.

&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer sees 2013 EPS $2.20-$2.30 excluding items&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Lilly sees 2013 EPS $3.82 to $3.97&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer, Lilly shares close up 3.2 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 29 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co
 reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter profits as
deals, cost cutting and strong sales of new products helped the
pharmaceutical companies weather generic competition for once
top-selling products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. drugmakers also issued 2013 forecasts on Tuesday
that encouraged investors, who sent shares of both companies up
more than 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 47 cents per share,
topping analysts' average expectations by 3 cents, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But global sales for the largest U.S. drugmaker fell 7
percent to $15.1 billion as sales of Lipitor, formerly the
world's top selling prescription medicine at nearly $13 billion
a year, plunged 71 percent to $584 million. Sales of the
cholesterol fighter began tumbling in November 2011, when its
U.S. patent expired and cheaper generics flooded the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's quarterly net profit quadrupled to $6.32 billion,
or 86 cents per share, due to the November sale of its
nutritional products business to Swiss food group Nestle SA
 for about $12 billion. It is also preparing to spin
off its animal health business through an initial public
offering expected to bring in billions more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the Lipitor expiration is an issue for our
investors today," Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview.
"We've done what we needed to do and (investors) are focused on
the future," he added, referring to the company's decision to
spin off the nutritional and animal health units in order to
focus on its more-profitable core pharmaceuticals business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer recently won approvals for highly promising new
products, including the blood clot preventer Eliquis, which it
shares with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, and Xeljanz for
rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid to late-stage trials, it is testing treatments for
cholesterol, psoriasis and numerous types of cancer. Read said
Pfizer's biggest priority is developing the drug pipeline and
getting the products to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer is doing exactly what you want them to do," said
Bill Smead, portfolio manager of Seattle-based Smead Value Fund
that owns Pfizer shares. "Pfizer is moving back to their core
with a strong balance sheet and a bright future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly's fourth-quarter net profit fell more than 3 percent
as sales of its Zyprexa schizophrenia drug - at one time one of
the world's top five sellers - fell 49 percent to $385 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding one-time items such as asset impairments and
restructuring charges, Lilly earned 85 cents per share, beating
analysts' expectations by 7 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly's results and its 2013 forecast were dependent upon
aggressive companywide cost controls. Strong sales of other
drugs and animal health products helped offset the toll of
generic Zyprexa in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are absolutely emerging from the loss of Zyprexa," Lilly
Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice said in an interview. "We
feel good where we are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company is facing yet another daunting patent cliff
at the end of this year when its best-selling product, the
antidepressant Cymbalta, begins to face generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're negotiating the Zyprexa patent cliff pretty well by
keeping costs down, but the question is whether they can keep
tightening the belt to offset the patent expiration on
Cymbalta," said Judson Clark, an analyst for Edward Jones. "It's

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp launched new Office software for home users on Tuesday, featuring constantly updated, online access to documents from all kinds of devices as the world's largest software company attempts to tailor its most profitable product to a mobile generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Office suite of applications - including desktop staples Outlook email, Excel, Word and PowerPoint - is aimed at home users rather than businesses, and is designed to extend Microsoft's domination of the workplace to the home office and beat back growing competition from Google Inc's free online apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The notion of an always up-to-date streaming version of Office comes directly from how people are using devices today," said Kurt DelBene, head of Microsoft's Office unit, in a phone interview. "You really want all your content to roam with you. We see that as an opportunity to deliver what customers are asking for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The version of the new software launched on Tuesday, called Office 365 Home Premium, is the first major overhaul of Office since 2010. Big companies, which generally buy Microsoft's software under multi-year contracts, already got the latest features of the new Office in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was the first look for individual customers, and initial reactions were positive at Microsoft's flagship Seattle store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks badass. And that whole touch-screen thing now," said Kouichi Armga, 25, who works at Trader Joe's grocery store and studies at the University of Washington in Tacoma, after seeing the new Office run on touch-screen hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was actually very impressive," said Jeremy Payne, 26, from Olympia, Washington, who works in retail and is studying public relations at the local Evergreen State College. "The biggest thing was the new PowerPoint. I was really excited to see the new PowerPoint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payne, an avowed Apple Inc enthusiast, said the new Office was "really rad," but it might be hard to drag Mac users away from their Apple-centered world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have their work cut out for them pulling people from Apple," he said. "The Apple system is so integrated to my way of thought."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOWNLOAD UPDATES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After downloading the basic programs online, users can access the latest versions of all Office applications from up to five devices on a subscription basis for $100 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software will be updated online, marking a change from the past where users had to wait years for upgrades to installed software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the latest step in what Chief Executive Steve Ballmer called Microsoft's "transformation to a devices and services business," making the company more like Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Office largely adopts the look of last year's Windows 8, with a cleaner, more modern-looking design and includes touch-screen capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "ribbons" showing commands in Word and Excel are mostly unchanged. For the first time the package includes online calling and video service Skype, which Microsoft bought in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users' work can be stored on their devices but also in remote data centers - known as the cloud - and the latest version of a document can accessed from any licensed device with a browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE KILLER?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two and a half years in the making, the new Office is designed to extend Microsoft's domination of the business market and counter the growing popularity of Google Apps, a collection of online-only, Office-style applications Google provides free for home users and sells to businesses for $50 per user per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is hoping its move into online services, alongside its new Surface tablets, will push it into the forefront of mobile computing, which has been led by Google's Android software and Apple's combination of slick hardware and apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft Office remains the gold standard for productivity applications," said Avi Greengart, research director at Current Analysis. "It is bringing Office fully into today's connected, cloud-based environment. But it still has more work to do to make it fully finger-friendly for use on its own Windows tablets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Office will run natively on Microsoft's own Surface tablets - both the 'RT' and Pro versions running on ARM Holdings and Intel Corp chips respectively - but it will not run natively on Apple's iPad, disappointing some iPad users who are also Office fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not said that we will do rich client software on the iPad at this point," said DelBene, although he did not rule out producing such software in the future. "We've been very logical in our approach. I'm pleased with the software we have delivered for the iPad to date," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's SkyDrive online storage system and its OneNote note-taking software are available as iPad apps, and iPad users can use limited Web versions of some Office applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iPad issue has been a long-time quandary for Microsoft, which might gain more mobile users by making Office available on the iPad but would have to give Apple a cut of its subscriptions. Availability of Office on iPads would also take away a major incentive to buying its own competing Surface tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft estimates that 1 billion people worldwide use some part of Office and the unit that produces Office is Microsoft's most profitable, edging out the flagship Windows division for the last few years. It now accounts for more than half of Microsoft's overall profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales dipped last quarter as consumers held off in anticipation of the new Office, but analysts expects sales to ramp up this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the immediate next year or two, this version of Office should help many of the core small and midsize enterprise customers stay with Office," said Al Hilwa at tech research firm IDC. "The value proposition for the consumer space has always stemmed from synergies with the enterprise. I don't think this is going to change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric M.

SAN RAMON, Calif., Jan. 29, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ArmaninoLLP (www.amllp.com
http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ctr?d=10019278=1=www.amllp.com=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amllp.com%2F
) - the 35th largest accounting and business consulting firm in the United States and a provider
of an integrated set of audit, tax, consulting and technology solutions to a wide range of
organizations operating both in the U.S. and globally - today announced it has strengthened its
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) consulting practice by merging in Gradient Vision, a
consulting services company specializing in Dynamics CRM and SharePoint technology solutions from
Microsoft as well as solutions from other providers. Details of the transaction, which was
completed earlier this month, are undisclosed.

Joining Armanino is Gradient Vision Founder Rajya Bhaiya, an industry thought leader and co-author
of a popular series of books on Microsoft CRM entitled "Microsoft Dynamics CRM Unleashed" and
"Microsoft Dynamics CRM Integration Unleashed." Bhaiya is a recognized expert on collaboration,
client portals, intranet/extranet networks, workflow and document management.

"Raj is a national leader in cloud-based applications and our clients will be able to leverage his
knowledge to improve their sales, marketing and web-portal processes in a wide variety of
industries," says Scott Mangelson, Armanino's CRM practice leader. "His depth of knowledge around
Microsoft CRM, as well as SharePoint and Office 365, will enable our clients to increase
productivity, reduce overhead and increase efficiencies in their own businesses."

The transaction made sense because of close alignment between Armanino and Gradient Vision, says
Tom Mescall, partner-in-charge of Armanino's consulting practice. "Our client bases are very
complimentary and Gradient Vision has resources and relationships that strengthen our own CRM
practice."

The addition of SharePoint expertise augments the Armanino product line, Mescall adds. "SharePoint
is a great technology for businesses that have collaborative cultures," he says. "It dramatically
reduces or eliminates many cumbersome processes that inhibit productivity and extends
collaboration between employees, supply chains and sales channels."

Microsoft SharePoint is scalable and easily integrated into back and front end applications both
at customer location and in the cloud, notes Mangelson. "Adding this solution to our suite of
Microsoft products rounds out our Microsoft Dynamics (ERP and CRM) cloud offerings and allows us
to offer manufacturing, sales and marketing organizations a great space to organize unstructured
data and yet another way to do more with less in driving revenue growth."

Mangelson notes that many of Gradient Vision's customers, as well as business partners, will be
integrated into the Armanino business model. The deal "broadens our footprint and delivers
additional, highly competent resources to our CRM practice."

&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer, Lilly 4th-quarter profit top Street view&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer sees 2013 EPS $2.20-$2.30 excluding items&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Lilly sees 2013 EPS $3.82 to $3.97&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Pfizer shares up 3 percent; Lilly shares up 3.6 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 29 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co
 both reported a better-than-expected fourth-quarter
profit as they weathered generic competition for once
top-selling products through deals, cost cutting and strong
sales of newer products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. drugmakers also issued 2013 forecasts on Tuesday
that passed muster with investors, sending shares of both
companies up about 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 47 cents per share,
topping analysts' average expectations by 3 cents, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But global sales for the largest U.S. drugmaker fell 7
percent to $15.1 billion as sales of Lipitor, formerly the
world's top selling prescription medicine at nearly $13 billion
a year for Pfizer, plunged 71 percent to $584 million with the
market flooded by cheaper generic copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's net profit quadrupled to $6.32 billion, or 86 cents
per share, due to the November sale of its nutritional products
business to Swiss food group Nestle SA for about $12
billion. It is also preparing to spin off its animal health
business through an initial public offering expected to bring in
billions more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer is doing exactly what you want them to do," said
Bill Smead, portfolio manager of Seattle-based Smead Value Fund
that owns Pfizer shares. "Pfizer is moving back to their core
with a strong balance sheet and a bright future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly's fourth-quarter net profit fell more than 3 percent
as sales of its Zyprexa schizophrenia drug - at one time one of
the world's top five sellers - fell 49 percent to $385 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding one-time items such as asset impairments and
restructuring charges, Lilly earned 85 cents per share, beating
analysts' expectations by 7 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly's results and its 2013 forecast were dependent upon
aggressive companywide cost controls. Strong sales of other
drugs and animal health products helped offset the toll of
generic Zyprexa in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are absolutely emerging from the loss of Zyprexa," Lilly
Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice said in an interview. "We
feel good where we are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company is facing yet another daunting patent cliff
at the end of this year when its current biggest product, the
antidepressant Cymbalta, begins to face generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're negotiating the Zyprexa patent cliff pretty well by
keeping costs down, but the question is whether they can keep
tightening the belt to offset the patent expiration on
Cymbalta," said Judson Clark, an analyst for Edward Jones. "It's
a $6 billion a year drug, and a tough act to follow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly updated the 2013 earnings forecast it issued earlier
this month, which was better than Wall Street estimates, to
include 7 cents per share from a delayed research and
development tax credit. It now expects to earn $3.82 to $3.97
per share, which represents growth of 13 percent to 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer forecast 2013 earnings of $2.20 to $2.30 per share,
excluding special items, with a midpoint below the average
analyst estimate of $2.29 per share, according to Thomson
Reuters. Pfizer earned $2.19 a share in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer earnings were propped up by rebounding sales in
emerging markets, which rose 17 percent to $2.65 billion, and
strong sales of its Prevnar vaccine for pneumococcal bacteria,
which jumped 19 percent to $993 million. It also recently won
approvals for highly promising new products, including the blood
clot preventer Eliquis, which it shares with Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co, and Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As they pare away non-pharmaceuticals businesses, that will
allow Pfizer's drug pipeline to shine even more because it will
represent a bigger portion of the company going forward," Clark
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smead likes the U.S. pharmaceutical sector as a whole.    
"The best business over next 20 years is keeping baby boomers
alive and keeping their animals alive," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 83 cents, or 3 percent, at $27.67,
while Lilly shares rose $1.92, or 3.6 percent, to $54.56 in
midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Mac Management Plug-in Leverages Parallels Cross-Platform Expertise and Extends
Microsoft System Center Capabilities for Rapid Implementation and Lifecycle
Management of Macs across Enterprise Environments
RENTON, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Parallels&#174; today announced Parallels Management, a plug-in for Microsoft System
Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) that lets enterprises extend System Center
capabilities to efficiently and cost-effectively manage the growing number of
Macs on their network. Parallels Management extends System Center to become a
universal and complete cross-platform solution for managing both Macs and PCs,
as well as virtual machines running on Macs. This new software adds to the
growing list of cross-platform solutions Parallels offers that are paving the
way for Macs in business environments - including Parallels Desktop for Mac
Enterprise Edition. 

This first component of the Parallels Management Suite enables CIOs and IT
administrators to solve the problem of full Mac management, letting enterprises
leverage the existing infrastructure and extend it to Macs without costly build
out, as well as giving them the power to gain complete control of the Macs on
their network. 

"IT departments are experiencing the growing reality of Macs across their
networks. In response to demands of CIOs and IT managers who need better control
and more cost-effective answers, we delivered a complete and seamless solution
that leverages existing IT investments in infrastructure, resources and talent,"
said Birger Steen, CEO of Parallels. "As the industry experts and innovators in
making Windows and Mac work well together, we are delighted with the industry
response." 

As Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and Choose Your Own Device (CYOD) grow from a
bleeding-edge trend to becoming a mainstream reality, the number of Apple
devices showing up in enterprises is growing, yet the management and tools for
securing those devices are lagging behind. A Parallels survey, at
www.appleintheworkplace.com, of more than 500 IT and knowledge workers revealed
that less than 30 percent of workers get automatic software updates distributed
to their Macs, and that more than 42 percent of large companies have no system
or tools in place for Mac security and management - exposing potential security
risks. 

"Parallels solutions allow IT organizations to build stronger partnerships with
business units that require varied IT resources and support in order to increase
productivity," according to Rob Young, IDC Research Manager, Client Device and
IT Service Management Software. "Parallels proven cross-platform capabilities
make its new Parallels Management Suite for Microsoft System Center
Configuration Manager a promising solution for CIOs and IT managers who need to
control their Macs and want to leverage their existing infrastructure management
software." 

According to a January 2012 Forrester blog by analyst Frank Gillett entitled
"Apple Infiltrates the Enterprise: 1/5 of Global Info Workers Use Apple Products
For Work!," in early 2012, 21 percent of information workers used Apple devices
at work, and almost half of all enterprises were issuing Macs to at least some
employees - numbers that are only expected to grow in 2013. Further underscoring
the need for the Parallels Management plug-in as a viable and necessary
solution, a January 2013 Forrester report1 on the latest version of Microsoft
System Center concludes, "[System Center] does not yet manage hosted virtual
desktops or Macs effectively," and, "In a heterogeneous, virtualized world firms
should look to best-of-breed tools for non-Windows or virtualized clients."
1(Product Spotlight: Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2012,
Forrester Research, Inc., January 2013) 

"Employees bringing Macs to work or choosing them at work, while great for them,
presents real challenges for IT departments as they are faced with supporting a
platform that System Center cannot effectively handle on its own. I`ve seen this
time and time again throughout my career - previously in my IT leadership roles
at Yahoo! and Access Systems Inc., and even now at Parallels," said Parallels
Chief Information Officer Christopher McLaughlin-Brooks. "The option of building
out Mac-only management is far too expensive; ideally IT leaders need
centralized processes, tools, and a single team that can manage everything
easily. The Parallels Management solution solves that problem." 

With Parallels Management, CIOs and IT administrators can:

* Manage and control Macs by leveraging their existing Microsoft SCCM
infrastructure, resources and talent 
* Gain full visibility into the Macs coming onto their networks, both those they
know about and those they don`t 
* Gain control and take action on those devices the same as they would with PCs
- all while working within the same environment they are accustomed to 
* Easily leverage Mac technologies to have complete security on their Macs 
* Leverage Parallels Desktop for Mac Enterprise Edition to deploy and manage
policy-compliant Windows stack to Macs, which is key for employees who need
Windows OS on their desktops and laptops to run mission-critical Windows-only
applications

Additional Information

At the upcoming MacIT Conference, Parallels will demonstrate its full suite of
Mac enterprise solutions and will host an interactive session on BYOD and what
IT departments need to do to gain control of Macs. MacIT is an event co-located
with Macworld, and is held in the Moscone Center in San Francisco from January
31 - February 2. 

Parallels launched the Apple-in-the-Workplace Barometer, a crowd-sourced project
for gauging where companies stand in terms of BYOD Mac adoption and support.

learning about and implementing Macs in the enterprise by taking the survey at

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) today announced additional donations totaling $900,000
to nonprofits that are dedicated to helping people and small businesses continue
their recovery; many by providing assistance to access available funding and
obtain financial assistance for losses caused by Superstorm Sandy. This donation
is part of the firm's previously announced $5 million charitable commitment to
help revive communities impacted by the devastation of the storm this past
October. 

"Many people in New York and New Jersey are still coping with damage from Storm
Sandy, some still unable to move back into their homes. Their once-beautiful
tree-lined streets are now barren, and many areas still have a lot of cleaning
up to do before they can even begin to rebuild," said Peter Scher, Executive
Vice President and Head of Corporate Responsibility, JPMorgan Chase. "At
JPMorgan Chase, we recognize the importance of continuing to provide assistance
as the recovery efforts continue, and are proud to support these local nonprofit
organizations, as they continue to work every day toward helping to rebuild our
communities." 

Nine organizations and initiatives working in the New York/New Jersey region
will receive grants as follows:

* Operation Hope ($400,000) will help those affected by Superstorm Sandy
complete FEMA and insurance claims and access available financial resources.
Operation Hope will also use the funds to continue providing support for these
individuals after their applications have been submitted and provide long-term
financial planning assistance as they begin rebuilding their finances. JPMorgan
Chase employees will also volunteer their time and expertise to help provide
these services. 
* All Hands Volunteers ($75,000) will use the funds from JPMorgan Chase to
purchase vehicles and needed equipment, which will make it possible for the
organization to provide mold remediation and gutting services to more homes in
areas affected by the superstorm. 
* The Bridge Fund of New York Inc. ($75,000) will use this funding to provide
needed financial support to working underserved families in Westchester. 
* Long Island Housing Partnership ($75,000) will conduct assessments and provide
100 grants for repair or replacement of hot water heaters and furnaces to
lower-income homeowners who do not receive funding from FEMA. 
* Sandy Aftermath Fund for Economic Recovery (SAFER Fund) ($75,000) will
allocate funding from JPMorgan Chase to agencies in New Jersey that provide
essential services for emergency relief and recovery, such as emergency repairs,
replacement automobile purchases, rent and relocation assistance, and grants to
nonprofits for the purchase and distribution of emergency goods. 
* Accion New York ($50,000) will use these funds to provide capital to
microenterprises that were ineligible for funding from public sources. Accion
experienced a dramatic increase in applications as a result of an increase in
referrals from New York City`s Small Business Services, and this grant will
enable it to support the small businesses still in need of emergency capital for
business continuity and restoration. This grant succeeds a $250,000-gift that
JPMorgan Chase made to Accion as part of its earlier round of grants to provide
relief from Superstorm Sandy. 
* Empire State Relief Fund, Hurricane Sandy New Jersey Relief Fund, and Mayor`s
Fund to Advance New York City ($50,000 each) will use the capital toward
addressing the most pressing needs of communities affected by the storm,
including housing and small business recovery.

"We know from our experience in homelessness prevention over the past two
decades, that the after effects of a disaster like Superstorm Sandy will have a
long-term impact on working poor families across our region. We are now
assisting the secondary victims of the storm who fell behind in their rent due
to lost wages and extraordinary storm-related expenses. These secondary effects
of the disaster will take months to resolve, and we thank JPMorgan Chase for
their foresight to help reinforce this safety net for working poor families and
individuals trying to hold on to affordable apartments," said Barbara Hayes,
Chief Executive Officer, The Bridge Fund of New York Inc. 

"JPMorgan Chase is an outstanding partner with an incredible team that truly
understands that partnership, collaboration, funding and volunteer people power
is the true model for successful long-term financial recovery for Sandy
survivors and HOPE is honored to partner with them," said Mary Hagerty Ehrsam,
Chief Executive Officer, Operation HOPE (HOPE) New York Market. "Project Restore
HOPE, with JPMorgan Chase's support, will empower thousands of families and
small businesses in NY and NJ to get back on track financially and stay strong
as they recover through economic triage, financial guidance, and long-term
planning. HOPE is committed to coordinating every possible resource available to
support a full recovery. Working in partnership with government, community, and
the private sector, we will help restore hope and rebuild lives." 

In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, JPMorgan Chase was one of the first
companies to announce it would offer disaster relief, with up to $5 billion of
support for small businesses and $5 million in charitable relief. The firm
recently sponsored an event to restore photos for families whose pictures were

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) today announced additional donations totaling $900,000
to nonprofits that are dedicated to helping people and small businesses continue
their recovery; many by providing assistance to access available funding and
obtain financial assistance for losses caused by Superstorm Sandy. This donation
is part of the firm's previously announced $5 million charitable commitment to
help revive communities impacted by the devastation of the storm this past
October. 

"Many people in New York and New Jersey are still coping with damage from Storm
Sandy, some still unable to move back into their homes. Their once-beautiful
tree-lined streets are now barren, and many areas still have a lot of cleaning
up to do before they can even begin to rebuild," said Peter Scher, Executive
Vice President and Head of Corporate Responsibility, JPMorgan Chase. "At
JPMorgan Chase, we recognize the importance of continuing to provide assistance
as the recovery efforts continue, and are proud to support these local nonprofit
organizations, as they continue to work every day toward helping to rebuild our
communities." 

Nine organizations and initiatives working in the New York/New Jersey region
will receive grants as follows:

* Operation Hope ($400,000) will help those affected by Superstorm Sandy
complete FEMA and insurance claims and access available financial resources.
Operation Hope will also use the funds to continue providing support for these
individuals after their applications have been submitted and provide long-term
financial planning assistance as they begin rebuilding their finances. JPMorgan
Chase employees will also volunteer their time and expertise to help provide
these services. 
* All Hands Volunteers ($75,000) will use the funds from JPMorgan Chase to
purchase vehicles and needed equipment, which will make it possible for the
organization to provide mold remediation and gutting services to more homes in
areas affected by the superstorm. 
* The Bridge Fund of New York Inc. ($75,000) will use this funding to provide
needed financial support to working underserved families in Westchester. 
* Long Island Housing Partnership ($75,000) will conduct assessments and provide
100 grants for repair or replacement of hot water heaters and furnaces to
lower-income homeowners who do not receive funding from FEMA. 
* Sandy Aftermath Fund for Economic Recovery (SAFER Fund) ($75,000) will
allocate funding from JPMorgan Chase to agencies in New Jersey that provide
essential services for emergency relief and recovery, such as emergency repairs,
replacement automobile purchases, rent and relocation assistance, and grants to
nonprofits for the purchase and distribution of emergency goods. 
* Accion New York ($50,000) will use these funds to provide capital to
microenterprises that were ineligible for funding from public sources. Accion
experienced a dramatic increase in applications as a result of an increase in
referrals from New York City`s Small Business Services, and this grant will
enable it to support the small businesses still in need of emergency capital for
business continuity and restoration. This grant succeeds a $250,000-gift that
JPMorgan Chase made to Accion as part of its earlier round of grants to provide
relief from Superstorm Sandy. 
* Empire State Relief Fund, Hurricane Sandy New Jersey Relief Fund, and Mayor`s
Fund to Advance New York City ($50,000 each) will use the capital toward
addressing the most pressing needs of communities affected by the storm,
including housing and small business recovery.

"We know from our experience in homelessness prevention over the past two
decades, that the after effects of a disaster like Superstorm Sandy will have a
long-term impact on working poor families across our region. We are now
assisting the secondary victims of the storm who fell behind in their rent due
to lost wages and extraordinary storm-related expenses. These secondary effects
of the disaster will take months to resolve, and we thank JPMorgan Chase for
their foresight to help reinforce this safety net for working poor families and
individuals trying to hold on to affordable apartments," said Barbara Hayes,
Chief Executive Officer, The Bridge Fund of New York Inc. 

"JPMorgan Chase is an outstanding partner with an incredible team that truly
understands that partnership, collaboration, funding and volunteer people power
is the true model for successful long-term financial recovery for Sandy
survivors and HOPE is honored to partner with them," said Mary Hagerty Ehrsam,
Chief Executive Officer, Operation HOPE (HOPE) New York Market. "Project Restore
HOPE, with JPMorgan Chase's support, will empower thousands of families and
small businesses in NY and NJ to get back on track financially and stay strong
as they recover through economic triage, financial guidance, and long-term
planning. HOPE is committed to coordinating every possible resource available to
support a full recovery. Working in partnership with government, community, and
the private sector, we will help restore hope and rebuild lives." 

In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, JPMorgan Chase was one of the first
companies to announce it would offer disaster relief, with up to $5 billion of
support for small businesses and $5 million in charitable relief. The firm
recently sponsored an event to restore photos for families whose pictures were
damaged by the storm. It also dispatched food trucks into the hardest hit areas
of New York City and launched food drives to get food to the hungry, brought
ATMs into severely affected areas to help residents access funds, waived fees
for customers, reopened branches quickly and allowed anyone to charge their
electronic devices, and accepted donations to the American Red Cross through its
Rewards program and ATMs. The firm also organized programs for employees to
volunteer in hard-hit communities and help their colleagues through an
employee-to-employee fund.

EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
VoiceVault announces that their voice biometric identity verification solution
is verified by Microsoft as having the ability to handle at least 1 billion
authentication sessions per year.

This is a significant initiative in that it further establishes VoiceVault as an
industry leader providing enterprise solutions that meet rigid standards of
scalability, availability, and audit trailing.These standards are possible while
providing business continuity and security that is designed into call center and
smart device solutions.With the ability to handle a 1 billion biometric session
throughput rate, the customer`s cost savings are considerable when utilizing a
voice biometric identity verification solution as less hardware is needed to
achieve identity verification response time goals.

This level of performance and scalability is an important VoiceVault
distinguisher and demonstrates that the voice biometric component of a call
center solution or smart device app will never be a bottleneck. The high volume
capacity is enabled by Microsoft SQL Server 2012, a key architecture component
of VoiceVault voice biometric identity verification solutions.

"As a voice biometric solution provider, it's vital that we have high levels of
throughput designed-in," said Nick Wise, CTO for VoiceVault."Identity
verification is a key component in enterprise solutions and our customers expect
it to perform at the highest levels. We're proud to be working with Microsoft in
ensuring that voice biometrics is never a bottleneck."

About VoiceVault

VoiceVault is a private voice biometric company that focuses exclusively on the
development and deployment of voice biometric solutions in the financial and
healthcare sectors. VoiceVault is a US based company (El Segundo, CA) with an
R center in the UK.

VoiceVault's solutions use an individual`s vocal characteristics for biometric
identity verification over the phone, web, or via mobile and smart device
applications. They rely on the simple fact that speaking is completely natural
and effortless and that no two voices are exactly the same. They enable the
delivery of data and application access control; transaction authorization;
identity verification; e-signature provision and out of band authentication
solutions.

Biometric voice-based solutions enable business processes to enhance multifactor
authentication with something you are - your voice.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Tuesday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, helped by rebounding sales in emerging markets, but the drugmaker forecast that 2013 profits would be weaker than Wall Street has estimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, said quarterly earnings quadrupled to $6.32 billion, or 86 cents per share, as it recorded a gain from selling its nutritional products business to Swiss food groups Nestle SA (NESN.VX) for about $12 billion in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year-earlier quarter, it posted a profit of $1.44 billion, or 19 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 47 cents per share in the quarter. Analysts, on average, expected 44 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global company sales fell 7 percent to $15.1 billion, hurt by generic competition for its Lipitor cholesterol fighter, but came in well above expectations of $14.37 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer forecast full-year 2013 earnings of $2.20 to $2.30 per share, excluding special items. The average analyst estimate was $2.29 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer's 2013 forecast is a little lighter than expected, but won't cause me to lose sleep," said Judson Clark, an analyst with Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the forecast would have been 2 cents per share higher, and roughly in line with expectations, if not for expenses related to a planned spinoff of its animal health business into a new company called Zoetis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark said he has a "buy" rating on the Pfizer shares because of its strong pipeline of experimental drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is on a roll with recent approvals of a handful of new products that could help it rebound from plunging sales of Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include a blood clot preventer called Eliquis - co-developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) and approved in late December - that analysts believe could eventually claim annual sales of $5 billion or more. Xeljanz, a pill for rheumatoid arthritis deemed likely to generate annual sales of more than $2 billion, was approved by U.S. regulators in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares have risen 26 percent in the last year, compared with 19 percent for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers, largely because of the turnaround in its long-anemic drug pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have also warmed to Pfizer because of its ongoing efforts to spin off non-pharmaceutical operations and return much of the proceeds to investors in the form of bigger dividends and repurchases of common shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the heels of selling its nutrition business, Pfizer is expected within days to raise more than $2.2 billion through an initial public offering that will separate its animal health unit into a new company called Zoetis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in November approved an additional $10 billion in share repurchases, after having repurchased almost $6 billion in shares in 2012 through an earlier $10 billion authorization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth quarter company sales in emerging markets rose 17 percent to $2.65 billion, in contrast with a slight decline in the prior quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Lipitor sales plunged 71 percent in the quarter to $584 million, but that was offset by strong sales of other medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of its Prevnar vaccine against pneumococcal bacteria jumped 19 percent to $993 million, helping ease concerns about weak sales in earlier quarters. Sales of Celebrex, used to ease pain from arthritis, rose 12 percent to $750 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares rose 2.3 percent, or about 63 cents, to $27.45 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Estados Unidos, 29 jan (Reuters) - A Microsoft
 lan&#231;ou nova vers&#227;o do Office nesta ter&#231;a-feira,
oferecendo acesso online constantemente atualizado a documentos
por meio de m&#250;ltiplos aparelhos, como parte da tentativa da
maior produtora mundial de software de adaptar seu produto mais
lucrativo &#224; gera&#231;&#227;o m&#243;vel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O novo pacote Office de aplicativos &#233; a primeira
reformula&#231;&#227;o do produto desde 2010 e o objetivo &#233; superar a
concorr&#234;ncia dos aplicativos online gratuitos do Google
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A ideia de uma vers&#227;o sempre atualizada do Office veio
diretamente das pessoas que usam aparelhos m&#243;veis hoje", disse
Kurt DelBene, diretor da divis&#227;o Microsoft Office, em entrevista
por telefone. "O usu&#225;rio quer que o conte&#250;do o acompanhe aonde
v&#225;. Para n&#243;s, &#233; uma oportunidade de dar aos clientes o que eles
querem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vers&#227;o do software voltada a consumidores, o Office 365
Home Premium, chegou ao mercado nesta ter&#231;a-feira. Depois de
baixar os programas b&#225;sicos online, o usu&#225;rio ter&#225; acesso a
vers&#245;es atualizadas de todos os aplicativos Office em at&#233; cinco
aparelhos, pagando uma assinatura anual de 100 d&#243;lares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O software ser&#225; atualizado online, o que representa uma
mudan&#231;a da pol&#237;tica anterior, em que os usu&#225;rios esperavam anos
para ter atualiza&#231;&#245;es dos softwares instalados. O novo Office
adota o estilo do Windows 8, lan&#231;ado no ano passado, com design
mais moderno e suporte a telas sens&#237;veis a toques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As "fitas" que mostram os comandos do Word e Excel n&#227;o
mudaram muito. Pela primeira vez, o pacote inclui o servi&#231;o
online de telefonia e v&#237;deo Skype, adquirido pela Microsoft em
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O trabalho dos usu&#225;rios pode ser armazenado em centrais
remotas de processamento - "na nuvem" - e a mais recente vers&#227;o
do documento ser&#225; acessada por meio de qualquer aparelho
licenciado e dotado de navegador com o qual o usu&#225;rio deseje
trabalhar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DE OLHO NO GOOGLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O novo Office foi desenvolvido durante dois anos e meio e
tem por objetivo combater a crescente popularidade do Google
Apps, uma cole&#231;&#227;o de aplicativos dispon&#237;veis apenas online e
semelhantes ao Office que o Google oferece gratuitamente a
usu&#225;rios dom&#233;sticos e vende a empresas por 50 d&#243;lares por
usu&#225;rio por ano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"O lan&#231;amento do Ofice 365 hoje marca um grande passo na
transforma&#231;&#227;o da Microsoft para neg&#243;cios voltados a dispositivos
e oferta de servi&#231;os", disse Steve Ballmer, presidente-executivo
da Microsoft, em comunicado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A oferta do Office 365 para empresas, principal mercado da
Microsoft, j&#225; come&#231;ou, apesar do lan&#231;amento oficial estar
marcado para 27 de fevereiro. Os novos aplicativos do Office
est&#227;o dispon&#237;veis para um grande n&#250;mero de clientes empresariais
desde dezembro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft estima que 1 bilh&#227;o de pessoas no mundo usam
alguma parte do Office e a unidade respons&#225;vel pelo pacote &#233; a
mais lucrativa da companhia, gerando mais da metade do lucro da
empresa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As vendas do Office ca&#237;ram no &#250;ltimo trimestre diante da
espera dos consumidores pela nova vers&#227;o, mas analistas esperam
que as vendas se recuperem neste trimestre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A Microsoft vinha sendo criticada n&#227;o apenas pelo pre&#231;o,
mas tamb&#233;m por n&#227;o inovar o Office rapidamente e por ser lenta
em responder ao movimento da Web ou dos dispositivos m&#243;veis",
afirmou Michael Silver, analista da empresa de pesquisa do
mercado de tecnologia Gartner. "O Office 2013 atende parte das
cr&#237;ticas e a Microsoft ainda tem poder para manter seus n&#237;veis
de pre&#231;os."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Por Bill Rigby)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REUTERS AAJ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Deal faces opposition from local councils, far-right group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Ukraine hopes shale gas will ease its dependence on Russia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIEV Jan 29 (Reuters) - Ukraine has removed a self-imposed
May 2013 deadline on signing a shale gas deal with energy major
Chevron which faces scrutiny in local councils dominated
by opposition groups, a government document showed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Soviet republic is seeking to ease its dependence
on costly natural gas supplies from Russia and signed a landmark
production sharing agreement with Shell this month that
could bring in $10 billion in investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the move on Tuesday indicated that the government had no
quick plan to overcome domestic opposition to the second large
shale gas deal and its approval could be delayed significantly,
casting doubt on the whole project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is said to have Europe's third-largest shale gas
reserves at 42 trillion cubic feet (1.2 trillion cubic metres),
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kiev government picked Shell and Chevron as partners to
develop the Yuzivska area in eastern Ukraine and Olesska area in
western Ukraine, respectively, through a tender last May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine estimates the reserves of the Olesska area at 0.8 to
1.5 trillion cubic metres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But whereas local councils in the eastern Donetsk and
Kharkiv regions, loyal to the ruling Party of the Regions,
quickly approved the Shell deal, opposition groups that dominate
western Ukrainian councils threaten to block the Chevron one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The far-right nationalist Svoboda party, which surged on to
the political landscape in parliamentary elections in October, 
is strong in the west of the country and opposes shale gas
exploration citing environmental concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shale gas technology uses a process called "fracking" in
which fluid and chemicals are injected at high pressure into
beds of rock, often situated deep in the ground, to access gas
reserves trapped there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say fracking could contaminate water and cause other
environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government decree adopted last month and published on
Tuesday removes the May deadline for signing the deal but does
not set any new term for its conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing shale gas reserves is a key element in Ukraine's
strategy aimed at securing energy independence. Kiev's current
deal with Russia sets an exorbitant price for gas - about $430
per thousand cubic metres this quarter, - Ukraine says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiev's attempts to renegotiate the deal have so far failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Straining the bilateral relations even further, Russia this
month sent Ukraine a $7 billion bill for the gas that it says
Kiev was obliged to buy but never bought as it tried to reduce
imports last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  REDMOND, WA, Jan 29 (Marketwire) -- 
ALM 3 SUMMIT -- Skytap Inc., the leading provider of self-service cloud
automation solutions, today unveiled a new Automation Pack that
seamlessly enables on-premise Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS),
Visual Studio and Testing Manager workflows to dynamically create testing
environments in Skytap Cloud. The Automation Pack offers flexible support
for a wide range of application development workloads, ranging from .NET
client applications to complex n-tier server applications, such as
SharePoint. With these capabilities, customers using TFS and Visual
Studio 2012 can accelerate build-deploy-test (BDT) workflows, increase
business agility, and lower costs using Skytap Cloud.

    Agile development and testing methodologies enable businesses to
accelerate the delivery of new software products to market. While some
cloud services have attempted to provide a foundation for these agile
environments, they often require sacrifices from the development and test
teams. Many cloud providers operate at the basic
infrastructure-as-a-service level, which typically require an up-front
time and resource investment to create the target cloud environments in
advance. The Skytap Automation Pack brings together the best of both
worlds, providing the automated scale and elasticity of cloud
infrastructure coupled with the preferred tools and processes that
development and test teams are currently using today.

    "Agile development for the cloud demands rapid deployment, a high focus
on user experience and access to highly elastic resources for software
testing, while requiring comparatively less underlying infrastructure for
developing applications," said Asheesh Raina, principal research analyst
at Gartner, in a report titled "Market Trends: Application Development
Software, Worldwide, 2012-2016." "The trend is compelling enough to force
traditional agile development vendors to 'cloud enable' their existing
offerings and position them as a service to be delivered through the
cloud."

    The Skytap Automation Pack is software that installs on Visual Studio
Team Foundation Server 2012, providing workflow automation and seamless
integration with Skytap Cloud. With this solution, customers can: 


--  Run TFS on-premise and automatically spin-up, run, and tear down
    complex Microsoft development and testing environments in Skytap Cloud
    on-demand
--  Dynamically provision secure VPN network connectivity between test
    environments in Skytap Cloud and TFS without manual intervention
--  Create golden templates of complete test environments in Skytap Cloud
    using Microsoft Test Manager -- automating the creation of identical
    clean environments for each test pass
--  Automatically snapshot entire test environments in Skytap Cloud to
    investigate and diagnose root cause of test pass failures
--  Review consolidated test pass reports using Microsoft Test Manager
--  Support complex testing requirements of n-tier applications with
    virtual test environments that are identical to production
    environments on-premise or in Microsoft Azure

    

"Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2012 is an Enterprise ALM
solution that enables teams to deliver software at a continuous cadence
with agility and quality. The lab management capability of the solution
delivers self-service experiences for developers and testers that reduce
the cycle times in provisioning and managing development and test
environments with operational compliance," said Karthik Ravindran, senior
director of ALM product management at Microsoft. "With the Skytap
Automation Pack, teams can extend their Team Foundation Server ALM lab
infrastructure beyond their on-premise investments, to include the option
of the Skytap cloud infrastructure. This option will enable teams to
burst to the Skytap cloud from within their ALM workflows for dev and
test lab management and gain the economics of scale benefits of cloud
computing for dev and test workloads."

    By deploying TFS and Visual Studio workloads in Skytap Cloud, businesses
can eliminate the time and effort required to provision, configure, and
manage complex on-premise test environments. Customers benefit from
Skytap's Intelligent Automation Platform, which offers self-service
automation, team collaboration, and visibility and control capabilities
not available with traditional cloud environments. For example,
distributed teams of developers and testers can create and collaborate on
highly parallelized testing environments. With on-demand access to Skytap
Cloud, customers can scale up and quickly deploy additional environments
as needed to accelerate software development and testing cycles. Users
can also leverage other existing development and test tools in a hybrid
cloud environment by creating secure VPN connections from on-premise
environments to Skytap Cloud. 

    "In order to be a truly Agile development process, the entire application
lifecycle must be fast, including the provisioning of test environments
and the speed at which you can deploy your application into these
environments," said Sumit Mehrotra, director of product management at
Skytap. "By combining their on-premise TFS or Visual Studio environments
with Skytap Cloud, Agile teams can deliver products faster, increasing
the speed at which the organization can generate revenue."

    Skytap's director of product management, Sumit Mehrotra, will be speaking
at the Microsoft ALM 3 Summit as part of a panel on Agile testing,
helping software development teams adopt the best practices that fit
their organizations. As part of the presentation, Sumit will provide a
live demonstration of the new Skytap Automation Pack for Microsoft Visual
Studio Team Foundation Server. The presentation will take place on
Thurs., Jan. 31 at 12:45 p.m. PT in the Cascade room of Microsoft
Conference Center, Building 33 on Microsoft's Redmond campus.

Extends Protection to Latest Version of Microsoft Operating System and Browser
to Safeguard Users` Browser Sessions from Theft and Data Leakage
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Quarri Technologies, a leading security software company that empowers
organizations to keep their sensitive data secure, today announced the release
of Quarri Protect On Q 3.1, an enhanced version of its flagship web browser
security solution. Protect On Q (POQ) 3.1 delivers new support for the Microsoft
Windows 8 platform, enabling organizations to enforce secure browsing on
endpoint devices. 

Quarri`s patented POQ on demand web information security solution enables
organizations to address a variety of challenging security issues, including
external and internal data threats, and unauthorized use and replication of
confidential data. Protect On Q version 3.1 extends these capabilities to
Microsoft Windows 8, Adobe Acrobat 11 and Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10),
Microsoft`s most sophisticated web browser to date. 

"As enterprises begin to migrate to Windows 8 and IE 10, they must also be
prepared to address new security issues introduced by HTML5, including
WebSockets, local storage and application caching," said Bill Morrow, CEO and
executive chairman of Quarri. "With the latest enhancements to Protect On Q,
Quarri is providing its customers with reassurance that their users` web
sessions will be protected in Windows 8 and mixed OS environments." 

Leveraging Quarri`s patented technology, the POQ hardened browser provides
zero-hour malware protection against key logging, frame grabbing, cache mining
and inbound attacks. POQ also enables enterprises to enforce security policies
that prevent end users from copying, saving, printing or screen-capturing
browser-delivered data, preventing costly data breaches. 

The POQ 3.1 release also features new capabilities for POQ Mobile for iOS to
provide enterprises with new control and protection for their users` browser
sessions on iOS devices. Organizations can now allow or block printing from iOS
devices based on their POQ policies. They can also detect when screen shots are
captured by users and provide user notification and event logging when this
activity conflicts with policy. POQ Mobile for iOS also features new blocking
capabilities to prevent iOS display mirroring to PC devices via AirPlay when the
screen-capture blocking policy is enabled. 

More information about the POQ product suite is available at
http://www.quarri.com/products.

&lt;p&gt;* Rolls out online service for home users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Subscription costs $100 per year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* No word yet on Office for iPad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp launched
its new Office software on Tuesday, featuring constantly
updated, online access to documents from a range of devices as
the world's largest software company attempts to tailor its most
profitable product to a mobile generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Office suite of applications - including desktop
staples Outlook email, Excel charts, Word and PowerPoint - marks
the first overhaul since 2010 and aims to beat back growing
competition from Google Inc's free online apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The notion of an always up-to-date streaming version of
Office comes directly from how people are using devices today,"
said Kurt DelBene, head of Microsoft's Office unit, in a phone
interview. "You really want all your content to roam with you.
We see that as an opportunity to deliver what customers are
asking for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumer-focused version of the new software, called
Office 365 Home Premium, launched on Tuesday. After downloading
the basic programs online, users can access the latest versions
of all Office applications from up to five devices on a
subscription basis for $100 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software will be updated online, marking a change from
the past where users had to wait years for upgrades to installed
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Office largely adopts the look of last year's
Windows 8, with a cleaner, more modern-looking design and
includes touch-screen capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'ribbons' showing commands in Word and Excel are mostly 
unchanged. For the first time the package includes online
calling and video service Skype, which Microsoft bought in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users' work can be stored in remote data centers - known as
'the cloud' - and the latest version of a document accessed from
any licensed device with a browser that the user wants to work
on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOGLE KILLER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two and a half years in the making, the new Office is
designed to counter the growing popularity of Google Apps, a
collection of online-only, Office-style applications Google
provides free for home users and sells to businesses for $50 per
user per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is hoping its move into online services, alongside
its new Surface tablets, pushes it back into the forefront of
mobile computing, which has been led by Google's Android
software and Apple's combination of slick hardware and apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's launch of Office 365 Home Premium marks the next
big step in Microsoft's transformation to a devices and services
business," said Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Office will run natively on Microsoft's own Surface
tablets - both the 'RT' and Pro versions running on ARM Holdings
 and Intel Corp chips respectively - but it will
not run natively on Apple's iPad, disappointing some iPad users
who are also Office fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not said that we will do rich client software on
the iPad at this point," said DelBene, although he did not rule
out producing such software in the future. "We've been very
logical in our approach. I'm pleased with the software we have
delivered for the iPad to date," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's SkyDrive online storage system and its OneNote
note-taking software are available as iPad apps and iPad users
can use limited Web versions of some Office applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iPad issue has been a long-time quandary for Microsoft,
which might gain more mobile users by making Office available on
the iPad, but also removes a major incentive to buying its own
competing Surface tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rollout of Office 365 for corporations, Microsoft's core
market, has already started, but the new product will not be
officially launched until Feb. 27. The new Office applications
have been available to large volume business customers since
December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft estimates that 1 billion people worldwide use some
part of Office and the unit that produces Office is Microsoft's
most profitable, edging out the flagship Windows division for
the last few years. It now accounts for more than half of
Microsoft's overall profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales dipped last quarter as consumers held off in
anticipation of the new Office, but analysts expects sales to
ramp up again this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has been criticized not only for pricing, but
also for not innovating Office quickly and being slow to respond
to the move to the Web or to mobile," said Michael Silver, an
analyst at tech research firm Gartner. "Office 2013 addresses
some of the criticisms, but Microsoft still has the power to
maintain its pricing levels."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* S 500 ends eight-day rally, but stays above 1,500&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Ford, Pfizer up in premarket after posting results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Consumer confidence, Case/Shiller data on tap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Futures down: Dow 2 pts, S 5.3 pts, Nasdaq 9.5 pts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ryan Vlastelica&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged
lower on Tuesday as investors looked to take profits following
an extended rally and as they waited an onslaught of earnings
and data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* On Monday, the S 500 index closed slightly lower, ending
an eight-day run of gains. However, the index remained above
1,500, suggesting there was still support for the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Investors poured $55 billion in new cash into stock mutual
funds and exchange-traded funds in January, the biggest monthly
inflow on record, research provider TrimTabs Investment Research
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The gains have come on a strong start to earnings season.
Thomson Reuters data showed that of the 150 companies in the S
500 that have reported earnings so far, 67.3 percent have beaten
analysts' expectations, which is a higher proportion than over
the past four quarters and above the average since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Yahoo Inc rose 1.9 percent to $20.70 in premarket
trading a day after reporting adjusted earnings that beat
expectations and forecasting a rise in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Ford Motor Co jumped 2.4 percent to $14.11 in
premarket trading after reporting results early Tuesday, while
Pfizer Inc rose 0.6 percent to $27 after results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Amazon.com Inc is slated to report results after
the market closes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Eli Lilly and Co reported adjusted fourth-quarter
earnings and revenue that beat expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S 500 futures fell 5.3 points and were below fair
value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account
interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 2
points and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 9.5 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee begins two
days of meetings on interest rates. Traders speculated more
solid U.S. growth indicators might see the Fed pull back on its
aggressive easing stimulus, which has played a key role in
fuelling an equity market rally since the second half of last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Investors will also look to the latest economic data for
evidence the recent rally, which took major averages to
five-year highs, was justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* January consumer confidence, due at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) is
seen dipping to 64 from 65.1 in the previous month. The S
Case/Shiller Home Price Index for November is seen showing an
increase of 0.6 percent in home prices. Case/Shiller is due at 9
a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* While the housing market has recently shown signs of
improvement, data released on Monday showed pending home sales
unexpectedly slumped in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* U.S. stocks edged modestly lower on Monday. However,

* Calculation not meaningful 

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for fourth-quarter and
full-year 2012. Fourth-quarter 2012 revenues were $15.1 billion, a decrease of
7% compared with $16.1 billion in the year-ago quarter, which reflects an
operational decline of $802 million, or 5%, and the unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange of $271 million, or 2%. 

For fourth-quarter 2012, U.S. revenues were $5.8 billion, a decrease of 9%
compared with the year-ago quarter. This decrease was primarily the result of
the loss of exclusivity of Lipitor in November 2011 and Geodon in March 2012.
International revenues were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 5% compared with the
prior-year quarter, mainly due to the losses of exclusivity of Lipitor in
developed Europe during second-quarter 2012 and the unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 38% of total revenues in
fourth-quarter 2012 compared with 39% in the year-ago quarter, while
international revenues represented 62% of total revenues in fourth-quarter 2012
compared with 61% in the year-ago quarter. 

Full-year 2012 revenues were $59.0 billion, a decrease of 10% compared with
$65.3 billion in full-year 2011, which reflects an operational decline of $4.8
billion, or 8%, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.5 billion,
or 2%. 

For full-year 2012, U.S. revenues were $23.1 billion, a decrease of 14% compared
with full-year 2011. This decrease was primarily the result of the
aforementioned loss of exclusivity of Lipitor. International revenues were $35.9
billion, a decrease of 6% compared with the prior year, mainly due to the
previously mentioned losses of exclusivity of Lipitor and the unfavorable impact
of foreign exchange. U.S. revenues represented 39% of total revenues in
full-year 2012 compared with 41% in the previous year, while international
revenues represented 61% of total revenues in full-year 2012 compared with 59%
in full-year 2011.

Business Commentary

Primary Care unit revenues decreased 28% operationally in comparison with
fourth-quarter 2011, primarily due to the losses of exclusivity of Lipitor in
most major markets, as well as the resulting shift in the reporting of U.S. and
Japan Lipitor revenues to the Established Products unit beginning January 1,
2012. This decline in revenues for Lipitor and for certain other Primary Care
unit products that lost exclusivity in various markets in 2012 and 2011 reduced
Primary Care unit revenues by approximately $1.8 billion, or 33%. The impact of
this decline was slightly offset by the continued strong operational growth of
Lyrica in developed markets as well as Celebrex and Viagra in the U.S. 

Specialty Care unit revenues declined 2% operationally in comparison with
fourth-quarter 2011. Revenues were positively impacted by growth of the
Prevnar/Prevenar franchise, primarily due to the timing of U.S. government
purchases, as well as growth of Enbrel and Rebif, mostly in the U.S., in
addition to Benefix, ReFacto/Xyntha and Zyvox. This increase was more than
offset by approximately $360 million, or 9%, due to product losses of
exclusivity. 

Emerging Markets unit revenues grew 20% operationally in comparison with
fourth-quarter 2011. This growth was primarily driven by strong volume growth in
China as a result of more targeted promotional efforts for key innovative and
established products, including Lipitor, Norvasc and Sulperazon, and overall
market growth, as well as the timing of government purchases of Enbrel in Brazil
and Prevenar 13 in Turkey in comparison with the year-ago period. 

Established Products unit revenues increased 5% operationally in comparison with
the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the inclusion of $200 million of
U.S. and Japan branded Lipitor revenues in fourth-quarter 2012. This increase
was partially offset by the decline of revenues of certain products that
recently lost exclusivity and the impact of ongoing pricing pressures, primarily
in developed Europe and South Korea. Total revenues from established products in
both the Established Products and Emerging Markets units were $3.5 billion, with
$1.1 billion generated in emerging markets. 

Oncology unit revenues increased 11% operationally in comparison with
fourth-quarter 2011. Revenues were positively impacted by the launches of Inlyta
and Xalkori in the U.S. and certain other developed markets. Revenues were
negatively impacted by approximately $44 million, or 13%, due to the shift in
the reporting of international Aromasin revenues to the Established Products
unit beginning January 1, 2012. 

Consumer Healthcare unit revenues increased 17% operationally in comparison with
fourth-quarter 2011, primarily due to the addition of products from the
acquisitions of Ferrosan Consumer Health in December 2011 and Alacer Corp. in
February 2012 as well as strong growth of Advil and Centrum in the U.S.

See end of text prior to tables for notes. 

Adjusted cost of sales(2), adjusted SI expenses(2) and adjusted R
expenses(2) in the aggregate were $9.8 billion in fourth-quarter 2012, a
decrease of 8% compared with $10.6 billion in fourth-quarter 2011. Excluding the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $161 million, or 1%, these costs
decreased 9%, primarily reflecting the benefits of cost-reduction and
productivity initiatives. 

Savings in adjusted R expenses(2) were generated in fourth-quarter 2012
primarily by the discontinuation of certain therapeutic areas and R programs
in connection with our previously announced initiatives. Lower adjusted SI
expenses(2) compared with the year-ago period primarily reflect a reduction in
the field force and a decrease in promotional spending, both partially in
response to product losses of exclusivity, and more streamlined corporate
support functions. Adjusted cost of sales(2) and adjusted cost of sales(2) as a
percent of revenues were favorably impacted by the benefits generated from the
ongoing cost-reduction and productivity initiatives to streamline the
manufacturing network, while unfavorably impacted by the decline in revenues
contributing to a shift in geographic, business and product mix as well as by
foreign exchange. Additionally, adjusted cost of sales(2) compared with the same
period last year reflects reduced manufacturing volumes given the aforementioned
products that lost exclusivity in various markets. 

In full-year 2012, adjusted cost of sales(2), adjusted SI expenses(2) and
adjusted R expenses(2) in the aggregate were $34.6 billion, a decrease of 12%
compared with $39.2 billion in full-year 2011. Excluding the favorable impact of
foreign exchange of $840 million, or 2%, these costs decreased 10%, primarily
reflecting the aforementioned items. 

The fourth-quarter 2012 effective tax rate on adjusted income(2) was 31.0%,
compared with 29.8% in fourth-quarter 2011. The 2012 full-year effective tax
rate on adjusted income(2) was 29.3%, compared with 29.6% for the full-year
2011. The rates for 2012 compared with the prior-year rates reflect the impact
of the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the expiration of the
U.S. research and development tax credit. The full-year 2012 effective tax rate
compared to the prior-year rate also reflects the favorable impact of the
resolution of foreign audits pertaining to multiple tax years, recorded in
third-quarter 2012. 

The diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for fourth-quarter and full-year
2012 were 7.4 billion and 7.5 billion shares, respectively, a reduction of
approximately 292 million and 362 million shares, respectively, compared with
the same periods in 2011. These declines were primarily due to the Company`s
ongoing share-repurchase program. 

As a result of the aforementioned factors, fourth-quarter 2012 adjusted
income(2) was $3.5 billion, a decrease of 7% compared with $3.8 billion in the
year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(2) was $0.47, a decrease of 4%
compared with $0.49 in fourth-quarter 2011. Full-year 2012 adjusted income(2)
was $16.5 billion, a decrease of 8% compared with $17.8 billion in full-year
2011, and adjusted diluted EPS(2) was $2.19, a decrease of 4% compared with
$2.27 in full-year 2011. 

Reported Net Income(3) and Reported Diluted EPS(3) Highlights

In addition to the aforementioned factors, fourth-quarter and full-year 2012
reported earnings in comparison with the same periods in 2011 were favorably
impacted by the gain on the sale of the Nutrition(1) business, lower purchase
accounting adjustments, lower acquisition-related costs and lower costs related
to cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, while unfavorably impacted by
highercosts associated with the potential separation of Zoetis(4). Full-year
2012 reported earnings in comparison with full-year 2011 were also unfavorably
impacted by certain legal charges, primarily associated with hormone-replacement
therapy, Rapamune, Celebrex and Chantix, and the non-recurrence of the gain on
the sale of Capsugel(5) recorded in third-quarter 2011. 

The fourth-quarter 2012 effective tax rate on reported results was 31.3%,
compared with 34.4% in fourth-quarter 2011. The full-year 2012 effective tax
rate on reported results was 21.2%, compared with 31.8% for full-year 2011. The
lower rates for 2012 compared with the prior-year rates reflect the impact of
the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the expiration of the U.S.
research and development tax credit. The full-year 2012 effective tax rate was
also favorably impacted by a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
related to audits for multiple tax years and the aforementioned resolution of
foreign audits, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the
non-deductibility of the aforementioned legal charge related to Rapamune, all
recorded in third-quarter 2012. 

As a result of all these factors, fourth-quarter 2012 reported net income(3) was
$6.3 billion, compared with $1.4 billion in the prior-year quarter, and reported
diluted EPS(3) was $0.85, compared with $0.19 in fourth-quarter 2011. Full-year
2012 reported net income(3) was $14.6 billion, an increase of 46% compared with
$10.0 billion in full-year 2011, and reported diluted EPS(3) was $1.94, an
increase of 53% compared with $1.27 in full-year 2011. 

Executive Commentary

Ian Read, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "In 2012, we generated
attractive returns for our shareholders and made meaningful progress in
positioning Pfizer for anticipated sustained value creation. Notable
achievements during 2012 included approvals of five important new products in
key markets, realizing significant value through the sale of our Nutrition(1)
business, preparation for our potential initial public offering of up to a 19.8%
stake in Zoetis(4) in order to further unlock value, as well as returning almost
$15 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In
addition, many of our key innovative products reported solid operational growth,
and our Emerging Markets business generated strong growth. We continued to make
important advances in our mid-to-late stage pipeline, notably in the oncology
and vaccines areas, effectively managed our cost structure and progressed key
initiatives that I believe will drive future growth. These achievements reflect
the continued hard work and commitment of our colleagues in support of Pfizer`s
ability to realize long-term success." 

"During 2013, we will continue to foster our two distinct operating models in
order to best support our innovative and value-driven businesses and position
them to generate peak performance. We also look forward to successful launches
for Xeljanz for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and,
together with our partner Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eliquis for the prevention of
stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
These opportunities represent important new therapies in high-need markets. In
addition, our mid-to-late stage pipeline continues to strengthen with key
potential opportunities, including palbociclib (PD-332991) for advanced breast
cancer, RN316 (PCSK9) for lowering LDL cholesterol, dacomitinib for advanced
non-small cell lung cancer, inotuzumab for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and
acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Xeljanz for psoriasis, and the rLP2086 vaccine for
meningococcal B in adolescents and young adults. In addition, I expect that
`bolt-on` business development will continue to play an important role in
supplementing our internal efforts." 

"In summary, we remain intently focused on continued value creation for our
shareholders, driving meaningful innovation and pursuing the most attractive
opportunities for deployment of our shareholders` capital," concluded Mr. Read. 

Frank D`Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "Overall, I am pleased with our
2012 financial performance, our recent product approvals and our expense
reductions, as evidenced by the $4.5 billion decline in adjusted cost of sales,
SI expenses and R expenses(2) in the aggregate compared with 2011.
Additionally, we completed an important strategic initiative through the sale of
our Nutrition(1) business to Nestl&#233;, and are ready to execute on another
important strategic initiative with the potential initial public offering of up
to a 19.8% stake in Zoetis(4), after having recently completed a related $3.65
billion debt offering. We continue to expect to allocate the proceeds from these
transactions to share repurchases while also considering other value-creating
opportunities, with the return on share repurchases remaining the case to beat."


"We are also providing our initial 2013 financial guidance, including a range
for revenues of $56.2 to $58.2 billion and for adjusted diluted EPS(2) of $2.20
to $2.30. Our guidance reflects the benefit of a full-year contribution from
Zoetis(4), partially offset by an unfavorable $0.02 adjusted(2) and reported(3)
diluted EPS impact for Zoetis(4)-related interest expense associated with the
$3.65 billion debt offering and certain duplicative and other costs given the
potential separation of Zoetis(4). Additionally, our revenue guidance reflects
the anticipated negative impact of approximately $4 billion due to product
losses of exclusivity and the near-term expiration of certain co-promotion
agreements. We expect adjusted SI expenses(2) to be between $15.6 billion and
$16.6 billion, with the mid-point below the 2012 level. Notably, we expect SI
expenses will include substantial expenses associated with the launches of
various key medicines, including Eliquis, Xeljanz and Prevnar/Prevenar 13 for
adults, but plan to essentially offset those incremental expenses through our
cost-reduction initiatives. Lastly, we expect to continue to deploy significant
capital to share repurchases during the year," concluded Mr. D`Amelio.

 Pfizer`s financial guidance is summarized below.                                         
                                                                                          
 Reported Revenues                                            $56.2 to $58.2 billion      
 Adjusted Cost of Sales(2) as a Percentage of Revenues        19.0% to 20.0%              
 Adjusted SI Expenses(2)                                    $15.6 to $16.6 billion

 Effective Tax Rate on Adjusted Income(2)                     Approximately 28.0%         
 Reported Diluted EPS(3)                                      $1.50 to $1.65              
 Adjusted Diluted EPS(2)                                      $2.20 to $2.30              


The exchange rates assumed in connection with the 2013 financial guidance are as
of mid-January 2013. 

The 2013 financial guidance does not assume the completion of any business
development transactions not completed as of December 31, 2012, including any
one-time upfront payments associated with such transactions, and excludes the
potential effects of the resolution of litigation-related matters not
substantially resolved as of December 31, 2012. 

The 2013 financial guidance reflects the benefit of a full-year contribution
from Zoetis(4). Adjusted(2) and Reported(3) Diluted EPS guidance includes a
$0.02 unfavorable impact for Zoetis(4)-related interest expense and certain
duplicative and other costs given its potential separation. Reported Diluted
EPS(3) guidance includes an additional $0.02 unfavorable impact for costs
related to the establishment of Zoetis`(4) corporate and manufacturing support
functions, and certain other costs related to the potential separation of
Zoetis(4) from Pfizer, including new branding, creation of a standalone
infrastructure, site separation and certain legal registration and patent
assignment costs. 

For additional details, please see the attached financial schedules, product
revenue tables, supplemental information and disclosure notice.

 (1)    On November 30, 2012, Pfizer completed the sale of the Nutrition business to Nestl&#233;. The operating results of the Nutrition business are reported as Discontinued         
        Operations - net of tax in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The gain on the sale of the Nutrition business is reported as Discontinued    
        Operations - net of tax in the consolidated statements of income for fourth-quarter and full-year 2012.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                  
 (2)    "Adjusted Income" and its components and "Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS)" are defined as reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net     
        income(3) and its components and reported diluted EPS(3) excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain        
        significant items. Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Selling, Informational and Administrative (SI) expenses, Adjusted Research and Development (R) expenses and       
        Adjusted Other (Income)/Deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. As      
        described under Adjusted Income in the Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the fiscal 
        quarter ended September 30, 2012, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We 
        believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. Reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information 
        for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2012 and 2011, as well as reconciliations of full-year 2013 guidance for adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS to full-year 2013  
        guidance for reported net income(3) and reported diluted EPS(3), are provided in the materials accompanying this report. The adjusted income and its components and       
        adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS.                              
                                                                                                                                                                                  
 (3)    "Reported Net Income" is defined as net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. in accordance with U.S. GAAP. "Reported Diluted EPS" is defined as reported diluted EPS        
        attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                  
 (4)    Pfizer previously announced its intention to initiate a potential initial public offering of up to a 19.8% stake in Zoetis Inc. (Zoetis), a subsidiary of Pfizer, and     
        Zoetis has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Upon completion of the potential initial public offering, Pfizer will have         
        transferred substantially all of its animal health business assets and liabilities to Zoetis. The financial results of Zoetis differ from the financial results of the    
        Animal Health business unit as the components of this unit differ from Zoetis and, therefore, the financial results of the Animal Health business unit should not be      
        relied upon as indicative of the performance of Zoetis.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                  
 (5)    On August 1, 2011, Pfizer completed the sale of Capsugel to an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. L.P. The operating results and the gain on the sale of Capsugel 
        are reported as Discontinued operations - net of tax in the consolidated statements of income for full-year 2011. Additionally, due to the acquisition of King            
        Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (King), legacy King operations are reflected in the results beginning January 31, 2011. Therefore, in accordance with Pfizer`s domestic and         
        international reporting periods, in full-year 2011 the operating results reflect approximately eleven months of King`s U.S. operations and approximately ten months of    
        King`s international operations.                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                  
 (6)    For a description of each business unit, see Note 13A to Pfizer`s condensed consolidated financial statements included in Pfizer`s Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended 
        September 30, 2012.

   (a)                        Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its          
                              components and diluted EPS. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its          
                              components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are Non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in     
                              their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S.    
                              GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its     
                              components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
   (b)                        Exclusive of amortization of intangible assets, except as discussed in footnote (c) below.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
   (c)                        Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and   
                              intellectual property is included in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to    
                              acquired intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expensesor Research and

   (a)                        Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its          
                              components and diluted EPS. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its          
                              components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are Non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in     
                              their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S.    
                              GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its     
                              components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
   (b)                        Exclusive of amortization of intangible assets, except as discussed in footnote (c) below.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
   (c)                        Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and   
                              intellectual property is included in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization expense related to    
                              acquired intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses or Research and    
                              development expenses, as appropriate.

 *    Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are Non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non 
      -GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.

PFIZER INC.
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

1. Change in Reported Cost of Sales

Reported cost of sales decreased 13% in the fourth quarter and 19% in full-year
2012, compared to the same periods in 2011. The decreases were primarily due to
lower purchase accounting adjustments in 2012, lower costs related to our
cost-reduction and productivity initiatives and acquisition-related costs, as
well as the benefits generated from the ongoing productivity initiatives to
streamline the manufacturing network. Additionally, the decreases were due to
reduced manufacturing volumes related to products that lost exclusivity in
various markets. The decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact
of a shift in geographic, business and product mix for both periods. In
addition, reported cost of sales in fourth-quarter 2012 reflects the unfavorable
impact of foreign exchange of 7%, while reported cost of sales in full-year 2012
reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 3%. 

Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 1.4 percentage
points to 21.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in
2011, reflecting the aforementioned factors. 

2. Change in Reported Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI) Expenses
and Reported Research &amp; Development (R) Expenses

Reported SI expenses decreased 7% in fourth-quarter 2012 and 12% in full-year
2012, compared to the same periods in 2011. The decreases were primarily due to
savings generated from a reduction in the field force and a decrease in
promotional spending, both partially in response to product losses of
exclusivity and more streamlined corporate support functions, as well as the
favorable impact of foreign exchange of 1% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2%
in full-year 2012, partially offset by costs associated with the potential
separation of Zoetis employees, net assets and operations from Pfizer. 

Reported R expenses decreased 17% in fourth-quarter 2012 and 13% in full-year
2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily due to savings generated
by the discontinuation of certain therapeutic areas and R programs in
connection with our previously announced cost-reduction and productivity
initiatives, which were partially offset in full-year 2012 by a $250 million
payment to AstraZeneca in the third quarter of 2012 to obtain the exclusive
global over-the-counter rights to Nexium.

(a) Interest income decreased in both periods in 2012 due to lower average cash
balances and lower interest rates earned on investments. Interest expense
decreased in both periods in 2012 due to lower debt balances and the effective
conversion of some fixed-rate liabilities to floating-rate liabilities. 

(b) In fourth-quarter 2012, primarily includes charges related to Chantix
litigation. In full-year 2012, primarily includes a $491 million charge
resulting from an agreement-in-principle with the U.S. Department of Justice to
resolve an investigation into Wyeth`s historical promotional practices in
connection with Rapamune, a $450 million settlement of a lawsuit by Brigham
Young University related to Celebrex, and charges related to hormone-replacement
therapy litigation and Chantix litigation. In 2011, primarily includes charges
for hormone-replacement therapy litigation. 

(c) In fourth-quarter and full-year 2012, primarily relates to certain
intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of Wyeth and
King, including in-process research and development (IPR) intangible assets.
In fourth-quarter 2011, primarily relates to our indefinite-lived brand asset,
Xanax, as a result of an increased competitive environment. In full-year 2011,
substantially all relates to certain intangible assets acquired in connection
with our acquisition of Wyeth, including IPR intangible assets, and our
indefinite-lived brand asset, Xanax, as mentioned in the previous sentence. 

(d) Costs incurred in connection with the potential initial public offering of
up to a 19.8% ownership stake in Zoetis. Includes expenditures for banking,
legal, accounting and similar services related to the potential transaction. 

4. Effective Tax Rate

Reported
The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 31.3% for the fourth
quarter of 2012 compared with 34.4% for the fourth quarter of 2011, and 21.2%
for full-year 2012 compared with 31.8% for full-year 2011. The lower rates for
2012 compared with the prior-year rates reflect the impact of the change in the
jurisdictional mix of earnings and the expiration of the U.S. research and
development tax credit. The full-year 2012 effective tax rate was also favorably
impacted by a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service related to
audits for multiple tax years and the resolution of foreign audits pertaining to
multiple tax years, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the
non-deductibility of a legal charge related to Rapamune, all recorded in
third-quarter 2012. 

Adjusted
The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was 31.0% in fourth-quarter 2012
compared with 29.8% in fourth-quarter 2011, and 29.3% in full-year 2012 compared
with 29.6% in full-year 2011. The rates for 2012 compared with the prior-year
rates reflect the impact of the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and
the expiration of the U.S. research and development tax credit. The full-year
2012 effective tax rate compared to the prior-year rate also reflects the
favorable impact of the resolution of the aforementioned foreign audits recorded
in third-quarter 2012.

unfavorable impact for Zoetis-related interest expense and certain duplicative
and other costs given its potential separation. Reported Diluted EPS guidance
includes an additional $0.02 unfavorable impact for costs related to the

certain other costs related to the potential separation of Zoetis from Pfizer,
including new branding, creation of a standalone infrastructure, site separation
and certain legal registration and patent assignment costs.

including our realigned R footprint, and amounts related to other

______________________________________________ 

(1) "Adjusted income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are
defined as reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net
income attributable to Pfizer Inc. and reported diluted EPS attributable to
Pfizer Inc. common shareholders excluding purchase accounting adjustments,
acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant
items. As described under Adjusted Income in the Management`s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer`s
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2012, management uses
Adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure
the performance of the overall company. We believe that investors` understanding
of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. The Adjusted income
and Adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as
substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS. 

DISCLOSURE NOTICE: The information contained in this earnings release and the
attachments is as of January 29, 2013. We assume no obligation to update
forward-looking statements contained in this earnings release and the
attachments as a result of new information or future events or developments. 

This earnings release and the attachments contain forward-looking statements
about our future operating and financial performance, business plans and
prospects, in-line products and product candidates, strategic review, capital
allocation, business development plans, and share-repurchase and dividend-rate
plans that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these
statements by the fact that they use future dates or use words such as "will,"
"anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe,"
"target," "forecast," "goal," "objective," "aim" and other words and terms of
similar meaning. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from past results and future plans and projected future results are
the following:

* the outcome of research and development activities, including, without
limitation, the ability to meet anticipated clinical trial commencement and
completion dates, regulatory submission and approval dates, and launch dates for
product candidates; 
* decisions by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to approve our
drug applications, as well as their decisions regarding labeling, ingredients
and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of
our products; 
* the speed with which regulatory authorizations, pricing approvals and product
launches may be achieved; 
* the outcome of post-approval clinical trials, which could result in the loss
of marketing approval for a product or changes in the labeling for, and/or
increased or new concerns about the safety or efficacy of, a product that could
affect its availability or commercial potential; 
* the success of external business-development activities; 
* competitive developments, including the impact on our competitive position of
new product entrants, in-line branded products, generic products, private label
products and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to
those treated by our in-line drugs and drug candidates; 
* the implementation by the FDA of an abbreviated legal pathway to approve
biosimilar products, which could subject our biologic products to competition
from biosimilar products in the U.S., with attendant competitive pressures,
after the expiration of any applicable exclusivity period and patent rights; 
* the ability to meet generic and branded competition after the loss of patent
protection for our products or competitor products; 
* the ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically
and internationally; 
* difficulties or delays in manufacturing; 
* trade buying patterns; 
* the impact of existing and future legislation and regulatory provisions on
product exclusivity; 
* trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment; 
* the impact of the U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011 (the Budget Control Act) and
the deficit-reduction actions to be taken pursuant to the Budget Control Act in
order to achieve the deficit-reduction targets provided for therein, and the
impact of any broader deficit-reduction efforts; 
* the possible failure of the federal government to increase or suspend the
federal debt ceiling and any resulting inability of the federal government to
satisfy its financial obligations, including under Medicare, Medicaid and other
publicly funded or subsidized health programs; 
* the impact of U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010 -- the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act -- and of any modification or repeal of any of the provisions
thereof; 
* U.S. legislation or regulatory action affecting, among other things:
pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including under
Medicaid, Medicare and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs; the
importation of prescription drugs from outside the U.S. at prices that are
regulated by governments of various foreign countries; direct-to-consumer
advertising and interactions with healthcare professionals; and the use of
comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner
that focuses primarily on the cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic
differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative
medicines; 
* legislation or regulatory action in markets outside the U.S. affecting
pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including, in
particular, continued government-mandated price reductions for certain
biopharmaceutical products in certain European and emerging market countries; 
* the exposure of our operations outside the U.S. to possible capital and
exchange controls, expropriation and other restrictive government actions,
changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, as well as
political unrest and unstable governments and legal systems; 
* contingencies related to actual or alleged environmental contamination; 
* claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety or efficacy of in-line
products and product candidates; 
* any significant breakdown, infiltration, or interruption of our information
technology systems and infrastructure; 
* legal defense costs, insurance expenses, settlement costs, the risk of an
adverse decision or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to product
liability, patent protection, government investigations, consumer, commercial,
securities, antitrust, environmental and tax issues, ongoing efforts to explore
various means for resolving asbestos litigation, and other legal proceedings; 
* our ability to protect our patents and other intellectual property, both
domestically and internationally; 
* interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; 
* governmental laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations,
including, without limitation, tax obligations and changes affecting the tax
treatment by the U.S. of income earned outside of the U.S. that may result from
pending and possible future proposals; 
* any significant issues involving our largest wholesaler customers, which
account for a substantial portion of our revenues; 
* the possible impact of the increased presence of counterfeit medicines in the
pharmaceutical supply chain on our revenues and on patient confidence in the
integrity of our medicines; 
* any significant issues that may arise related to the outsourcing of certain
operational and staff functions to third parties, including with regard to
quality, timeliness and compliance with applicable legal requirements and
industry standards; 
* changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; 
* uncertainties related to general economic, political, business, industry,
regulatory and market conditions including, without limitation, uncertainties
related to the impact on us, our customers, suppliers and lenders and
counterparties to our foreign-exchange and interest-rate agreements of
challenging global economic conditions and recent and possible future changes in
global financial markets; and the related risk that our allowance for doubtful
accounts may not be adequate; 
* any changes in business, political and economic conditions due to actual or
threatened terrorist activity in the U. S. and other parts of the world, and
related U. S. military action overseas; 
* growth in costs and expenses; 
* changes in our product, segment and geographic mix; 
* the possibility that the potential initial public offering (IPO) of up to a
19.8% ownership stake in Zoetis Inc., for which a registration statement has
been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, will not be consummated
at all or within the anticipated time period or at a price within the estimated
IPO range, including as the result of regulatory, market or other factors; and,
if the IPO is consummated, the impact of the strategic alternative that we
decide to pursue with regard to our remaining ownership stake in Zoetis Inc.;
and 
* the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, product recalls and
withdrawals and other unusual items, including our ability to realize the
projected benefits of our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, including
those related to our research and development organization.

A further list and description of risks, uncertainties and other matters can be
found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2011 and in our reports on Form 10-Q, in each case including in the sections
thereof captioned "Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect
Future Results" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors", and in our reports on Form 8-K. 

This earnings release may include discussion of certain clinical studies
relating to various in-line products and/or product candidates. These studies
typically are part of a larger body of clinical data relating to such products
or product candidates, and the discussion herein should be considered in the
context of the larger body of data. 

This earnings release does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of
an offer to buy, any securities, which will be made only by prospectus.

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects GOME price change in 2nd bullet to rise 1.1 pct, not
fall)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Jan 29 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares slipped from
Monday's 20-month closing high, underperforming Asian peers
largely due to a weak Chinese banking sector after Goldman Sachs
sold a $1 billion stake in Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China (ICBC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Index closed down 0.1 percent at
23,655.2 on Tuesday, slipping from its highest closing levels
since May 31, 2011. The China Enterprises Index of the
top Chinese listings in Hong Kong inched down 0.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSI300 of the top Shanghai and Shenzhen
A-shares listings ended up 0.9 percent at 2,675.9, its highest
close since May 8. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed
0.5 percent to its highest close since June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIGHLIGHTS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* After the market closed on Monday, Goldman Sachs offered
shares of ICBC at HK$5.77, a 3 percent discount to the
day's near 2-year close at HK$5.95. On Tuesday, the shares slid
2.2 percent to HK$5.82 which pointed to a healthy demand for the
stake sale, given that the stock dropped less than 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Shares of Bain Capital-backed GOME Electrical Appliance
 rose 1.1 percent despite China's second-largest home
appliance retailer having said late on Monday that it expects to
have suffered a loss last year partly due to its unprofitable
e-commerce business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Mid-sized Chinese banks were again strong after mainland
media reported that the country's banking regulators may relax
loan-to-deposit ratio limits to improve risk controls as
interest rates are gradually liberalised, a move that will
benefit smaller banks more in the short term.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Jan 30 (Reuters) - California has slapped
nearly $1 million in fines on Chevron for safety
violations related to an August fire at its refinery in
Richmond, representing the biggest such penalties in the state's
history, regulators said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron received 25 citations from the state's safety
regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators found willful violations in Chevron's response
before, during and after the Aug. 6 fire at the Richmond
refinery, located northeast of San Francisco, that sent a smoke
column over San Francisco Bay and thousands of people to
hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil giant did not comply with state safety standards,
putting workers at its refinery and the public at risk, the
California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA)
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron also failed to follow recommendations by its own
experts to replace the corroded pipe that ultimately ruptured
and caused the fire. When the pipe began leaking, Chevron did
not follow its own emergency shutdown procedures, putting
workers at the site and thousands of areas residents at extreme
risk, Cal/OSHA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no serious injuries were reported among workers at the
refinery, at least 15,000 people complaining of respiratory
problems went to area hospitals in the hours and days after the
fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The citations include 11 "willful serious" and 12 "serious"
violations, resulting in the highest penalties in Cal/OSHA
history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman said while the company acknowledged that
it failed to live up to its own expectation in the incident, it
did not agree with several Cal/OSHA findings and its
characterization of some of the violations as "willful." The
spokesman said the company plans to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scientist with an environmental group said the safety
report provided a disturbing picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As an engineer, it's shocking to see the photos and reports
from Cal/OSHA and other agencies, showing pieces of piping that
were corroded by 80 percent with little more than a shell of the
original pipe holding things together," said Diane Bailey, a
senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This kind of shoddy and seriously negligent maintenance is
not what you expect to see from one of the largest companies in
the world," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Chevron said it has paid $10 million in
claims stemming from the crude unit fire at its
245,000-barrels-per-day refinery in Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Argentine suit stems from $19 bln ruling against Chevron
    * Chevron says pollution judgment fraudulent, unenforceable
    * Two-decade legal dispute has spread to several countries


    By Guido Nejamkis
    BUENOS AIRES, Jan 30 (Reuters) - An Argentine appeals court
has upheld a freeze on up to $19 billion worth of assets held by
U.S. oil major Chevron Corp in Argentina as part of an
environmental lawsuit by Ecuadorean villagers, one of the
plaintiffs' lawyers said on Wednesday.
    An Ecuadorean court last year ordered Chevron to pay the
enormous sum for contamination of watersheds over nearly 30
years that the plaintiffs say sickened indigenous tribes people
and farmers in the Ecuadorean Amazon.  
    Chevron, which vowed to fight the latest ruling, has refused
to make any payments and accuses Ecuadorean courts of fraud.
Because the company has few assets in Ecuador, the plaintiffs
are seeking enforcement of the ruling in other nations including
Argentina, Brazil and Canada. 
    The two Chevron subsidiaries targeted by the freeze, Chevron
Argentina and Ing. Norberto Priu, asked the court in November to
lift the asset freeze on the grounds that they were not directly
owned by Chevron. The court rejected their appeal unanimously,
lawyer Enrique Bruchou said. 
    "We are very pleased with the resolution of the Court of
Appeals, which is well founded," Bruchou said in a statement
sent to Reuters.
    
   
    California-based Chevron said it would "pursue all available
legal remedies to reverse the interim measure."
    "Chevron's view of the situation remains unchanged; the
precautionary embargo is unfounded and based on a judicial fraud
in Ecuador. If the plaintiffs' lawyers believed they had a
legitimate judgment they would seek to enforce it in the United
States, where Chevron Corporation resides," a company spokesman
said in an emailed comment.
    The plaintiffs' lawyers estimate that Chevron's assets in
Argentina are worth about $2 billion and that they could obtain
some $600 million a year if the ruling were enforced. 
    Chevron argues that the company has no direct assets in
Argentina because its operations in the country are conducted by
subsidiaries.
    Chevron signed an accord with state-controlled YPF,
Argentina's No. 1 energy company, in December that aims to pave
the way for major investment in the country's shale oil
resources. 
    Bruchou said Chevron should acknowledge the potential
liability in company financial reports. It is due to report
fourth-quarter earnings on Friday.
    "In the immediacy of Chevron submitting its fully audited
2012 financial statements, we hope this will help the company,
and in particular its Audit Committee and its auditors, focus on
the need of recognizing and accruing the loss contingency in
their 2012 financial statements, in compliance with clear
guidelines of the SEC rules," he said.
    "According to such rules, if a loss is 'probable' and the
amount of loss can be 'reasonably estimated' the company must
recognize and accrue it in its financial statements."

&lt;p&gt;Its that time again: Fed watchers are already parsing possible changes to the January policy statement, even before it is released. Goldman Sachs economists in particular have identified one passage ripe for some type of tweak  one that could signal the appetite for continued bond buys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Treasury purchases under the new regime already underway, the statement that Treasury purchases would&#160;initially occur at a pace of $45 billion per month will have to be adjusted. If initially is replaced with another modifier such as at the present time rather than deleted, it would suggest downside risks to the size of&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; the Treasury program later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two more government entities choose Tyler to implement Microsoft Dynamics AX
2012
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Tyler Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: TYL) has signed agreements with Walker County,
Texas, and Arizona`s Maricopa Association of Governments to implement Microsoft
Dynamics&#174; AX 2012, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution with public
sector functionality that Tyler Technologies jointly developed with Microsoft&#174;. 

Walker County and the Maricopa Association of Governments each selected
Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 for its intuitive user interface and ability to be
implemented quickly. Under the agreements, both clients will implement a variety
of Dynamics AX 2012 applications, including project accounting, accounts
receivable and payroll. Truckee Meadows Water Authority and the Global Alliance
for TB Drug Development also selected Tyler earlier in 2012 to implement
Dynamics AX 2012, and both of those clients went live on the new system this
month. 

"As public sector organizations transform for the future, elected officials will
continue to look to ERP modernization for cost savings, improving operational
effectiveness and achieving greater strategic value from financial management,"
said Amir Capriles, general manager, U.S. Public Sector for Microsoft Dynamics.

these customers who will enjoy greater end-user satisfaction, a higher return on
investment, and a lower total cost of ownership for their ERP solution."

the Microsoft Dynamics AX product suite," said Richard E. Peterson Jr.,
president of Tyler`s ERP &amp; School Division. "Tyler is the market leader in
developing, implementing and supporting integrated solutions for the public
sector, all backed by our exceptional services and support for all of our
product offerings, including Microsoft Dynamics AX."

BERLIN--(Business Wire)--
JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH (JPT), a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioNTech AG
(Mainz, Germany), and The Institute for Medical Immunology at the Charit&#233; in
Berlin today announced a collaborative agreement on the development of
serological peptide markers for the differential diagnosis of chronic fatigue
syndrome (CFS). 

CFS is a debilitating and complex disorder characterized by profound fatigue.
Symptoms affect several body systems, frequently resulting in broadly reduced
participation in daily activities. Definitive diagnosis of CFS is difficult and
a diagnostic test is not available. Currently, diagnosis of CFS is achieved
through the process of eliminating other diseases that have chronic fatigue as a
symptom. 

The goal of the partnership is to combine the long term expertise at the Charit&#233;
Clinics for Immune Deficiencies in diagnosing CFS patients with JPT`s
high-content peptide microarray approach to discover seromarkers that enable the
development of a diagnostic test system. 

Prof. Carmen Scheibenbogen, the project team head at the Charit&#233; stated: "Our
previous and ongoing research at The Institute for Medical Immunology indicates
a chronic activation of the immune system for a portion of our CFS patients.
Preliminary results using JPT`s peptide microarray technology let us hope to
find distinct serological markers that allow better diagnosis and treatment of
CFS patients in the future." 

Holger Wenschuh, CEO at JPT adds, "The previous success of our peptide

NetSocket Cloud Experience Manager (CEM) enables an optimized Lync user
experience in enterprise and service provider environments
PLANO, Texas--(Business Wire)--
NetSocket, a leading provider of network service assurance solutions for unified
communications (UC)in enterprise and service provider environments, today
announced its Cloud Experience Manager (CEM) has been tested and qualified as an
ISV in Microsoft`s Unified Communications Open Interoperability Program for Lync
Communications Server. 

Microsoft Lync connects people in enterprises everywhere as part of their
everyday productivity experience. When a user`s Lync experience is affected by
issues in the underlying IP network, unified communications (UC) managers need
to solve those problems immediately. NetSocket`s CEM provides comprehensive
insight into network issues for fast problem resolution, lower total cost of
ownership (TCO) and a superior Lync user experience. 

NetSocket`s CEM solution for Microsoft Lync is more than just monitoring; it
provides complete IP network information correlation for Lync environments. CEM
automatically correlates, in real time, all session, content and topology data
to each user call, enabling managers to quickly anticipate, isolate and
remediate the root causes of network-based UC problems. CEM delivers immediate
insight into underlying IP networks without costly probes at each endpoint or
burdening the performance of all Lync elements with post-event diagnostic
traces. A Web-based single view of the end-to-end call layers and a system
management dashboard provide a comprehensive view of performance metrics and the
Lync user experience. 

CEM facilitates Lync event root cause analysis, identification and resolution in
just a few clicks, minimizing the manual efforts of IT operations and support
personnel. CEM`s forensic data is derived from all calls - including those
affected by service disruptions. CEM`s deep visibility and correlation of UC
session, content and IP topology layers yield a 70 percent reduction in mean
time-to-repair UC service degradations. CEM historical reports and key
performance indicators identify mid- and long-term trends for predicting
capacity and performance actions, enabling administrators to anticipate caseload
peaks and take action through proactive alerting. The enhanced visibility
afforded by CEM provides both a reduction in TCO and greater predictability for
Microsoft Lync operations. 

"The Lync ISV Qualification Program helps customers to have a high-quality
experience with applications built for Lync," said Jon Morrow, Senior Program
Manager for Lync. "NetSocket CEM`s qualification provides Lync customers with a
network service assurance solution for optimizing their unified communications
experience." 

"NetSocket is proud to have achieved Microsoft Lync ISV qualification and to
work with Lync customers to help them anticipate, isolate and remediate
underlying unified communications network issues," said John White, CEO and
president of NetSocket. "Maximizing existing investments is important for
increasing an organization`s cost-efficiency and productivity. NetSocket`s
support of the Microsoft Lync platform is a critical factor for assuring a
high-quality Lync unified communications experience and reducing the operational
TCO in enterprise and managed service provider environments."

and their members with effective tools for growth. Businesses within the USHCC network are now
able to receive guaranteed payments and greater risk management protection, while also providing

small business products.

"As we bring together the people and policy experts that affect not only the small business
community, but help command the strength and prowess of the American work force, the USHCC
recognizes Visa for sharing the resources and knowledge to make meaningful contributions within
the Hispanic business community," said USHCC Chairman Marc Rodriguez. "We are delighted to have
Visa on board as the 2013 Legislative Summit Corporate Chair."

The USHCC Annual Legislative Summit is attended each year by hundreds of chamber executives,
Hispanic business owners, Fortune 500 corporate representatives and leaders in federal and state
government, as well as elected officials and members of the Administration. The Summit features
several meal events, receptions, workshops and Congressional meetings focused on pertinent issues

DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--

Research and Markets

(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/jz8bhk/orencia) has announced the
addition of GlobalData's new report "Orencia (Rheumatoid Arthritis) Forecast and
Market Analysis" to their offering. 

Orencia (Rheumatoid Arthritis) Forecast and Market Analysis. The RA market is
currently very dynamic, with the November 6, 2012 FDA approval of Pfizer's
Xeljanz (tofacitinib) and novel oral therapies awaiting approval such as: Eli
Lilly's anti-BAFF, tabalumab and JAK1,2 inhibitor, baricitinib, and Rigel/AZ's
SYK inhibitor, fostamatinib. These compounds will challenge the current
biologics in the attempt to dislodge the stronghold of the TNF inhibitors, if
their safety and efficacy profiles are proven once they enter the market. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb's Orencia (abatacept) is a soluble biologic and
structurally a fully human fusion protein of human cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte-associated Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the Fc domain of human IgG1. The
drug blocks T-cell activation by binding to CD80 and CD86, which in turn blocks
their interaction with CD28. 

Scope 

- Overview of RA, including epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnosis,
pathology and treatment guidelines as well as an overview on the competitive
landscape. 

- Detailed information on Orencia including product description, safety and
efficacy profiles as well as a SWOT analysis. 

- Sales forecast for Orencia for the top nine countries from 2012 to 2022. 

- Sales information covered for the US, France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain,
Japan and Australia 

Reasons to buy

ensure a robust return 

- Stay ahead of the competition by understanding the changing competitive
landscape for Rheumatoid Arthritis 

- Effectively plan your M and partnership strategies by identifying drugs with
the most promising sales potential

&lt;p&gt;ARBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Behind the closed doors of their offices in the United States, top executives and lawyers for Exxon Mobil are poring over two sets of contracts, weighing a decision that could shift the balance of power in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki last week hastily convened a meeting with Exxon's chief executive Rex Tillerson in a bid to woo back the U.S. major, which had seemed intent on pulling out of the $50 billion West Qurna 1 oilfield in the south, in an area under Baghdad's control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since signing for six blocs with the Kurdistan regional government in 2011, Exxon has situated itself on one of Iraq's deepest faultlines, bringing to a head friction between the northern enclave and Baghdad, which says only it has the authority to grant oil contacts and control crude exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry sources say Maliki has offered Tillerson substantial incentives to stay in Iraq's southern oilfields as long as the company forfeits its assets in the autonomous Kurdish region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final decision is due within the next few days, Iraqi Oil Minister Abdul Kareem Luaibi said on Sunday. It remains to be seen which way Exxon's compass will swing. The company has declined to comment on the impending decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The loss of prestige would be huge," said a former U.S. diplomat, contemplating the fallout for Kurdistan if Exxon were to quit the region in favor of Baghdad. "Exxon's presence here levels the political playing field."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the first major oil company to risk Baghdad's ire by venturing north, Exxon afforded the Kurds a victory in their turf war with the central government over how to exploit Iraq's hydrocarbon riches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. major's vote of confidence opened the door for others such as Total, Russia's Gazprom Neft and Chevron Corp, which recently added a third bloc to its Kurdish portfolio and is eyeing further acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of Exxon's blocs, however, are located in the "disputed areas", an oil-rich band of territory over which both Baghdad and the Kurds claim jurisdiction and where the Iraqi army and Kurdish troops are facing off against each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECURITY CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry sources say Tillerson raised concerns about security at a meeting in Switzerland with the Iraqi Kurdish region's president, Masoud Barzani, although Kurdistan said later that Exxon had restated its commitment to working in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Baghdad also expects Exxon to take its side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're positive the company is not willing to quit West Qurna," said an Iraqi Oil Ministry official, noting that output from that field alone exceeds total current Kurdish production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think Exxon will halt operations in Kurdistan and wait until a solution is reached to all the unresolved issues," he added, asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New legislation to govern the world's fourth largest oil reserves has been caught up for years in a struggle over how to share power between Iraq's Sunni, Shi'ite and Kurdish factions, which has intensified since U.S. troops withdrew a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kurds say the right to dictate their own oil policy is enshrined in the country's federal constitution, but Baghdad rejects contracts signed by the region as illegal and has blacklisted some firms operating there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International oil companies have been prepared to take that risk in return for Kurdistan's better contract terms, security and an easier working environment, as opposed to the bureaucracy and infrastructure bottlenecks that hamper oil projects in the rest of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad would have to promise Exxon favorable terms to entice it away from the north, but analysts and industry sources doubt Maliki's capacity to deliver those, and say it would be a mistake for him to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they go for Baghdad, I'm sure they (Exxon) will want sweeteners," said a senior executive from a rival company. "But if they get better terms, others will want the same."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some industry sources even suggested that may have been part of Exxon's calculations all along: that when defying Baghdad the company figured it might eventually be able to use its Kurdish contracts as leverage to extract concessions in the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"POINT OF NO RETURN"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the loss of face if Exxon were to back away from Kurdistan, experts say such a move would ultimately do little to slow the region's drive towards greater energy autonomy from Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon was a game-changer then, but things have moved on," said one industry source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there are other majors waiting to snap up acreage in what has been described as one of the final frontiers for onshore oil exploration, and they are unlikely to be deterred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real challenge lies in finding new ways to sell Kurdish oil, until now shipped to world markets through a Baghdad-controlled pipeline running from Kirkuk to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kurdish exports via that channel dried up in December from a peak of around 200,000 bpd as result of a row over payments with Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fed up with waiting, the Kurds have already started bypassing the federal pipeline network by trucking small quantities of crude over the Turkish border in exchange for refined products. The trade is small, but symbolic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil and gas wise, it's a point of no return," said an industry source. "From this point on, the Kurds will not agree to a centralized oil and gas policy. Other regions will do the same."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurdistan is looking to Turkey for answers.

&lt;p&gt;* Exxon to decide between Kurds and Baghdad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Decision expected in next few days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Kurds strive for energy autonomy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Isabel Coles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARBIL, Iraq, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Behind the closed doors of
their offices in the United States, top executives and lawyers
for Exxon Mobil are poring over two sets of contracts,
weighing a decision that could shift the balance of power in
Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki last week hastily
convened a meeting with Exxon's chief executive Rex Tillerson in
a bid to woo back the U.S. major, which had seemed intent on
pulling out of the $50 billion West Qurna 1 oilfield in the
south, in an area under Baghdad's control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since signing for six blocs with the Kurdistan regional
government in 2011, Exxon has situated itself on one of Iraq's
deepest faultlines, bringing to a head friction between the
northern enclave and Baghdad, which says only it has the
authority to grant oil contacts and control crude exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry sources say Maliki has offered Tillerson
substantial incentives to stay in Iraq's southern oilfields as
long as the company forfeits its assets in the autonomous
Kurdish region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final decision is due within the next few days, Iraqi Oil
Minister Abdul Kareem Luaibi said on Sunday. It remains to be
seen which way Exxon's compass will swing. The company has
declined to comment on the impending decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The loss of prestige would be huge," said a former U.S.
diplomat, contemplating the fallout for Kurdistan if Exxon were
to quit the region in favour of Baghdad. "Exxon's presence here
levels the political playing field."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the first major oil company to risk Baghdad's ire by
venturing north, Exxon afforded the Kurds a victory in their
turf war with the central government over how to exploit Iraq's
hydrocarbon riches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. major's vote of confidence opened the door for
others such as Total, Russia's Gazprom Neft 
and Chevron Corp, which recently added a third bloc to
its Kurdish portfolio and is eyeing further acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of Exxon's blocs, however, are located in the
"disputed areas", an oil-rich band of territory over which both
Baghdad and the Kurds claim jurisdiction and where the Iraqi
army and Kurdish troops are facing off against each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECURITY CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry sources say Tillerson raised concerns about
security at a meeting in Switzerland with the Iraqi Kurdish
region's president, Masoud Barzani, although Kurdistan said
later that Exxon had restated its commitment to working in the
region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Baghdad also expects Exxon to take its side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're positive the company is not willing to quit West
Qurna," said an Iraqi Oil Ministry official, noting that output
from that field alone exceeds total current Kurdish production
capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think Exxon will halt operations in Kurdistan and wait
until a solution is reached to all the unresolved issues," he
added, asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized
to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New legislation to govern the world's fourth largest oil
reserves has been caught up for years in a struggle over how to
share power between Iraq's Sunni, Shi'ite and Kurdish factions,
which has intensified since U.S. troops withdrew a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kurds say the right to dictate their own oil policy is
enshrined in the country's federal constitution, but Baghdad
rejects contracts signed by the region as illegal and has
blacklisted some firms operating there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International oil companies have been prepared to take that
risk in return for Kurdistan's better contract terms, security
and an easier working environment, as opposed to the bureaucracy
and infrastructure bottlenecks that hamper oil projects in the
rest of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad would have to promise Exxon favourable terms to
entice it away from the north, but analysts and industry sources
doubt Maliki's capacity to deliver those, and say it would be a
mistake for him to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they go for Baghdad, I'm sure they (Exxon) will want
sweeteners," said a senior executive from a rival company. "But
if they get better terms, others will want the same."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some industry sources even suggested that may have been part
of Exxon's calculations all along: that when defying Baghdad the
company figured it might eventually be able to use its Kurdish
contracts as leverage to extract concessions in the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"POINT OF NO RETURN"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the loss of face if Exxon were to back away from
Kurdistan, experts say such a move would ultimately do little to
slow the region's drive towards greater energy autonomy from
Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon was a game-changer then, but things have moved on,"
said one industry source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there are other majors waiting to snap up acreage in
what has been described as one of the final frontiers for
onshore oil exploration, and they are unlikely to be deterred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real challenge lies in finding new ways to sell Kurdish
oil, until now shipped to world markets through a
Baghdad-controlled pipeline running from Kirkuk to the Turkish
port of Ceyhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kurdish exports via that channel dried up in December
from a peak of around 200,000 bpd as result of a row over
payments with Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fed up with waiting, the Kurds have already started
bypassing the federal pipeline network by trucking small
quantities of crude over the Turkish border in exchange for
refined products. The trade is small, but symbolic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil and gas wise, it's a point of no return," said an
industry source. "From this point on, the Kurds will not agree
to a centralized oil and gas policy. Other regions will do the
same."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurdistan is looking to Turkey for answers. A broad energy
partnership between them has been in the works since last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will be a big bang deal. That's the only way to do it,
involving everything at the same time," said a diplomatic source
familiar with the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details are still unclear, but industry sources said it
would range from exploration to export and seek to open up a new
"energy corridor" to Turkey that would reduce Ankara's
dependence on Russia and Iran for oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would involve a new Turkish entity taking a stake
in several Kurdish blocs and an alternative pipeline, which the
United States is actively discouraging for fear it will further
destabilise Iraq and threaten its federal integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GAME-CHANGER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would also have to include a mechanism to pay the Kurds
directly for their exports instead of the current arrangement
whereby Baghdad receives the proceeds and then passes on 17
percent of the country's revenues as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurdish officials have long complained what they end up
getting is in fact closer to 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the money starts flowing straight to Arbil, that will
be the game-changer," said a diplomatic source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurdish officials say they would keep the share to which
they are entitled and send the rest on to Baghdad, but an
independent revenue stream would theoretically give the region
the means to stand on its own economically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Assuming they could export 1 million barrels per day,
they'd make more revenues from that than their current share of
the national budget, depending on how much oil the south is
producing," said Robin Mills of UAE-based energy consultancy
Manaarco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opponents of the tie-up worry it would make Kurdistan too
dependent on Turkey, which has a fraught relation with its own
Kurdish community and will be keen to have the upper hand in any
dealings with their ethnic kin in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But champions of the deal argue that landlocked Kurdistan
has few options besides isolated Iran and war-torn Syria -- its
other neighbours -- neither of which has the strategic
advantages of Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Economically, we're already at their mercy," said a senior
Kurdish regional government official. "Once we start mass
producing, the equation changes and the relationship with Turkey
becomes interdependent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Majority Sunni Turkey's links with Iraqi Kurdistan have
already come at a price, heightening tensions between Ankara and
the Shi'ite-led government in Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baghdad has accused Ankara of complicity in "smuggling"
Iraqi oil, and late last year prevented Turkey's energy minister
from attending an oil conference sponsored by Exxon in Kurdistan
by denying his plane permission to land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Collaboration between the KRG (Kurdistan Regional
Government) and Turkey to transfer oil and gas to the world
markets will strengthen our ties," Turkish Deputy Energy
Minister Selahattin Cimen said at that conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But given the regional turmoil and political ramifications
of building a pipeline to Turkey, it may be less imminent than
the rumours suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has already made an
enemy along his longest border with Syria, having turned his
back on one-time friend, President Bashar al-Assad and embraced
the rebels fighting him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course the Turks want access to Kurdish energy, but is
it worth torpedo-ing relations with Baghdad when you have a
crisis in Syria to deal with?," Mills said. "I think they may
wait."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to resolve claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it deceived investors in the Abacus collateralized debt obligation, theres been a giant question mark hovering over the hedge fund Paulson  Co. Paulson worked with Goldman Sachs to select the CDOs reference portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, then reaped the profits from a short position when the instrument failed. The implication was that Paulson picked securities that doomed Abacus, but the SEC never brought a case against the hedge fund. And when the bond insurer ACA Financial Guaranty, which was nominally the portfolio selection agent on the CDO, sued in 2011 to recover the $30 million it lost (plus punitive damages), it named only Goldman as a defendant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on Wednesday, New York State Supreme Court Justice&#160;Barbara Kapnick&#160;of Manhattan ruled from the bench that ACA can file an amended complaint  and this one names Paulson  Co and the Paulson Credit Opportunities fund as defendants. The&#160;49-page suit, which was attached as an exhibit to ACAs motion to file, adds&#160;layers of detail&#160;to what was previously known about Paulsons involvement with the Abacus CDO, based on discovery not only from ACAs suit but also from the SECs ongoing case against former Goldman vice president Fabrice Tourre. There arent huge surprises in the new evidence, but the disclosure of a side agreement between Goldman and Paulson and of a phone conversation in which Goldman assures ACA that Paulson has a long position appear to bolster ACAs assertion that it was the dupe of a secret deal between the investment bank and the hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very significant event, said ACA counsel&#160;Marc Kasowitz&#160;of&#160;Kasowitz, Benson, Torres  Friedman. Its the first time Paulson has been fronted for having a share of the responsibility in Abacus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the new complaint, Paulson talked about shorting MBS-referenced CDOs with three banks besides Goldman: Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank. Bear and Morgan Stanley both balked; ACA alleges that the Morgan Stanley deal fell through after the collateral manager, Trust Company of the West, expressed concern about the arrangement. Deutsche Bank, however, supposedly had Paulson interview potential collateral managers for a 2007 CDO. According to the complaint, emails show that the hedge fund agreed both to play the role of an equity investor when the fund met with candidates and to stick to the script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those allegations are tantalizing, but theyre really not central to ACAs case. More significant for the purposes of establishing liability to ACA are the insurers new allegations about behind-the-scenes negotiations between Paulson and Goldman. According to the complaint, Paulson was concerned that if Goldman Sachs, as the initial protection buyer of the credit default swap piece of Abacus, defaulted on the CDS, then the hedge fund wouldnt be able to reap the benefit of its short, which was structured as a separate CDS with Goldman. Paulson wanted the Abacus deal to permit the fund to step into Goldmans place as initial protection buyer in the event of default. But according to the complaint, Goldman was worried that if the indenture documents specified Paulson as a replacement counterparty, the hedge funds overall role in Abacus would have to be disclosed. So instead, ACA asserts, the indenture documents gave Goldman the right to appoint a successor  and an undisclosed side agreement between Goldman and Paulson, executed in April 2007, said that Paulson would be that successor (if the fund wanted to be). The complaint also alleges that Goldman was so eager to serve Paulson, which paid the bank $15 million to put the Abacus deal together, that it agreed to take on an additional $100 million of risk on the CDO so the hedge fund could take a bigger short position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACA claims that it was unaware of the side agreement, and, indeed, of Paulsons short. The bond insurers suit alleges that Goldman and Paulson actively deceived ACA into believing that Paulson was an equity investor whose interests were aligned with those of the insurer. The new complaint includes a snippet of transcript from a phone call on Jan. 17, 2007, in which a Goldman managing director expressly and unequivocally misrepresented  Paulsons economic interest. (Goldman supposedly said that Paulsons position was 100 percent equity.) In addition, ACAs new complaint cites testimony from the SEC case, in which a Paulson representative said that the funds aim in its analysis of the Abacus reference portfolio was opposite ACAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Procedurally, Justice Kapnicks decision to permit ACA to file the new complaint puts the bond insurer in good shape. Last April, the judge&#160;partially denied Goldmans motion to dismiss&#160;ACAs previous complaint, despite Goldmans argument that&#160;ACA was a sophisticated counterparty&#160;that could easily have investigated Paulsons role itself. Goldmans lead counsel,&#160;Richard Klapper&#160;of&#160;Sullivan  Cromwell, argued the appeal of Kapnicks ruling earlier this month at the state Appellate Division, First Department. But according to ACA counsel Kasowitz, even if the appeals court overturns Kapnick and dismisses the previous complaint, the bond insurer still has live claims for fraudulent concealment and inducement through the new complaint. If Paulson makes the same motion to dismiss that Goldman Sachs made, given Justice Kapnicks decision, that motion would obviously be denied, Kasowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klapper didnt return my call and a Goldman spokesman declined a request for comment from my Reuters colleague Karen Freifeld. But Goldman argued in its&#160;opposition to ACAs motion&#160;to file a new complaint that the bond insurer is quoting way too selectively from phone calls between itself and Goldman. By the time ACA committed to the Abacus deal in May 2007, Goldman asserted, the bond insurer had been expressly informed of Paulsons short position  and, according to Goldman, that assertion is backed by the recording of a May 8, 2007, phone conversation between a senior ACA executive and a Morgan Stanley bond trader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If ACA believed that Paulsons position in Abacus was important  ACA could have asked Paulson about its investment objectives at any time during the almost five months between its first meeting with Paulson on January 8 and the closing of the swap transaction on May 31, the brief said. But if there were any doubt that ACA knew or could have known by May 31 that Paulson did not intend to take a long position in Abacus, that uncertainty was dispelled by the May 8 recording, which demonstrates unequivocally that ACA actually knew of Paulsons doomsday short strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Paulson representative sent an email comment on Kapnicks decision: We firmly believe that the amendment by ACA to include Paulson as a defendant is completely without merit. As the SEC said back in 2010, Paulson was not the subject of the SECs Abacus investigation, made no misrepresentations, and was not the subject of any charges. As there is no basis in law or fact for the amendment, Paulson will defend itself against this baseless action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more of my posts, please go to&#160;Thomson Reuters News  Insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co held what it called a "productive conversation" with an Arab-American group that labeled the firm's Super Bowl ad racist, but will not change the commercial featuring an Arab walking through a desert with a camel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We did express regret that the ad had been misunderstood," Coca-Cola spokeswoman Lauren Thompson said in an email. "We are very concerned by these allegations and in no way is our ad meant to be derogatory to any group."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, which sharply criticized the commercial, said on Thursday it was pleased with the company's apology and explanation, and believed the issue had been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the group had said it would ask Coca-Cola to change the spot before CBS airs the game this coming Sunday in front of an expected audience of more than 100 million U.S. viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson said Coca Cola had not changed the ad, which was released online last week. It shows an Arab walking through a desert pulling a camel, as cowboys, Las Vegas show girls and a motley crew fashioned after the marauders of the apocalyptic "Mad Max" film, race by him to reach a gigantic bottle of Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ad asks viewers to vote online on which characters should win the race. The online website does not allow a vote for the Arab character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADC and other groups cried foul over the image, and also the fact that it was not possible to vote for the Arab character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren David, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said Coca-Cola had been "very apologetic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They ... said their intention was not to sustain the Arab stereotype," he said. "We believe the issue is resolved and are now comfortable that Coke was in no way trying to demonize the Arab culture or race."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abed Ayoub, director of legal and policy affairs for the group, said it now had a better understanding of Coca-Cola's campaign, although he expected the ad would still rankle some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel once the entire campaign comes through, then people will understand our position," said Ayoub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola said the vote would run as planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imam Ali Siddiqui, president of the Muslim Institute for Interfaith Studies, said the ad was racist, "portraying Arabs as backward and foolish Camel Jockeys, and they have no chance to win in the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coca-Cola spokeswoman said Coke had taken a "cinematic" approach, employing the characters as a nod to movies of the past. "Coca-Cola is an inclusive brand enjoyed by all demographics," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 60-second video was the first commercial of Coca-Cola's two-part Super Bowl advertising campaign. The spot will air during the game, followed by a different one in the post-Game telecast. Content for the campaign will also air online across Tumblr, Twitter and many other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke will air two other unrelated Super Bowl commercials on Sunday, including one during the game and another during the pre-game portion of the telecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADC garnered attention back in 1992 when it complained that lyrics in the Walt Disney animated film "Aladdin" were racist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Susan Zeidler; Editing by Alden Bentley and David Brunnstrom)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sue Zeidler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Jan 31 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co held what it called a "productive conversation" with an Arab-American group that labeled the  firm's Super Bowl ad racist, but will not change the commercial featuring an Arab walking through a desert with a camel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did express regret that the ad had been misunderstood," Coca-Cola spokeswoman Lauren Thompson said in an email. "We are very concerned by these allegations and in no way is our ad meant to be derogatory to any group."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, which sharply criticized the commercial, said on Thursday it was pleased with the company's apology and explanation, and believed the issue had been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the group had said it would ask Coca-Cola to change the spot before CBS airs the game this coming Sunday in front of an expected audience of more than 100 million U.S. viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson said Coca Cola had not changed the ad, which was released online last week. It shows an Arab walking through a desert pulling a camel, as cowboys, Las Vegas show girls and a motley crew fashioned after the marauders of the apocalyptic "Mad Max" film, race by him to reach a gigantic bottle of Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ad asks viewers to vote online on which characters should win the race. The online website does not allow a vote for the Arab character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADC and other groups cried foul over the image, and also the fact that it was not possible to vote for the Arab character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren David, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said Coca-Cola had been "very apologetic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They ... said their intention was not to sustain the Arab stereotype," he said. "We believe the issue is resolved and are now comfortable that Coke was in no way trying to demonize the Arab culture or race."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abed Ayoub, director of legal and policy affairs for the group, said it now had a better understanding of Coca-Cola's campaign, although he expected the ad would still rankle some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel once the entire campaign comes through, then people will understand our position," said Ayoub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola said the vote would run as planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imam Ali Siddiqui, president of the Muslim Institute for Interfaith Studies, said the ad was racist, "portraying Arabs as backward and foolish Camel Jockeys, and they have no chance to win in the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coca-Cola spokeswoman said Coke had taken a "cinematic" approach, employing the characters as a nod to movies of the past. "Coca-Cola is an inclusive brand enjoyed by all demographics," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 60-second video was the first commercial of Coca-Cola's two-part Super Bowl advertising campaign. The spot will air during the game, followed by a different one in the post-Game telecast. Content for the campaign will also air online across Tumblr, Twitter and many other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke will air two other unrelated Super Bowl commercials on Sunday, including one during the game and another during the pre-game portion of the telecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADC garnered attention back in 1992 when it complained that lyrics in the Walt Disney animated film "Aladdin" were racist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 31 (Reuters) - John Paulson's hedge fund will
have to defend claims that his firm conspired with Goldman Sachs
Group Inc to fraudulently induce a bond insurer to
guarantee payments on risky debt, court papers show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond insurer ACA Financial on Thursday filed an amended

Opportunities Master II Ltd as defendants in a $120 million
lawsuit it brought against Goldman in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit centers on a collateralized debt obligation
known as Abacus, which ACA claimed was designed to fail so that

Company consolidates supply and trading functions into single supply and trading
services operation within Gas and Midstream organization
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) saidtoday that it will realign its Gas and
Midstream business by consolidating the company`s supply and trading functions
into a single supply and trading group within Chevron`s Gas and Midstream
organization. 

Until now, Chevron`s Downstream organization oversaw the company`s trading
operations for crude oil and refined products, while the company`s Gas and
Midstream business was responsible for Chevron`s natural gas and liquefied
natural gas trading operations. 

"These changes will more tightly integrate our supply and trading activities and
allow our Gas and Midstream organization to create value across our upstream and
downstream assets," said Chevron Chairman and CEO John Watson. 

Watson said that Joseph C. (Joe) Geagea, 53, will lead the new organization and
retain his title as corporate vice president and president, Chevron Gas and
Midstream. In addition to supply and trading, Geagea will continue to be
responsible for the company`s shipping, pipeline, power and gas
commercialization operations. Geagea will report to Watson in his expanded role
effective immediately. The new Gas and Midstream organization will be effective
June 1, 2013. 

"Joe`s enterprise-wide experience makes him well qualified to lead this
organization," added Watson. 

Geagea joined Chevron in 1982. Since the early 1990s, he has held a variety of
executive and management positions in both the upstream and downstream
operations of the company. Previously, Geagea was managing director, Chevron
Asia South Ltd., Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production Company.
Earlier, he was vice president, Upstream Capability, Chevron International
Exploration and Production Company. He also served as president of Fuel &amp; Marine
Marketing and as president of the company`s downstream operations in East
Africa, the Middle East and Pakistan. Following the Chevron and Texaco merger in
2001, Geagea led the integration of the two companies` downstream operations. 

Chevron is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies, with
subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company is involved in
virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and lubricants; manufactures and sells petrochemical
products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy
efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future, including
biofuels. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron
is available at www.chevron.com.

&lt;p&gt;
http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/8knews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20130131:nBw315778a

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc. said today that the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware ruled that Pfizer`s patent covering a method for using sirolimus, the
active ingredient in RAPAMUNE, for the inhibition of organ transplant rejection
is valid and infringed. The company brought a patent infringement action in
April 2010 against the generic company Watson Laboratories, Inc-Florida (now
known as Actavis) and three other Watson entities after Watson applied to the
FDA to market a generic version of RAPAMUNE. The Court`s decision prevents
Watson from marketing its generic version of RAPAMUNE in the U.S. before
Pfizer`s patent expires, pending a possible appeal by Watson. 

The patent at issue in the lawsuit is U.S. Patent No. 5,100,899, which including
pediatric exclusivity, expires January 7, 2014. In response to the decision, Amy
Schulman, Executive Vice President and General Counsel for Pfizer, said, "We are
pleased with the Court`s decision, recognizing the validity of our patent." 

In the United States, RAPAMUNE is indicated for the prevention of organ
transplant rejection in kidney transplant patients aged 13 years and older. 

Important Safety Information

* There is an increased risk of developing infections or certain cancers,
especially lymphoma and skin cancers.Rapamune has not been shown to be safe and
effective in people who have had liver or lung transplants. Serious
complications and death may happen in people who take Rapamune after a liver or
lung transplant.You should not take Rapamune if you have had a liver or lung
transplant without talking with your doctor.
* Do not take Rapamune if you know you are allergic to sirolimus or any of the
other ingredients in Rapamune. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include swelling
of your face, eyes, or mouth; trouble breathing or wheezing; throat tightness;
chest pain or tightness; feeling dizzy or faint; and rash or peeling of your
skin. 
* Before taking Rapamune, tell your doctor if you have liver problems, skin
cancer or it runs in your family, high cholesterol or triglycerides, are
breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, and are pregnant or plan to become
pregnant. Women of childbearing potential should use effective birth control
before therapy, during therapy, and for 12 weeks after Rapamune therapy has been
stopped. Rapamune may interact with other medicines. Make sure that your doctor
is aware of all prescription and over-the-counter drugs that you are taking,
including vitamins, herbs, and nutritional supplements. 
* Rapamune may cause swelling in your hands, feet, and in various tissues of
your body. Call your doctor if you have trouble breathing.
* Rapamune may cause your wounds to heal slowly or not heal well resulting in
redness, drainage, or opening of the wound.
* Rapamune may increase the levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (lipids or
fat) in your blood. Your doctor should do blood tests to check your lipids
during treatment with Rapamune. Your doctor may recommend treatment if your
lipid levels become too high. Your lipid levels may remain high even if you
follow your prescribed treatment plan.
* In patients taking Rapamune with cyclosporine, decreased kidney function has
been observed. Your doctor will regularly check your kidney function. 
* Rapamune may increase protein in your urine. Your doctor may monitor you for
abnormal protein in your urine from time to time. 
* Rapamune may increase your risk for viral infections. Certain viruses can live
in your body and cause active infections when your immune system is weak. One of
these viruses, BK virus, can affect how your kidney works and cause your
transplanted kidney to fail. A certain virus can cause a rare serious brain
infection called Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy causing death or
severe disability.
* Rapamune may cause potentially life-threatening lung or breathing problems.
Symptoms may include coughing, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing.
* When Rapamune is taken with cyclosporine or tacrolimus, you may develop a
blood clotting problem resulting in unexplained bleeding or bruising.
* Common side effects associated with Rapamune include high blood pressure, pain
(including stomach and joint pain), diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract
infection, low red blood cell count (anemia), nausea, and low platelet count
(cells that help blood to clot). If you experience any side effects, contact
your doctor.

Indications and Usage

RAPAMUNE (sirolimus) is indicated for the prevention of organ rejection in
kidney transplant patients aged 13 years or older. Blood levels of sirolimus
should be checked in all patients taking Rapamune.

* In patients at low to moderate risk of acute rejection, it is recommended that
Rapamune be used initially in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids;
cyclosporine should be withdrawn approximately 3 months after transplantation.
Cyclosporine withdrawal has not been studied in patients who have had severe
acute rejection prior to cyclosporine withdrawal, those who require dialysis or
have a high serum creatinine, Black patients, patients receiving a repeat kidney
transplant, patients receiving other transplanted organs besides the kidney
transplant, or patients with antibodies that may be directed against the kidney
transplant. 
* In patients at high risk of acute rejection (defined as Black patients and/or
patients receiving a repeat kidney transplant who lost a previous kidney
transplant from rejection and/or patients with high levels of antibodies that
may be directed against the kidney transplant), it is recommended that Rapamune
be used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for the first year
following transplantation. The safety and efficacy of this combination in
high-risk patients have not been studied beyond one year; therefore, after the
first year, adjustments to the immunosuppressive regimen may be considered by
your doctor.

In pediatric patients, the safety and efficacy of Rapamune have not been
established in kidney transplant patients less than 13 years old, or in patients
less than 18 years old who are considered at high risk of acute rejection.

* The safety and efficacy of Rapamune without cyclosporine in newly transplanted
kidney patients have not been established.

* The safety and efficacy of changing from either cyclosporine or tacrolimus to
Rapamune in maintenance kidney transplant patients have not been established.

Please see full Prescribing Information for Rapamune, including Boxed Warning
and Medication Guide here.

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co' (JPM.N) fund unit is expecting to raise up to $150 million in Taiwan to invest in A shares in mainland China, an executive of its Taiwan fund arm said on Thursday, marking the first such fund as cross-strait ties accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move comes as China said this week that it will allot investment quotas of up to 100 billion yuan ($16 billion) for Taiwanese seeking to put money into its financial markets under the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have got the QFII quota from China regulators," said Jason Pu, an executive director of JPMorgan Asset Management in Taiwan.
