&lt;p&gt;* Alison Watkins quits GrainCorp to head local Coke bottler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Move follows Australia blocking ADM's A$2.8 bln GrainCorp
takeover&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* GrainCorp shares slip 1.4 percent, CCA shares rise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The chief executive of GrainCorp
Ltd has resigned just days after Australia's government
rejected a takeover of the grains handler by U.S. agribusiness
giant Archer Daniels Midland Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alison Watkins, who she had planned to leave GrainCorp once
ADM had secured control of the company, will take over as
managing director of Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCA), the
bottler said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey rejected ADM's A$2.8 billion
($2.6 billion) bid for GrainCorp on Friday, bowing to pressure
from grain growers in a rare and surprising decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The expectation in the investment community was that ADM's
offer for GrainCorp would be approved and effected in the near
term," said Graincorp Chairman Don Taylor, who will assume a
temporary role as executive chairman while a search for a
replacement is conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In that context, it is not surprising that an executive of
Alison's calibre has attracted interest and had new
opportunities presented to her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA said Watkins, who ran GrainCorp for three-and-a-half
years, would start in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in GrainCorp, which plunged by almost a quarter on
Friday after Hockey rejected ADM's bid, were down 1.4 percent on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which dominates Australia's east coast grains
handling and storage business, has been diversifying with recent
deals in the malting and oil seeds businesses. Its earnings
however have come under pressure as grains harvests retreat from
record volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA shares rose 1.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

planning processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capital plans are part of the stress-testing regime
meant to determine how the biggest U.S. banks would fare in a
financial meltdown. Regulators began the tests after the
2007-2009 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, the Fed approved Goldman's and JPMorgan's plans to
buy back shares and pay dividends, but regulators told both
banks to fix flaws in how they determined capital payouts to
shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTTAWA, Ontario, Dec. 2, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Software resellers and academic institutions looking for a fast and reliable
			method of deploying the new Microsoft&#174; Student Advantage program
			can now offer the full benefits of the program to students through a new provisioning service launched today by Kivuto Solutions Inc., the world's leading provider of hosted, flexible and scalable solutions for complex digital distribution requirements.
			
	Built on Kivuto's Electronic License Management System (ELMS), the new service enables software resellers to provide academic institutions with an quick and effective way to get cloud-based Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus productivity suite to eligible students. With this service, any academic institution currently licensing Microsoft Office Professional Plus or Office 365 ProPlus for all of their faculty and staff through an eligible Microsoft Academic Volume License Agreement can provide students with no-cost licenses of Office 365 through an ELMS web store.
			
	"By working with Kivuto, the reseller and the institution avoid the challenging time and labor intensive integration process resulting from deploying and managing the Student Advantage program independently," said Brad Brohman, Vice-President, Sales. "Our reseller partners work with institutions to get them on board. We then work with schools to deploy a custom-branded web store as well as provide program and customer support. There is no on-going management requirement for the school and no additional effort needed by the reseller. The whole process can be accomplished in about two business days, at which point students will have instant access to all the benefits of Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus. We are excited about this approach and believe it's a win-win for all involved."
			
	The Microsoft Student Advantage program allows academic institutions that are offering Office to all of their faculty and staff to offer it to their students at no additional cost. Office 365 ProPlus provides students with an Office suite that they can use both offline on their PC, Mac or mobile device and in the cloud, and it includes everything they need to succeed at school, including Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook  Lync. This allows faculty and students to work together in real time on assignments, group projects, and research, and communicate seamlessly through e-mail, instant messaging, or online classrooms.
			
	Web stores built by Kivuto to deliver the Student Advantage program are powered by the Kivuto ELMS platform, the most flexible, secure, scalable and customizable digital distribution and management system on the market.

      Research and Markets: Global System Integration Services Market Analysis 
      2012-2016 with Accenture, IBM, Lockheed Martin  Fujitsu Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/9k52s3/global_system) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      System Integration Services Market 2012-2016" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global System Integration Services market to grow at a CAGR of 
      5.86 percent over the period 2012-2016.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the most important factors is the increased demand for cloud 
      computing services. This service is increasing the demand for 
      integration services as it is easily accessible and flexible. Moreover, 
      this relieves organizations from the burden of owning and setting up IT 
      infrastructure. This is particularly helpful to start-ups and small 
      businesses that do not want to invest readily in costly infrastructures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The system integration services include a gamut of services that are 
      focused on precise areas of technology. However, a particular trend is 
      witnessed that organizations are turning away from large global system 
      integrators as they are becoming wiser with their outsourcing decisions. 
      Organizations are looking for services that deliver tangible benefits 
      and results rather than being involved in large and complex projects 
      which are often expensive and do not show clear results for clients. 
      Mobile application is one such application that is gaining importance 
      and traditional system integrators that have a broad spectrum of 
      services often fail to successfully implement it. Therefore, 
      organizations are reaching out to specialist system integrators, without 
      which areas such as mobility will not be appropriately aligned to 
      business strategy and thus will not fetch expected benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the 
      unstable economic conditions in developed economies. The global economic 
      slowdown of 2008-2009 has retarded the growth rate of overall IT 
      spending, particularly in the US and Western Europe. These two markets 
      are the highest adopters of system integration services and any 
      instability in their spending affects the Global System Integration 
      Services market abruptly.

			&lt;p&gt;BURNABY, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Dec 2, 2013) -  Academic research and industry were strengthened today thanks to federal funding for the Vancouver Institute for Visual Analytics (VIVA) announced by Andrew Saxton, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance and Member of Parliament for North Vancouver, on behalf of the Honourable Michelle Rempel, Minister of State for Western Economic Diversification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Innovation is an important engine of economic growth and job creation; here in British Columbia we're fortunate to have cutting-edge research labs and groundbreaking entrepreneurs," said Parliamentary Secretary Saxton. "By partnering with industry and academic institutions, our Government is working to bridge the gap between academia, training and industry and to ensure the continued success of western Canadian businesses and our entrepreneurs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investment of $513,141 will help VIVA, a partnership between Simon Fraser University (SFU), the University of British Columbia and industry, establish the Visual Analytics Research and Instructional Laboratories (VARILab) for visual analytics training and education at UBC and at SFU's Burnaby campus. The funding will be used to purchase an IBM private cloud computing platform, providing students, faculty and VIVA's industry partners with scalable, secure access to servers, storage, applications and services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concurrently, IBM is making an in-kind contribution of its leading analytics software applications, valued at $800,000. The software will enable VIVA researchers to, for the first time, visually analyze "Big Data" - a term given to the abundance of information generated by a growing list of sources such as smartphones, social networks, instrumentation, GPS and sensors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Organizations are operating in a world of accelerating complexity and massively available data," said Dan Fortin, president of IBM Canada. "Our aim is to help VIVA work with its industry partners to turn that data into a strategic asset. Today's investment supports IBM's continued commitment to collaborate with academia and government to help further advance Canada's ability to innovate, address a critical skills gap, and drive analytics research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual analytics is an emerging science and will enable future new industries. Companies who train employees in the field are finding the skills useful in creating practical solutions to data-related problems. IBM and VIVA are currently working with VIVA partners to apply the analysis of big data sets in a number of sectors including healthcare, aviation, insurance and oceanography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the support of our partners in this project, VIVA now has an advanced infrastructure for virtual computation to conduct visual analytics applied research anywhere," pointed out Dr. Fred Popowich, Director of the Visual Institute for Visual Analytics. "This enables research, training and education to be supported by the best technology and tools, and be made available from the new Laboratory located at MAGIC at UBC and from the laboratory here at IRMACS, on the SFU - Burnaby Campus. The infrastructure will also be accessible by other universities in Western Canada that are part of the Canadian Network for Visual Analytics (CANVAC), benefiting not only SFU and UBC students and researchers, but also western Canadian companies and universities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2006, the Harper Government, through WD, has invested in job-creating small- and medium-sized businesses, aerospace, marine and defence industries, and supported innovative entrepreneurs in pursuing emerging markets. By continuing to promote new economic opportunities, WD is helping to create jobs, economic growth, and long-term prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribe to news releases and keep up-to-date on the latest from WD.

      is also witnessing vendors providing hybrid private branch exchange 
      systems which enable enterprises to benefit from next-generation IP 
      solutions without replacing their existing systems. Some of the benefits 
      of implementing UC solutions include increased productivity, increased 
      flexibility for employees, and a faster response time for information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the main challenges is the huge 
      capital investments. Enterprises are reluctant to bear the high cost of 
      transforming traditional data centers in green data centers, as huge 
      capital investments are required to procure new components for green 
      data centers. The traditional data centers are equipped with outdated 
      components which consume more power, thereby increasing the operational 
      costs of data centers.

      Research and Markets: Global Smart Grid Cyber Security Market, 2016 with 
      BAE Systems, IBM, IOActive, Lockheed Martin, Siemens, Verisign  ViaSat 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/3f6vgq/global_smart_grid) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Smart Grid Cyber Security Market 2012-2016" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Smart Grid Cyber Security market to grow at a CAGR of 29.43 
      percent over the period 2012-2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers is the increase in occurrence of cyber threats. 
      The increase in adoption of smart grids, which facilitate two-way 
      communications through various communication networking, increases the 
      threat of cyber-attacks. As this hampers the security of sensitive and 
      personal data of the smart grid customers, the demand for smart grid 
      cyber security systems has increased. This in turn boosts the growth of 
      the Global Smart Grid Cyber Security market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Smart Grid market has been witnessing new vulnerabilities 
      over the years. Approximately 4,396 new vulnerabilities were detected 
      during 2010, which may increase in the coming years. The different 
      components within smart grids, which are prone to virus attacks are IT 
      systems such as computers, servers, databases, and web services; 
      communications networks such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and ZigBee; operational 
      technologies such as supervisory control and data acquisition, power 
      line communications, energy management systems, and intelligent 
      electronic devices; end access points such as smart meters, smartphones, 
      and other mobile devices; and human influences such as lack of training 
      and misuse of universal serial bus drives. Due to the increase in the 
      complexity of the smart grid networks it has increased the threat of 
      cyber-attacks, which is in turn driving the growth of the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the lack of disclosure mechanisms. Various power utilities 
      across the world are reluctant to disclose the occurrence of smart grid 
      cyber-attacks, due to the fear of more grid vulnerabilities being 
      exposed. If more vulnerabilities are exposed it will reduce the loyalty 
      of various customers. The disclosure mechanism in the industry is also 
      weak; this will in turn make it difficult for the market to grow at a 
      fast pace in the future.

      Research and Markets: Global Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service Market 
      2014-2018: Accenture, CA, Geminare, IBM  SunGard Data Systems Dominate
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/54pcds/global_disaster) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service Market 2014-2018" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service market to grow at a CAGR of 
      54.64 percent over the period 2014-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers is the increased need for flexibility among 
      user organizations. Cloud-based disaster recovery services are more 
      flexible than traditional disaster recovery services; this is mainly 
      because with the adoption of cloud-based services, end-users are able to 
      concentrate more on organizational core activities than on managing 
      infrastructure and applications. Further, enterprises are able to 
      establish a rapid deployment model that enables applications to be 
      scaled quickly to match increased usage requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of an increase in the adoption of the hybrid cloud, SMEs 
      have found that applying the same to disaster recovery brings huge 
      benefits. For years businesses have been crippled by the challenges of 
      using tape and disk backup services. Thus, SMEs are expected to 
      increasingly embrace hybrid cloud disaster recovery during the forecast 
      period. Hybrid cloud disaster recovery is a combination of onsite 
      hardware and software with cloud-based recovery. Adoption of hybrid 
      cloud disaster recovery by businesses will eliminate the need for a 
      secondary disaster recovery site. Moreover, it will reduce the expenses 
      and complexities of managing and maintaining such systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the lack 
      of proper checks on backup data. Since through cloud computing the 
      disaster recovery infrastructure is no longer in a client's premises and 
      outsourcing of services is commonly practiced, user organizations do not 
      check backup operations regularly. Therefore, if regular backup of data 
      is not done, it increases the threat of data loss.

			Chevron Increases Total Global Fund Investment to $60 Million
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			$5 million investment makes Chevron single largest private sector 
      partner
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) announced that it will commit an 
      additional $5 million over two years to The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
      Tuberculosis and Malaria to target the prevention of mother-to-child 
      transmission of HIV (PMTCT) in Nigeria. This commitment raises Chevron&#8217;s 
      8-year investment in the Global Fund to $60 million, making the company 
      the single largest private sector partner to the organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We recognize the deep interdependence of healthy businesses and healthy 
      societies,&#8221; said Rhonda Zygocki, executive vice president, Policy and 
      Planning for Chevron Corporation. &#8220;Our continued partnership with the 
      Global Fund reflects our long-term commitment to investing in health, 
      education and economic development initiatives that help build strong 
      communities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron became The Global Fund&#8217;s inaugural Corporate Champion in January 
      2008, when it committed $30 million to support AIDS, tuberculosis and 
      malaria programs in Asia and Africa. In 2010, the company made an 
      additional commitment of $25 million to fight HIV/AIDS and PMTCT in 
      Angola, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In expanding its reach, Chevron initially chose The Global Fund as a 
      partner in 2008 because its performance-based model provides an 
      efficient and highly-impactful way to sustain healthy communities around 
      the world. The Global Fund also places a significant emphasis on 
      measurement and evaluation of the programs it funds, ensuring that 
      Chevron&#8217;s investments are making a tangible difference. To date, Chevron 
      has played a part in saving 8.7 million lives through the company&#8217;s 
      support of The Global Fund.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron has shown commendable leadership in the fight against 
      infectious diseases,&#8221; said Dr. Mark Dybul, the executive director of The 
      Global Fund. &#8220;With shared responsibility and strong partnerships with 
      governments, civil society and private sector players like Chevron, we 
      will defeat these deadly diseases. Chevron&#8217;s strong support helps bring 
      us ever closer to this historic opportunity.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron has been at the forefront of the fight against AIDS since 1986 
      when it joined other U.S. companies to promote education and reduce 
      stigma in the workplace. In the 1990s, Chevron expanded efforts 
      internationally and in 2005 was the first energy company to institute a 
      global HIV and AIDS policy supporting employees and their families.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies, with 
      subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company is involved in 
      virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for, 
      produces and transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and

	ZELTIQ is a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing its proprietary controlled-cooling technology platform. ZELTIQ's first commercial product, the CoolSculpting System, is designed to selectively reduce stubborn fat that may not respond to diet or exercise. CoolSculpting is based on the scientific principle that fat cells are more sensitive to cold than the overlying skin and surrounding tissues. It utilizes patented technology of precisely controlled cooling to reduce the temperature of fat cells in the treated area, which is intended to cause fat cell elimination through a natural biological process known as apoptosis. ZELTIQ developed CoolSculpting to safely, noticeably, and measurably reduce the fat layer.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Investor Relations:

      one of the biggest IT asset in France with 160,000 users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Bull-Osiatis consortium will be providing an end-to-end solution 
      using modern, integrated email, file-sharing, video-conferencing and 
      instant messaging solutions (Exchange, SharePoint and Lync). The 
      consortium will be providing the following services:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Engineering and implementation of a private cloud infrastructure
      
			
        Business continuity for the current solution

        Secure running of these unified solutions and management via a service 
        catalogue, on a pay-per-use basis.

      Osiatis&#8217; secure service facilities. This is currently the world&#8217;s 
      biggest private cloud infrastructure project using Microsoft 
      technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Bull-Osiatis consortium will continue to assist EDF with change 
      management and modernising its infrastructure, with a minimum 5-year 
      contract, and will thus provide the energy group with unified 
      communication solutions to enable them to face the business challenges 
      of tomorrow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Thanks to this major project, Osiatis and Bull will assist EDF in 
      overhauling their collaborative and communication tools and thus 
      transform their businesses and enable their employees to communicate

&lt;p&gt;* Local residents oppose shale gas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Romania has substantial reserves of recoverable gas-US
data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUCHAREST Dec 2 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron 
has resumed its search for shale gas in eastern Romania, it said
on Monday, despite opposition from local residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October the company won approval to drill exploratory
wells in the small town of Pungesti in the impoverished eastern
county of Vaslui but had to halt works soon after as local
residents blocked access to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people have rallied across Romania in recent
months to protest against government support for shale gas
exploration and separate plans to set up Europe's largest open
cast gold mine in a small Carpathian town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron can confirm that it has resumed operations," the
company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our priority is to conduct these activities in a safe and
environmentally responsible manner consistent with the permits
under which we operate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday up to 300 riot police were in Pungesti, 340 km
(210 miles) northeast of capital Bucharest, blocking a road and
barring residents from the Chevron site, a spokeswoman told
local television stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villagers have been taking turns guarding the site since
October, sleeping in tents. They oppose the project and say they
do not want what they say are the environmental risks of
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking - the process of injecting
water and chemicals at high pressure into shale formations to
release the gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that
Romania could potentially recover 51 trillion cubic feet of
shale gas, which would cover domestic demand for more than a
century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, which also has rights to explore three licence
blocks near the Black Sea, does not have plans to use fracking
under its five-year exploration programme.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Paris, 02 december 2013&#160;- EDF is launching a project to renovate and unify all its collaborative and email solutions for the whole group. EDF SA and ERDF together have one of the biggest IT asset in France with 160,000 users.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Bull-Osiatis consortium will be providing an end-to-end solution using modern, integrated email, file-sharing, video-conferencing and instant messaging solutions (Exchange, SharePoint and Lync). The consortium will be providing the following services:&lt;/p&gt;
		
			Engineering and implementation of a private cloud infrastructure
			Business continuity for the current solution
			Migration to Microsoft solutions
			Secure running of these unified solutions and management via a service catalogue, on a pay-per-use basis.
		
		
		&lt;p&gt;The highly secure, scalable, redundant infrastructures will be hosted at two of EDF Group's data centres. They include 68 bullion servers, 400 virtual machines and 1000 TB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This effective solution will thus be able to serve the client's 160,000 users and will be monitored and administrated remotely from Bull and Osiatis' secure service facilities. This is currently the world's biggest private cloud infrastructure project using Microsoft technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Bull-Osiatis consortium will continue to assist EDF with change management and modernising its infrastructure, with a minimum 5-year contract, and will thus provide the energy group with unified communication solutions to enable them to face the business challenges of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Thanks to this major project, Osiatis and Bull will assist &#160;EDF in overhauling their collaborative and communication tools and thus transform their businesses and enable their employees to communicate more easily, share knowledge and pass on skills and expertise more effectively, whilst optimising operating costs," said Bruno Grossi, co-chairman of Osiatis. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Bull is continuing its strategy for developing cloud computing IT solutions to help its clients update their IT systems. We are very proud to be assisting EDF in carrying out this strategic project," said Philippe Miltin, Bull's Executive Vice-President of Computing Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmaker Andrew Tyrie called for a review of fees paid to advisers on M deals after it emerged JP Morgan (JPM.N) had a financial incentive for the Co-operative Bank's CPBB_p.L ill-fated 2009 takeover of Britannia to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan executives on Tuesday told Britain's Treasury Select Committee, which Tyrie chairs, that the U.S. bank was paid 7 million pounds ($11.5 million) for advising Co-op on the deal, 5 million of which was contingent on the transaction being completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A fee structure for the provision of independent advice that heavily incentivises one outcome over others strikes me as inherently problematic," Tyrie said after a Treasury committee hearing. "The industry and the regulators will need to look closely at the way such advice is remunerated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Britannia takeover, which saddled Co-op with a portfolio of souring property loans, was a major factor behind a 1.5 billion capital shortfall at the bank which has resulted in it falling under the control of U.S. hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Wise, a managing director at JP Morgan's UK investment bank, said the payment reflected the way the industry worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyrie had earlier suggested to JP Morgan executives they had a considerable financial interest in seeing this deal through to completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You weren't sitting there neutrally giving advice, you were thinking there's 5 million riding on this," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wise defended the arrangement, which is not untypical, and said he didn't believe JP Morgan had suffered reputational damage from advising on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of the integrity of our advice and the clarity of our advice and the honesty of our advice that is something that is absolutely fundamental to the way we work and the way the vast majority of the industry works," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The way that clients choose to pay us whether it's M transactions or capital markets transactions is (based) on the outcome of the transaction happening," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KPMG partner Andrew Walker earlier told the committee the auditor received 1.3 million pounds for its work on the deal but hadn't undertaken due diligence on Britannia's commercial loan book.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates Microsoft's Senior Unsecured Note Offering 'AA+'; Outlook 
      Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA+' rating to Microsoft Corporation's 
      (Microsoft) offering of U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated senior 
      unsecured notes. Net proceeds from the offering are expected to be used 
      for general corporate purposes, which may consist of working capital 
      funding, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and 
      repayment of existing debt. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft's ratings and Stable Outlook reflect:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Leading market positioning in its core software businesses, including 
      over 90% in PC operating systems (OS) and 75% in servers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Very strong balance sheet with nearly $81 billion in cash and 
      short-term investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Diversification of end market with consumers and enterprise demand as 
      well as strong geographic diversification. No customer is larger than 
      10% of revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's credit concerns center on:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Reliance on Windows and Office for the vast majority of free cash flow 
      (FCF). In aggregate, these products accounted for 77% of total operating 
      income, excluding unallocated corporate level expenses. However, strong 
      growth and margin expansion in the Server and Tools business has reduced 
      the contribution of Windows and Office from a four-year high of nearly 
      89%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Growing popularity of other operating systems outside of the core PC 
      space, principally Apple's iOS as well as Google's Android and Chrome 
      platforms. Fitch believes both platforms will continue to grow as 
      competitive threats to Windows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Extension of PC replacement cycle due to the popularity of tablets and 
      smartphones as well as consumer substitution of tablets in lieu of 
      traditional PCs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Minimal historical success in developing profitable consumer 
      businesses outside of Microsoft's core Windows and Office ecosystem 
      despite significant investment over a decade-plus in other consumer 
      markets. Fitch believes this is indicative of the challenging 
      competitive environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Significant dividend and share repurchase programs, though funded 
      entirely today by FCF, could pressure the company to issue increasing 
      amounts of debt to avoid repatriation of foreign earnings, which 
      represent the majority of total annual FCF.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, 
      lead to negative rating action include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Penetration of alternative operating system's such as Chrome OS in the 
      PC market and/or continued market share gains by Apple;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Greater than expected extensions of PC replacement cycles because of 
      tablets, without a commensurate gain from Microsoft Surface. Fitch 
      currently expects PC replacement cycles to extend on average up to 12 
      months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Greater acceptance of cheaper software applications that compete with 
      Microsoft Office such as Google Docs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Positive: Upside movement on the ratings is unlikely.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch currently rates Microsoft as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'AA+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt 'AA+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR 'F1+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper (CP) program 'F1+'.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Two former brokers for a JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co unit have been barred from the securities industry after they allegedly stole$300,000 from an elderly client's account and exploited her failing mental capacity to carry out the scheme, Wall Street's industry-funded watchdog said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokers, Jimmy Caballero and Fernando Arevalo, worked for JP Morgan Securities LLC in Palmdale, California, until they voluntarily resigned from the firm earlier this year, according to regulatory filings. Both worked at a retail bank affiliated with the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In settlements with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, they agreed to be barred permanently from the securities industry but neither admitted nor denied the regulator's filings, according to the settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan, which was not named in FINRA's enforcement action, reimbursed the customer, according to FINRA. A spokesman for JP Morgan, as well as Caballero and Arevalo, could not be reached for comment. FINRA did not identify the bank affiliated with JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokers' scheme occurred between April and July, FINRA said. In April, the customer, an elderly widow, deposited about $300,000 from the sale of two annuities in an account Arevalo opened for her at the JP Morgan-affiliated bank where he worked, according to FINRA. In May, Caballero opened an account at another bank, listing himself as a joint account holder with the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two cashier's checks were then issued from the customer's account where Arevalo and Caballero worked, bringing her balance to zero, FINRA said. Caballero deposited those checks in the joint account at the outside bank that same day. Caballero drove the customer to the bank, which had questioned the transfer, to personally confirm the transaction, according to FINRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arevalo and Caballero used the money for personal expenses, including payments on a real estate loan, car loan and purchases at retail stores, FINRA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn; Editing by Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 3 (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 trader who pleaded guilty to fraudulently building an
unauthorized $8.3 billion futures trade should repay $118
million to his former employer to cover its losses and spend
about three years in prison, federal prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Monday night filing in the U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, prosecutors said Matthew Taylor deserves a 33- to
41-month prison term that reflects his "blatant abuse" of the
trust placed in him by Goldman, which once considered him a
"rising star," and to deter other "rogue traders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators said the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
graduate fabricated trades and lied to supervisors to conceal an
$8.3 billion bet on Standard &amp; Poor's 500 e-mini futures
contracts, which bet on the direction of that index, over a
two-day period in December 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The defendant took these steps out of both greed and
hubris, to improve the bottom line of his bank account and to
rehabilitate his suffering professional reputation," U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Goldman discovered the scheme on Dec. 14,
2007, and spent about $118 million to unwind the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the defendant's plea agreement estimated a loss of
$1 million to $2.5 million, prosecutors said restitution could
be greater, and that Goldman deserves to have its request to
recover all it lost fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here, Goldman Sachs is a victim," Bharara said. "Ordering
restitution to Goldman Sachs for the cost of unwinding the
defendant's position would make Goldman Sachs whole."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Nov. 22 court filing, lawyers for Taylor said the
married father of two, who turns 35 on New Year's Day and has no
prior criminal record, should spend no time in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said Taylor's conduct was the "plainly aberrant" act of
a then 28-year-old trader under "overwhelming" pressure at
Goldman to succeed, and that the risk of his committing similar
conduct again is nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However misguided, his intentions were never to harm
Goldman," Thomas Rotko, a partner at Clayman &amp; Rosenberg, wrote,
referring to Taylor. "He makes no excuses for his conduct and
accepts full responsibility for his actions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor's capacity to make restitution to Goldman was not
immediately clear. He was previously civilly fined $500,000 by
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission over his trading.
Goldman paid a $1.5 million civil fine last December to settle
CFTC charges that it failed to appropriately supervise Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rotko declined to comment on the government filing.
Bharara's office did not immediately respond to a request for
comment. A Goldman spokesman had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $8.3 billion position was double the size of a $4.1
billion trade that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
highlighted in a report on the May 6, 2010 "flash crash," where
e-mini trades caused the Dow Jones industrial average to
plunge 700 points in just a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Taylor, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York, No. 13-cr-00251.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc trader who pleaded guilty to fraudulently building an unauthorized $8.3 billion futures trade should repay $118 million to his former employer to cover its losses and spend about three years in prison, federal prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Monday night filing in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, prosecutors said Matthew Taylor deserves a 33- to 41-month prison term that reflects his "blatant abuse" of the trust placed in him by Goldman, which once considered him a "rising star," and to deter other "rogue traders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators said the Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate fabricated trades and lied to supervisors to conceal an $8.3 billion bet on Standard &amp; Poor's 500 e-mini futures contracts, which bet on the direction of that index, over a two-day period in December 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The defendant took these steps out of both greed and hubris, to improve the bottom line of his bank account and to rehabilitate his suffering professional reputation," U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Goldman discovered the scheme on December 14, 2007, and spent about $118 million to unwind the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the defendant's plea agreement estimated a loss of $1 million to $2.5 million, prosecutors said restitution could be greater, and that Goldman deserves to have its request to recover all it lost fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here, Goldman Sachs is a victim," Bharara said. "Ordering restitution to Goldman Sachs for the cost of unwinding the defendant's position would make Goldman Sachs whole."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a November 22 court filing, lawyers for Taylor said the married father of two, who turns 35 on New Year's Day and has no prior criminal record, should spend no time in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said Taylor's conduct was the "plainly aberrant" act of a then 28-year-old trader under "overwhelming" pressure at Goldman to succeed, and that the risk of his committing similar conduct again is nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However misguided, his intentions were never to harm Goldman," Thomas Rotko, a partner at Clayman &amp; Rosenberg, wrote, referring to Taylor. "He makes no excuses for his conduct and accepts full responsibility for his actions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor's capacity to make restitution to Goldman was not immediately clear. He was previously civilly fined $500,000 by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission over his trading. Goldman paid a $1.5 million civil fine last December to settle CFTC charges that it failed to appropriately supervise Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rotko declined to comment on the government filing.

		&lt;h1&gt;Cisco Holds Off Microsoft Surge in UC Collaboration Market&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;RENO, NV--(Marketwired - Dec 3, 2013) -  New Q3 data from Synergy Research Group shows that Cisco held on to leadership of UC collaboration with a 24% market share, while Microsoft, which has been inexorably closing the gap on Cisco, dropped off the pace a little in Q3 with its share slipping to 19%. Avaya reversed a trend of market share decline by boosting UC application and telephony sales, a sign that it remains a strong competitor. Worldwide revenue from UC collaboration -- which includes enterprise voice systems, UC applications, telepresence, collaborative workspace software, email software and enterprise social networks -- reached $5.7 billion in the quarter, marginally up on Q3 of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues from enterprise voice and telepresence continued to soften due to a combination of factors, including a growing shift to software-based pricing, strong competition amongst vendors and competition from disruptive technologies such as cloud UC. The quarter saw particularly strong growth in email software and enterprise social networks, while on a rolling annualized basis collaborative workspace software has seen the strongest revenue growth -- a segment in which Microsoft enjoys a 47% market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the premise equipment market we continue to see a strong transition in spending away from legacy technologies and towards software-based collaborative applications," said Synergy Research Group's founder and Chief Analyst, Jeremy Duke. "Microsoft and other vendors that are transitioning to a software pricing model are benefiting from this spending shift and we anticipate that this change will continue to have a positive impact on future revenues. Notwithstanding the temporary blip in Q3, Microsoft continues to gain share in UC collaboration and is closing the gap on market leader Cisco."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Synergy Research Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synergy provides quarterly market sizing and segmentation data on enterprise voice, UC applications, telepresence, collaboration technology and related markets, including vendor revenues by segment and by region.

			Ben Stiller&#8217;s Performance of James Thurber&#8217;s &#8220;The Secret Life of 
      Walter Mitty&#8221; Now Available as a Free Audio Download at Audible
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Audible, Inc., the world&#8217;s largest seller and producer of downloadable 
      audiobooks and other spoken-word content, today announced the release of 
      James Thurber&#8217;s classic story &#8220;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,&#8221; 
      narrated by Ben Stiller. The audio edition, which is part of a 
      partnership between Audible and 20th Century Fox in support 
      of Fox&#8217;s forthcoming theatrical release, includes commentary by Stiller 
      at the end of the recording and is available free at www.audible.com/Mitty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to offer our listeners, as well as anyone who loves a 
      good story well told, this whimsical tale performed with great panache 
      by Ben Stiller,&#8221; said Audible EVP and Publisher Beth Anderson. &#8220;Walter 
      Mitty&#8217;s imagination famously transports him away from the quotidian 
      details of life, and we like to think that&#8217;s exactly what Audible helps 
      our customers to do every day.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Anderson added, &#8220;Everyone who&#8217;s excited to see the new film version of The 
      Secret Life of Walter Mitty will first want to revisit Thurber&#8217;s 
      classic, reinvigorated by Stiller&#8217;s interpretation of the text.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;When we had the opportunity to collaborate with Audible on this 
      exciting program, we knew it was a perfect way to introduce the rapidly 
      growing number of Audible customers to the original short story as well 
      as the amazing film that Ben has created,&#8221; said Zachary Eller, Senior 
      Vice President, Marketing Partnerships, 20th Century Fox. &#8220;Ben&#8217;s 
      recording of the short story is fantastic and demonstrates his passion 
      for the brilliant source material.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stiller&#8217;s much-anticipated film version of The Secret Life of Walter 
      Mitty, co-starring Kristen Wiig, opens in theaters nationwide on 
      December 25.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We all have our own secret life, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s made the story so 
      classic,&#8221; said Stiller.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most famous of humorist Thurber&#8217;s stories, &#8220;The Secret Life of

      Rocket Software Signs Reseller Agreement with IBM for Rocket Servergraph
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      -- Boston-based global software company has been an IBM partner for over 
      20 years --
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rocket Software (www.rocketsoftware.com) 
      today announced that it has signed a software remarketing agreement with 
      IBM (www.ibm.com). 
      Under terms of the contract, IBM will resell Rocket Servergraph, a 
      storage product that enhances timely business decision making for backup 
      administrators, IT managers and CIOs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rocket Servergraph provides dashboards, rich data visualizations, alerts 
      and graphical reports that transform the way users manage their backup 
      environments. The product provides integrated monitoring and reporting 
      support of the data protection environment in addition to a complete set 
      of reports and dashboards provided at both the enterprise and server 
      level for a broad range of supported applications including: IBM Tivoli 
      Storage Manager (TSM), Symantec Netbackup, EMC Avamar, IBM Tivoli 
      Storage Manager FastBack, EMC NetWorker and VTL device support for EMC 
      Data Domain, IBM ProtecTIER and Sepaton.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to Brian Starr, Rocket Vice President and General Manager, 
      "This is another excellent opportunity for us to continue our 
      long-standing work with IBM. Servergraph is ideal for any size backup 
      environment and for organizations that face problems managing or 
      understanding their backup environment. This is a great fit for both 
      Rocket and IBM, and organizations around the world will benefit from 
      this agreement."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Rocket Servergraph complements IBM's Tivoli Storage Manager Operations 
      Center and Cognos reporting capabilities by extending visibility and 
      control across multi-vendor storage environments," said Ian Smith, 
      director of storage software at IBM. "This is a great example of IBM's 
      work to build an innovation ecosystem, by providing business partners 
      with access to open technology which they can leverage to address client 
      needs for visibility and simplicity. Servergraph will provide value to 
      clients worldwide looking for heterogeneous environment visualization 
      and assessment".

		&lt;h1&gt;Align Technology Announces Invisalign G5 Innovations for Treatment of Deep Bite&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - Dec 3, 2013) -  Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALGN) today announced the upcoming release of Invisalign G5 innovations, specifically designed for the treatment of deep bite malocclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invisalign G5 is engineered to help doctors achieve even better clinical outcomes when treating deep bites. Invisalign G5 offers comprehensive features dedicated to deep bite treatment, including:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				New SmartForce attachments and pressure areas designed to level the curve of Spee by improving control of premolar extrusion and anterior intrusion for more predictable deep bite treatments.
            
				Precision aligner bite ramps designed to disocclude the posterior teeth for improved efficiency in deep bite treatments.
			&lt;p&gt;"Invisalign G5 is our first set of innovations designed to enhance treatment predictability for a specific type of malocclusion," said John P. Graham, Align Technology's vice president, marketing and chief marketing officer. "Deep bite is a very prevalent, functional problem that is important to correct, with an estimated 45 percent of adult and teen patients presenting with this orthodontic problem.* We're pleased to introduce this set of innovative features that addresses such a big part of our customers' practices and that will help drive increased utilization of Invisalign over time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invisalign G5 is the latest in a series of SmartForce innovations that include Optimized Attachments and Power Ridge&#174; features. SmartForce features are engineered to deliver the forces needed to achieve predictable tooth movements with Invisalign. Based on biomechanical principles, SmartForce features are customized for each tooth using advanced virtual modeling and are positioned precisely to deliver the proper forces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invisalign G5 innovations for deep bite will be available on all Invisalign treatment options at no additional cost to Invisalign-trained providers worldwide in the first quarter of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*2013 Align Technology North America survey data on file with Align&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Align Technology, Inc.
					Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.The Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express 10, Invisalign Express 5, Invisalign Lite, and Vivera Retainers.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Upgrades One Class of J.P. Morgan Series 2000-C9
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings upgrades one class of J.P. Morgan Commercial Mortgage 
      Finance Corp.'s mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2000-C9. A 
      list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upgrade reflects the high concentration of defeased collateral as 
      the largest (72% of the pool) of the three remaining loans is defeased 
      and matures in July 2014. The two remaining non-defeased loans are 
      secured by single tenant retail properties, one a fully amortizing loan 
      that matures in 2018. The other has passed its anticipated repayment 
      date in 2009 and matures in 2029.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the November 2013 distribution date, the pool's collateral balance 
      has paid down 99% to $12.4 million from $814.4 million at issuance. The 
      pool has incurred 4.6% in losses to date. In addition, there are $1.5 
      million in outstanding unpaid interest shortfalls to classes J, K and NR 
      which Fitch believes are not likely to be recoverable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Class H has a stable outlook reflecting Fitch's expectation of future 
      affirmations. The rating reflects the probability of full principal 
      payoff as well as significant concentration of the pool with only three 
      loans remaining and the potential for future interest losses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch upgrades the following class:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$3 million class H to 'Asf' from 'BB+sf'; Rating Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Classes J, K and NR are not rated by Fitch. Classes A-1 through G have 
      paid in full and class X was previously withdrawn.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global drugmaker Pfizer Inc will broaden access to information from its scores of clinical trials to independent researchers and to patients who take part in the studies, the company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the largest U.S. pharmaceutical company, said it hoped the enhanced access to its data will help spur further scientific and medical research as well as encourage more patients to get involved in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are impressed to see how active patients are individually to manage and understand their disease, and in patient foundations a tremendous, great job is made to contribute to the advance of care," Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten told reporters at the company's New York headquarters. "We think this is the right time to support this trend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes at a time of increasing pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to be more transparent with clinical trial information - including safety data and details of failed studies - and to increase access for the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European health regulators announced a plan to start publishing clinical trial data submitted by companies seeking new drug approvals from next year, a move opposed by some drugmakers. Britain's GlaxoSmithKline has set up an online system to provide researchers with access to anonymous patient-level data about its medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has gone a step further by allowing trial patients themselves to access its data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are proud to be, I think, the first company to take this step," Dolsten said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new initiative, Pfizer will make easy-to-understand summaries of its trial results available to study participants who want to receive them, beginning in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will also allow trial participants to download all of their own personal data gleaned during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would for the first time give them access to personal medical information tracked by researchers over the course of the trial, which is far more detailed than simply their response to the study drug or placebo. The information could help doctors and patients make more informed treatment decisions to address health problems, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've had patients ask for information for many, many years and I think one way of making them feel that the value that they brought to the whole development process is in fact recognized is to get information back to them," said Steve Romano, head of Pfizer's medicines development group and specialty care unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As far as changing the mindset of patients getting involved in clinical trials, which has always been a challenge, this will help quite a bit," Romano predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enrolling enough subjects into large clinical trials of experimental medicines and devices, an industry-wide problem, can cause delays in completing important studies and add months or years to the time it takes to bring new products to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the scientific and medical researchers, Pfizer said it would consider requests for access to its trial information and make the anonymous patient data available for what it sees as high-quality scientific reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enhance the transparency of the process, Pfizer will set up an independent review panel of academic scientists with the power to override a Pfizer veto or partial approval of clinical data access to researchers. The panel, not the company, would make the final decision, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Krista Hughes)&lt;/p&gt;

patient-level data about its medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has gone a step further by allowing trial patients
themselves to access its data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are proud to be, I think, the first company to take this
step," Dolsten said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new initiative, Pfizer will make
easy-to-understand summaries of its trial results available to
study participants who want to receive them, beginning in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will also allow trial participants to download all of
their own personal data gleaned during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would for the first time give them access to personal
medical information tracked by researchers over the course of
the trial, which is far more detailed than simply their response
to the study drug or placebo. The information could help doctors
and patients make more informed treatment decisions to address
health problems, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've had patients ask for information for many, many years
and I think one way of making them feel that the value that they
brought to the whole development process is in fact recognized
is to get information back to them," said Steve Romano, head of
Pfizer's medicines development group and specialty care unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As far as changing the mindset of patients getting involved
in clinical trials, which has always been a challenge, this will
help quite a bit," Romano predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enrolling enough subjects into large clinical trials of
experimental medicines and devices, an industry-wide problem,
can cause delays in completing important studies and add months
or years to the time it takes to bring new products to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the scientific and medical researchers, Pfizer said it
would consider requests for access to its trial information and
make the anonymous patient data available for what it sees as
high-quality scientific reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enhance the transparency of the process, Pfizer will set
up an independent review panel of academic scientists with the
power to override a Pfizer veto or partial approval of clinical
data access to researchers. The panel, not the company, would
make the final decision, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;

			loyalkaspar Brings &#8220;Disney Time&#8221; To Life In Playful Brand Launch
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dlife, Japan&#8217;s first foreign-owned and free channel targeting women and 
      families, recently turned to its longtime creative partner and go-to 
      entertainment branding agency loyalkaspar to launch &#8220;Disney Time,&#8221; a new 
      branded block of children's programming.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Working closely with the network&#8217;s creative team, loyalkaspar created a 
      vibrant 3D-animated package that amps up the excitement for the free 
      two-hour block of Disney programming.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      loyalkaspar Creative Director Daniel D&#246;rnemann led the comprehensive 
      brand strategy, which included helping to conceive the &#8220;Disney Time&#8221; 
      name, designing the logo, identity package, and website template, print 
      ad elements, and original music.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The visual identity of "Disney Time" is a playful twist on the 
      sophisticated photo-real package that loyalkaspar created for Dlife's 
      network launch. Set to cool blue backdrops, the graphics unfold into a 
      dynamic world of fun and imagination, highlighting Disney favorites, 
      such as Lilo  Stitch and Phineas  Ferb.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our challenge was to communicate Disney Time&#8217;s unique identity without 
      losing its tie to the overall Dlife brand,&#8221; explains D&#246;rnemann. &#8220;We 
      explored different conceptual platforms for the branded block, 
      reimagining the composition and animation language familiar to Dlife 
      while maintaining brand continuity that would speak to both moms and 
      their kids.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      loyalkaspar created a graphic system around the concept of attraction, 
      playing with the concept of gravity by having various elements float or 
      explode like confetti. By turning gravity on and off, the team was able 
      to truly expand the animation language.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We were lucky to have a very seamless process with the client, who 
      shared our enthusiasm for collaboration and organization,&#8221; concludes 
      D&#246;rnemann. &#8220;This has been a longstanding 360-degree relationship for us, 
      and Dlife entrusted us to take their brand to the next level. We gave 
      this programming block its own personality with a new animation language 
      that we believe will translate beautifully to future branding 
      opportunities.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Celebrity cook Nigella Lawson told a court she had taken cocaine several times including when being subjected to "intimate terrorism" by her millionaire ex-husband Charles Saatchi, in the latest dramatic twist in a trial that has gripped Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-known TV star and author in Britain and the United States, Lawson also told the court on Wednesday she had smoked cannabis occasionally in the final year of her marriage to art dealer Saatchi but had "never been a drug addict or abuser".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't have a drug problem, I have a life problem," said Lawson, nicknamed the "Domestic Goddess" after the title of one of her best-selling recipe books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 53-year-old was testifying at the trial of two of her personal assistants who are facing fraud charges relating to the alleged misuse of 685,000 pounds ($1.12 million) on a credit card belonging to Saatchi's company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week the assistants' defense counsel said there was a tacit understanding they could spend what they liked as long as they did not tell anyone about Lawson's drug use. They deny the fraud charges. The court has also heard Saatchi wrote Lawson an email in which he accused her of being "off her head" on drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson said on Wednesday she had taken cocaine on six occasions with her first husband, journalist John Diamond, as he was dying of throat cancer in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a small amount but it gave him some escape," said the cook, who is due to feature as a mentor and judge in U.S. TV cooking competition show "The Taste" in the new year, on Walt Disney Co's ABC network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she also used the drug in July 2010. "I was having a very, very difficult time," Lawson said. "I felt subjected to intimate terrorism by Mr. Saatchi," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say with some shame that I (also) smoked the odd joint in the last year of my marriage (to Saatchi). I am now totally drug-free," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson and Saatchi, 70, ended their 10-year marriage in July, and he accepted a police caution after newspapers published pictures of him with his hands around his ex-wife's neck at a London restaurant a month earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fraud case has exposed the bitter rows between them, once one of Britain's most famous couples. Interest in the case has also been stoked by the extent to which the assistants allegedly treated themselves to lavish purchases on the credit card and the drug allegations leveled at Lawson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flanked by police officers, Lawson arrived at  Isleworth Crown Court in west London on Wednesday to a barrage of flashlights and TV arc lights from jostling media crews from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SISTERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in court, she accused Saatchi of threatening to destroy her with false drug allegations. She said she had been reluctant to give evidence because of such allegations, which she said followed "a long summer of bullying" from Saatchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt this would not become a fraud case and I would be put on trial and that is what happened," she said. "But I'm glad to answer the allegations here and to the world's press," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson told the jury that following the "awful incident" at the restaurant in June, false allegations of her drug use began circulating on what she called a PR blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those allegations, she said, had been "dedicated to salvaging Mr. Saatchi's reputation and destroying mine".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the court her reluctance to give evidence in the trial had angered Saatchi. "He had said to me if I didn't get back to him and clear his name, he would destroy me," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court had previously heard that Saatchi wrote her an email in October in which he said the two assistants on trial, Italian sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo, would be able to beat the fraud charge because of her drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can only laugh at your sorry depravity," he said in the email, which was read in court. "Of course now the Grillos will get off on the basis that you ... were so off your head on drugs that you allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court last week, however, Saatchi said he had no proof that his ex-wife had ever taken drugs. "Are you asking me whether I think that Nigella truly was off her head? Not for a second," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court has been told by the prosecution that in the four months to June 2012 alone, Francesca Grillo, 35, spent an average of 48,000 pounds per month and 41-year-old Elisabetta 28,000 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At various times during the four years to which the charges relate, the court has heard, the sisters spent lavishly on flights to New York, hotel stays, designer handbags and clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson told the court Elisabetta was a stalwart who had helped her through the death of Diamond. She said the fraud allegations "broke our heart" when revealed to her and Saatchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Stephen Addison; Editing by Pravin Char)&lt;/p&gt;

she said followed "a long summer of bullying" from Saatchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt this would not become a fraud case and I would be
put on trial and that is what happened," she said. "But I'm glad
to answer the allegations here and to the world's press," she
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson told the jury that following the "awful incident" at
the restaurant in June, false allegations of her drug use began
circulating on what she called a PR blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those allegations, she said, had been "dedicated to
salvaging Mr Saatchi's reputation and destroying mine".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the court her reluctance to give evidence in the
trial had angered Saatchi. "He had said to me if I didn't get
back to him and clear his name, he would destroy me," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court had previously heard that Saatchi wrote her an
email in October in which he said the two assistants on trial,
Italian sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo, would be able
to beat the fraud charge because of her drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can only laugh at your sorry depravity," he said in the
email, which was read in court. "Of course now the Grillos will
get off on the basis that you ... were so off your head on drugs
that you allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court last week, however, Saatchi said he had no proof
that his ex-wife had ever taken drugs. "Are you asking me
whether I think that Nigella truly was off her head? Not for a
second," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court has been told by the prosecution that in the four
months to June 2012 alone, Francesca Grillo, 35, spent an
average of 48,000 pounds per month and 41-year-old Elisabetta
28,000 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At various times during the four years to which the charges
relate, the court has heard, the sisters spent lavishly on
flights to New York, hotel stays, designer handbags and clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson told the court Elisabetta was a stalwart who had
helped her through the death of Diamond. She said the fraud
allegations "broke our heart" when revealed to her and Saatchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial continues.

			Pfizer Expands Clinical Trial Data Access Policy And Launches Data 
      Access Portal
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced an update of its clinical trial 
      data access policy that will simplify and broaden access to information 
      gathered in Pfizer-sponsored clinical trials. The updated policy builds 
      upon and expands the company&#8217;s established methods of clinical trial 
      information sharing, including Pfizer&#8217;s long track record of submitting 
      for publication results from all interventional clinical trials in 
      patients and its pioneering efforts to provide clinical trial results 
      and data to study participants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer&#8217;s updated policy meets or exceeds the &#8220;Principles 
      for Responsible Data Sharing&#8221; issued by the Pharmaceutical Research 
      and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the European Federation of 
      Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) in July 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key elements of Pfizer&#8217;s expanded policy, effective January 1, 2014, are:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Pfizer&#8217;s INSPIIRE public web portal for investigator-initiated 
        research (iirsubmission.pfizer.com) 
        will offer qualified researchers a standard form and process for 
        requesting access to anonymized patient-level data from 
        Pfizer-sponsored trials of approved (or discontinued) 
        products/indications posted on clinicaltrials.gov that have been 
        complete for 24 months.
      
			
        An external Independent Review Panel will consider all requests denied 
        or only partially approved by Pfizer and make a final decision.
      
			
        Pfizer will publish, on Pfizer.com, synopses of clinical study reports 
        (CSRs) filed with regulatory agencies for approved products for which 
        basic results are posted in the clinicaltrials.gov registry (dating 
        back to September 2007). These CSR synopses will include summary 
        results for all primary and secondary endpoints; any data that could 
        be used to identify individual patients will be removed.
      
			
        Pfizer will produce and distribute lay-language summaries of clinical 
        trial results to trial participants who wish to receive them, starting 
        with trials that begin enrolling in 2014, in countries where 
        regulations permit.
      
			
        Pfizer is piloting the use of &#8220;Blue Button&#8482;&#8221; technology (launched by 
        the U.S. Departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human 
        Services) to enable Pfizer trial participants to download their own 
        electronic clinical data collected in the trial.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer&#8217;s expanded clinical data access policy also reinforces the 
      company&#8217;s current practice of submitting for publication manuscripts for 
      all interventional clinical trials in patients, regardless of outcomes, 
      within 18 months of study completion, and the company&#8217;s commitment to 
      register and post summary results for interventional human clinical 
      trials to clinicaltrials.gov in the United States and to registries 
      outside the United States as required.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Increasing use of new analytical tools and processes to better 
      understand patient outcomes suggests that broadening access to 
      information from clinical trials, including patient-level data, when 
      done responsibly, may benefit medical research and public health,&#8221; said 
      Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., Pfizer&#8217;s executive vice president and chief 
      medical officer. &#8220;Pfizer&#8217;s expanded policy is part of a larger and 
      evolving effort by those who create and use clinical data to arrive at a 
      transparent, harmonized process to expand access in ways that protect 
      patient privacy, respect the regulatory process and maintain incentives 
      to conduct new research.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has put in place a number of safeguards designed to protect 
      patient privacy and commercially confidential information, and will ask 
      those requesting patient-level data to sign a data-sharing agreement. 
      All research proposals will be assessed to ensure there is scientific 
      rationale for the research, a well-documented and rigorous statistical 
      analysis plan, and a commitment to publish any resulting findings. Any 
      proposals not fully approved by Pfizer will go to an Independent Review 
      Panel for review and final decision.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The full version of Pfizer&#8217;s expanded policy, the clinical data request 
      form, the searchable CSR database, the Independent Review Panel 
      membership roster and charter, and more information, including 
      Frequently Asked Questions, are available at http://www.pfizer.com/TrialDataandResults.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Providing Trial Data and Information to Participants
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer is the first company to have provided summaries of trial results 
      directly back to participants in a lay language format. In 2009, Pfizer 
      partnered with the Center for Information  Study on Clinical Research 
      Participation (CISCRP) on a patient lay summary pilot project. Pfizer is 
      working now with CISCRP to begin offering such summaries to trial 
      participants, starting with studies that begin in 2014. In addition to 
      study results, Pfizer has announced the launch of the Pfizer Blue 
      Button&#8482; Project, enabling patients the ability to access their own 
      electronic clinical data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Access to clinical data empowers today&#8217;s patients with information and 
      resources to better manage their health and wellness,&#8221; said Craig 
      Lipset, head of Clinical Innovation for Pfizer Worldwide Research and 
      Development. &#8220;As Pfizer generates clinical data during studies to 
      develop new medicines, we look forward to exploring new ways to make 
      this data meaningful and actionable for our trial participants and their 
      healthcare providers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer&#8217;s site for clinical trial participants is http://www.pfizerlink.com 
      (registration required and access is limited to alumni of 
      Pfizer-sponsored clinical trials).

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union took steps on Wednesday towards lifting visa requirements for Turkish citizens, in a move underscoring a new thaw in relations between Ankara and the 28-member bloc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides agreed to sign an agreement allowing EU governments to send back illegal immigrants crossing into Europe from Turkey. In return, the EU agreed to enter into official discussions on how the current requirement for a visa when travelling to Europe could be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey, a candidate for EU membership, lies on a major route for illegal migration into Europe from Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But talks on the "readmission agreement" to send back illegal immigrants have been stalled for years, largely due to Turkish distrust over the EU's willingness to ease visa rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(The agreement) creates sustainable momentum in our relations that should first of all have the positive impact of putting accession talks back on track", EU enlargement commission Stefan Fuele told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another sign of improved relations, Turkey and the EU began a new round of membership talks last month. Talks had been delayed by the bloc in protests over a Turkish crackdown on anti-government demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey began negotiations to join the EU in 2005, 18 years after applying. But a series of political obstacles, notably over the divided island of Cyprus, and resistance to Turkish membership in Germany and France, have slowed progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Justyna Pawlak; Editing by John O'Donnell and Catherine Evans)&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Microsoft Xbox One: The Battle against Sony 
      PlayStation 4
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/5xt9zv/microsoft_xbox) 
      has announced the addition of the "Microsoft 
      Xbox One: The battle against Sony PlayStation 4" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On November 15, 2013 Sony released its PlayStation 4 (PS4) in the US to 
      enter the next generation console market before Microsoft, who will 
      launch the Xbox One (XB1) on November 22, 2013. This report analyzes the 
      battle thus far between the two consoles in terms of strategies 
      employed, how these have been shaped by the previous generation, and how 
      Microsoft can gain a future advantage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Features and benefits
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        This case study looks at the reasons behind Microsoft's Xbox One 
        strategy and how it has been shaped by the previous generation of 
        consoles.
      
			
        This report analyzes strengths and weaknesses in Microsoft and Sony's 
        current approach and identifies which aspects will become crucial in 
        the future.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Highlights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Price has been a critical issue in the past within the console market: 
        the PS3 debuted with a price that limited initial consumer uptake, but 
        subsequent price drops led to increased consumer enthusiasm. 
        Crucially, the XB1 is set to launch at a $100 premium over the PS4 in 
        the US, but will include the next generation Kinect motion sensor.
      
			
        Many sources suggest that the PS4 is superior to XB1 in terms of 
        graphical fidelity. It is, however, important to consider the fact 
        that many consumers will not notice, or mind, the difference in the 
        hardware of the two consoles. Indeed, it is other differentiators, 
        such as cloud technology, that will be more important.
      
			
        Microsoft has billed the Xbox as a multimedia device since the 
        console's initial unveiling, and is positioning the machine as an 
        entertainment system' rather than a videogame console. Although being 
        met with hostility from the hardcore demographic, the XB1's position 
        as an all-in-one entertainment system has the potential to attract 
        casual gamers.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Your key questions answered
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        What impact will the Xbox One's price have upon its launch, and how 
        can Microsoft improve its future value proposition?
      
			
        How can Microsoft overcome the PS4's technical advantages?
      
			
        Why is the Kinect key to Microsoft's Xbox One strategy, and how can it 
        be utilized in the future to differentiate the product?
      
			
        How is Microsoft aiming to bolster the Xbox One's software line-up to 
        provide a better gaming experience than its competitor?
      
			
        Why is Microsoft positioning the Xbox One as a multimedia system, and 
        how can this give the console an advantage in the future?

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 4 (Reuters) - Celebrity chef Nigella Lawson told
a British court on Wednesday that she had taken cocaine several
times but had "never been a drug addict or abuser".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawson was testifying at the trial of two of her personal
assistants who are facing fraud charges relating to the alleged
misuse of 685,000 pounds ($1.12 million) on a credit card
belonging to her ex-husband, millionaire art dealer Charles
Saatchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week the assistants' defence counsel said there was a
tacit understanding that they could spend what they liked as
long as they did not tell anyone about Lawson's drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court has also heard that Saatchi wrote her an email in
October in which he accused her of being "off her head" on
drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawson, 53, said on Wednesday she had taken cocaine several
times with her first husband, journalist John Diamond, when he
used the drug for relief as he was dying of throat cancer in
2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the chef, who is well known in Britain and the United
States, told the jury at Isleworth Crown Court in west London:
"The idea that I'm a drug addict or a habitual user of cocaine
is ridiculous. I don't have a drug problem, I have a life
problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexander Winning; Editing by Pravin Char)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has been hired by the biggest shareholder of Wing Hang Bank Ltd 0302.HK to advise on the sale of the $4.5 billion Hong Kong lender which promises buyers a route into mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sale would be the second this year for a family-owned Hong Kong lender after Chong Hing Bank Ltd (1111.HK), with suitors attracted by the prospects of overseas expansion as well as the city's rapidly growing offshore yuan fixed-income market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family of Chairman Patrick Fung as well as a family-linked affiliate and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) - which own a combined 45 percent of Wing Hang - said in September they had received preliminary offers from third parties that they did not identify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suitors preparing to bid in mid-December include Singapore's Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd (OCBC.SI), China's Anbang Insurance Group and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd (601288.SS), and Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS.TO), two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wing Hang expects a price equivalent to about twice its book value, one of the people said, valuing the sale at just over $5 billion. The bank's stock currently trades at 1.71 times its book value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At $5 billion, the transaction would be the second-biggest for an Asian bank this year, behind the $5.6 billion Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T) paid for the majority of Thailand's Bank of Ayudhya PCL (BAY.BK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wing Hang shares were up 3.5 percent on Wednesday afternoon, with the sign of progress in the sale process offering investors encouragement. By comparison, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index .HSI was down 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BENCHMARK DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, a trading arm of China's Guangzhou city government agreed to buy three quarters of Chong Hing Bank for about $1.5 billion, or a price-to-book ratio of 2.08 which analysts regard as a benchmark for future deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Hong Kong's family-run banks have recovered from a selloff after the financial crisis, encouraging owners to consider selling. The index tracking the performance of Hong Kong financial institutions .HSNF has more than doubled after hitting a multi-year low in March 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small and mid-sized lenders operate in a challenging market dominated by HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBA.L), Standard Chartered PLC (STAN.L) and Chinese banks. Competition has pushed their return on equity to 9 percent from about 20 percent in 2001, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But financial institutions looking for a gateway into China's banking market may have to act quickly because there are only three family-run banks left - including the biggest, Bank of East Asia Ltd (0023.HK), and smallest, Dah Sing Financial Holdings Ltd (0440.HK) - compared with at least six a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying Wing Hang would give the successful bidder access to the bank's 70-plus branches and offices in Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, as well as a spring board from which to launch an offshore yuan business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Wing Hang spokeswoman declined to comment on the hiring of Goldman, pointing to a statement the bank issued in October saying shareholders were in talks with independent third parties and that no agreements had been reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Thursday it had disrupted the largest network of compromised personal computers, involving some 2 million machines around the world, since it stepped up its battle against organized online criminals three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant filed a lawsuit in Texas and won a judge's order directing Internet service providers to block all traffic to 18 Internet addresses that were used to direct fraudulent activity to the infected machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement in many European countries served warrants at the same time, seizing servers expected to contain more evidence about the leaders of the ZeroAccess crime ring, which was devoted to "click fraud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such rings use networks of captive machines, known as botnets, in complicated schemes that force them to click on ads without the computer owners' knowledge. The schemes cheat advertisers on search engines including Microsoft's Bing by making them pay for interactions that have no chance of leading to a sale. Microsoft said the botnet had been costing advertisers on Bing, Google Inc and Yahoo Inc an estimated $2.7 million monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coordinated effort marks the eighth time Microsoft has moved against a botnet and a rare instance of it doing serious damage to one that is controlled with a peer-to-peer mechanism, where infected machines give each other instructions instead of relying on a central server that defenders can hunt down and disable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ZeroAccess botnet still had a weakness: The code in the infected machines told them to reach out to one of the 18 numeric Internet addresses for details on which ads to click.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recently opened a new Cybercrime Center in Redmond and is using new tools in its efforts. They are helped by a provision in trademark that allows pretrial seizure of suspected counterfeit goods, including websites that, as in the present case, are spreading tainted versions of the Internet Explorer browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is working with national computer security authorities in various countries and with Internet service providers to notify individual computer owners with infected machines, hoping to reach most of them before the fraudsters can spread new instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been sharing evidence with the FBI and Europol, the continent's law enforcement coordinating service. National agencies took part in seizure actions in Germany, Switzerland, Latvia, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, at least, the fraud by this network has stopped, said Microsoft Assistant General Counsel Richard Boscovich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operators of the botnet are believed to be in Russia, while the author of the malicious software distributed on it could be based elsewhere, Boscovich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

was devoted to "click fraud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such rings use networks of captive machines, known as
botnets, in complicated schemes that force them to click on ads
without the computer owners' knowledge. The schemes cheat
advertisers on search engines including Microsoft's Bing by
making them pay for interactions that have no chance of leading
to a sale. Microsoft said the botnet had been costing
advertisers on Bing, Google Inc and Yahoo Inc 
an estimated $2.7 million monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coordinated effort marks the eighth time Microsoft has
moved against a botnet and a rare instance of it doing serious
damage to one that is controlled with a peer-to-peer mechanism,
where infected machines give each other instructions instead of
relying on a central server that defenders can hunt down and
disable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ZeroAccess botnet still had a weakness: The code in
the infected machines told them to reach out to one of the 18
numeric Internet addresses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recently opened a new Cybercrime Center in Redmond
and is using new tools in its efforts. They are helped by a
provision in trademark that allows pretrial seizure of suspected
counterfeit goods, including websites that, as in the present
case, are spreading tainted versions of the Internet Explorer
browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is working with national computer security
authorities in various countries and with Internet service
providers to notify individual computer owners with infected
machines, hoping to reach most of them before the fraudsters can
spread new instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been sharing evidence with the FBI and
Europol, the continent's law enforcement coordinating service.
National agencies took part in seizure actions in Germany,
Switzerland, Latvia, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, at least, the fraud by this network has stopped,
said Microsoft Assistant General Counsel Richard Boscovich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operators of the botnet are believed to be in Russia,
while the author of the malicious software distributed on it
could be based elsewhere, Boscovich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp pledged late Wednesday to fight in court any attempt by U.S. intelligence agencies to seize its foreign business customers' data under American surveillance laws, one of a series of steps aimed at reassuring nervous users abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of the world's most popular computer operating system said it had never turned over any such data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and did not believe that authorities are entitled to the information if it is stored abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are committing contractually to not turning it over without litigating that issue," Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Microsoft has turned over data on non-U.S.-based individuals using its email and other services, as required under FISA laws. Microsoft and other companies are suing the government for the right to disclose how frequently that happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also said that Microsoft would dramatically increase the amount of encryption it uses for internal traffic, following similar moves by Google Inc and Yahoo Inc in the wake of reports that the National Security Agency had tapped into their facilities overseas without oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said Microsoft was caught by surprise by reports in The Washington Post, based on documents leaked by former contractor Edward Snowden, that the NSA had successfully penetrated the other companies and perhaps targeted it as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That really was like an earthquake sending shock waves through our industry," Smith said.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds statements from Louisiana and Connecticut officials)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Henry and Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BOSTON Dec 5 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
 is warning some 465,000 holders of prepaid cash cards
issued by the bank that their personal information may have been
accessed by hackers who attacked its network in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cards were issued for corporations to pay employees and
for government agencies to issue tax refunds, unemployment
compensation and other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said on Wednesday it had detected that the web
servers used by its site www.ucard.chase.com had been breached
in the middle of September. It then fixed the issue and reported
it to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank spokesman Michael Fusco said that since the breach was
discovered, the bank has been trying to find out exactly which
accounts were involved and what information may have been
compromised. He declined to discuss how the attackers breached
the bank's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fusco said the bank was notifying the cardholders, who
account for about 2 percent of its roughly 25 million UCard
users, about the breach because it couldn't rule out the
possibility that their personal information was among the data
removed from its servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank typically keeps the personal information of its
customers encrypted, or scrambled, as a security precaution.
However, during the course of the breach, personal data
belonging to those customers had temporarily appeared in plain
text in files the computers use to log activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank believes "a small amount" of data was taken, but
not critical personal information such as social security
numbers, birth dates and email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyber criminals covet such data because it can be used to
open bank accounts, obtain credit cards and engage in identity
theft. Many states require banks to notify customers if they
believe there is any chance that such information may have been
taken in a breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is also offering the cardholders a year of free
credit-monitoring services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning only affects the bank's UCard users, not holders
of debit cards, credit cards or prepaid Liquid cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fusco said the bank had not found that any funds were stolen
as a result of the breach and that it had no evidence that other
crimes have been committed. As a result, it was not issuing
replacement cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesman declined to identify the government agencies
and businesses whose customers it had warned about the breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials from the states of Louisiana and Connecticut said
the bank notified them this week that personal information of
some of their citizens may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisiana citizens included about 6,000 people who received
cards with state income tax refunds, plus 5,300 receiving child
support payments and 2,200 receiving unemployment benefits,
according to a statement from state Commissioner of
Administration Kristy Nichols on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nichols said Louisiana would "hold JP Morgan Chase
responsible" for protecting the rights and personal privacy of
the citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecticut Treasurer Denise Nappier said she was "dismayed"
that the bank took two and a half months to notify the state of
the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan Chase has some work to do, not only to assure the
holders of its debit cards, but also to restore the state's
confidence in the company's ability to remain worthy of our
continued business," Nappier said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it didn't know who was behind the attack,
though the Secret Service and FBI were investigating the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses and government agencies are increasingly using
prepaid cards because they are easier to cash than paper checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the vast stores of data behind payment cards of all
kinds have created new risks. In 2007, some 41 million credit
and debit card numbers from major retailers, including the owner
of T.J. Maxx stores, were stolen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May of this year, U.S. prosecutors said a global
cybercrime ring had stolen $45 million from banks by hacking
into credit card processing firms and withdrawing money from
automated teller machines in 27 countries.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is warning some 465,000 holders of prepaid cash cards issued by the bank that their personal information may have been accessed by hackers who attacked its network in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cards were issued for corporations to pay employees and for government agencies to issue tax refunds, unemployment compensation and other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said on Wednesday it had detected that the web servers used by its site www.ucard.chase.com had been breached in the middle of September. It then fixed the issue and reported it to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank spokesman Michael Fusco said that since the breach was discovered, the bank has been trying to find out exactly which accounts were involved and what information may have been compromised. He declined to discuss how the attackers breached the bank's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fusco said the bank was notifying the cardholders, who account for about 2 percent of its roughly 25 million UCard users, about the breach because it couldn't rule out the possibility that their personal information was among the data removed from its servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank typically keeps the personal information of its customers encrypted, or scrambled, as a security precaution. However, during the course of the breach, personal data belonging to those customers had temporarily appeared in plain text in files the computers use to log activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank believes "a small amount" of data was taken, but not critical personal information such as social security numbers, birth dates and email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyber criminals covet such data because it can be used to open bank accounts, obtain credit cards and engage in identity theft. Many states require banks to notify customers if they believe there is any chance that such information may have been taken in a breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is also offering the cardholders a year of free credit-monitoring services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning only affects the bank's UCard users, not holders of debit cards, credit cards or prepaid Liquid cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fusco said the bank had not found that any funds were stolen as a result of the breach and that it had no evidence that other crimes have been committed. As a result, it was not issuing replacement cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesman declined to identify the government agencies and businesses whose customers it had warned about the breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials from the states of Louisiana and Connecticut said the bank notified them this week that personal information of some of their citizens may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisiana citizens included about 6,000 people who received cards with state income tax refunds, plus 5,300 receiving child support payments and 2,200 receiving unemployment benefits, according to a statement from state Commissioner of Administration Kristy Nichols on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nichols said Louisiana would "hold JP Morgan Chase responsible" for protecting the rights and personal privacy of the citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecticut Treasurer Denise Nappier said she was "dismayed" that the bank took two and a half months to notify the state of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan Chase has some work to do, not only to assure the holders of its debit cards, but also to restore the state's confidence in the company's ability to remain worthy of our continued business," Nappier said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it didn't know who was behind the attack, though the Secret Service and FBI were investigating the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses and government agencies are increasingly using prepaid cards because they are easier to cash than paper checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the vast stores of data behind payment cards of all kinds have created new risks. In 2007, some 41 million credit and debit card numbers from major retailers, including the owner of T.J. Maxx stores, were stolen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May of this year, U.S. prosecutors said a global cybercrime ring had stolen $45 million from banks by hacking into credit card processing firms and withdrawing money from automated teller machines in 27 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in NEW YORK and Jim Finkle in BOSTON; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Bernadette Baum)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Dec 5 (Reuters) - Mexican TV and radio giant
Televisa said on Thursday it has been notified by
the country's competition watchdog that it was weighing whether
the media group has a dominant position as a broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notification of Televisa is the first step in a telecoms

the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa, the world's largest producer of Spanish-language

and preparing an official response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 5 (Reuters) - Tomkins Plc, a private
equity-owned manufacturer of auto parts and building products,
has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs
Group and Morgan Stanley to lead an initial public
offering that could value the company at as much as $7 billion,
people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onex Corp and the Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board (CPPIB), which acquired Tomkins in 2010 for $5 billion
including debt, will also explore an outright sale of Tomkins to
another company in what is known as a "dual track" process, the
people said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported on Nov. 22 that the buyout firms were
interviewing investment banks to sell Tomkins to another party
or float it in the stock market, with a process to explore both
possibilities expected to start in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people asked not to be identified as the matter is not
public. Representatives of Tomkins, Onex and Morgan Stanley did
not immediately respond to requests for comment. CPPIB, Bank of
America and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London-based Tomkins has operations in over 30 countries and
sells products ranging from power transmission systems to
acrylic bathtubs in over 70 countries, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had adjusted 12-month earnings, before, interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of $536 million as of the end of
September and net debt of roughly $1.5 billion, according to
Onex's third-quarter earnings statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company serves a broad range of sectors including oil
and gas, mining, construction, agriculture, transportation,
automotive and manufacturing. Its Gates Corp division, which
accounts for most of the company's business, is headquartered in
Denver, Colorado, and employs more than 14,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1925 as a small manufacturer of buckles and
fasteners, the company expanded into a multi-industrial
conglomerate through a series of deals, which included the 1987
acquisition of gun maker Smith &amp; Wesson and the 1996
takeover of U.S.-based Gates Corporation. The Gates deal
signaled its move into the industrial and automotive markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company was once one of Britain's largest industrial
groups and dubbed the 'buns-to-guns' company in its 1990s heyday
because it owned both food group Rank Hovis McDougall and .357
Magnum maker Smith &amp; Wesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onex, CPPIB and Tomkins' management invested $2.2 billion as
equity when they took Tomkins private in 2010. In September
2012, CCPIB agreed to acquire Tomkins' air distribution
division, which makes products for air-conditioning systems, for
about $1.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to that divestiture, the company had already sold five
other non-core businesses for total proceeds of almost $1
billion, which were used primarily to reduce Tomkins' debt
following the leveraged buyout by Onex and CPPIB.&lt;/p&gt;

        Improving campus communications and collaboration is top of mind for 
        higher education professionals attending for ACUTA&#8217;s Winter 2014 
        Seminar.

      Networks, Inc., a 
      global leader in SIP communications, announced today that it will 
      lead a workshop titled &#8220;Lessons for Bringing Microsoft Lync to 
      Existing Networks&#8221; at the ACUTA 
      2014 Winter Seminar, to be held January 12-15, 2014 in Phoenix.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ACUTA, comprised of more than 700 educational institutions, is focused 
      on advancing the capabilities of communications and collaboration 
      technology leaders in the field of higher education to address the range 
      of collaboration styles and needs of faculties, students and staffs 
      within today&#8217;s distributed, and often virtual, campuses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the advent of the mobile Internet and the increased use of 
      smartphone and tablet devices, universities are increasingly turning to 
      unified communications (UC) platforms such as Microsoft Lync to improve 
      collaboration. With Microsoft Lync, colleges and universities can 
      leverage campus voice, video and data networks and build a bridge to 
      bring-your-own-device (BYOD), Cloud and social media tools used by 
      students and faculty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sonus was selected by ACUTA to lead the workshop based on the company&#8217;s 
      experience in delivering interoperability for real-time, multimedia 
      communications across complex, multi-vendor environments. Joining Sonus 
      in the workshop will be representatives from Microsoft who are well 
      versed in the higher education sector, as well as leading Lync 
      integration partner, The Via Group. The Via Group was recognized in 2011 
      as the U.S. Lync Voice Education Partner of the Year and is a certified 
      Microsoft Gold Communications systems integration partner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Together, Microsoft, The Via Group and Sonus plan to conduct a dynamic, 
      interactive session based on actual university use cases selected from 
      session participants. These industry experts expect to take the class 
      through what to consider and how to go about executing a Lync deployment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      said Todd A. Abbott, executive vice president, Strategy and 
      Go-to-Market, Sonus. &#8220;We are very pleased to have been selected by ACUTA

      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4425 and 4427 Trusts
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4425 'AA/F1'; Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --DRIVERs, Series 4425 'AA'; Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4427 'AA-/F1'; Negative Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --DRIVERs, Series 4427 'AA-'; Negative Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA'; Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4425 
      PUTTERs and series 4425 DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch has 
      assigned to The City of New York General Obligation Bonds, Fiscal 2012 
      Series D, Tax-Exempt Bonds, Subseries D-1 (rated 'AA'; Stable Outlook) 
      that have been deposited in the series 4425 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA-', Negative Outlook ratings assigned to the series 
      4427 PUTTERs and series 4427 DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch 
      has assigned to the South Carolina Public Service Authority Revenue 
      Obligations, Refunding Series B (rated 'AA-', Negative Outlook) that 
      have been deposited in the series 4427 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' ratings assigned to the series 4425 and 4427 PUTTERs 
      are based on the liquidity facilities provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. 
      (rated A+/F1'; Stable Outlook). The 'F1' ratings assigned to the PUTTERs 
      will expire on June 30, 2014, the expiration date of the liquidity 
      facilities, unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term ratings assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

Turner to Pay More Than $700,000 in Restitution for Unsuitable Sales of Leveraged and Inverse ETFs and for Excessive Mutual Fund Switching</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FINRA Orders J.P. Turner to Pay More Than $700,000 in Restitution for 
      Unsuitable Sales of Leveraged and Inverse ETFs and for Excessive Mutual 
      Fund Switching
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) today announced that 
      it has ordered Atlanta-based broker-dealer J.P. Turner  Company, L.L.C. 
      to pay $707,559 in restitution to 84 customers for sales of unsuitable 
      leveraged and inverse exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and for excessive 
      mutual fund switches.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brad Bennett, FINRA Executive Vice President and Chief of Enforcement, 
      said, "Securities firms and their registered reps must understand the 
      complex products they are selling and the risks inherent to the products 
      and be able to determine if they are suitable for investors before 
      recommending them to retail customers. Firms also have a fundamental 
      obligation to monitor conservative investments such as mutual funds to 
      ensure that investors are not abused by excessive trading."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Leveraged and inverse ETFs "reset" daily, meaning that they are designed 
      to achieve their stated objectives on a daily basis so their performance 
      can quickly diverge from the performance of the underlying index or 
      benchmark. It is possible that investors could suffer significant losses 
      even if the long-term performance of the index showed a gain. This 
      effect can be magnified in volatile markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FINRA found that J.P. Turner failed to establish and maintain a 
      reasonable supervisory system and instead, supervised leveraged and 
      inverse ETFs in the same manner that it supervised traditional ETFs. The 
      firm also failed to provide adequate training regarding these ETFs. In 
      addition, J.P. Turner allowed its registered representatives to 
      recommend these complex ETFs without performing reasonable diligence to 
      understand the risks and features associated with the products. As a 
      result, many J.P. Turner customers held leveraged and inverse ETFs for 
      several months. J.P. Turner also failed to determine whether the ETFs 
      were suitable for at least 27 customers, including retirees and 
      conservative customers, who sustained collective net losses of more than 
      $200,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, J.P. Turner engaged in a pattern of unsuitable mutual fund 
      switching. Mutual fund shares are typically suitable as long-term 
      investments and are not proper vehicles for short-term trading because 
      of the transaction fees and commissions incurred from repeated buying 
      and selling of mutual fund shares. J.P. Turner failed to establish and 
      maintain a reasonable supervisory system designed to prevent unsuitable 
      mutual fund switching and lacked sufficient procedures to adequately 
      monitor for trends or patterns involving mutual fund switches. During 
      the relevant period, despite the presence of several red flags, J.P. 
      Turner failed to reject any of the more than 2,800 mutual fund switches 
      that appeared on the firm&#8217;s switch exception reports. As a result, 66 
      customers paid commissions and sales charges of more than $500,000 in 
      unsuitable mutual fund switches.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In settling this matter, J.P. Turner neither admitted nor denied the 
      charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA's findings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FINRA's investigation was conducted by the departments of Enforcement 
      and Member Regulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

				Better release management. While Microsoft's release innovations have helped reduce the impact of upgrades on users, deploying the latest release does not always go as smoothly as expected. 
					
				
				Smoother Migration. Key migration challenges were in consolidating data on virtualized servers, reducing migration impacts, and validating architecture designs. 
					
				
				Cloud migration concerns. Respondents felt that they were not ready to migrate 100% of their infrastructure and workloads to a public cloud, citing security and reliability as key concerns. 
					
				
				Lack of advanced reporting. Many participants point to the absence of advanced reporting and analytics in System Center Operations Manager (SCOM), pointing to the need to employ third party solutions to meet their needs.

"We are particularly pleased with the partnership with Sky as it will further increase the satisfaction of our Italian users of Lumia devices. This app, in addition to the recent arrival in the Store of other successful brands such as Instagram and Vine, will be available on the entire Lumia family stretching from the Lumia 520 to the new Lumia 1520 with its high-quality 6-inch screen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"We are pleased with this important agreement thanks to which Sky Go for the first time in the world will be making its debut on Nokia Lumia smartphones and the Windows Phone 8 platform," said Remo Tebaldi, Customer  Product Marketing Manager Sky.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the collaboration between Nokia, Microsoft and Sky, starting from middle of December the pay-TV service on the go will be available for all &#160;Windows Phone 8 Nokia Lumia devices in Italy&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Milan, Italy - Sky Italia, Nokia and Microsoft have announced the global debut on Windows Phone of Sky Go, the service that allows users to view 30 pay-TV channels on the go. Thanks to this agreement, one of the most loved applications - already chosen by 1.9 million Sky subscribers - will be coming to the entire Nokia Lumia family in Italy starting from the middle of December.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The agreement allows Sky to enhance its mobile service by offering some of its most prestigious content to owners of Windows Phone 8 Lumia smartphones, which are increasingly widespread in Italy, in addition to allowing Nokia to enrich its cutting-edge models with the application that truly allows TV to be taken outside the home.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Sky Go on the Windows Phone 8 platform is a world exclusive for Italy and a true Christmas present for our customers," said Paola Cavallero, General Manager, Nokia Italia. "We are particularly pleased with the partnership with Sky as it will further increase the satisfaction of our Italian users of Lumia devices. This app, in addition to the recent arrival in the Store of other successful brands such as Instagram and Vine, will be available on the entire Lumia family stretching from the Lumia 520 to the new Lumia 1520 with its high-quality 6-inch screen."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased with this important agreement thanks to which Sky Go for the first time in the world will be making its debut on Nokia Lumia smartphones and the Windows Phone 8 platform," said Remo Tebaldi, Customer  Product Marketing Manager Sky. "Sky Go is thus taking a further step on the path of innovation, allowing an increasingly broad segment of our subscribers to enjoy ever richer and more compelling viewing experiences. In fact, this partnership will boost customers' chances to access their favourite programs on devices such as the new Nokia Lumia 1520 that guarantee the standard of excellence that has always set Sky apart."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"We are enthusiastic about our collaboration with Sky and proud that Italy has been chosen for the global debut of Sky Go on Windows Phone. This is further confirmation of the excellent results that have led our mobile operating system to become the second largest in Italy in the third quarter of 2013," said Silvano Colombo, Consumer Channel Group Manager, Microsoft Italia. "Thanks to Sky Go, the line-up of Windows Phone applications has been further expanded, confirming Microsoft's commitment to guaranteeing its users access to the best of entertainment on their smartphones as well."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BOSTON Dec 5 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co
 is warning some 465,000 holders of prepaid cash cards
issued by the bank that their personal information may have been
accessed by hackers who attacked its network in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cards were issued for corporations to pay employees and
for government agencies to issue tax refunds, unemployment
compensation and other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said on Wednesday it detected that its web servers
used by its site www.ucard.chase.com had been breached in the
middle of September. It then fixed the issue and reported it to
law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank spokesman Michael Fusco said that in the months since
the breach was discovered the bank has been investigating to
find out exactly which accounts were involved and what pieces of
information could have been taken. He declined to discuss how
the attackers breached the bank's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fusco said the bank is notifying the cardholders, who
account for about 2 percent of its roughly 25 million UCard
users, about the breach because it cannot rule out the
possibility that their personal information was among the data
removed from its servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank typically keeps the personal information of its
customers encrypted, or scrambled, as a security precaution.
However, during the course of the breach, personal data
belonging to those customers had temporarily appeared in plain
text in files the computers use to log activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank believes "a small amount" of data was taken, but
not critical personal information such as social security
numbers, birth dates and email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyber criminals covet such data because it can be used to
open bank accounts, obtain credit cards and engage in identity
theft. Many states require banks to notify customers if they
believe there is any chance that such information may have been
taken in a breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is also offering the cardholders a year of free
credit-monitoring services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning only affects the bank's UCard users, not holders
of debit cards, credit cards or prepaid Liquid cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fusco said the bank has not found that any funds were stolen
as a result of the breach and that it has no evidence that other
crimes have been committed. As a result, it is not issuing
replacement cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesman declined to identify the government agencies
and businesses whose customers it had warned about the breach.
Fox 8 News in New Orleans reported on its website that three
Louisiana agencies were notified by the bank on Wednesday that
the personally identifiable information of some state citizens
may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State officials could not be reached for comment late
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it does not know who was behind the attack,
though the Secret Service and FBI are investigating the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses and government agencies are increasingly using
prepaid cards because they are easier to cash than paper checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the vast stores of data behind payment cards of all
kinds have created new risks. In 2007 some 41 million credit and
debit card numbers from major retailers, including the owner of
T.J. Maxx stores, were stolen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May of this year U.S. prosecutors said a global
cybercrime ring had stolen $45 million from banks by hacking
into credit card processing firms and withdrawing money from
automated teller machines in 27 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp pledged late Wednesday to fight in court against any attempt by U.S. intelligence agencies to seize its foreign customers' data under American surveillance laws, one of a series of steps aimed at reassuring nervous users abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of the world's most popular computer operating system said it had never turned over any such data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and did not believe that authorities are entitled to the information if it is stored abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are committing contractually to not turning it over without litigating that issue," Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also said that Microsoft would dramatically increase the amount of encryption it uses for internal traffic, following similar moves by Google Inc and Yahoo Inc in the wake of reports that the National Security Agency had tapped into their facilities overseas without oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said Microsoft was caught by surprise by reports in The Washington Post, based on documents leaked by former contractor Edward Snowden, that the NSA had successfully penetrated the other companies and perhaps targeted it as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That really was like an earthquake sending shock waves through our industry," Smith said. Past discussions with federal officials, he said, have always been based on working out what the law required, without any hint that the company might be subjected to attacks based on "technological brute force" instead of legal process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing another concern, a spokeswoman said the company did not believe it could be ordered to install spyware on a user's machine and that Microsoft would fight any such directive in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it would encrypt consumer data that it stores and would work with other email providers to make sure that messages stay secure when they move from a service such as Microsoft's Outlook.com, formerly Hotmail, to another, such as those from Google or Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it would also expand the use of regional centers that allow governments worried about U.S. "back doors" in its software to inspect the source code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical measures will move Microsoft close to parity with other major Internet companies in their protections for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the cloud business, which provides remote storage and computing power for companies, Microsoft's top rival is Amazon.com Inc.. An Amazon Web Services spokeswoman said her employer, like Microsoft, provides tools to help cloud customers encrypt their sensitive data and warns them if legal papers have been served seeking access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she did not know whether papers presented under the intelligence laws, which are secret, had been used to obtain data about international customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are committing contractually to not turning it over
without litigating that issue," Microsoft General Counsel Brad
Smith said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also said that Microsoft would dramatically increase
the amount of encryption it uses for internal traffic, following
similar moves by Google Inc and Yahoo Inc in
the wake of reports that the National Security Agency had tapped
into their facilities overseas without oversight by the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said Microsoft was caught by surprise by reports in
The Washington Post, based on documents leaked by former
contractor Edward Snowden, that the NSA had successfully
penetrated the other companies and perhaps targeted it as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That really was like an earthquake sending shock waves
through our industry," Smith said. Past discussions with federal
officials, he said, have always been based on working out what
the law required, without any hint that the company might be
subjected to attacks based on "technological brute force"
instead of legal process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing another concern, a spokeswoman said the company
did not believe it could be ordered to install spyware on a
user's machine and that Microsoft would fight any such directive
in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it would encrypt consumer data that it stores
and would work with other email providers to make sure that
messages stay secure when they move from a service such as
Microsoft's Outlook.com, formerly Hotmail, to another, such as
those from Google or Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it would also expand the use of regional
centers that allow governments worried about U.S. "back doors"
in its software to inspect the source code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technical measures will move Microsoft close to parity
with other major Internet companies in their protections for
consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the cloud business, which provides remote storage and
computing power for companies, Microsoft's top rival is
Amazon.com Inc.. An Amazon Web Services spokeswoman
said her employer, like Microsoft, provides tools to help cloud
customers encrypt their sensitive data and warns them if legal
papers have been served seeking access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she did not know whether papers presented under the
intelligence laws, which are secret, had been used to obtain
data about international customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top U.S. cable provider Comcast Corp has tapped JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co for advice as it evaluates a potential bid for Time Warner Cable Inc, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast brought in the bank to help review options as speculation about cable industry consolidation increased in the past several months, one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comcast does not plan to make a pre-emptive bid for No. 2 cable provider Time Warner Cable, the subject of a months-long pursuit by much smaller rival Charter Communications Inc, but could jump in if signs emerge that Charter is getting close to a deal, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comcast, which has a market value of more than $127 billion, might also decide against doing any deal, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people asked not to be identified by name because the matter is not public. Representatives for Comcast and JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable, which has said it was open to a deal at the right price, considers Comcast to be the best merger partner because the larger rival can afford to make an all-cash offer and provides a better geographic fit, separate people familiar with the matter have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter has a market value of about $13 billion, much less than Time Warner Cable's $37 billion, and would need to raise a large amount of debt to finance a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Comcast takeover bid would likely face close scrutiny from antitrust regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission because it would create a dominant company controlling more than one third of the pay TV market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comcast currently has 23 million video subscribers while Time Warner Cable has about 12 million. In comparison, third-ranked Cox Communications has 4.5 million and No.4 player Charter has 4.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newly installed FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has also spoken out in favor of competition. A former chief at both the cable industry and wireless industry trade groups, Wheeler spent his first days in office taking a hard line against wireless providers and continuously speaking about promoting competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a large cable merger is still possible because cable operators generally do not offer services in the same markets and instead compete with satellite and telcom TV services, industry experts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHARTER'S CHALLENGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter, in which cable billionaire John Malone's Liberty Media Corp owns a 27 percent stake, has its own challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company offered to buy Time Warner Cable earlier this spring, but was rebuffed because it did not offer a premium, Reuters previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And any deal has gotten much more expensive since, with takeover speculation pushing Time Warner Cable' shares above $130 from the mid $90s in May -- when Charter first approached the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter's pursuit of Time Warner Cable also attracted the interest of privately held Cox Communications, which is examining its own options for a deal with the second-largest U.S. cable operator, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any suitor would likely need to bid at least $150 per share to be considered seriously by Time Warner Cable's board, one person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tie-up with Charter raises particular concerns for Time Warner Cable because any offer from the smaller rival would have a large stock component and heavily indebt the combined company, people familiar with the matter have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter's stock price has increased about 70 percent this year, which could be viewed as an inflated currency by Time Warner Cable shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the amount of debt it raises, a Charter-Time Warner Cable combination could push up the merged company's leverage ratio to five or six times. Time Warner Cable's current leverage is just over three times while Charter's leverage ratio is 4.9 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Soranno, an equity analyst at Calvert Investment Management, which has $13 billion under management and owns Time Warner Cable shares, said he is not convinced if he wants to hold shares in a merged Charter-Time Warner Cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons the firm likes Time Warner Cable is because the company has been reducing its debt level and has a stable cash flow structure, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In order to accept a deal with Charter, shareholders have to accept a fundamentally different capital structure with a heck of a lot more debt. How solid is its growth profile? How solid is the stock you're getting?" Soranno said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Soyoung Kim, Nicola Leske and Liana B.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc trader Matthew Taylor was sentenced Friday to serve nine months in prison and pay $118 million in restitution to his former employer after he pleaded guilty to pursuing an unauthorized $8.3 billion futures trade in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In imposing a sentence well below the 33- to 41-month term the U.S. Department of Justice had recommended, U.S. District Judge William Pauley in New York castigated both Goldman and government authorities for failing to immediately address Taylor's conduct when it occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is a "paradigm of everything that is wrong with Wall Street and the regulators charged with protecting the public," Pauley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors claimed Taylor lied to supervisors and fabricated trades in December 2007 to conceal an $8.3 billion position in Standard &amp; Poor's 500 e-mini futures contracts, which bet on the direction of that index.

He pleaded guilty in April, a day after turning himself in to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was previously fined $500,000 by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman itself paid a $1.5 million civil fine last December to settle CFTC charges that it failed to adequately supervise Taylor, an amount that Pauley said it earned back in a "couple of minutes" given its more than $7 billion in annual profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pauley also faulted Goldman for simply firing Taylor without disclosing the full extent of his cover-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Astonishingly, Goldman then watched as one of its competitors, Morgan Stanley, rehired Taylor," Pauley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the judge saved some of his harshest words for the government, criticizing regulators and prosecutors for failing to investigate Taylor for years and then claiming credit in the media when they finally did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It cannot be called justice or oversight when it took the government six years to bring a rogue trader to justice, when the trader admitted his conduct on Day 1," he said. "At some point, the justice needs to be swift if it's going to mean anything, other than another press release and the ability to say, 'another pelt.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and the CFTC declined to comment on Pauley's remarks. But a person familiar with the criminal investigation said prosecutors only first became aware of Taylor's conduct last November after seeing a news report about the CFTC probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a Goldman spokesman said the bank had disclosed in a filing with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority that Taylor was fired in 2007 for "inappropriately large proprietary futures positions in a firm trading account".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pauley said Taylor is a "brilliant and talented" man who made a series of terrible decisions, and while he did not deserve years in prison, the judge concluded that a short sentence of imprisonment was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everything about this case is sad," Pauley said. "Your employer's response was sad. Your conduct is sad. The government's conduct is sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Undoubtedly, they'll issue another press release," he added.

 trader Matthew Taylor was sentenced to serve nine months
in prison and pay $118 million in restitution to his former
employer after he pleaded guilty to pursuing an unauthorized
$8.3 billion futures trade in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Pauley imposed the sentence in 
New York federal court on Friday, eight months after Taylor
turned himself in to federal authorities and admitted to wire
fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentence was well below the 33- to 41-month term
recommended by prosecutors, and the roughly eight to 10 years
that Pauley said federal guidelines would suggest given the size
of Goldman's losses. Taylor had sought no prison time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors claimed Taylor lied to supervisors and
fabricated trades in December 2007 to conceal an $8.3 billion
position in Standard &amp; Poor's 500 e-mini futures contracts,

Commodity Futures Trading Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sentencing Taylor, Pauley also found fault with Goldman
and the federal government, asking why regulators waited so long
to go after Taylor, and why Goldman didn't do more than simply
fire the trader in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is a "paradigm of everything that is wrong with
Wall Street and the regulators charged with protecting the

The program is paid for in its entirety by JPMorgan Chase  Co., so participants don't incur any costs or use their education benefits to take part.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"The Veterans Career Transition Program has helped many veterans successfully transition into civilian careers &#8211; and that's why we're expanding it to military spouses. Our aim is to position military families for post-military service success. Through VCTP, veterans and spouses can add to the valuable skills they already have and gain additional knowledge, skills and certifications that employers are seeking," said Maureen Casey, Managing Director, JPMorgan Chase  Co. Office of Military and Veterans Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Just over three decades ago, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) bought a niche coffee-and-gold trading firm called J. Aron &amp; Company, becoming one of the first banks to enter the commodity markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year from now, the Wall Street giant may be one of the last ones standing as the former J. Aron traders who now run Goldman mount a lonely defense of their right - and customers' need - to buy and sell copper, crude or corn. Few others are sticking around as a rocky, on-and-off romance between financial firms and raw material markets turns sour again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising regulations, political pressure, falling profit margins and fierce competition from newcomers - including overseas banks - is forcing Goldman's rivals to retreat, or scale back, particularly in the costlier trade of physical commodities, a critical core for many banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Deutsche Bank, one of the five biggest players of the past decade, said it would quit commodities trading under regulatory pressure, cutting 200 jobs. That follows similar moves by smaller players like UBS and Credit Agricole in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top rivals JP Morgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) are in the process of selling out from commodities trading while Barclays (BARC.L) has cut its division by a fifth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other big banks that have yet to signal their longer-term plans have generally remained silent on the matter of commodities - except Goldman, whose top executives have given unequivocal support to the roughly 250 J. Aron traders who helped deliver a blockbuster $5 billion in revenues in 2009. By last year that had dropped to less than $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who started his carrier at J. Aron in precious metal sales in the early 1980s, said in September it was a "core, strategic business".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Cohn, who ran J. Aron in the late 1990s, said the bank's clients "really need us to be in that business". A spokesman said on Thursday those statements still stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference in tone has been apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan have put their businesses up for sale. Goldman Sachs is not doing anything (like this)," Alex Beard, the head of oil division at trading giant Glencore (GLEN.L), told a conference earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOO MUCH DOWNSIDE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks have come under unprecedented pressure this year, including debate in the U.S. Congress over accusations their physical commodity desks have contributed to market froth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For many banks there is too much downside to be in commodities," chief executive of trading giant Gunvor, Torbjorn Tonrqvist, said earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shrinking ranks of top five players is opening opportunities for the likes of Glencore and Gunvor, as well as for more lightly regulated banks like South African Standard Bank, emerging market-focused Standard Chartered (STAN.L), Australia's Macquarie Group (MQG.AX) or Brazil's Grupo BTG Pactual SA (BBTG11.SA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Goldman still faces some competition at home. Bank of America's (BAC.N) Merrill Lynch and Citigroup (C.N) have in the past two years unexpectedly beefed up their desks and employ around 200-250 people each. For both it is their second or even third attempt to build a top tier desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It all comes down to what regulations will allow big U.S. banks to do... U.S. banks will diminish activity," Ian Taylor, the head of top global oil trader Vitol, said earlier this year, predicting that new entrants would include Asian institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not certain that Goldman will be able to successfully defend the franchise once the Federal Reserve completes a wide-ranging review of banks' commodity trading activities. Alongside Morgan Stanley, Goldman has argued that a clause in a 1999 banking law should allow it to keep the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it has recently signaled plans to sell its metal warehousing unit at the heart of a controversy over aluminum prices, and has put its uranium trading desk on the block. It has tried, in vain, to get permission to trade iron ore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most banks have almost fully closed proprietary trading desks, as the so-called Volcker rule prohibits banks from trading with their own money. They now focus mainly on financing commodities trading for clients as well as hedging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further retreat threatens to diminish liquidity in key markets, reduce choice for corporate hedgers and drive more trading toward less-regulated players, some analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For those refineries that need to hedge their specific types of oil, there may be no financial services firms to do it with. For airlines that needs to hedge Jet-A1 at their hubs, Atlanta or Chicago or Denver, who's going to do that for them?" says Brad Hintz, a Wall Street analyst at Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co and a former treasurer of Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only the one that may be left is Goldman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THE VEINS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman bought J. Aron, then a small trading house focused on coffee and gold, in 1981, the same year that commodity merchant Philipp Brothers (Phibro) bought Salomon Brothers banks. Morgan Stanley jumped into the market shortly thereafter, building up the business internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It marked the beginning of a three-decade affair between financial institutions and raw material markets, one that waxed and waned once in the 1990s and again in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The revenue opportunity for banks has both shrunk and morphed over the past couple of years, so any remaining player of scale will need to be nimble in adapting to changing market opportunities and regulations," said Seb Walker, a partner at industry consultant Tricumen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although JP Morgan is selling its large physical commodity trading franchise, the remaining derivatives business will still benefit from its massive lending franchise, trade finance operations and principal investing activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi, too, is "something of a wild card", said Walker. "Although currently a smaller player, the bank is notable for investing in the area while others have been pulling out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with Citi operations said the bank was committed to continue narrowing the gap with top players in commodities trading with focus on serving clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has suffered alongside some of its peers as some of its most senior executives have departed in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But none of them have commodities in the veins in the same way that Goldman does. Many of the banks' partners grew up in the J. Aron business, and remain fiercely loyal to it, giving them a strong voice among shareholders, says Hintz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The management grew up in commodities, they're looking through the cycle," he said. "In the meantime this isn't going to be profitable, but (they know) this is cyclical."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Clarifies reference to Standard Bank and Standard Chartered)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Giles Elgood)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;New Mobile App Lets Sage Business Prepaid Visa Card Users Manage Usage, View Spending, Replenish Funds&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;IRVINE, CA--(Marketwired - Dec 6, 2013) - &#160;Sage North America today announced new mobile capabilities for the Sage Business Prepaid Visa Card, which allows businesses to instantly allocate funds to employees while managing employee spending based on company policies. Using the Sage Business Prepaid Visa Card mobile application ("app"), businesses can place daily spending limits on cards and restrict card usage by merchant category. Administrators can also use the mobile app to set funding rules for each card as well as set zero balances and block cards. A real-time mobile dashboard provides functionality to view all card spending, replenish card funds and turn cards on or off. Additionally, cardholders can use the mobile app to view real-time card balances and previous transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sage Business Prepaid Visa Card customers are already seeing tangible results from the mobile capabilities. Janet Crow, controller for Covenant Life Church, Inc., Covenant Life School, Inc. and the OneU campus ministry in Gaithersburg, Md., finds the simplicity of the Sage Business Prepaid Visa Card mobile app most striking when using the product for all three of her organizations.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's so easy to log on and move money around, no matter where I am or how I'm accessing the system," said Crow. "We can track card usage, activate and terminate cards and block international use in order to reduce the risk of fraud. There are no limitations when using the mobile features of the Sage prepaid Visa."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sage Business Prepaid Visa Card allows employers to control where money is spent and increases organizational efficiency through reduced paperwork, simplified administration and robust reporting tools. The card can be used everywhere Visa cards are accepted worldwide and enables businesses to send money to employees in real time through an administrative website or mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Businesses need to be able to view and manage their expenses regardless of their physical location," said Greg Hammermaster, president of Sage Payment Solutions, the payments division for Sage North America. "With that in mind, the Sage Business Prepaid Visa Card now includes mobile feature enhancements that allow employee cardholders to request funds and employers to appropriate funds while on the go. By integrating mobility with traditional plastic Visa cards, cardholders have visibility to their card balance and spending activity, and businesses have the visibility and controls required to more broadly distribute business cards to their employees and contractors for purchases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No credit checks on the company or owners are ever performed during the Sage Business Prepaid Visa Card enrollment process. Businesses can easily sign up for the prepaid card and then view and manage their entire prepaid card program online and through the new mobile app. In addition, the Sage Business Prepaid Visa Card is interest-free and there are no overdraft fees. Businesses using the Sage Business Prepaid Visa Card can benefit from reduced administrative costs associated with employee reimbursements and cash advancements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sage Business Prepaid Visa Card customers have 24/7 access to their detailed transaction reports and monthly statements.

&lt;p&gt;* Analyst Currie says oil cycle is reversing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* U.S. oil demand growth surges as China's slows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* U.S. oil prices to remain cheap vs global markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The oil market is on the cusp of a
new cycle, Goldman Sachs said on Friday, with demand in the
United States growing at a faster pace than in emerging
economies such as China and India for the first time in a
decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's likely to have profound implications for how oil
markets operate, Jeffrey Currie, Goldman's influential chief
commodity analyst wrote in a note, which says there will be a
"new oil order".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currie was one of the first oil analysts to predict that
crude prices would surge last decade, driven by growing Chinese
demand and tightening supplies. Now as U.S. shale production
drives down prices for American consumers, the market may shift,
he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As oil demand leadership transitions to developed markets
from emerging markets, this not only represents a significant
fundamental shift, but combined with significant developed
market-led production, this turns the previous commodity cycle
upside down," Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immediate impact may be subtle at first - Goldman is
maintaining its price forecasts for next year for both North Sea
Brent crude and U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate at $106
and $98, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THREE DEVELOPMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long run, Currie expects three inter-related
developments to flip the market on its head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, he writes, the boom in U.S. shale oil output should
keep oil prices in the United States low and lead to a
"substantial acceleration" in its economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, stronger U.S. growth will lead the Federal Reserve
to scale back its monetary support, which is likely to
strengthen the dollar. That should put pressure on emerging
market demand by making oil and other commodities priced in the
greenback more expensive for users of other currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, weaker oil demand growth in countries including China
and India should help keep markets well supplied, limiting
inflation in developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This new emerging commodity cycle is the exact opposite of
the 'super cycle' where weak U.S. economic growth, exacerbated
by a lack of domestic energy supplies and conflicts in key
commodity-producing regions, helped facilitate more
accommodative monetary policy," Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"U.S. policy reinforced emerging market demand growth and a
weaker U.S. dollar, which largely offset the higher oil and
commodity prices to emerging market countries," in the last
decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the reversed trend will lead emerging market
economies to "shift from being consumers to producers", Currie
said forcing countries such as China to follow the U.S. path in
tapping unconventional resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since hitting a record of almost 21 million barrels per day
(bpd) in 2005, U.S. oil demand has fallen by more than 10
percent to 18.5 million bpd last year, data from the U.S. Energy
Information shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in September, U.S. demand was up by 1 million bpd on the
same month in 2012 - the biggest year-on-year leap since 2001 - 
while Chinese demand growth has been muted in the second half of
this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currie estimates total Chinese demand growth at just 230,000
bpd throughout 2013. Growth was as low as 70,000 bpd in October
year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. demand has been boosted in part by the fact that
gasoline prices are 15 percent lower in Chicago than in
Singapore, Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retail prices in the United States were at the lowest level
in three years at the end of November, the EIA said.&lt;/p&gt;

			The above referenced presentation may contain certain forward-looking statements regarding future circumstances, including statements relating to the Company's positioning and forecasts regarding earnings per diluted share.

      Visa is one of many strides TigerDirect.com 
      has taken to minimize payment friction, giving customers one more reason

      customers at TigerDirect.com click the V.me checkout button and complete 
      their purchase with only a simple username and password.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      TigerDirect.com customers enjoy not only existing benefits from their 
      credit cards of choice, but TigerDirect.com 
      has provided an added bonus during the holiday season: Customers who 
      checkout on TigerDirect.com 
      using V.me by Visa will receive at least $20 off any $100 order. This is 
      the perfect perk for consumers looking to get more from TigerDirect.com&#8217;s 
      already unbeatable deals and savings and this instant savings is another 
      marketplace-disrupting value from two companies dedicated to innovation 
      and complete customer satisfaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are so pleased to bring this value-added service and special savings 
      opportunity to our customers in time for the holiday shopping season,&#8221; 
      said Richard Leeds, Chairman and CEO of Systemax, Inc., the parent 
      company of TigerDirect.com. &#8220;In addition to our existing customers, 
      we&#8217;re excited that we may attract new customers who already know and 
      trust Visa. And, $20 savings doesn&#8217;t hurt, either.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Radian Guaranty Inc., the mortgage insurance subsidiary of Radian Group 
      Inc., today released data for primary mortgage insurance delinquencies 
      for November 2013. These details may also be found on Radian&#8217;s website

      to Radian from loan servicers. Default reporting, particularly on a 
      monthly basis, may be affected by several factors, including the date on

      transfers.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets: Physician Views: Revisiting Pfizer's Xeljanz - 
      Is the Oral Revolution Gaining Traction in Rheumatoid Arthritis?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/gs8x44/physician_views) 
      has announced the addition of the "Physician 
      Views: Revisiting Pfizer's Xeljanz - Is the Oral Revolution Gaining 
      Traction in Rheumatoid Arthritis?" company profile to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Just over a year ago - and buoyed by recent FDA approval - expectations 
      for Pfizer's rheumatoid arthritis treatment Xeljanz (tofacitinib) were 
      suitably high. The drug - an oral alternative to injectable biologic 
      therapies with a comparative efficacy and safety profile - was widely 
      expected to help spearhead Pfizer's post-Lipitor growth expectations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consensus expectations in November of last year pointed to full-year 
      sales of around $315 million for Xeljanz in 2013. Based on its current 
      quarterly run-rate, analysts now expect the franchise to generate 
      revenue of about $123 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Failure of Xeljanz to gain approval in Europe (see ViewPoints: Key 
      opinion leader casts doubt as to whether Pfizer's Xeljanz will ever 
      secure European approval) is a contributing factor to this downgraded 
      commercial outlook, but in the US market, Pfizer's product has simply 
      not gained the anticipated traction among physicians, despite its oral 
      availability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This trend says as much about the entrenched competition - particularly 
      AbbVie's Humira, Johnson  Johnson's Remicade and Amgen/Pfizer's Enbrel 
      - as it does about Xeljanz. During Q3, these three biologics were the 
      industry's biggest selling products, generating sales of $2.9 billion, 
      $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. In 2012, these three 
      franchises delivered combined global sales of around $28 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The sheer size of revenues generated within the autoimmune space is one 
      reason why Xeljanz is still expected to achieve blockbuster status by 
      2017 (a similar outlook was referenced last week by one analyst towards 
      Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' biologic sarilumab, which could 
      achieve peak sales of around $1 billion despite being largely 
      differentiated from existing competition). However, gaining market share 
      at the expense of these long-established products has taken longer than 
      anticipated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer management has conceded that uptake of Xeljanz needs to increase 
      if the product is to deliver on (presumably revised) expectations. The 
      company initiated a US direct-to-consumer (DTC) marketing campaign at 
      the beginning of the summer and hopes to gain approval for a revised 
      label from the FDA in February to reflect Xeljanz's ability to inhibit 
      progression of structural disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Reasons to Purchase:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The authors polled US-based rheumatologists in May to ascertain how 
      physicians were utilising Xeljanz and this week's Physician Views poll 
      partly acts as a follow-up. Specifically, this week's poll will ask 
      US-based rheumatologists:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - To what percentage of rheumatoid arthritis patients they have now 
      prescribed Xeljanz?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Where they are typically using the drug in the treatment paradigm?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - How awareness of the drug has increased over the past 6 months?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - How significant a role the oral availability of Xeljanz holds in the 
      eyes of patients?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Whether potential new labelling for Xeljanz (possibly secured in 
      February 2014) will impact usage?
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - A $6.4 billion gas project being built by Chevron CVN.X in China is facing further delays due to disagreements with partner PetroChina (0857.HK) over how to develop the technically tricky fields, three industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chuandongbei project, the U.S. firm's largest investment in China, is now not expected to deliver first gas until the second half of 2014, nearly 7 years after the firms clinched a 30-year deal to produce 7.6 billion cubic meters of gas a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest setback follows a series of delays for Chuandongbei, which Chevron has described as one of its larger capital projects for 2013. PetroChina initially expected first gas to be delivered in 2010, while its parent CNPC forecast just four months ago that production would start by end-2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China, the world's top energy user, but the fourth-largest consumer of gas, is racing to unlock supplies of the cleaner-burning fuel by boosting imports and domestic exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some discrepancies over how to develop the fields between PetroChina and Chevron," said a Beijing-based industry official with knowledge of the project, a 2,000 square-kilometer block in Sichuan basin in southwest China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is the operator of the project and holds a 49 percent stake. PetroChina holds the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government had now suspended its approval for the development plan for the second stage of the three-stage Chuandongbei project, to encourage the companies to focus on delivering the first phase, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chuandongbei is a sour gas development. The natural gas contains a high level of hydrogen sulphide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The complexity of the project, being a high-pressure, high sulphur development that means higher operational risk and higher standards for technical processes, also contributed to the delays," said a second industry official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the only international oil firm developing high-sulphur gas in China, Chevron has imposed stringent safety standards, sources said, especially after a deadly disaster in 2003 in the same region that forced the then-head of CNPC to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blowout in 2003 at a gas well in Chongqing municipality owned by CNPC turned 25 sq km (10 sq miles) of farmland into a lethal zone, killing 243 people and poisoning thousands as they slept or scrambled to escape a toxic cloud of hydrogen sulphide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a similar sour gas development in the same geological area, the $10 billion Puguang project developed by PetroChina's domestic rival Sinopec Corp (0386.HK), took 32 months from start of construction to first gas in 2010. It has a designed annual capacity of 12 bcm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sinopec being the sole owner of the project had a much stronger sense of execution," said a third industry official involved in the Puguang development. "It had top attention from Sinopec management, which pooled the best design and construction teams to build it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PetroChina declined comment on the project start-up date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said the company has not yet announced a first-gas date. Chevron "continues to advance the construction of the first natural gas processing plant and development of the Luojiazhai and Gunziping natural gas fields for the Chuandongbei project," a spokesman said by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plant and the two fields make up the first stage of the project. Chevron said on its website in April that it expected the plant, which is designed for maximum production of about 2.7 bcm a year to be "mechanically complete" by end-2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full development will include two sour gas processing plants and five natural gas fields with gathering systems and tie-ins to the plants. An exploration well is planned for the third quarter of 2013, Chevron said on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, in the northeastern part of Sichuan province, has proven reserves of 176 billion cubic meters, the two companies have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron is an experienced sour gas developer, and has partnered with PetroChina to develop gas in Australia. It won the deal in December 2007, beating rival bidders Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA), partly because it pledged swifter development, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By last February, Chuandongbei had cost 12.6 billion yuan ($2.1 billion), local media reported. The project is Chevron's largest upstream investment in China, where it also has a much smaller offshore portfolio.

Christmas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Gwladys Fouche&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSLO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Statoil and ExxonMobil
 have made another big gas discovery off Tanzania and
plan a drilling campaign over the next two years, lifting the
East African country's hope of becoming a major gas exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firms found 2-3 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas in
place, or 360-540 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings their total gas resources in place in the
licence to 17-20 tcf or 3.06-3.6 billion boe, said Statoil, the
block's operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's BG and Ophir Energy have also made
big discoveries in Tanzania and a source told Reuters earlier
that the four have submitted proposals to build an onshore
liquefied natural gas plant in the southern region of Lindi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No new LNG project has won a final investment decision
anywhere in the world outside the United States for almost two
years because of huge cost increases across the industry, a glut
of LNG from places such as Australia and a shale boom which has
made the United States self-sufficient in natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Tanzania's relative cost advantage, abundance of
gas and proximity to Asia's main LNG buyers is seen boosting its
chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been through the site selection with BG and
basically all the technical data has been submitted to the
government," Nick Maden, Statoil's head of exploration
activities for the western hemisphere, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are awaiting a final decision. We are hoping soon. We
are hoping before Christmas. But these things often take time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firms are aiming for a final investment decision on the
Tanzania plant in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE DRILLING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statoil said it planned to drill 9 to 12 exploration and
appraisal wells in Tanzania by early 2015 and has secured a rig,
often the biggest constraint in exploration, through 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are encouraged by what we see," Maden said. "We really
are not fully concluded on what sort of potential (the licence
has). But we see potential to increase the volume further."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the news was clearly positive for the Statoil
stock with Swedbank First Securities estimating the value of the
discovery at around 1 crown while Pareto Securities estimated at
it at around 0.9 crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 0937 GMT, Statoil shares traded unchanged at 139.5
crowns, underperforming a 1.1 percent rise in the European oil
and gas index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statoil has been the most successful offshore explorer this
year with big finds in Canada and Tanzania. Prior to Friday's
discovery, it had found around 900 million barrels of oil
equivalent, indicating that its reserve replacement ratio would
stay above 100 percent for a third consecutive year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year it plans to focus exploration on Tanzania, East
Africa, the Gulf of Mexico and Norway. It also hopes to return
to Canada as soon as it can secure a rig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statoil owns a 65-percent stake in the Tanzania licence
while ExxonMobil holds the remaining 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Residents oppose shale exploration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Protesters and riot police turn out in equal numbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Romania holds estimated 51 trln cubic feet of shale gas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Bogdan Cristel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PUNGESTI, Romania, Dec 7 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron
 halted exploration works for shale gas in eastern
Romania for the second time in two months on Saturday after
anti-fracking protesters broke through wire mesh fences around
the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people have rallied across Romania in recent
months to protest against government support for shale gas
exploration and separate plans to set up Europe's largest open
cast gold mine in a small Carpathian town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates Romania
could potentially hold 51 trillion cubic feet of shale gas,
which would cover domestic demand for more than a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron won approval to drill exploratory wells in the small
town of Pungesti in the impoverished county of Vaslui in October
but had to halt work soon after when residents blocked access to
the site. It resumed work on Dec. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, about 300 riot police were deployed in
Pungesti, 340 km (210 miles) northeast of capital Bucharest, to
try to prevent an equal number of protesters, mostly local
residents, from entering the Chevron site. Some broke through
into the site, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The activists chanted "Stop Chevron" and held banners saying
"No drilling allowed here". Dozens were detained by police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said some equipment had been damaged on the site.
"Chevron can today confirm it has suspended activities ... as a
result of unsafe conditions generated by unlawful and violent
protester activities," it said in a statement emailed to
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our priority is to conduct our activities in a safe and
environmentally responsible manner consistent with the permits
under which we operate, however this was not possible today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRACKING DIVIDE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shale gas faces opposition due to concerns around hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, the process of injecting water and
chemicals at high pressure into underground rock formations to
push out gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics, including the Pungesti protesters, say it can
pollute water supplies and trigger small earthquakes. Advocates
say it has a strong safety record and point to countries like
the United States, where extensive fracking has driven down
energy prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, which also has rights to explore three licence
blocks near the Black Sea, does not have plans to use fracking
under its five-year exploration programme. It says is abiding by
all safety regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said last month it had filed a civil lawsuit against
protesters in Poland who have prevented it from reaching a site
where it plans to explore for shale. It said the action was
filed on the grounds that protesters were violating its lawful
right of access to the site - one of four shale gas exploration
concessions the company has in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday left intact a $142 million jury verdict against Pfizer Inc over the marketing of the epilepsy drug Neurontin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury had ruled in favor of an insurer who said it had been misled into paying for the drug for "off-label" uses, or uses for which it was not approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the jury in Massachusetts found that due to Pfizer's marketing of the drug for off-label uses, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc, one of the nation's largest health maintenance organizations, and affiliates were damaged because they paid for prescriptions relating to conditions Neurontin did not effectively treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court's refusal to hear Pfizer's appeal means similar claims brought against the company by insurer Aetna Inc and Harden Manufacturing Corp can also go forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we are disappointed with the court's decision denying the petition, the company has strong defenses on the merits in the cases that will now proceed in the lower court," Pfizer said in a statement. "Plaintiffs face significant hurdles before they even reach trial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were unchanged at $31.54 in afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer asked the high court to weigh whether lower courts correctly concluded that the company could be held liable under federal racketeering law. Pfizer said the claims made under the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, did not make a sufficient connection between the alleged inaccurate marketing and the increase in what Kaiser had to pay out for prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an April ruling, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the jury verdict, finding that Pfizer should cover costs for the marketing and prescribing of Neurontin for unapproved uses, a practice that has also earned the company a hefty criminal fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the related cases, the appeals court revived similar claims made by Aetna and a class-action suit filed by Harden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury in Massachusetts found that Pfizer had marketed Neurontin for bipolar disorder, migraines and neuropathic pain, none of which had been approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente, a managed care company, said the ruling was a reminder to pharmaceutical makers to abide by their legal and ethical obligations or pay the cost. "The manipulated research and information behind the marketing of Neurontin misled physicians, pharmacists and patients alike into using this expensive drug for off-label uses where the evidence did not support it," it said in a statement. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc is part of Kaiser Permanente.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verdict followed a $240 million criminal fine in 2004 paid by Pfizer's Warner-Lambert unit, as well as a $190 million civil fine paid by Pfizer in connection with the off-label marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off-label uses included bipolar disorder, Lou Gehrig's disease, restless leg syndrome, attention deficit disorder and drug and alcohol withdrawal seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the illegal marketing was conducted by Warner-Lambert before Pfizer acquired the company in 2000. Neurontin was developed by Warner-Lambert and was approved in 1993 to treat seizures at a maximum dose of 1,800 milligrams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are allowed to prescribe drugs for uses that have not been approved by U.S. health regulators, but companies are prohibited from marketing their products for such purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said most big payouts by drugmakers for improper marketing of their products have been as a result of government probes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a little concerned these litigation trends could spread more widely to private entities," Conover said. Should Kaiser and other private plaintiffs prevail in their Neurontin battles with Pfizer, more insurers might feel motivated to seek financial recoveries of their own for other improperly marketed drugs, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conover also said Pfizer could easily afford the $142 million judgment in the Kaiser case. The largest U.S. drugmaker has annual sales of $50 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conover said he hoped more safeguards were in place to prevent improper marketing of medicines, following major settlements in the past decade that came as a result of whistleblowers and their disclosures of such practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Pfizer agreed to pay $2.3 billion to settle civil and criminal allegations that it had improperly marketed painkiller Bextra and other drugs, including Lyrica (pregabalin), a medicine chemically similar to Neurontin which is used to treat nerve pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer Inc. v.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Economic growth in developed economies will accelerate next year and investors should buy U.S. stocks, partly on the likelihood that central banks' monetary policies will remain accommodative, Goldman Sachs strategists said on a webcast Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gross domestic product (GDP) growth of the United States and the United Kingdom will exceed expectations, the strategists said, and U.S. stocks look attractive since the Federal Reserve will likely keep short-term interest rates low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key trade in 2014 will be to invest in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index while betting against the Australian dollar, said Noah Weisberger, head of the macro equity team within Goldman Sachs' Global Markets Group. He cited the Fed's stance of keeping policy rates low through "forward guidance" as a reason to buy U.S. stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategists also touted stocks within the U.S., Japanese and European banking sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S 500 has hit record highs this year and surged nearly 27 percent. The Fed's $85 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgages have kept bond yields low, leading investors to seek higher income in stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forward guidance refers to the language the Fed uses to tell markets how long it will keep short-term rates near zero. The central bank has kept the key federal funds rate near zero since late 2008 to help the economy recover from recession and has promised to keep it there for a while longer, probably until 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risks remain that economic growth could lag their optimistic forecast, the strategists said. Also, if investors in general begin to expect higher economic growth, bonds could sell off and result in volatility for stocks, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continued easing of risks stemming from the euro zone will be a positive influence on economic growth in developed economies next year, said Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of the global macro and markets research team. He added that inflation will remain "relatively low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While touting stocks broadly, the strategists recommended betting against commodities such as copper, iron ore and gold. Copper and iron ore prices will suffer from supply growth, said senior metals analyst Max Layton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Chinese stocks while "shorting" or betting against copper prices, said Kamakshya Trivedi, executive director within the global macro and markets group. Trivedi said that a stable China might be "good enough" next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have warned this year of an end to the "supercycle" of strong commodity performance over the past decade in response to a potential unwinding of the Fed's bond-buying program, along with fragility in the U.S. and European economic recoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sam Forgione.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A Republican member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission blasted other government regulators on Monday for requiring JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to pay $13 billion to resolve allegations of mortgage misdeeds tied to the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think you would be hard-pressed to find any rational regulatory policy that would underlie a $13 billion penalty against shareholders," said SEC member Dan Gallagher, a Republican.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month JPMorgan agreed to pay $13 billion to resolve claims from the Justice Department, a federal housing regulator, and others, that the bank overstated the quality of mortgages it was selling to investors in the run-up to the financial crisis. The SEC was not a party to the settlement, which included $9 billion in cash and the rest as help to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department rolled several separate investigations and lawsuits into one large settlement, and said such a deal was designed to hold wrongdoers accountable for misconduct that contributed to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of the settlement forced JPMorgan to record its first quarterly loss under CEO Jamie Dimon and was expected to cost JPMorgan $9 billion after tax, a little less than half the company's annual profit of $21 billion in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan in a statement of facts acknowledged problems in its marketing of mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Justice Department did not release details of how it calculated the penalty, and did not release a complaint that laid out the entire scope of the misconduct government investigators had unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Reuters last week, Attorney General Eric Holder defended the size of the fines. "What we have looked for in terms of the size of these things is really to do it in a way that's appropriate, that's proportionate," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a mathematical basis to the offers that we make," he said. "It's not something that we simply look at the size of the institution or their balance sheet," Holder added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When announcing the deal, the Justice Department described it as the "largest settlement with a single entity in American history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holder also said in the interview that the department planned to bring more mortgage fraud cases against other financial institutions early in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the settlement, JPMorgan's general counsel Stephen Cutler criticized the large penalty imposed and described it as contributing to something of an arms race in government fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking before an audience in Frankfurt at an event organized by the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany, Gallagher blamed that escalation on government lawyers looking to build a reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the ... problems we have in the United States is that prosecutors like to make a name for themselves and they all try to distinguish themselves in one way or another," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One way to distinguish yourself is to get the highest penalty ever against a bank ... I don't think it bears much resemblance to anything else. It is not rational," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Eva Taylor and Sakari Suoninen Frankfurt, and David Ingram in Washington writing by Aruna Viswanatha; Editing by Karey Van Hall and David Gregorio)&lt;/p&gt;

      operations. It truly is amazing what we can accomplish when we work 
      together,&#8221; said Jack Pelo, President and CEO of Swire Coca-Cola.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through focused efforts to implement sustainable business practices at 
      Swire Coca-Cola&#8217;s headquarters and distribution center, the 
      585,000-square-foot Draper building was awarded the Silver LEED&#174; 
      certification. According to the U.S. Green Building Council&#174;, &#8220;LEED 
      certification is an official recognition that a project complies with 
      the requirements prescribed within the LEED rating systems as created 
      and maintained by the U.S. Green Building Council.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To aid in the safe return of water to communities, Swire Coca-Cola 
      partnered with the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, Trout Unlimited 
      and The Nature Conservancy to support three crucial restoration 
      projects. The first, located in Utah&#8217;s Chalk Creek watershed, was 
      completed in June of 2013. It removed a fish migration barrier, opened 
      up approximately 23 miles of stream habitat and helped conserve water by 
      upgrading an irrigation system for a local rancher. This collaborative 
      effort will restore stream flows of up to 11 million liters to the lower 
      quarter-mile of the South Fork of Chalk Creek.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Located in Swire Coca-Cola&#8217;s territory, a second project, on the upper 
      Bear River, will ensure safe passage for Bonneville Cutthroat Trout and 
      restore several miles of river and riparian habitat, providing stream 
      flows during a critical time of the year. Funded partly by The Coca-Cola 
      Company, modernized irrigation diversions and fish screens will protect 
      thousands of juvenile Bonneville Cutthroat Trout that would previously 
      have been trapped in canals. This major project will restore up to 3.86 
      billion liters of water to the river annually.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At Jesse Creek, located in the source watershed for Swire&#8217;s Fruitland, 
      ID plant, Swire has supported a project led by The Nature Conservancy 
      that reconnects natural stream flow to a section of the creek that has 
      been dewatered for decades. Rejuvenated water flow should allow up to 1 
      billion liters to pass through the previously dewatered section of the 
      creek. Currently underway, this project will balance the amount of water 
      used in the Fruitland, ID plant with an equal amount of water flowing 
      through the newly restored Jesse Creek channel. This creates a unique 
      opportunity for Swire to reconnect water flow to a dewatered ecosystem 
      and support environmental restoration activities. The project will be 
      completed in the fall of 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These remarkable projects demonstrate to landowners, water rights 
      holders and other stakeholders that NGOs and irrigators can work 
      together to produce win-win results. The projects will restore in-stream 
      flows, help native fish populations and improve irrigation systems to 
      benefit ranchers and rural economies,&#8221; said Todd Reeve, CEO of the 
      Bonneville Environmental Foundation.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 9 (Reuters) - A Republican member of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission blasted other government regulators on
Monday for requiring JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co to pay $13 billion to
resolve allegations of mortgage misdeeds tied to the financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think you would be hard-pressed to find any rational
regulatory policy that would underlie a $13 billion penalty
against shareholders," said SEC member Dan Gallagher, a
Republican.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month JPMorgan agreed to pay $13 billion to resolve
claims from the Justice Department, a federal housing regulator,
and others, that the bank overstated the quality of mortgages it
was selling to investors in the run-up to the financial crisis.
The SEC was not a party to the settlement, which included $9
billion in cash and the rest as help to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department rolled several separate
investigations and lawsuits into one large settlement, and said
such a deal was designed to hold wrongdoers accountable for
misconduct that contributed to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of the settlement forced JPMorgan to record its
first quarterly loss under CEO Jamie Dimon and was expected to
cost JPMorgan $9 billion after tax, a little less than half the
company's annual profit of $21 billion in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan in a statement of facts acknowledged problems in
its marketing of mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Justice Department did not release details of how it
calculated the penalty, and did not release a complaint that
laid out the entire scope of the misconduct government
investigators had unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Reuters last week, Attorney General
Eric Holder defended the size of the fines. "What we have looked
for in terms of the size of these things is really to do it in a
way that's appropriate, that's proportionate," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a mathematical basis to the offers that we make,"
he said. "It's not something that we simply look at the size of
the institution or their balance sheet," Holder added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When announcing the deal, the Justice Department described
it as the "largest settlement with a single entity in American
history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holder also said in the interview that the department
planned to bring more  mortgage fraud cases against other
financial institutions early in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the settlement, JPMorgan's general counsel
Stephen Cutler criticized the large penalty imposed and
described it as contributing to something of an arms race in
government fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking before an audience in Frankfurt at an event
organized by the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany,
Gallagher blamed that escalation on government lawyers looking
to build a reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the ... problems we have in the United States is
that prosecutors like to make a name for themselves and they all
try to distinguish themselves in one way or another," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One way to distinguish yourself is to get the highest
penalty ever against a bank ... I don't think it bears much
resemblance to anything else. It is not rational," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      Case Study: Chevron Delo Products Keeps R.E. West Transportation&#8217;s Fleet 
      Running
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Detroit Diesel Series 60 Engine Achieves 1.5 Million Miles Of Service 
      Using Delo 400 Engine Oil and Delo Extended Life Coolant
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, maker of the 
      Delo&#174; brand of technologically advanced engine oils, lubricants and 
      coolants, released a case study demonstrating the performance of Delo 
      400 engine oil and Delo Extended Life Coolant in a Detroit Diesel Series 
      60 engine used by R.E. West Transportation of Nashville, Tennessee. The 
      two products were key factors in the engine reaching 1.5 million miles 
      with minimal wear.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      R.E. West Transportation is a nationally recognized contract and 
      dedicated carrier with a fleet of 120 trucks and 300 trailers. A family 
      business, R.E. &#8220;Bob&#8221; West founded the company in 1969, and has used Delo 
      Lubricants and Delo Extended Life Coolant for years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      West&#8217;s trucks often see severe service, but the superb protection 
      provided by Delo products allows the company&#8217;s fleet to regularly 
      achieve high mileage &#8211; including one truck in particular. &#8220;Some time 
      ago, we were telling people that we had this truck that had over a 
      million miles and just hadn&#8217;t had any trouble with it, which virtually 
      no one believes,&#8221; said West.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In order to demonstrate the condition of his truck, a team including 
      R.E. West Transportation&#8217;s own mechanics and those from maintenance 
      provider Clarke Power Services in Nashville, Tenn., disassembled the 1.5 
      million-mile Detroit Diesel Series 60 engine during an extensive, 
      three-day inspection. Despite the mileage, the use of Delo lubricants 
      and Delo Extended Life Coolants kept the engine components in &#8220;great&#8221; 
      condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The parts coming out of this engine had minimal wear, it looked really 
      well,&#8221; said R.E. West Maintenance Manager Dustin Stricker. &#8220;Once we get 
      this rebuild done we&#8217;re putting the truck back on the road, and we 
      believe that the truck will go another million-plus miles.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Delo oils incorporate ISOSYN&#174; Technology, which combines premium base 
      oils with high performance additives, helping to deliver extended 
      service protection, maximized engine durability and minimized operating 
      costs for companies like R.E. West.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upon inspection, the camshaft, engine bearings and cylinder rings showed 
      only minimal wear. The pistons held no harmful carbon deposits, and the 
      cylinder liners showed no cavitation and full cross-hatch. &#8220;We&#8217;re 
      delighted with the performance of the Delo 400 with ISOSYN Technology. 
      The overall picture is, it&#8217;s absolutely clean. There is absolutely no 
      sludge,&#8221; said Chevron Senior Scientist James McGeehan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;ve replaced door hinges, door latches, window regulators, all kinds 
      of the parts that you&#8217;re using in these years that you&#8217;re operating the 
      truck,&#8221; West said. &#8220;But not the engine, not the transmission, not the 
      rear ends, and we think a big part of that is Delo.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs banker Elias Preko was sentenced to 4-1/2 years in prison by a London court on Monday for laundering $5 million on behalf of James Ibori, the former governor of Nigeria's oil-producing state of Delta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibori is serving 13 years in a British jail after pleading guilty last year to 10 counts of fraud and money-laundering. He is the most senior Nigerian politician to be held to account for the corruption that has blighted Africa's most populous country and top oil producer, where the case is being closely watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvard graduate Preko, 54, became the fifth of Ibori's associates to be jailed for assisting his corruption after the ex-governor's wife, mistress, sister and lawyer were all convicted by British courts in previous trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases have been tried in London because some of the money was laundered in Britain and some of the defendants were based there. Attempts by Nigeria's own anti-corruption agency to prosecute Ibori, dating back to 2007, have foundered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A jury at London's Southwark Crown Court unanimously convicted Preko, a Ghanaian national, of two offences of money-laundering between March 2003 and April 2008 when he was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was charged with assisting Ibori in channeling stolen money through a web of offshore trusts and shell companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preko had left Goldman Sachs before he committed the offences and the bank is not accused of any wrongdoing. The court heard Preko tried to open accounts on Ibori's behalf when he still worked there but this was not authorized by the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Delta governor from 1999 to 2007, Ibori was in his heyday a power broker at the heart of Nigeria's ruling party. After he left office and lost immunity from prosecution his fortunes ebbed and flowed according to political developments in Abuja until he was extradited from Dubai to Britain in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AMOUNTS BEYOND BELIEF"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The evidence against you in this case was very clear. You knew what Mr. Ibori was doing and you were actively assisting him," Judge Anthony Pitts told Preko in his sentencing remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are a man of considerable ability and intelligence, highly educated, capable of making lots of money perfectly legitimately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court had heard that in a decade at Goldman Sachs, where he was in charge of private clients in sub-Saharan Africa, Preko had made $12 million in salary and received a severance payment of $3 million when he left the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You had the ability to walk away (from Ibori). You chose to involve yourself with him as a professional man, against the code of upstanding conduct for men in your position," Pitts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge noted that the sums Preko had helped launder were "relatively small amounts in a case where the amounts are almost beyond belief".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibori's total fortune is not known. During his sentencing in April 2012 Pitts put the amount of stolen money covered by his guilty pleas at 50 million pounds ($82 million) but said this may be a "ludicrously low" fraction of his total booty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a three-week hearing this year prosecutors sought a court order for the confiscation of 90 million pounds in assets that they said were the proceeds of Ibori's crimes, but the hearing ended inconclusively and will restart next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=0.6115 British pounds)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Dec 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court said on
Monday it would leave intact a $142 million jury verdict against
Pfizer Inc over its marketing of the epilepsy drug
Neurontin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury in Massachusetts found in 2010 that Kaiser Foundation
Health Plan Inc, one of the nation's largest health
maintenance organizations, and affiliates were damaged because
they ended up paying out for prescriptions relating to
conditions the drug did not effectively treat due to Pfizer's
marketing for off-label uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court's refusal to hear Pfizer's appeal means
claims brought against Pfizer by insurer Aetna Inc and
Harden Manufacturing Corp can also go forward.&lt;/p&gt;

			Palmetto Technology Group (PTG) Sales up Nearly 1000%, Adds Microsoft 
      Dynamics CRM Solution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Palmetto 
      Technology Group (PTG) &#8211; Microsoft 
      Cloud Partner of the Year (East Region) and outsourced 
      IT support company headquartered in South Carolina &#8211; announced today 
      it has experienced extraordinary growth in the first six months of the 
      year over the previous fiscal year. And as part of the company&#8217;s 
      expansion, PTG has added Microsoft 
      Dynamics CRM to its service portfolio to complement their other 
      solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PTG President Reed Wilson said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen tremendous growth at PTG and 
      attribute a good percentage to cloud 
      services. This surge in the cloud from area 
      businesses has allowed PTG to add 10 new employees and contributed 
      to our recognition from Microsoft as Cloud Partner of the Year.&#8221; Wilson 
      continued, &#8220;And to continue this momentum and drive growth into the next 
      fiscal year, we&#8217;ve also further diversified our service offerings to 
      include Microsoft 
      Dynamics CRM.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wilson&#8217;s cloud services sales are up nearly 1,000 percent over the 
      previous year. He said that the benefit of Microsoft cloud is that it 
      frees business owners from on-site infrastructure. PTG is part of a 
      select group of Microsoft partners who excel in both cloud-based and 
      on-site services &#8211; such as networking and computer repair/managed 
      services &#8211; allowing them to deliver the best solutions to their 
      customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a Microsoft 
      Dynamics consultant, PTG will be able to offer a full gamut of 
      online licensing and services. PTG clients can now set up their 
      infrastructure in the cloud with Azure, increase their productivity with 
      Office 365, and automate business processes and nurture customer bases 
      with Microsoft 
      Dynamics CRM solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of PTG&#8217;s customers, Marcus Myers at HWP Company, Inc., appreciates 
      the way CRM works with the cloud and Office 365. Myers commented, &#8220;The 
      great thing about Microsoft 
      Dynamics is that it&#8217;s such a flexible system. It&#8217;s not a 
      one-size-fits-all solution. It&#8217;s scalable and easy to use, so it allows 
      us to do more with less on-premise infrastructure.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At PTG&#8217;s new CRM website, customers can view Microsoft 
      Dynamics demos, sign up for a free Dynamics 
      trial, and compare Microsoft 
      Dynamics pricing.

			IT Industry Veterans Reinforce Axway&#8217;s Position as the Global Leader 
      in Governing the Flow of Data
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In support of its continued growth, Axway

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Nick, Paul and Laurent&#8217;s experience and expertise in leading sales, 
      services and development teams, as well as their deep understanding of 
      enterprise integration and application infrastructure, will be highly 
      valuable in helping guide the future growth of the Axway 5 Suite and our 
      customers&#8217; businesses,&#8221; said Christophe Fabre, CEO, Axway. &#8220;Their 
      leadership in their respective market segments will help drive 
      widespread adoption of the Axway 5 Suite, and cement our position as a

      held sales leadership positions at companies including Sterling 
      Commerce, Yahoo! and Amdahl/Fujitsu, with involvement in global sales, 
      marketing and global operations. In his new role, Ferrante will be 
      responsible for overseeing Axway&#8217;s global sales organizations. His 
      primary goal will be driving sales productivity and customer 
      satisfaction for the Axway 5 Suite, in alignment with the company&#8217;s

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      Shortell held a wide range of responsibilities, including customer 
      interaction, solution selling and delivering services that drove

      solutions. In his new position, Shortell will lead Axway&#8217;s North

      years at Business Objects, where he developed deep expertise in complex 
      enterprise software development with a special attention to technology

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JPMCC 
      2011-PLSD Surveillance Report
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) affirmed its ratings on all seven 
      classes of JPMCC 2011-PLSD certificates, a $365.6 million CMBS single 
      borrower transaction (see ratings list below). The transaction 
      collateral consists of a single non-recourse, first lien mortgage loan 
      secured by the borrower&#8217;s fee simple and leasehold interests in 1.9 
      million square feet (sf) of Palisades Center, a 2.3 million sf 
      super-regional and destination mall located in West Nyack, New York. 
      Palisades Center has three traditional mall anchor tenants, JCPenney, 
      Lord  Taylor and Macy&#8217;s. Of these, JCPenney is the only one that serves 
      as collateral for the loan, while the remaining anchors own their 
      improvements and underlying land. In addition, Palisades Center also has 
      six big-box tenants, AMC Lowes, BJ&#8217;s Wholesale Club, Burlington Coat 
      Factory, Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods, Home Depot and Target.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Comparable in-line tenants with less than 10,000 sf achieved sales of 
      $525 per sf as of the trailing twelve month (TTM) period ending 
      September 2013, which is 3.1% lower than the International Council of 
      Shopping Centers (ICSC) median sales levels for the Northeast region of 
      $542 per sf and 16.7% higher than the national mall sales average of 
      $450 per sf as of September 2013. Excluding the Apple Store, average 
      in-line tenant sales were $460 per sf, down 2.1% since the TTM period 
      ending September 2012 ($470 per sf). The Apple Store recently vacated 
      the subject property and relocated its store to the newly opened Shops 
      at Nanuet in October 2013. The Shops at Nanuet is a 759,000 sf open-air 
      lifestyle center that is operated by Simon Property Group and located 
      approximately four miles west of Palisades Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA used information obtained from the trustee, U.S. Bank National 
      Association, and servicer, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, to 
      analyze the loan collateral. The analysis produced a KBRA Net Cash Flow 
      (KNCF) of $42.2 million and a KBRA value of $544.9 million, both of 
      which have increased 2.1% since issuance. The resulting in-trust KBRA 
      Loan to Value (KLTV) is 67.1%.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan Chase and the Justice Department thought that all the zeroes at the end of the banks multibillion-dollar settlement for mortgage securitization failures would foreclose questions about the banks actual wrongdoing, clearly they thought wrong. Days after the much-leaked-about $13 billion deal was finally announced, New York Times columnist Gretchen Morgenson looked at the admissions accompanying the settlement and wondered why it had taken the federal government so long to hold the bank accountable for conduct thats been in the public domain for years. Morgensons column echoed posts at Bloomberg and Slate that also scoffed at JPMorgan admissions. On Monday, even a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission piled on. Dan Gallagher, a Republican, criticized the settlement as a penalty on the banks current shareholders thats not justified by JPMorgans admitted conduct. It is not rational, Gallagher told an audience in Frankfurt at an event organized by the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of all of this criticism is a nagging suspicion that we dont really know what the Justice Department had  or didnt have  on JPMorgan, that the $13 billion settlement was not pegged to the banks actual misconduct but to the public relations benefits to both sides from a supposedly record-setting deal. Attorney General Eric Holder has called the size of the settlement a proportionate response to JPMorgans wrongdoing, but its tough to take that assertion on faith when the statement of facts that accompanied the settlement revealed so little about the governments evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh believes that the government knows a lot more about JPMorgans securitization practices than it disclosed in the settlement agreement  and the FHLBs lawyers at Robins, Kaplan, Miller  Ciresi are pretty sure those additional details are contained in a civil complaint against the bank that was drafted by the U.S. Attorney in Sacramento, California. At a closed-door hearing last Friday, Judge Stanton Wettick of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas heard Robins Kaplan argue that release of this rich source of detailed facts about JPMorgans conduct would serve the publics interest in understanding the basis of the $13 billion settlement. JPMorgans lawyers at Sidley Austin, meanwhile, contend that the Justice Department never intended the complaint to be public but used it only as leverage in negotiations with the bank. Turning the document over to FHLB and the public, the bank asserts, would be contrary to Pennsylvanias interest in promoting settlements, would violate attorney-client privilege and would accomplish nothing because Justices allegations are not related to claims by the FHLB. Judge Wettick did not issue a public ruling from the bench Friday and lawyers for JPMorgan and FHLB didnt respond to my emails requesting comment. But if were ever going to find out more about the governments dirt on JPMorgan, theres a good chance it will be in the FHLB litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wettick, after all, has already ordered the draft complaint to be turned over to the FHLB once. In early October, when JPMorgans settlement with Justice was still just a rumor, Robins Kaplan moved to compel JPMorgan to turn over whatever documents it had disclosed to the Justice Department, in case any of that material shed light on FHLBs allegations that it was duped into buying JPMorgan mortgage-backed securities. (You may remember the litigation because FHLB successfully deployed the same tactic of moving for Justice documents against Standard  Poors, which is also a defendant in the case.) At the time, JPMorgans counsel in the FHLB case in Pittsburgh said he didnt know for sure whether Justice had prepared a complaint against the bank, despite press reports that the complaint existed. At a hearing on Oct. 17, Judge Wettick ordered JPMorgan lawyer Robert Pietrzak of Sidley to find out if the government had shown a draft complaint to JPMorgan, and to the extent that you have it, (to) turn it over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an affidavit from FHLBs general counsel, Dana Yealey, the existence of a draft complaint was confirmed soon thereafter when Justice Department lawyers contacted him to ask if FHLB would agree to extend the deadline on Judge Wetticks order so that Justice could wind up its negotiations with JPMorgan. Yealey said that he asked if Justice would intervene in his case to oppose production of the draft complaint and received a promise that it would not. (The Justice lawyer) said he was very close to a final deal with JPMorgan and that after one more week, he would not care about the draft complaint, Yealeys affidavit said. FHLB agreed to hold off until the Justice settlement was finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after JPMorgan and the Justice Department announced their deal, JPMorgan filed a motion asking Judge Wettick to vacate or reconsider his order directing the bank to produce the draft complaint. As JPM assistant general counsel Alyssa Kelman explained in her affidavit, Justice only showed the complaint to the bank to prod negotiations. JPMorgan had to agree to keep the draft confidential, she said. The banks brief argued that the draft is protected from discovery under the laws of New York and California. Such drafts are exchanged with the understanding that they will not be disclosed outside of the settlement process and will be kept confidential, the brief said. An order denying this motion and requiring the JPMorgan defendants to produce the draft DOJ complaint here would not only be contrary to federal and state law, it would chill the use of such materials in future settlement negotiations. Besides, the bank argued, the 11-page statement of facts accompanying the Justice Department settlement provides a public explanation of JPMorgans alleged wrongdoing, none of which is relevant to FHLBs claims. (JPMorgans brief was filed in November but was released on Dec. 5.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its response, a Nov. 26 motion to compel, FHLB asks just what JPMorgan is so afraid the draft complaint will reveal  a question I suspect it is not alone in asking. Given the DOJs desire not to have the draft complaint become public until after the settlement was reached, and given JPMorgans apparent deep desire to prevent it from ever seeing the light of day, it would not be at all surprising if the draft complaint is a much more detailed account of JPMorgans fraudulent conduct, and as such, far more enlightening than the statement of facts, the brief said. Those facts should be made public, not only to aid private litigants such as Pittsburgh FHLB in the pursuit of their claims, but also to inform the public of the basis for the DOJs settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither side discusses the collateral litigation consequences for JPMorgan if the draft complaint is disclosed, but I doubt theyd be disastrous. The bank has already settled with the government, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and private investors with mortgage put-back claims (assuming, of course, that MBS trustees sign on to that proposed $4.5 billion deal). Were more than six years past the issuance of most mortgage-backed securities, which means time has just about run out on even state-law fraud claims. There are doubtless good reputational reasons why JPMorgan doesnt want the Justice Departments draft complaint to see the light of day, but I dont think any revelations of misconduct would lead to a flood of new suits, or, at least, viable new suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ill let you know what Judge Wettick decides.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 64 loans secured by 72 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.082 billion as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association; Barclays Bank PLC; General Electric 
      Capital Corporation; Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation; and RAIT 
      Funding, LLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 76.9% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis on 78.2%, and asset summary reviews on 78.2% of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.11x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 106.7%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 8.7%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 9.4% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Leverage: This transaction has higher leverage than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower deals. The pool's Fitch LTV of 
      106.7% is higher than the 2012 and third-quarter 2013 averages of 97.2% 
      and 102.1%, respectively. However, excluding the third-largest loan 
      secured by a multifamily property in New York City, the pool's Fitch LTV 
      is 104.6%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High Multifamily / Low Lodging Exposure: This pool has an above-average 
      concentration of multifamily properties, which represent 25.5% of the 
      total pool balance. This is above the average 2012 and third-quarter 
      2013 concentrations of 6.3% and 11.6%, respectively. Additionally, this 
      transaction has a below-average concentration of hotel properties, which 
      represent 8.6% of the total pool balance; the 2012 and third-quarter 
      2013 average hotel concentrations were 13.5% and 15.6%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Increased Percentage of Partial IO Loans: This pool has a significantly 
      higher concentration of partial-interest loans (56.1%) than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower deals. This is higher than the 2012 
      and third-quarter 2013 averages of 20.1% and 31.0%, respectively. 
      However, full interest-only loans represent only 1.5% of the pool 
      balance, lower than the 2012 and third-quarter 2013 averages of 13.0% 
      and 16.9%, respectively. The pool is scheduled to amortize approximately 
      15.1% prior to maturity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch performed two model-based break-even analyses to determine the 
      level of cash flow and value deterioration the pool could withstand 
      prior to $1 of loss being experienced by the 'BBB-sf' and 'AAAsf' rated 
      classes. Fitch found that the JPMBB 2013-C17 pool could withstand a 
      39.37% decline in value (based on appraised values at issuance) and an 
      approximately 14.99% decrease to the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing a $1 of loss to the 'BBB-sf' rated class. Additionally, 
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 48.97% decline in value and 
      an approximately 28.45% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to JPMBB 2013-C17
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of 
      preliminary ratings to 14 classes of the JPMBB 2013-C17 transaction (see 
      ratings listed below). JPMBB 2013-C17 is a $1.08 billion CMBS conduit 
      transaction collateralized by 64 commercial mortgage loans that are 
      secured by 72 properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loans have principal balances ranging from $2.1 million to $120.0 
      million for the largest loan in the pool, Jordan Creek Town Center 
      (11.1%). Jordan Creek Town Center is a 1.1 million sf, super-regional 
      mall located in West Des Moines, Iowa, approximately 12 miles from the 
      Des Moines CBD. The top five loans, which also include the EIP National 
      Portfolio (8.7%), The Aire (8.3%), Wildwood Center (6.8%) and Residence 
      Inn Seattle Bellevue Downtown (4.4%), represent 39.2% of the initial 
      pool balance, while the top 10 loans represent 54.5%. Unless otherwise 
      indicated, all percentages referenced are based on the approximate 
      aggregate cut-off date balance. 56 loans have 10-year terms (93.3%) and 
      eight loans have a five-year term (6.7%). More than half of the pool 
      balance (23 loans, 56.1%) is comprised of loans with interest only (IO) 
      periods. The remainder of the pool is comprised of amortizing balloon 
      loans (40 loans, 42.4%) with no IO periods and one full-term IO loan 
      (1.5%). The collateral properties are located in 24 states and the 
      District of Columbia. There are three states that exceed 10.0% of the 
      pool balance, which include New York (12.2%), Iowa (11.1%) and Texas 
      (10.1%). The pool has exposure to three property types with 
      concentrations in excess of 15.0%: Retail (27.8%), Multifamily (25.5%) 
      and Office (20.2%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction incorporated our multi-borrower 
      rating process that begins with our analysts' evaluation of underlying 
      collateral properties' financial and operating performance, which 
      determine KBRA&#8217;s estimate of sustainable net cash flow (KNCF) and KBRA 
      value using our CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines. On an aggregate 
      basis, KNCF was 5.6% less than the issuer cash flow. KBRA capitalization 
      rates were applied to each asset&#8217;s KNCF to derive values that were, on 
      an aggregate basis, 34.5% less than third party appraisal values. The 
      pool has an in-trust KLTV of 101.8% and an all-in KLTV of 104.9%. The 
      model deploys rent and occupancy stresses, probability of default 
      regressions, and loss given default calculations to determine losses for 
      each loan, which are then used to assign the credit ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      For complete details on the analysis, please see our Presale Report,&#160;JPMBB 
      2013-C17, published today at&#160;www.krollbondratings.com.&#160;The 
      preliminary ratings are based on information known to KBRA at the time 
      of this publication. Information received subsequent to this release 
      could result in the assignment of final ratings that differ from the 
      preliminary ratings.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;h1&gt;NextPlane Launches Microsoft Office 365 Federation Service&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Office 365 Users Can Now Collaborate With Partners Using Other Types of Unified Communications Platforms&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SUNNYVALE, CA--(Marketwired - Dec 10, 2013) - 
				NextPlane, the leading provider of B2B UC Collaboration and Federation Services, announced that its UC Exchange Service provides support for the Microsoft Office 365 service. Companies wanting to collaborate with their business partners that have deployed Office 365, as well as Office 365 customers, who want to collaborate with partners on other UC platforms, can now do so seamlessly through the NextPlane UC Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click to Tweet: #NextPlane launches Microsoft Office 365 Federation Service, http://bit.ly/18uNURy #UC Collaboration, #UnifiedComm &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B2B UC Collaboration, also called UC Federation, enables end-users to engage their business associates across different partner organizations in real-time communication, using instant messaging and presence (IMP), multi-party chat, voice, video calling and conferencing -- as if they are on the same UC platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a hosted UC service, operated by Microsoft, Office 365 only allows direct federation with other Microsoft platforms, such as Lync 2010.&#160;This is enforced by requiring that the domain name (FQDN - Fully Qualified Domain Name) of the edge/gateway server published in the SIP DNS SRV record, matches the domain name on the security certificate -- issued by a certificate authority such as VeriSign. Otherwise Office 365 refuses to establish an encrypted TLS connection -- as a result the federation fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a "walled garden" environment, Microsoft does not provide any federation options to Office 365 customers. This precludes Office 365 customers from collaborating with partners who are using an XMPP-based platform such as Cisco WebEx Messenger, or OpenFire. Cisco Presence Server (CUPS) and IBM Sametime claim support for federation with Lync 2013 via their own gateways, and in theory they may be able to federate with Office 365, however in practice most Do-it-Yourself (DIY) federations end up to be an uphill and frustrating struggle -- not only in getting them to initially work, but also in maintaining and scaling them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft Office 365 is one of the fastest-growing UC-as-a-Service (UCaaS) in the enterprise. We are now enabling the Office 365 customers to benefit from and/or join collaborative ecosystems that are forming across their industry segments," said Farzin Shahidi, CEO of NextPlane.&#160;"Through the NextPlane UC Exchange service, we enable partner organizations to overcome the technical challenges of Office 365."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By becoming part of UC Exchange community, Office 365 customers can find, connect, and collaborate with business partners across a broad range of unified communication (UC) platforms including IBM Sametime; Cisco Jabber XCP, Unified Presence Server (CUPS), and WebEx Messenger; Unify OpenScape; Google Apps, OpenFire, and virtually any other UC platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About NextPlane&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based in Sunnyvale, CA, NextPlane (www.nextplane.net) is the global leader in providing scalable B2B Collaboration and Federation, Services for Unified Communications (UC). NextPlane UC Exchange is the world's fastest-growing community of organizations that are transforming their real-time B2B collaboration through UC federation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using UC Exchange, leading companies and organizations worldwide in financial services, energy, automotive, pharmaceutical, hi-tech, mining, legal, media, manufacturing, construction and education are building real-time collaborative business communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UC Exchange community is powered by a scalable any-to-any UC collaboration service that includes UC federation, plus Skype, Yahoo, Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, and Social Media federation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it is presence, instant messaging, multi-user chat, or voice and video calls, employees in member organizations can collaborate instantly with their colleagues in partner organizations or public IM networks regardless of their underlying UC platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC Exchange has more than 250 member organizations with 500,000 federated users across 600+ unique corporate domains, generating more than 1 billion federated messages per month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NextPlane UC Exchange Collaboration Service is also being used by the global financial institutions under the name Markit Collaboration Services (MCS). Members include Markit, Thomson Reuters, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, GFI Group, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Member organizations can find, connect, and collaborate with business partners across the broadest range of unified communication (UC) platforms including Microsoft Lync 2013 and 2010, OCS 2007 R2 and R1, LCS 2005; IBM Sametime; Cisco Jabber XCP, Unified Presence Server (CUPS), and WebEx Messenger; Unify OpenScape; Google Apps, OpenFire, and virtually any UC platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC Exchange is powered by a searchable UC Federation Directory of over 250 federation-ready organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UC Exchange Management Portal allows organizations to quickly provision their UC domains for federation-readiness, manage federation requests, and access various reporting and analytics tools.&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer and Kaiser Permanente Beat Apple and Google in Employee 
      Happiness
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CareerBliss 50 Happiest Companies in America Reveals the Top Companies 
      for Employees in 2014
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After thousands of independent employee reviews and analysis of hundreds 
      of companies, CareerBliss announces the 4th annual CareerBliss 
      50 Happiest Companies in America, honoring the top companies 
      dedicated to cultivating happier work environments. Thousands of 
      employees from companies around the nation submitted independent company 
      reviews on CareerBliss.com, ranking their employers on the key factors 
      that impact overall employee happiness. Topping the list is the 
      pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which once again lands in the top 10 this 
      year, ranking No. 1. Following Pfizer is Kaiser Permanente at No. 2. 
      Both these companies beat notable corporations well known for unique 
      company culture, including Apple (No. 15) and Google (No. 21). A trend 
      amongst the 50 companies that made the 2014 list is that each 
      organization is dedicated to supporting the employee in career 
      development programs and cultivating a team committed to providing a 
      positive and rewarding work experience.

			*BlissScore data derived from 2012-2013 employee generated company 
      reviews. BlissScore ranks on a scale of 1-5 and evaluates a combination 
      of 10 key factors that impact overall workplace happiness.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			For a full list of the CareerBliss 50 Happiest Companies in America 
      for 2014: http://www.careerbliss.com/facts-and-figures/careerbliss-50-happiest-companies-in-america-for-2014/
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Each year thousands of employees visit CareerBliss to rank and evaluate 
      their employer. We are honored to be able to award the companies that 
      lead the way in providing happy work environments and truly value their 
      employees,&#8221; says Heidi Golledge, Chief Happiness Officer and co-founder 
      of CareerBliss.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			How CareerBliss Determines The Top 50:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CareerBliss evaluates the key factors that affect work happiness 
      including: work-life balance, one&#8217;s relationship with his/her boss and 
      co-workers, work environment, job resources, compensation, growth 
      opportunities, company culture, company reputation, daily tasks and job 
      control over work performed on a daily basis. The data gathered accounts 
      for how an employee values each factor. Each review is given an average 
      score indicating where the company places between one and five. Reviews 
      are calculated between 2012-2013 from employees that visit CareerBliss. 
      Thousands of reviews from hundreds of companies were tabulated to find 
      the CareerBliss Happiest Companies in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			What Drives Happiness at Work:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Employees from the CareerBliss 50 Happiest Companies in America state 
      that company culture, senior management, and the rewards and the support 
      they get each day contribute to their overall happiness. Pfizer 
      employees, who once again ranked the pharmaceutical company in the top 
      10, state that the support they receive from their team is key in their 
      overall happiness at work. One employee states, &#8220;It is a great 
      company to work at, with cutting edge technologies&#8230;and great career 
      development programs.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;What is unique to the CareerBliss 50 Happiest Companies in America for 
      2014 is the diversity we see &#8211; companies from technology, finance, 
      healthcare and retailers are all creating happier work environments for 
      employees,&#8221; says Bradley Brummel, Ph.D. in workplace psychology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the competition for quality talent increasing, companies are 
      looking for new ways to attract potential employees with not just money, 
      but an environment that allows them to thrive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Good human capital development practices that engage workers and create 
      good work environments are needed in all types of companies and are 
      likely to be a competitive advantage, no matter the core purpose of a 
      business. Creating happy and healthy environments for employees creates 
      loyalty, a strong tenure and typically results in great products and 
      services for their customers,&#8221; says Golledge.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Methodist Health System Partners with MD Buyline and IBM Watson to 
      Improve Healthcare Decisions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MD Buyline&#8217;s Hippocrates powered by IBM Watson enables real-time 
      decision support for healthcare providers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Methodist Health System, a premier healthcare provider in the 
      Dallas-Fort Worth area, will leverage MD Buyline&#8217;s Hippocrates powered 
      by IBM Watson (a cognitive computing application) in its hospitals to 
      enable better patient care, satisfaction and outcomes through more 
      informed decision making. Methodist and MD Buyline will collaborate to 
      identify important structured and unstructured Big Data from both 
      organizations to train Watson to extract, learn, understand and assign 
      context to return real-time, evidence-based responses for users within 
      Methodist Health System.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a tremendous opportunity for Methodist to use comparative 
      effectiveness data to improve care for our patients,&#8221; said Sam Bagchi, 
      MD, Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Informatics, Chief Quality 
      Office, Methodist Health System. &#8220;The addition of Hippocrates powered by 
      IBM Watson is a unique opportunity to align our core values of 
      innovation and quality.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As an advocate for advancing and improving the quality of care, MD 
      Buyline believes Hippocrates powered by IBM Watson is the next 
      generation solution that utilizes Big Data to transform how hospitals 
      make important decisions every day. The quality, objective and 
      evidence-based clinical and financial data MD Buyline has gathered and 
      analyzed for over 30 years combined with the industry&#8217;s most current 
      clinical evidence will be made available in real time through the 
      revolutionary cognitive computing application. Most importantly, 
      Hippocrates will improve care quality by encouraging patient-focused, 
      unbiased healthcare decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Hippocrates powered by IBM Watson presents healthcare providers with an 
      unparalleled opportunity to impact and improve patient outcomes by 
      deriving conclusions across structured and unstructured data, such as 
      health system and facility&#8217;s data systems, MD Buyline clinical and 
      financial data, and publicly available data,&#8221; said Satin Mirchandani, 
      CEO of MD Buyline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With our hospital partners, such as Methodist, Watson will learn 
      information specific to that health system and its patients and 
      research. While Watson is learning this information, it&#8217;s also assigning 
      context and weighing the data according to the reliability of the 
      source. With this approach, Hippocrates provides our hospital partners 
      with real-time access to the latest clinical and financial research, MD 
      Buyline data and first-hand experiences within their own hospitals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hippocrates is designed to be easy to use and collaborate so several 
      areas of the hospital (e.g., clinical and financial support, quality 
      improvement, supply chain, physicians, and the C-suite) can utilize and 
      benefit from the cognitive computing platform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Within Hippocrates, users are able to initiate projects, create goals 
      and assign collaborators. Users will ask Hippocrates a question using 
      natural language and human speech. Hippocrates calls upon Watson to use 
      hypotheses and evidence-based learning to generate a list of 
      confidence-weighted answers. To present the best scenarios and analysis, 
      Watson analyzes thousands of documents and data points from health 
      systems, MD Buyline and the industry that healthcare providers would not 
      otherwise have access to. Hippocrates reduces the time required to 
      generate analysis of this quality from months to minutes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Collaborators can view and comment on the results Hippocrates generated 
      in a social setting. This allows physicians and clinicians to share 
      first-hand experiences with other areas of the hospital. And users can 
      continue to ask questions of Hippocrates to further educate themselves 
      to make the best overall decisions for their patients, physicians and 
      facilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With Hippocrates powered by IBM Watson, healthcare providers are now 
      able to efficiently make the right decisions for their patients and 
      hospitals based on quality, evidence-based information in real time. 
      This Big Data solution is unparalleled in how it enlightens and empowers 
      users to support healthier decisions, hospitals and, ultimately, 
      patients,&#8221; said Mirchandani.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			IBM Watson: Then and Now
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM&#8217;s mission to spark a new generation of Watson-powered apps is the 
      latest milestone in the company&#8217;s initiative to develop cognitive system 
      offerings that help its clients and partners succeed, in a range of 
      industries including healthcare, financial services and retail.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Two years after its triumph on the television quiz show Jeopardy!, IBM 
      Watson has evolved from a first-of-a-kind status, to a commercial 
      cognitive computing system. Watson has gained a 240 percent improvement 
      in system performance, and a reduction of 75 percent in the physical 
      requirements needed to run the system which can now operate from a 
      single Power 750 server with Linux and from a cloud computing 
      environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Named after IBM founder Thomas J. Watson, IBM's transformational 
      cognitive technology was developed in IBM&#8217;s Research Labs. Using 
      advances in natural language processing and analytics, Watson can 
      process information similar to the way people think, representing a 
      significant shift in the ability for organizations to quickly analyze, 
      understand and respond to vast amounts of Big Data. The ability to use 
      Watson to answer complex questions posed in natural language with speed, 
      accuracy and confidence has enormous potential to improve decision 
      making across a variety of industries from healthcare to retail, 
      telecommunications and financial services.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Dec 12 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp raised
the cost of its giant Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project
in Australia by $2 billion on Wednesday, the second increase in
just over a year to take the total cost to $54 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost increase at Gorgon was part of a jump in Chevron's
overall investment spending to $42 billion this year, far more
than the $36.7 billion the company originally budgeted. Larger
rival Exxon Mobil Corp's 2013 budget was $38 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorgon is among around $190 billion worth of LNG projects
under way in Australia which have suffered cost blowouts from
mounting costs due to labour shortages and foreign exchange
movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gorgon project economics are attractive," Chevron Vice
Chairman George Kirkland said in a statement, adding that the
project is 75 percent complete and will start-up in mid-2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also anticipate 2014 will represent the peak year for
spending on our Australian LNG projects as we move them closer
to first production," Kirkland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second largest U.S. oil company, added $15
billion to the Gorgon budget late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns 47 percent of Gorgon, while Exxon and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc each hold 25 percent stakes and the
rest is shared by Japanese LNG buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are putting increased pressure on the world's
biggest oil companies to rein in spending and return more money
to shareholders - a trend Shell recently warned against because
it may create oil shortages in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's overall LNG production, including that from
another Australian plant being built called Wheatstone and a
newly opened development in Angola, is expected to double to the
oil-equivalent of 460,000 barrels per day (boepd) in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a major part of the production Chevron plans to add
as it pursues its 2017 production target of 3.3 million boepd,
up from about 2.6 million currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Chief Executive John Watson said 2013 would
be "a relative peak year for investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also plans to spend $39.8 billion on projects
and exploration in 2014, as it finishes work on huge
developments in Australia as well as the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has three projects in the works in the Gulf of
Mexico: Jack/St Malo, Big Foot and Tubular Bells. The Jack/St.
Malo project is scheduled to start next year, while the Big Foot
project is forecast to start in the second quarter of 2015,
Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company also included in its
list of major projects the expansion of the Caspian Pipeline in
Kazakhstan and Russia and development of the Usan and Agbami
deepwater fields in Nigeria, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the "downstream" budget for refining and chemicals,
Chevron set that at $3.1 billion, compared with a budget of $2.7
billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Microsoft fended off a challenge to its $8.5 billion takeover of messaging service Skype as Europe's second-highest court ruled against claims by rival Cisco that the 2011 deal would harm competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision on Wednesday means Microsoft can continue to market Skype's video calls to consumers and businesses without making any concessions to Cisco or others offering similar products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco's concern about the Skype deal stems from the fact it sells more expensive hardware to help companies with video conferencing, while Microsoft's alternative, based on Skype, can do much the same via a computer equipped with a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco, the world's top network equipment maker, said at a hearing in May that Microsoft's acquisition of Skype, the largest Internet video and voice messaging provider, created a monopoly. Cisco said the European Commission was wrong to approve the deal without demanding concessions from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Luxembourg-based General Court said Cisco had failed to show that the takeover would harm competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's acquisition of Skype is compatible with the (European Union's) internal market. The merger does not restrict competition either on the consumer video communications market or on the business video communications market," the judges said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court said Cisco's large share of the enterprise communications market and the existence of other rivals prevent Microsoft from impeding competition in this sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco, which filed its challenge together with Italian fixed-line and Internet telephone provider and Skype rival Messagenet SpA, originally said it would not appeal to the EU Court of Justice, Europe's highest. But it later withdrew that comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To defend itself against Microsoft, Cisco had pushed for a common set of technology standards in video conferencing to make sure that products offered by different firms work together. It had hoped to get backing from the EU case to ensure such "inter-operability" of video calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are hopeful that in the interest of customers and consumers, Microsoft and others in the industry will join us and continue to rally around this ideal and work together to achieve an open, interoperable video community," said a spokeswoman. "We have no comment about an appeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers and companies have been switching to cheaper Internet-based voice and video services such as Skype, Viber, Google Talk and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third of the world's voice calls are now made on Skype, with more than 280 million users spending more than 100 minutes monthly, Microsoft Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner said in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the Commission and Microsoft welcomed the court ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's judgment by the EU General Court confirms that the Commission was correct in its assessment that the acquisition of Skype by Microsoft would not significantly impede effective competition in the European Economic Area," the EU antitrust regulator said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last successful court challenge to a Commission merger-approval decision was in 2002 in a case involving the Sony Music and BMG record labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is T-79/12 Cisco Systems and Messagenet SpA v Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Leila Abboud; Writing by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Announces $39.8 Billion Capital and Exploratory Budget for 
      2014
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced a $39.8 billion capital 
      and exploratory investment program for 2014. Included in the 2014 
      program are $4.8 billion of planned expenditures by affiliates, which do 
      not require cash outlays by Chevron.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2014 budget is approximately $2 billion lower than expected total 
      investments for 2013. For the current year, total investments are 
      estimated at $42 billion, including expenditures of approximately $4 
      billion for major resource acquisitions not included in the original 
      budget.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We expect 2013 will be a relative peak year for investments, as we 
      completed several attractive resource acquisitions. We also anticipate 
      2014 will represent the peak year for spending on our Australian LNG 
      projects as we move them closer to first production. Overall, we have an 
      attractive portfolio of investment opportunities which we will continue 
      to fund in a disciplined fashion to grow value and shareholder 
      distributions,&#8221; said Chairman and CEO John Watson.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Approximately 90 percent of the 2014 spending program is budgeted for 
      upstream crude oil and natural gas exploration and production projects. 
      Another 8 percent is associated with the company&#8217;s downstream businesses 
      that manufacture, transport and sell gasoline, diesel fuel and other 
      refined products, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Almost 75 percent of affiliate expenditures are associated with 
      investments by Tengizchevroil LLP in Kazakhstan and Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) in the United States.

      Investment of $35.8 billion is planned for exploration and production 
      activities. Notable major capital investments include developments in 
      Australia, Nigeria, the U.S. deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Permian 
      Basin, Kazakhstan, Angola, and the Republic of the Congo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Planned capital spending is also directed toward improving crude oil and 
      natural gas recovery and reducing natural field declines from existing 
      producing assets throughout the world. About 30 percent of the Upstream 
      capital program is allocated to highly profitable development wells and 
      other projects associated with current producing assets. The 2014 base 
      program includes an increase in activity across several producing 
      regions of North America as well as in Thailand and Indonesia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Australia, the Gorgon project has been under construction for four 
      years and is almost 75 percent complete. The current estimate for the 
      cost of the foundation project is US$54 billion (AU$55 billion), with 
      plant startup and first gas planned for mid-2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Gorgon project economics are attractive,&#8221; said Vice Chairman George 
      Kirkland. &#8220;We continue to make steady progress against key project 
      milestones and are applying lessons learned to our Wheatstone 
      development which is almost 25 percent complete. Approximately 75 
      percent of our combined LNG offtake from the two projects is committed 
      under firm, long-term sales and purchase agreements. These LNG 
      developments are two of our most important future legacy assets, 
      representing approximately 400,000 barrels a day of net production at 
      full capacity. They will be substantial contributors to our cash flow 
      for decades to come.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kirkland added: &#8220;Our focus is on developing resource projects that grow 
      shareholder value. For instance, we are steadily increasing activity 
      levels to develop shale and other tight resources in Canada&#8217;s Duvernay, 
      the Vaca Muerta in Argentina and the Permian Basin of the United States. 
      We are very pleased with our global unconventional acreage position.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the Gulf of Mexico projects under development include Jack/St. Malo, 
      Big Foot, and Tubular Bells. The Jack/St. Malo hull has been moored at 
      the offshore location and is on schedule for a 2014 startup. The Big 
      Foot project is forecasting a third quarter 2014 tow to location and a 
      second quarter 2015 start-up.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upstream spending in 2014 for major capital projects also includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Kazakhstan/Russia &#8211; advancement of the Tengiz Future Growth and 
        Wellhead Pressure Management Projects (Kazakhstan) and the Caspian 
        Pipeline expansion (Kazakhstan, Russia)
      
			
        Nigeria &#8211; further development of the Usan and Agbami deepwater fields
      
			
        Canada &#8211; Hebron offshore development and advancement of Kitimat LNG
      
			
        Angola, Republic of the Congo &#8211; development of Mafumeira Sul (Angola) 
        and Moho Nord (Republic of the Congo)
      
			
        Argentina &#8211; advancement of the YPF arrangement for the development of 
        the Vaca Muerta shale
      
			
        United Kingdom &#8211; advancement of the Clair Ridge and Alder projects
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Global exploration funding is expected to be $3.2 billion in 2014. This 
      planned spending includes initial appraisal of new acreage acquired over 
      the past two years, including Australia, the Kurdistan region of Iraq 
      and Morocco. The program also supports continued exploration and 
      appraisal activity in Western Australia, the Gulf of Mexico, West 
      Africa, and in several shale gas regions around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Downstream
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Capital spending of $3.1 billion in 2014 is budgeted for downstream 
      operations.&#160;Expenditures in refining are geared toward enhancing 
      reliability and energy efficiency, feedstock flexibility and production 
      of cleaner transportation fuels. Planned capital spending is also 
      directed toward expanding Oronite additives production in Singapore.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional investments are expected to be funded by Chevron affiliates, 
      including chemicals projects managed by the company&#8217;s 50 percent-owned 
      CPChem. CPChem will be investing in the construction of a 1.5 million 
      metric ton per year ethane cracker as well as two new polyethylene 
      facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast, each with an annual capacity of 
      500,000 metric tonnes. This project takes advantage of existing 
      infrastructure and advantaged feedstocks, and startup is planned for 
      2017.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			All Other
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Expenditures of approximately $1 billion in 2014 are budgeted for 
      technology, power generation and other corporate activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Cisco will not appeal court ruling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Judges say no evidence Skype deal harms competition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Cisco and Microsoft compete in corporate communications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Messaging and video chat tools are growing rapidly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Michele Sinner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUXEMBOURG, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Microsoft fended off a
challenge to its $8.5 billion takeover of messaging service
Skype as Europe's second-highest court ruled against claims by
rival Cisco that the 2011 deal would harm competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision on Wednesday means Microsoft can
continue to market Skype's video calls to consumers and
businesses without making any concessions to Cisco or
others offering similar products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco's concern about the Skype deal stems from the fact it
sells more expensive hardware to help companies with video
conferencing, while Microsoft's alternative, based on Skype, can
do much the same via a computer equipped with a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco, the world's top network equipment maker, said at a
hearing in May that Microsoft's acquisition of Skype, the
largest Internet video and voice messaging provider, created a
monopoly. Cisco said the European Commission was wrong to
approve the deal without demanding concessions from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Luxembourg-based General Court said Cisco had failed to
show that the takeover would harm competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's acquisition of Skype is compatible with the
(European Union's) internal market. The merger does not restrict
competition either on the consumer video communications market
or on the business video communications market," the judges
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court said Cisco's large share of the enterprise
communications market and the existence of other rivals prevent
Microsoft from impeding competition in this sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco, which filed its challenge together with Italian
fixed-line and Internet telephone provider and Skype rival
Messagenet SpA, originally said it would not appeal to the EU
Court of Justice, Europe's highest. But it later withdrew that
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To defend itself against Microsoft, Cisco had pushed for a
common set of technology standards in video conferencing to make
sure that products offered by different firms work together. It
had hoped to get backing from the EU case to ensure such
"inter-operability" of video calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are hopeful that in the interest of customers and
consumers, Microsoft and others in the industry will join us and
continue to rally around this ideal and work together to achieve
an open, interoperable video community," said a spokeswoman. "We
have no comment about an appeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers and companies have been switching to cheaper
Internet-based voice and video services such as Skype, Viber,
Google Talk and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third of the world's voice calls are now made on Skype,
with more than 280 million users spending more than 100 minutes
monthly, Microsoft Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner said in
March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the Commission and Microsoft welcomed the court ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's judgment by the EU General Court confirms that the
Commission was correct in its assessment that the acquisition of
Skype by Microsoft would not significantly impede effective
competition in the European Economic Area," the EU antitrust
regulator said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last successful court challenge to a Commission
merger-approval decision was in 2002 in a case involving the
Sony Music and BMG record labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is T-79/12 Cisco Systems and Messagenet SpA v
Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon said on Wednesday he was thankful congressional leaders had reached a budget deal and was "less worried" about the impact of an eventual scaling back of the Federal Reserve's market-friendly stimulus measures.&lt;/p&gt;

			Driving Change: Coca-Cola Transforms Service Vans to Hybrid Vehicles
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola Partners with XL Hybrids to Add Fuel-Efficient Technology 
      and Expand Hybrid Fleet
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s familiar service vans are getting a makeover just in time 
      for the New Year. Coca-Cola is converting all of its newly purchased 
      2014 Chevrolet Express service vans into fuel-efficient hybrid-electric 
      vehicles using XL Hybrids&#8217; innovative powertrain technology. The updated 
      vans will be traversing roads across the country by year&#8217;s end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola currently operates the largest heavy-duty hybrid-electric 
      delivery fleet in North America. The addition of 100 hybrid service vans 
      builds upon this work by expanding the variety of fuel-efficient options 
      in the Company&#8217;s light-duty fleet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Adoption of this hybrid technology supports Coca-Cola&#8217;s goal to reduce 
      the carbon footprint embedded in &#8216;the drink in your hand&#8217; by 25 percent 
      by 2020,&#8221; said Bruce Karas, Vice President of Environment and 
      Sustainability for Coca-Cola. &#8220;We continue to make energy-saving 
      investments because they are good for business, good for the communities 
      we serve and good for the planet.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Early test results of this hybrid technology were positive, showing a 15 
      to 20 percent fuel reduction compared to the Company&#8217;s conventional 
      vans. The 100 new hybrid vans are expected to eliminate about 4,000 
      total tons of carbon dioxide emissions that conventional vans would 
      produce over their 10-year life span.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of the low maintenance and fuel savings, the powertrain unit 
      pays for itself three times over its life span.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;XL Hybrids provides technology that helps Coca-Cola meet its emissions 
      reduction goals while saving money,&#8221; said Justin Ashton, Vice President 
      of Business Development and Co-founder at XL Hybrids. &#8220;Our company&#8217;s 
      goal is to accelerate fuel and emissions reductions at a large scale. To 
      accomplish this, we had to design and commercialize technology that 
      provides a solid economic return on investment to corporate customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the hybrid service vans, Coca-Cola recently announced the 
      roll out of 16 first-of-its-kind refrigerated plug-in electric vehicles. 
      These trucks deliver the Company&#8217;s Odwalla&#174; brand beverages in the San 
      Francisco Bay Area. Coca-Cola is also making carbon footprint reductions 
      across its manufacturing processes, packaging and refrigeration 
      equipment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About XL Hybrids
		&lt;/p&gt;

      XL Hybrids designs, manufactures and installs hybrid electric 
      powertrains for commercial vans and trucks. The company&#8217;s patent-pending 
      hybrid electric powertrain can be installed on existing vehicles or as 
      an upfit on new ones. By storing energy wasted in braking and reapplying 
      it during acceleration, XL Hybrids technology decreases fuel use and 
      carbon dioxide emissions by up to 21.2 percent on urban or suburban 
      routes, while operating with the same durability and reliability as 
      traditional vans and trucks. XL Hybrids was founded by MIT alumni and is 
      based in Boston. For more information, visit www.xlhybrids.com.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Dec 11 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp 
has sold more than 2 million Xbox One video game consoles since
its Nov. 22 launch, catching up with rival Sony Corp's 
PlayStation 4 released a week earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. software giant on Wednesday said it took 18 days
for Xbox One's global sales to surpass 2 million. Japan's Sony
last week said it took 15 days for PS4 sales to cross 2.1
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox One, on sale in 13 countries, is selling quicker
than its predecessor, the Xbox 360, and is sold out at most
retailers, said Microsoft spokesman David Dennis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're manufacturing as fast as we can" to replenish
supplies at stores during the holiday season, Dennis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Xbox One, priced $499 in the United States, and PS4,
priced $399, offer improved graphics for increased realism and
faster processors permitting smoother play, as well as numerous
exclusive games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Xbox One, Microsoft hopes to not only entice gamers
but appeal to a broader consumer base of TV fans and music
lovers with its interactive entertainment features and media
applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert W. Baird &amp; Co analyst Colin Sebastian in October said
he expected shipments of 2.5 million to 3 million consoles for
both the Xbox One and PS4 in October-December.&lt;/p&gt;

			Octapharma AG Enters into Agreement with Pfizer for the Future 
      Commercialization and Marketing in the U.S. of an Investigational 
      Intravenous Therapy for the Urgent Reversal of an Oral Anticoagulant
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Biologics License Application (BLA) Currently Under Review by U.S. 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Octapharma AG today announced it has entered into an agreement with 
      Pfizer Inc. for the future marketing and commercialization of human 
      prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), an investigational agent 
      currently under FDA review for the urgent reversal of Vitamin K 
      antagonist (VKA, e.g., warfarin) therapy in adult patients who require 
      urgent surgery or invasive procedures. Under the terms of the agreement, 
      Octapharma AG has exclusive rights to commercialize this product 
      globally, with the exception of the U.S. where Pfizer will exclusively 
      be responsible for marketing and commercialization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This collaboration will add value to the overall potential of the 
      compound,&#8221; said Octapharma AG Board Member Flemming Nielsen. &#8220;Subject to 
      FDA approval of our BLA, the relationship enables the two companies to 
      effectively build on each other&#8217;s core capabilities to help meet a need 
      in emergency medicine.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The BLA for the product was submitted by Octapharma AG in April 2013 and 
      is currently under FDA review. Octapharma AG&#8217;s PCC is approved for use 
      in 75 countries outside the U.S. under the brand name Octaplex&#174; and was 
      first approved for use in Germany in 2003 (it is branded as Ocplex&#174; in 
      Sweden and Pronativ&#174; in Australia).
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Sign of Saudi Arabia becoming self-sufficient in meeting
gasoil needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Aramco Trading could skip gasoil term imports next year -
source&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* New Jubail refinery to meet S.Arabia's gasoil growth -
traders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jessica Jaganathan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has
offered gasoil cargoes through a rare term tender from its
joint-venture refinery in Saudi Arabia, in a further sign that
the country is becoming more self-sufficient in meeting its
gasoil needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gasoil from the Saudi Aramco Mobil Refinery Co (SAMREF)
refinery in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, which is a joint venture
between Exxon Mobil and Saudi Aramco, is usually sold within
Saudi Arabia, with the occasional spot cargoes offered for
exports, traders said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Exxon Mobil has offered up to 6 million barrels of 500
ppm sulphur gasoil through a rare term tender from the refinery
for loading next year, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has offered 11 to 12 cargoes of either 300,000 barrels or
500,000 barrels each of gasoil for loading from Yanbu, Saudi
Arabia over January to December, next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tender closes on Dec. 12 and is valid until Dec. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've only seen a spot tender from them, but they have (a
term contract) for the high sulphur gasoil," said a
Singapore-based middle distillates trader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cargoes have always been there but they normally keep
(those) for themselves apart from during winter," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second trader added that gasoil cargoes of similar
specifications were offered regularly for exports from the
refinery a few years ago, but stopped about 3 to 4 years ago
likely due to a rise in domestic demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would imagine they are fearing a slump in premium over
2014, and hence might want to capture a better premium now," a
third Gulf-based trader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has historically been short of gasoline and
gasoil. Its petro-dollar fuelled economy and growing population
have rapidly driven up internal demand, especially when power
generation surges in the hot summer months from May to August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country imported a record monthly volume of over 10
million barrels of gasoil in July, this year, up from a usual
peak of 7 to 9 million barrels for the same month in previous
years, official Saudi data showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW JUBAIL REFINERY CHANGES TRADE FLOWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unexpected term cargoes from the Yanbu refinery are
likely due to new refining capacity appearing in Saudi Arabia,
which is expected to cut the country's reliance on fuel imports,
traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aramco started oil product exports from the new Saudi Aramco
Total Refining and Petrochemicals Co (SATORP) refinery in
Jubail, Saudi Arabia from the second half of this year, which is
expected to cut its reliance on gasoil imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Saudis taking some volumes from their new refinery,
it's freeing up some volumes (from other refineries in Saudi
Arabia)," said a Singapore-based trader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aramco Trading, the trading arm of Saudi Aramco, might skip
its term gasoil imports for next year, a source close to the
matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could possibly change trade flow patterns in the region
and pressure gasoil margins, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many refineries in Asia and the Middle East depend on Saudi
Arabia's diesel imports to absorb excess cargoes in the region.
With a significantly reduced demand from Saudi Arabia and even
exports from its refineries, traders are worried the supply glut
in Asia will pressure refinery margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SATORP, the first of a trio of 400,000 barrels per day (bpd)
refineries due to open over the next five years, will refine
Saudi heavy crude into fuels ranging from gasoil, including
diesel, to gasoline and petroleum coke for domestic consumption
and export.&lt;/p&gt;

not sold term cargoes in a few years, a Singapore-based trader

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM Corp has been sued by a shareholder who accused it of concealing how its ties to what became a major U.S. spying scandal reduced business in China and ultimately caused its market value to plunge more than $12 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM lobbied Congress hard to pass a law letting it share personal data of customers in China and elsewhere with the U.S. National Security Agency, in a bid to protect its intellectual property rights, according to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff in the complaint, Louisiana Sheriffs' Pension &amp; Relief Fund, said this threatened IBM hardware sales in China, particularly given a program known as Prism that let the NSA spy on that country through technology companies such as IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baton Rouge pension fund said the revelation of Prism and related disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden caused Chinese businesses and China's government to abruptly cut ties with the world's largest technology services provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said this led IBM on October 16 to post disappointing third-quarter results, including drops in China of 22 percent in sales and 40 percent in hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While quarterly profit rose 6 percent, revenue dropped 4 percent and fell well below analyst forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell 6.4 percent on October 17, wiping out $12.9 billion of the Armonk, New York-based company's market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit names IBM, Chief Executive Virginia Rometty and Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge as defendants, and says they should be held liable for the company's failure to reveal the risks of its lobbying and its NSA ties sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman Doug Shelton did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana fund is represented by Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger &amp; Grossmann, a prominent class-action specialist. It seeks class-action status on behalf of shareholders from June 25 to October 16, 2013, and damages for shareholder losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge is retiring as CFO this month at age 60, which IBM calls its traditional retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Schroeter, who has been IBM's head of global finance, is replacing him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Sheriffs' Pension &amp; Relief Fund v.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 12 (Reuters) - IBM Corp has been sued
by a shareholder who accused it of concealing how its ties to
what became a major U.S. spying scandal reduced business in
China and ultimately caused its market value to plunge more than
$12 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM lobbied Congress hard to pass a law letting it share
personal data of customers in China and elsewhere with the U.S.
National Security Agency, in a bid to protect its intellectual
property rights, according to a complaint filed in the U.S.
District Court in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff in the complaint, Louisiana Sheriffs' Pension
&amp; Relief Fund, said this threatened IBM hardware sales in China,
particularly given a program known as Prism that let the NSA spy
on that country through technology companies such as IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baton Rouge pension fund said the revelation of Prism
and related disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden
caused Chinese businesses and China's government to abruptly cut
ties with the world's largest technology services provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said this led IBM on Oct. 16 to post disappointing
third-quarter results, including drops in China of 22 percent in
sales and 40 percent in hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While quarterly profit rose 6 percent, revenue dropped 4
percent and fell well below analyst forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell 6.4 percent on Oct. 17, wiping out $12.9
billion of the Armonk, New York-based company's market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit names IBM, Chief Executive Virginia Rometty and
Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge as defendants, and says
they should be held liable for the company's failure to reveal
the risks of its lobbying and its NSA ties sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman Doug Shelton did not immediately respond to

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Dec 12 (Reuters) - Opening Mexico's oil sector to
foreign investors would be a "win-win" for all involved, an
Exxon Mobil Corp executive said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico's Congress on Thursday passed a landmark reform to

said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have said the world's leading oil companies will
need to see final investment terms and new regulations before
deciding whether to do business in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to keep an eye on those," Tim Cutt, head of
petroleum at resources giant BHP Billiton, said 
of Mexico's reforms as both the Eagle Ford shale and Permian
Basin in Texas as well as the U.S. Gulf of Mexico abut Mexican
borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is "a decent extrapolation" that similar opportunities
exist across the border, given the close proximity of the
onshore and offshore basins, Cutt told reporters in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) is working with criminal and regulatory authorities on settlements over the bank's relationship with convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff, ones that would involve $2 billion in penalties and a rare criminal action, according to sources familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Privileged Identity Management Market 
      2014-2018: BeyondTrust Software, CA, IBM  Lieberman Software Dominate
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/tbk6mh/global_privileged) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Privileged Identity Management Market 2014-2018" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Privileged Identity Management market to grow at a CAGR of 
      26.6 percent over the period 2014-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers in this market is the growing compliance 
      requirements. Compliance requirements, both internal and external, make 
      companies adhere to certain rules and regulations. In case of any 
      breach, they have to pay hefty penalties. Therefore, the increasing need 
      to comply with these stringent regulatory requirements is a major driver 
      for this market as privileged identity management solutions help 
      enterprises to comply with these requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There has been an increasing adoption of cloud services in the recent 
      past. This has led to an emergence of new forms of threats. As the 
      services for cloud applications are hosted, the security has to be 
      provided by both the providers and users. Thus, traditional security 
      solutions designed for on-premise applications may not work for cloud 
      services and applications. Hence, with the increasing need for 
      cloud-based solutions and the increasing migration to cloud services, 
      privileged identity management vendors are introducing cloud-based 
      privileged identity management solutions. Most pure-play privileged 
      identity management vendors such as Cyber-Ark, Lieberman Software, and 
      BeyondTrust provide cloud application-specific solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the increasing complexity of network infrastructure. The 
      increasing complexity of network infrastructure has affected the 
      accuracy of privileged identity management solutions, thereby posing a 
      major challenge to the growth of the Global Privileged Identity 
      Management market.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dec 12 (Reuters) - North American liquids production is
expected to rise by more than 40 percent between 2010 and 2040,
driven by technological advancements that enable increased
output from sources such as oil sands, Exxon Mobil Corp 
said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More of the world's oil demand will be met by unconventional
sources, which will make up nearly half of the liquids supply by
2040, the company said in its annual energy outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technological advancements such as hydraulic fracturing 
have led to an energy boom in the United States with soaring
production from shale fields in Texas and North Dakota cutting
the country's dependence on energy imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, also
said it did not expect regulations on fracking to slow U.S.
shale development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do assume we will have continued access to
unconventional resources, there is so much opportunity for
unconventional resources, we don't see any significant
constraints in those areas where we are operating today,"
William Colton, Exxon's vice president of corporate strategic
planning said at a meeting to discuss the outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil production hit its highest level in 25 years in
November, averaging 8 million barrels per day, the U.S. Energy
Information Administration said in its latest monthly short-term
energy outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon reiterated on Thursday that it expected global energy
demand to increase 35 percent between 2010 and 2040, driven by
developing nations such as India and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural gas is expected to continue to meet nearly
60 percent of global energy demand, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also forecast a surge in the number hybrid
vehicles on world roads in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficiency for world's car fleet is projected to climb to 46
miles per gallon, up from 24 miles per gallon in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those gains reflect a surge in demand for hybrid vehicles,
which are expected to account for half of global new car sales 
and will account for 35 percent of the world's fleet by 2040,
Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;

			Nellymoser and NeoMedia Announce a Complete Solution for Migrating 
      from Microsoft Tag to Other Activation Technologies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nellymoser and NeoMedia 
      Technologies, Inc. (OTC BB:NEOM) announced today a solution that 
      will allow a seamless migration from Microsoft Tag (&#8220;Tag&#8221;) to other 
      forms of mobile activations such as QR codes, watermarks, and image 
      recognition (IR). Similar to QR codes, Microsoft Tag is a technology for 
      triggering activations from traditional or digital media, including 
      print.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since Tag is being discontinued by Microsoft, customers looking for new 
      or alternative solutions to migrate their codes now have a choice. 
      Microsoft Tag, which held an 84% market share in the Top 100 magazines 
      in 2010, has been eclipsed by QR codes, which comprised 68% of all 
      mobile activations in 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The joint solution by Nellymoser and NeoMedia presents brands, 
      publishers, and agencies with options to migrate from Tag to a wide 
      range of activation technologies such as QR, other 2D codes, or 
      watermarks. The migrated content can be scanned with the free NeoReader&#174; 
      app or a branded companion app using a built-in universal scanner. 
      Robust analytics and end-to-end client-specific options are some of the 
      joint solution&#8217;s benefits. Incentive offers are in place until March 31, 
      2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARSAW Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. energy major Chevron 
will join forces on shale gas exploration in south-eastern
Poland with local state-controlled gas firm PGNiG to
lower costs and speed up the work, PGNiG said in a statement on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement is the first example of cooperation between a
Polish firm and a foreign investor in the shale gas sector, move
keenly awaited by international players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. or Canadian firms would bring expertise in shale gas
exploration, while local firms would contribute access to
exploration licences and can help smooth relations with Polish
authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The initiative is part of PGNiG's new policy of openness to
opportunities that might come from working with other companies
interested in Polish shale gas deposits," PGNiG said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies said that if the cooperation is successful,
they may set up a joint company in which both will hold a 50
percent stakes. A joint venture would bring together four
licences in south-eastern Poland: two from PGNiG, and two from
Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binding agreements are expected to be signed in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poland, which imports most of the gas it consumes from
Russia, had high hopes for its own shale gas reserves. But red
tape and poor drilling results have forced some global players
to pull out. They had also complained that Polish companies were
reluctant to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron remains committed to our exploration program in
Poland," the U.S. company said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Dell and Microsoft Strengthen Alliance to Help Customers Take Full 
      Advantage of Public Cloud
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Dell expands Cloud Partner Program to include Microsoft and Windows 
        Azure, building on Dell&#8217;s current Windows Application Services 
        capabilities
      
			
        The Dell-Microsoft relationship brings added choice and flexibility to 
        customers, giving businesses a competitive advantage when implementing 
        public cloud
      
			
        With Windows Azure and Dell Cloud offerings, customers can easily 
        deploy on-demand cloud infrastructure that scales and adapts to 
        evolving business needs
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dell today announced it is building on its strategic alliance with 
      Microsoft to deliver Windows Azure to Dell customers worldwide through 
      the Dell Cloud Partner 
      Program. This expands upon the previously 
      announced alliance providing Application Development Services on 
      Windows Azure. With the evolving Dell-Microsoft relationship, current 
      and future customers will have even more choice and flexibility when 
      pursuing and planning public cloud infrastructures. Acting as a 
      single-source supplier through the Dell Cloud Partner Program, Dell will 
      offer customers a central point of solution integration, control and 
      direct support, lessening the complexity and challenges of deploying 
      cloud environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At the heart of Dell&#8217;s Cloud strategy are customer choice and 
      flexibility, the underlying reasons driving our continued expansion of 
      the Dell Cloud Partner Program and our open, scalable cloud solutions 
      and services across Dell,&#8221; said Nnamdi Orakwue, vice president, Dell 
      Software Strategy, Operations and Cloud. &#8220;The evolution of our Windows 
      Azure alliance combined with Dell&#8217;s end-to-end solutions, services and 
      support will help Dell customers globally truly reap the benefits of 
      cloud to achieve tangible business results.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Windows Azure is a flexible and scalable cloud platform that lets 
      customers build on trusted Microsoft technology, including Windows 
      Server 2012 R2 with Hyper-V and System Center 2012 R2. Strengthening our 
      relationship with Dell for Windows Azure adds new opportunities for 
      businesses to quickly and easily build, deploy and manage applications 
      across public cloud environments,&#8221; said Garth Fort, general manager, 
      Server and Tools Marketing, Microsoft. &#8220;This relationship will give 
      additional tools to organizations of all sizes and help them turn the 
      cloud into a focused, competitive advantage.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to taking advantage of Windows Azure, Dell customers gain a 
      superior level of integration and support across existing Dell solutions 
      and services such as:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        A complete portfolio 
        of services to develop and manage next-generation, custom 
        applications for Windows Azure, as announced 
        earlier this year;
      
			
        Expert guidance in helping assess, build, operate and control cloud 
        environments with Dell 
        Cloud Consulting and Application Services, whether customers are 
        just starting in cloud, already have significant cloud investments, or 
        are somewhere in between;
      
			
        The ability to manage single or multiple public, private and hybrid 
        clouds through one pane of glass with Dell 
        Cloud Manager, formerly Enstratius; and,
      
			
        Direct support from a Dell salesperson to advise customers through the 
        best purchasing, deployment and maintenance options to meet their 
        unique needs, accounting for budget, workloads, current 
        infrastructure, use cases, etc.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      As unified cloud management is critical to supporting any cloud 
      environment, Dell also unveiled today that Dell 
      Cloud Manager is adding support for Windows Azure Compute on top of 
      the already supported Windows Azure Storage. This comprehensive offering 
      now brings the governance, business agility, and open approach of Dell 
      Cloud Manager to Windows Azure users for both Compute and Storage, 
      enabling them to benefit from increased security, automation, 
      integration with leading configuration management and operational tools 
      for orchestration, and cloud management. Dell Cloud Manager is a cloud 
      infrastructure management solution for deploying and managing 
      enterprise-class applications and the consumption of cloud services in 
      public, private and hybrid clouds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Dell Cloud Partner Program gives customers more choice and 
      flexibility to select the public cloud partner, platform and model 
      appropriate for their business needs. The Program complements Dell&#8217;s 
      cloud focus areas of enabling private cloud, delivering multi-cloud 
      management and supplying cloud builders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4428 Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4428 'AA/F1'; Negative Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --DRIVERs, Series 4428 'AA'; Negative Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA'; Negative Outlook ratings assigned to the series 4428 
      PUTTERs and series 4428 DRIVERs are based on the rating that Fitch has 
      assigned to Commonwealth of Pennsylvania General Obligation Bonds, 
      Second Series of 2013 (rated 'AA'; Negative Outlook) that have been 
      deposited in the series 4428 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4428 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 
      A+/F1'; Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs will 
      expire on June 30, 2014, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, 
      unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bond deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp wants the United
States to remove restrictions on exporting oil, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing an interview with a company executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest publicly traded oil company is pressing
for crude exports as it expects decades of ample crude supplies
in the United States and elsewhere, as well as rising global
demand, the newspaper said. (link.reuters.com/meh45v)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Export Administration Act of 1979 bans the sale of U.S.
crude abroad, except to Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, due to release its energy demand outlook later on
Thursday, reiterated in the report that it expected global
energy demand to increase 35 percent between 2010 and 2040,
driven by developing nations such as India and China, the
Journal said.

        Oil and natural gas expected to continue to meet nearly 60 percent of 
        global energy demand
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The world will require all forms of energy over the next quarter century 
      to meet a greater than one-third increase in demand that will be driven 
      by population growth, improved living standards and expanded 
      urbanization, according to ExxonMobil&#8217;s 
      Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040, which was released today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Understanding global energy trends is absolutely critical for effective 
      energy policy,&#8221; said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive 
      officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:&#160;XOM). &#8220;The world depends on 
      safe, reliable and affordable energy development to support economic 
      growth and our modern way of life.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In its annual forecast, ExxonMobil projects that future energy needs - 
      expected to be about 35 percent higher in 2040 than 2010 - will be 
      supported by more efficient energy-saving practices and technologies, 
      increased use of less-carbon-intensive fuels such as natural gas, 
      nuclear and renewables as well as the continued development of 
      technology advances to develop new energy sources. Without gains in 
      efficiency, global energy demand could have risen by more than 100 
      percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Driving increased energy demand is anticipated population growth that 
      will reach nearly 9 billion in 2040 from about 7 billion today, and a 
      projected doubling of the global economy - at an annual growth rate of 
      nearly 3 percent - largely in the developing world where rising living 
      standards will continue to lift millions of people out of poverty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The outlook projects that oil and natural gas will continue to meet 
      about 60 percent of energy needs by 2040. Liquid fuels - gasoline, 
      diesel, jet fuel and fuel oil - will remain the energy of choice for 
      most types of transportation because they offer a unique combination of 
      affordability, availability, portability and high energy density.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An expected 25 percent increase in demand for oil, led by increased 
      commercial transportation activity, will be met through technology 
      advances that enable deep-water production and development of oil sands 
      and tight oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Natural gas will continue to be the fastest-growing major fuel source as 
      demand increases by about 65 percent. Natural gas is projected to 
      account for more than one quarter of all global energy needs by 2040 and 
      it is expected to overtake coal as the largest source of electricity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nuclear energy will see solid growth despite some countries scaling back 
      their nuclear expansion plans following the 2011 Fukushima incident in 
      Japan. Growth will be led by the Asia Pacific region, where nuclear 
      output is projected to increase from 3 percent of total energy in 2010 
      to nearly 9 percent by 2040. Renewable energy supplies - including 
      traditional biomass, hydro and geothermal as well as wind, solar and 
      biofuels - will grow by nearly 60 percent. Wind, solar and biofuels are 
      likely to make up about 4 percent of energy supplies in 2040, up from 1 
      percent in 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Energy used for power generation will continue to be the largest 
      component of global demand and is expected to grow by more than 50 
      percent by 2040 as improved living standards that come with urbanization 
      and rising incomes lead to increased household and industrial 
      electricity consumption through wider penetration of electronics, 
      appliances and other modern conveniences. The growth reflects an 
      expected 90 percent increase in electricity use, led by developing 
      countries where 1.3 billion people are currently without access to 
      electricity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Outlook for Energy is ExxonMobil&#8217;s long-term global view of 
      energy demand and supply and its findings help guide investments that 
      underpin the company&#8217;s business strategy. The outlook is developed by 
      examining energy supply and demand trends in more than 100 countries and 
      15 demand sectors, such as transportation, industrial and power 
      generation. Twenty different types of energy that will be available to 
      future consumers are evaluated while taking into account assessments of 
      future technologies, government policies and cross-border trade flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other key findings from the 2014 Outlook for Energy include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Market forces and emerging public policies will continue to have an 
        impact on energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. After decades of 
        growth, worldwide energy-related carbon dioxide emissions are expected 
        to plateau around 2030 before gradually declining toward 2040, despite 
        a steady rise in overall energy use.
      
			
        New technologies will continue to play an important role in 
        development of reliable and affordable energy. Significant 
        advancements in oil and natural gas technologies have safely unlocked 
        vast new supplies, already changing the energy landscape in North 
        America and expanding supplies to help meet growing global energy 
        demand.
      
			
        Through most of the outlook period, more than half of the growth in 
        unconventional natural gas supply will be in North America, providing 
        a strong foundation for increased economic growth across the United 
        States, and most notably in industries such as energy, chemicals, 
        steel and manufacturing.
      
			
        About 65 percent of the world&#8217;s recoverable crude and condensate 
        resource will have yet to be produced by 2040.
      
			
        The number of cars on the road worldwide is expected to approximately 
        double by 2040, but fuel demand will plateau and gradually decline as 
        consumers turn to smaller, lighter vehicles and technologies improve 
        fuel economy.
      
			
        Demand for energy in non-OECD nations will grow by about two thirds, 
        accounting for essentially all of the increase in global energy use.
      
			
        Global chemicals energy demand is expected to rise by about 55 percent 
        from 2010 to 2040 and will account for 35 percent of the growth in the 
        industrial sector. Most of the energy demand growth in the chemicals 
        sector will be for the feedstocks to make the building blocks for a 
        wide range of essential products. Fuel demand will grow more slowly as 
        improvements to efficiency reduce demand growth.
      
			
        Oil and natural gas are the most widely traded energy sources and 
        maintaining a robust global energy marketplace will remain critical to 
        meeting rising energy demand.
      
			
        Traded volumes of natural gas in 2040 are expected to be 
        two-and-a-half times the 2010 level, with most of this growth coming 
        from liquefied natural gas.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI/HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia has won an appeal to release a local factory seized by authorities in a tax dispute, allowing the transfer of the plant as part of the sale of its mobile phone business to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant in the southern city of Chennai is one of Nokia's biggest phone-making factories. Nokia had appealed its seizure and was trying to resolve the dispute ahead of the closure of the 5.4 billion euro ($7.4 billion) Microsoft deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia had wanted the asset freeze to be lifted by December 12 to enable the transfer of ownership to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the tax dispute is still ongoing and if Nokia loses it may have to pay as much as $3.4 billion, including penalties for non-payment of tax and interest, according to a tax department lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Delhi High Court asked the Finnish company to deposit 22.50 billion rupees ($367.17 million) in an escrow account as a condition for lifting the freeze and transferring the facility to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia's case is one of several high-profile tax disputes involving foreign companies in India, which has stepped up its pursuit of claims against such firms as it seeks to rein in its budget deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other foreign firms recently involved in tax disputes in India include IBM, Royal Dutch Shell, Vodafone Plc and LG Electronics Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extended asset freeze as a result of the dispute would have blocked Nokia from transferring ownership of the Chennai plant, possibly forcing it to operate as a subcontractor for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was the question, if Nokia couldn't sell this factory what should it do? Should they sell it later or should they be a subcontractor? This was some kind of uncertainty," said Pohjola Markets analyst Hannu Rauhala. "But of course, we still don't know how much Nokia has to pay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Nokia in Helsinki said the company would comment after analyzing the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a very fair and balanced order," said N.P. Sahni, a lawyer for the tax department. "It substantially protects the interest of the revenue (department) and also enables Nokia to go ahead with its proposed deal with Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Nokia was served with a tax demand for about 20.8 billion rupees covering five fiscal years starting from 2006-07, according to a notice on the Delhi High Court website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including the anticipated liability, or the tax bill for the years that have not been assessed by the authorities, the total liability could be roughly 75 billion rupees, Mohan Parasaran, a lawyer representing the tax department, said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Nokia loses the legal battle, its liability could total 210 billion rupees, which includes penalties and interest, Parasaran said. He declined to give additional details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia shares, which had fallen over 2 percent earlier in the day on uncertainty about the case's outcome, were flat by 1145 GMT.

&lt;p&gt;By Sumeet Chatterjee and Ritsuko Ando&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI/HELSINKI Dec 12 (Reuters) - Nokia has
won an appeal to release a local factory seized by authorities
in a tax dispute, allowing the transfer of the plant as part of

			JPMorgan Chase Launches $250 Million Global Economic Opportunity 
      Initiative
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Through research, data and investments, &#8220;New Skills at Work&#8221; aims to 
      revolutionize the way employers and skills trainers develop talent for 
      jobs in local high-growth industries
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. today launched an unprecedented five-year, $250 
      million global workforce readiness and demand-driven training initiative 
      called New Skills at Work. The new initiative will be the largest 
      ever private-sector effort aimed at addressing the &#8220;skills gap&#8221; that 
      exists across many industries, such as healthcare and advanced 
      manufacturing, where not enough trained workers have the specific skills 
      to fill the jobs available.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The announcement was made at an event in Washington, DC hosted by the 
      Aspen Institute featuring JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, 
      Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, former Director of the White House Domestic 
      Policy Council Melody Barnes, and Aspen President and CEO Walter 
      Isaacson.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to an IMF analysis, the skills gap accounts for approximately 
      one-third of the U.S. unemployment rate. By 2020, an estimated 63% of 
      the projected 48 million job openings will require some sort of 
      post-secondary school training. Using research and data analysis, 
      public-private partnerships and engagement with local leaders and 
      organizations, New Skills at Work will accelerate economic growth 
      by supporting training programs that will have the greatest impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Addressing the skills gap can be one of our most powerful tools for 
      reducing unemployment and creating more broadly shared prosperity,&#8221; said 
      Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase. 
      &#8220;JPMorgan is using its best assets, including industry intelligence and 
      strong partnerships in local communities, to provide a platform for 
      employers, educators and workforce participants to help people gain the 
      skills they need to succeed.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon will chair the JPMorgan Chase Global Workforce Advisory Council, 
      which will bring together a group of private sector, non-profit, 
      education and workforce development thought leaders to ensure the 
      effectiveness of the effort. The Advisory Council will advise on the 
      development, implementation and evaluation of New Skills at Work. 
      Melody Barnes, former Director of the White House Domestic Policy 
      Council, will co-chair the Council.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the key challenges is that too little data about employer demand 
      is available to inform workforce training programs. New Skills at Work 
      will fill that void by producing Workforce Readiness Gap Reports in 
      local markets to help drive more effective and strategic local workforce 
      planning. This research will explore regional level workforce 
      deficiencies and challenges and seek to identify holes in local job 
      markets and the skills needed to fill identified gaps. The data will be 
      used to inform program development efforts with both the supply and 
      demand sides of the skills gap challenge. On the demand side, the data 
      will help business groups and sector associations to broadcast the 
      skills they need to compete and prosper. On the supply side, the data 
      will help leading national workforce training groups including the Aspen 
      Institute&#8217;s Forum for Community Solutions, the Institute for Public 
      Policy Research, the National Academy Foundation, Jobs for the Future, 
      Participle, Year Up and YouthBuild develop the training programs and 
      credentials targeted to meet employer demands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our work with JPMorgan Chase is vitally important to the future success 
      of America&#8217;s workforce,&#8221; said Steve Patrick, executive director of The 
      Aspen Forum for Community Solutions at The Aspen Institute. &#8220;In our 
      country, 6.8 million young people graduate high school unprepared to 
      meet the needs of a 21st century economy, and with this new initiative, 
      we can create the capacity to drive solutions that connect youth to 
      careers vital to America&#8217;s growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Skills at Work research and programming will focus on major 
      U.S. and European urban areas, with an initial focus on Chicago, 
      Columbus, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, the 
      San Francisco Bay Area and London. Specific grants and partnerships for 
      individual cities will be announced in the early months of 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Closing the skills gap has to be one of the top priorities of our 
      economic development efforts around the nation,&#8221; said Mayor Emanuel. &#8220;In 
      Chicago, we have focused on training our students to ensure they have 
      the skills and education they&#8217;ll need to get the jobs that will be 
      available in the future. Around the nation, we must direct our 
      collective effort on similar missions, and I&#8217;m grateful that JP Morgan 
      Chase has put so much energy and resources into addressing these 
      critical issues. I look forward to working with all Americans to make 
      progress on these important economic issues and get people into good 
      jobs and careers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Chicago, Mayor Emanuel&#8217;s work to close the skills gap includes an 
      innovative program at the City Colleges of Chicago &#8211; called College to 
      Careers. The program, launched in 2011, partners faculty and staff at 
      City Colleges with more than 100 industry leaders to design curriculum 
      and facilities and offer internships and job opportunities to ensure 
      Chicagoans are ready to hit the ground running in fast-growing fields. 
      Leaders from the private and public sectors, college faculties and 
      industry groups come together to design innovative coursework, 
      curriculum and training, to ensure students are trained with the skills 
      they need for the jobs of tomorrow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The partnerships that New Skills at Work will develop with 
      non-profit organizations will aim to expand education and training 
      programs that are proven effective at helping Americans acquire new job 
      skills and find employment in their communities. For example, Year Up 
      was specifically chosen for their targeted job training investments that 
      help support young people ages 16 to 24 &#8211; both those who are currently 
      enrolled in school and those who are not on a path towards a degree &#8211; as 
      well as adults who are underemployed or need additional training to 
      progress in a career or transition to a new field.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This initiative from JPMorgan Chase is investing in more than our work, 
      it&#8217;s investing in building the partnerships necessary to catalyze a new 
      workforce,&#8221; Gerald Chertavian, founder and chief executive officer of Year 
      Up. &#8220;Despite talent and motivation, millions of young adults lack 
      access to training for careers that provide them with a living wage. At 
      the same time, U.S. businesses need more and better-trained talent to 
      compete on the global stage, highlighting the need for a program like New 
      Skills at Work, providing tools to gain the necessary career skills.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			JPMorgan Chase Launches $250 Million Global Economic Opportunity 
      Initiative
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Through research, data and investments, &#8220;New Skills at Work&#8221; aims to 
      revolutionize the way employers and skills trainers develop talent for 
      jobs in local high-growth industries
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. today launched an unprecedented five-year, $250 
      million global workforce readiness and demand-driven training initiative 
      called New Skills at Work. The new initiative will be the largest 
      ever private-sector effort aimed at addressing the &#8220;skills gap&#8221; that 
      exists across many industries, such as healthcare and advanced 
      manufacturing, where not enough trained workers have the specific skills 
      to fill the jobs available.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The announcement was made at an event in Washington, DC hosted by the 
      Aspen Institute featuring JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, 
      Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, former Director of the White House Domestic 
      Policy Council Melody Barnes, and Aspen President and CEO Walter 
      Isaacson.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to an IMF analysis, the skills gap accounts for approximately 
      one-third of the U.S. unemployment rate. By 2020, an estimated 63% of 
      the projected 48 million job openings will require some sort of 
      post-secondary school training. Using research and data analysis, 
      public-private partnerships and engagement with local leaders and 
      organizations, New Skills at Work will accelerate economic growth 
      by supporting training programs that will have the greatest impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Addressing the skills gap can be one of our most powerful tools for 
      reducing unemployment and creating more broadly shared prosperity,&#8221; said 
      Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase. 
      &#8220;JPMorgan is using its best assets, including industry intelligence and

		&lt;h1&gt;The FIDO Alliance Announces Microsoft Joins Board of Directors, Demonstrating Solidarity With the Global Community&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Leading Mobile Platforms Committed to FIDO Standards for Universal Strong Authentication&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA--(Marketwired - Dec 12, 2013) -  The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, an industry consortium revolutionizing online authentication with the first standards-based specifications, today announced that Microsoft has joined the Alliance as a member of the Board of Directors. Microsoft is committed to working with the FIDO Alliance to produce open standards that will ensure interoperability among strong authentication methods and technologies. Representing the preeminent desktop and enterprise software vendor, and as the third leading mobile platform provider to join the FIDO Alliance board, Microsoft joins Google, BlackBerry and many other industry leaders in making FIDO specifications the global standard for post-password authentication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIDO members commit to share technology and collaborate to deliver open specifications for universal strong authentication that enables FIDO-compliant authentication methods to be interoperable, more secure and private, and easier to use. Microsoft software runs on hundreds of millions of devices, and the technology leader maintains clear leadership in enterprise, desktop and laptop markets. Users of Microsoft products and services will have a variety of choices for better authentication that overcomes the prevailing reliance on passwords. FIDO authentication is designed with a core focus on privacy&#160;-- all biometric or personal identifying information (PII) stays local on the user's device and is never shared to the cloud or over the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft and the many global leaders joining our endeavor in the last ten months validates the work of the FIDO Alliance, and clearly indicates the imminent sea change set to move the world from a dependency on passwords to universal strong authentication," said Michael Barrett, president of the FIDO Alliance.&#160;"Clearly, the Alliance is recognized as the foremost place to effect the changes needed to ensure future authentication that is simultaneously easier to use, more secure, and private. We welcome Microsoft to our board of directors and value the contributions that only Microsoft can make to benefit enterprises and users everywhere." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has a track record of unwavering commitment to security and significant contributions to open standards organizations. Joining the FIDO Alliance board of directors is a logical step for us as a way to serve our customers and the community," said David Treadwell, Corporate Vice President, Microsoft. "As a contributor to the FIDO Alliance working groups on next generation authentication, we look forward to furthering our innovation and thought leadership in the identity space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft joining Fido Alliance's Board is a key milestone to reaching the post UN/PW Authentication era of strong Authentication," said Sami Nassar vice president  general manager Authentication, NXP Semiconductors. "With the support from industry leaders across the value chain, from semiconductors to relying parties, FIDO adds cloud security without compromising privacy and simplicity for consumers and enterprise users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open FIDO specifications will support a full range of authentication technologies for operating systems, including biometrics such as fingerprint and iris scanners, voice and facial recognition, as well as existing solutions and communications standards, such as Trusted Platform Modules (TPM), USB Security Tokens, embedded Secure Elements (eSE), Smart Cards, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Near Field Communication (NFC). The open specifications are being designed to be extensible and to accommodate future innovation, as well as protect existing investments. FIDO specifications allow the interaction of technologies within a single infrastructure, enabling security options to be tailored to the distinct needs of each user and organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About The FIDO Alliance
				The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The Alliance plans to change the nature of authentication by developing standards-based specifications for better authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. Better authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Andy Mukherjee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions&#160;expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is lucky to dodge Nokia&#8217;s tax bill in India. On Dec. 12, the Delhi High Court allowed the Finnish group to transfer its Chennai factory to the U.S. software giant as part of its planned $7.4 billion sale of its mobile handset business. While the overall deal wasn&#8217;t in doubt, Microsoft avoids Nokia&#8217;s hard-to-assess tax liability. If only Vodafone had been so fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian authorities had seized Nokia&#8217;s local assets after slapping it with a $340 million demand for unpaid taxes dating back to 2007. If the company loses the legal battle, the exchequer&#8217;s final claim could be as much as ten times that amount, the tax office&#8217;s lawyer has told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may be bluster, but Microsoft didn&#8217;t want to find out. The dispute has been out in the open since March, giving lawyers for the Redmond company plenty of time to ensure that any liability stays with Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vodafone debacle explains why. Six years after the British mobile operator acquired its Indian business, it&#8217;s still fighting a $2 billion claim for tax the authorities say it should have withheld from the price paid to Hutchison Whampoa. When India&#8217;s highest court threw out the government&#8217;s claim, New Delhi changed the tax law with retrospective effect, spooking investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax regime in India has become very wobbly. Nokia says it&#8217;s been wrongly accused of evading taxes on payments made to its parent for supply of operating software. But the company is not alone. An Indian court recently told Verizon&#8217;s unit in Singapore that the fees it receives from corporate clients in India for providing them with dedicated Internet access is taxable as a royalty  and hence subject to the same 10 percent withholding tax that Nokia is being asked to pony up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making sure multinationals pay more taxes to their host countries is a sore point, even in rich nations. India&#8217;s bossy approach, though, could backfire. Too many countries are desperate for investment dollars. If New Delhi gets too heavy, the net effect will only be to increase India&#8217;s dependence on Microsoft founder Bill Gates&#8217; charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This article has been corrected to state that Microsoft is based in Redmond, not Seattle, in paragraph 3).&lt;/p&gt;

He will replace Jacobs on March 4, after the annual shareholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Jacobs' leadership, the company's share price has more than doubled, giving Qualcomm a market capitalization of over $120 billion, while earnings have tripled. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index has risen just over 20 percent in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of Qualcomm's revenue comes from chips that allow phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its CDMA cellphone technology - a component in new fourth-generation mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mollenkopf focuses mostly on the semiconductor side of Qualcomm's business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If anything, Mollenkopf in the lead means (an) intense commitment to the semi business," said Argus Research analyst Jim Kelleher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA TROUBLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antitrust investigation in China will be a key concern for the new CEO.

But domestic Chinese sales make up around a fifth of Qualcomm revenue and it is positioned to reap the vast majority of licensing fees for phone chips in the world's biggest smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm denies any wrongdoing and says it is cooperating with the probe, which analysts say is likely tied to royalty negotiations ahead of the impending $16 billion rollout of commercial fourth-generation services by China's big telecoms carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nadia Damouni and Sinead Carew in New York; Writing by Rodney Joyce; Editing by Kirti Pandey, Ted Kerr and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

			Statement by Robert C. Weber, IBM Senior Vice President and General 
      Counsel
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Yesterday, IBM (NYSE:IBM) learned of a lawsuit pushing a wild conspiracy 
      theory. This lawsuit seeks to confuse IBM's support for a U.S. 
      cybersecurity legislative proposal -- which has yet to be enacted -- 
      with the completely unrelated NSA surveillance program called PRISM. 
      Even a cursory reading of the legislative proposal, known as CISPA, 
      makes clear that it has nothing to do with the recently disclosed NSA 
      surveillance program. The legislation is designed to help protect 
      companies from cyber attacks by encouraging the sharing of technical 
      cyber threat information, such as malware code. The ability for those 
      under attack to work together to help prevent cybercrime is a modern 
      business requirement and an important goal, which is why many companies, 
      including IBM, support such legislation. This bill does not refer to 
      China, and it does not authorize government surveillance, facts that the 
      plaintiff and its attorneys could have easily determined had they 
      bothered to do the slightest fact checking.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Starting from this fictitious connection between CISPA and PRISM, the 
      complaint proceeds to make numerous specious and false accusations, and 
      IBM calls upon the law firm that filed this action to do the right thing 
      and dismiss this action immediately. To fail to do so is a profound 
      disservice to the judicial system, to the public, and in this case, to 
      IBM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM will vigorously fight this baseless lawsuit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Jacobs says succession previously planned, but sped up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Execs decline to comment on Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Noel Randewich and Sruthi Ramakrishnan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc, the

Jacobs said, when asked by Reuters whether the promotion was
related to an offer from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The timing is a little faster than we originally planned
but the key thing is to make sure we kept management
continuity," Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and Mollenkopf declined to specifically discuss

faces a shift in smartphone growth away from the United States
toward China, where it faces an antitrust investigation and
where consumers often spend less on their phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm shares were flat at $72.73 on Nasdaq, suggesting

of its free cashflow to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mollenkopf, an engineer, led Qualcomm's $3.1 billion
acquisition of radio frequency chipmaker Atheros Communications
Inc in 2011, its biggest acquisition. He will replace Jacobs on
March 4, after the annual shareholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Jacobs' leadership, the company's share price has more
than doubled, giving Qualcomm a market capitalization of over
$120 billion, while earnings have tripled. The Philadelphia SE
Semiconductor Index has risen just over 20 percent in the
same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of Qualcomm's revenue comes from chips that allow
phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit
comes from licensing patents for its CDMA cellphone technology -
a component in new fourth-generation mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mollenkopf focuses mostly on the semiconductor side of
Qualcomm's business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If anything, Mollenkopf in the lead means (an) intense
commitment to the semi business," said Argus Research analyst
Jim Kelleher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA TROUBLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antitrust investigation in China will be a key concern
for the new CEO. China's top economic planning agency has
substantial evidence against Qualcomm, state media quoted a
senior official as saying on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of Qualcomm's revenue comes from China, including
Foxconn Technology Group, which assembles most of the world's
top-selling electronic gadgets including Apple Inc's 
iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the chips the company sells in China are used in
devices that are exported. But domestic Chinese sales make up
around a fifth of Qualcomm revenue and it is positioned to reap
the vast majority of licensing fees for phone chips in the
world's biggest smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm denies any wrongdoing and says it is cooperating
with the probe, which analysts say is likely tied to royalty
negotiations ahead of the impending $16 billion rollout of
commercial fourth-generation services by China's big telecoms
carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

over 10 percent)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Sinead Carew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 13 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc promoted Chief
Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf to chief executive in a
surprise move that follows investor pressure on the phone
chipmaker to return capital and speculation that he might be
poached to run Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The replacement of current CEO Paul Jacobs, the 51-year-old
son of a Qualcomm co-founder, comes a day after Bloomberg News
reported that Microsoft has been considering Mollenkopf as a
candidate to replace retiring CEO Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously Paul is still a very young man, so (this is) not
something that many of us were expecting but something that has
likely been in the works for some time," said Williams Financial
Group analyst Cody Acree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the consideration of Microsoft of Mollenkopf may
have prompted a bit of a speedier announcement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mollenkopf, 44, will take the reins at the world's biggest
maker of cellphone chips in March, as Qualcomm faces an
antitrust investigation in China, its largest market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one investment fund has been pushing for a return
of capital to shareholders, among other options. The company had
a cash pile of $29.4 billion as of Sept. 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm shares were up 0.7 percent at $73.21 in
late-morning trading on the Nasdaq, suggesting investors saw
little impact from the unexpected change of CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that Mollenkopf had effectively been running the
day-to-day operations of the company, so we don't expect daily
operations to change materially," JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall said
in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mollenkopf led Qualcomm's $3.1 billion acquisition of radio
frequency chipmaker Atheros Communications Inc in 2011, its
biggest acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An engineer, he will replace Jacobs on March 4, after the
annual shareholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobs has been CEO since 2005, taking over from his father
Irwin who co-founded Qualcomm in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the son's leadership the company's share price has
more than doubled and earnings have tripled. The Philadelphia SE
Semiconductor Index has risen just over 20 percent in the
same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of Qualcomm's revenue comes from chips that allow

commitment to the semi business," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morningstar analyst Brian Colello said the appointment
brought important continuity to Qualcomm's chip leadership team
at a time when its dominance in almost all high-end phones faces
challenges from the likes of Intel Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA TROUBLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antitrust investigation in China will be a key concern

      Fitch Affirms Coca-Cola FEMSA's Ratings at 'A'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de 
      C.V. (KOF) as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Local currency IDR at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --National scale long-term rating at 'AAA(mex)';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --National scale short-term rating at 'F1+(mex)';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior notes for USD1 billion due 2018 at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior notes for USD500 million due 2020 at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior notes for USD750 million due 2023 at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior notes for USD400 million due 2043 at 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Certificados Bursatiles for MXN7,500 million due 2023 at 'AAA(mex)'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's ratings reflect the company's substantial free cash flow (FCF) 
      generation across the cycle, solid financial position, ample financial 
      flexibility and strong business profile. The ratings also incorporate 
      the company's strategic relationship with The Coca-Cola Company (KO; 
      rated 'A+'/Outlook Stable) and the explicit and implicit financial 
      support KOF has received from KO. In addition, the ratings consider the 
      geographical diversification of the EBITDA generated outside of Mexico 
      and Fitch's expectation of a strengthening of its credit metrics in the 
      following years after its recent acquisitions. The ratings are 
      constrained by the highly competitive nature of the beverage industry, 
      the economic volatility present in its territories, higher debt levels, 
      and the effect of a new MXN1 tax per liter on beverages with sugar 
      content that would have a negative outcome on the company's sales volume 
      in Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Strong Business Profile
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's ratings are underpinned by its solid business position as the 
      largest franchise bottler in the world of Coca-Cola products with 
      operations across Latin America and the Philippines. The company's 
      strong brand image of Coca-Cola products, extensive well developed 
      distribution network, broad and diversified product portfolio and 
      superior execution at the point of sale, contribute to support its 
      leading position across the markets where it operates in the long term. 
      Fitch also considers that KOF benefits from participating in a sector 
      relatively less exposed to negative economic cycles than other 
      industries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Geographic Diversification
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's presence in Latin America provides the company with geographical 
      diversification of revenues and EBITDA generation that lowers business 
      risk and cash flow volatility. Considering the effect of the recent 
      acquisitions in Brazil of Companhia Fluminense de Refrigerantes, S.A. 
      (Companhia Fluminense) and Spaipa, S.A. Industria Brazileira de Bebidas 
      (Spaipa), Fitch estimates on a pro forma basis, that the company will 
      increment the importance of its operations in South America contributing 
      approximately with 58% of total sales and 52% of total EBITDA. For the 
      latest 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2013, the operations from South 
      America represented around 54% of total sales and 47% of total EBITDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Expected Deleverage
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch incorporates that leverage will gradually decline in the following 
      years approaching historical levels after the recent acquisitions in 
      Brazil of Fluminese and Spaipa. On a pro forma basis, including the 
      effect of these acquisitions, Fitch estimates that KOF's total debt to 
      EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA, will increase to approximately 2.0x and 
      1.6x, respectively, by the year-end 2013. Fitch expects that KOF's gross 
      leverage and net leverage will strengthen in the following two years to 
      levels around 1.5x and 1.3x, respectively, through higher EBITDA 
      generation and/or debt reduction. For the last 12 months as of Sept. 30, 
      2013, the company's total debt to EBITDA was 1.6x, while net debt to 
      EBITDA was 0.7x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ample Liquidity Position
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF has historically maintained an ample liquidity position with high 
      cash balances and manageable debt amortizations. Fitch estimates that 
      the company cash balance will reach around MXN13 billion by year end 
      2013, considering the closing of the acquisition of Spaipa and the 
      refinancing of a portion of its current debt with the proceeds from the 
      USD2.15 billion senior notes issuances obtained in November 2013. This 
      level of cash combined with internal cash flow generation of the company 
      should be sufficient to face debt maturities in the following three 
      years. In addition, Fitch considers that the company has ample access to 
      capital markets and credit facilities which provide additional financial 
      flexibility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Strong FCF Generation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects KOF's FCF to remain strong over the cycle. During the last 
      five years, the company's FCF estimated by Fitch after covering capital 
      expenditures and dividends has averaged annually around MXN5.5 billion. 
      Fitch believes that KOF's FCF generation provides financial flexibility 
      across the ups and downs of economic cycles to maintain a conservative 
      capital structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stable Operating Performance
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first nine months ended Sept. 30, 2013, net sales increased 
      3% to MXN110 million, while total volume increased 4% to 2,323 million 
      unit cases, when compared to the same period of last year. On a 
      comparable basis, excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, KOF's 
      revenues and volume growth was 1%, reflecting a slight decline of volume 
      in the territories of Mexico and Brazil and the effect of devaluation of 
      currencies from its South American operations. Consolidated EBITDA 
      margin has been relatively stable at levels around 18%. Higher 
      profitability in Mexico and Central America has compensated the decrease 
      in operating margins from South America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Excise Tax Manageable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects that KOF's sales volume in Mexico could decline close to 
      7% in 2014 following the MXN1 per liter excise tax on beverages with 
      sugar content approved by the Mexican Congress. The effect of this tax 
      is expected to be transferred to consumers resulting in an increase in 
      average sales prices between 12% to 15%. Fitch considers that the 
      company's price initiatives, productivity efficiencies and flexible 
      product portfolio should contribute to maintain relatively stable their 
      profitability and financial position.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downgrade pressures in the ratings could be triggered if KOF's leverage 
      ratios in the following 18 to 24 months are above Fitch's expectation or 
      by a change in the company's long-term capital structure that materially 
      deviates from its historical levels. After the recent acquisitions, 
      Fitch does not foresee any positive rating action over the medium term.

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
MONTERREY, December 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the
ratings of 
Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF) as follows:
--Foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A';
--Local currency IDR at 'A';
--National scale long-term rating at 'AAA(mex)';
--National scale short-term rating at 'F1+(mex)';
--Senior notes for USD1 billion due 2018 at 'A';
--Senior notes for USD500 million due 2020 at 'A';
--Senior notes for USD750 million due 2023 at 'A';
--Senior notes for USD400 million due 2043 at 'A';
--Certificados Bursatiles for MXN7,500 million due 2023 at
'AAA(mex)'.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
KOF's ratings reflect the company's substantial free cash flow
(FCF) generation 
across the cycle, solid financial position, ample financial
flexibility and 
strong business profile. The ratings also incorporate the
company's strategic 
relationship with The Coca-Cola Company (KO; rated 'A+'/Outlook
Stable) and the 
explicit and implicit financial support KOF has received from
KO. In addition, 
the ratings consider the geographical diversification of the
EBITDA generated 
outside of Mexico and Fitch's expectation of a strengthening of
its credit 
metrics in the following years after its recent acquisitions.
The ratings are 
constrained by the highly competitive nature of the beverage
industry, the 
economic volatility present in its territories, higher debt
levels, and the 
effect of a new MXN1 tax per liter on beverages with sugar
content that would 
have a negative outcome on the company's sales volume in Mexico.
Strong Business Profile
KOF's ratings are underpinned by its solid business position as
the largest 
franchise bottler in the world of Coca-Cola products with
operations across 
Latin America and the Philippines. The company's strong brand
image of Coca-Cola 
products, extensive well developed distribution network, broad
and diversified 
product portfolio and superior execution at the point of sale,
contribute to 
support its leading position across the markets where it
operates in the long 
term. Fitch also considers that KOF benefits from participating
in a sector 
relatively less exposed to negative economic cycles than other
industries.
Geographic Diversification
KOF's presence in Latin America provides the company with
geographical 
diversification of revenues and EBITDA generation that lowers
business risk and 
cash flow volatility. Considering the effect of the recent
acquisitions in 
Brazil of Companhia Fluminense de Refrigerantes, S.A. (Companhia
Fluminense) and 
Spaipa, S.A. Industria Brazileira de Bebidas (Spaipa), Fitch
estimates on a pro 
forma basis, that the company will increment the importance of
its operations in 
South America contributing approximately with 58% of total sales
and 52% of 
total EBITDA. For the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30,
2013, the 
operations from South America represented around 54% of total
sales and 47% of 
total EBITDA.
Expected Deleverage
Fitch incorporates that leverage will gradually decline in the
following years 
approaching historical levels after the recent acquisitions in
Brazil of 
Fluminese and Spaipa. On a pro forma basis, including the effect
of these 
acquisitions, Fitch estimates that KOF's total debt to EBITDA
and net debt to 
EBITDA, will increase to approximately 2.0x and 1.6x,
respectively, by the 
year-end 2013. Fitch expects that KOF's gross leverage and net
leverage will 
strengthen in the following two years to levels around 1.5x and
1.3x, 
respectively, through higher EBITDA generation and/or debt
reduction. For the 
last 12 months as of Sept. 30, 2013, the company's total debt to
EBITDA was 
1.6x, while net debt to EBITDA was 0.7x.
Ample Liquidity Position
KOF has historically maintained an ample liquidity position with
high cash 
balances and manageable debt amortizations. Fitch estimates that
the company 
cash balance will reach around MXN13 billion by year end 2013,
considering the 
closing of the acquisition of Spaipa and the refinancing of a
portion of its 
current debt with the proceeds from the USD2.15 billion senior
notes issuances 
obtained in November 2013. This level of cash combined with
internal cash flow 
generation of the company should be sufficient to face debt
maturities in the 
following three years. In addition, Fitch considers that the
company has ample 
access to capital markets and credit facilities which provide
additional 
financial flexibility. 
Strong FCF Generation
Fitch expects KOF's FCF to remain strong over the cycle. During
the last five 
years, the company's FCF estimated by Fitch after covering
capital expenditures 
and dividends has averaged annually around MXN5.5 billion. Fitch
believes that 
KOF's FCF generation provides financial flexibility across the
ups and downs of 
economic cycles to maintain a conservative capital structure. 
Stable Operating Performance
During the first nine months ended Sept. 30, 2013, net sales
increased 3% to 
MXN110 million, while total volume increased 4% to 2,323 million
unit cases, 
when compared to the same period of last year. On a comparable
basis, excluding 
the effect of recent acquisitions, KOF's revenues and volume
growth was 1%, 
reflecting a slight decline of volume in the territories of
Mexico and Brazil 
and the effect of devaluation of currencies from its South
American operations. 
Consolidated EBITDA margin has been relatively stable at levels
around 18%. 
Higher profitability in Mexico and Central America has
compensated the decrease 
in operating margins from South America.
Excise Tax Manageable
Fitch expects that KOF's sales volume in Mexico could decline
close to 7% in 
2014 following the MXN1 per liter excise tax on beverages with
sugar content 
approved by the Mexican Congress. The effect of this tax is
expected to be 
transferred to consumers resulting in an increase in average
sales prices 
between 12% to 15%. Fitch considers that the company's price
initiatives, 
productivity efficiencies and flexible product portfolio should
contribute to 
maintain relatively stable their profitability and financial
position.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Downgrade pressures in the ratings could be triggered if KOF's
leverage ratios 
in the following 18 to 24 months are above Fitch's expectation
or by a change in 
the company's long-term capital structure that materially
deviates from its 
historical levels. After the recent acquisitions, Fitch does not
foresee any 
positive rating action over the medium term.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) was named "Bank of the Year" for 2013 by International Financing Review (IFR) on Friday, which praised the U.S. investment bank's ability to build market share in the face of a tough economic and regulatory landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year has been another difficult one for banks, as they battled grim investment bank revenues, a mixed economic backdrop and an ever-growing list of regulatory and legal concerns, including record fines over interest rate rigging and probes into alleged foreign exchange market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IFR said it has been especially difficult for Goldman because it is a "lightning rod" for the public backlash against the banking industry, but the bank's continued focus on clients had delivered "truly impressive" market-share gains in advisory and financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the IFR awards year, Goldman's share of mergers and acquisitions stood at 39.5 percent in the U.S. and 36 percent in Europe. It ranked first in equity capital markets globally, with market share up to 11.3 percent from 8.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm advised on several of the year's largest and most complex transactions, including the Vodafone's (VOD.L) $130 billion sale of its stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications (VZ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to IFR, Goldman's Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein downplayed the bank's performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the context and the legacy issues we're working through, it's hard for me to thump my chest over anything other than maintaining focus where other people have found it hard to maintain focus," Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The awards, to be handed out in January, are among the most coveted in the banking industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be considered for an award, banks must make a pitch, often delivered by its most senior bankers, to the IFR editorial board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) recently stopped pitching for these and other awards, after deciding the time and effort dedicated to the awards process would be better spent elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also took home the prize for top equity house, while Germany's Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) received three awards: top bond house, top loan house and top high-yield bond house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank raised more debt for more issuers from more countries than ever before, acting for clients in 70 jurisdictions across 24 currencies and on deals of all types, ranging from high-grade to high-yield, IFR said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its complex event-driven deals and work on developing the global credit market won it the loan house accolade, IFR added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other winners included Citigroup (C.N), which won two awards, for top derivatives house and top emerging market bond house. Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) bagged the prize for structured finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. investment bank Houlihan Lokey was named top restructuring adviser thanks to its work on a string of assignments for both creditors and debtors in a relatively quiet period for restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issuer of the year went to Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), after it raised more than 18 billion euros ($24.76 billion) of unsecured and asset-backed bonds in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IFR is part of Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For a full list of winners, click here: here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Clare Hutchison; Editing by Steve Slater and Elaine Hardcastle)&lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Mining Finance Market 2014-2018 with Bank 
      of America Corporation, JP Morgan Chase  Co., and Citigroup Inc 
      Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/5twglt/global_mining) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Mining Finance Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The analysts forecast the Global Mining Finance market to grow at a CAGR 
      of 2.63 percent over the period 2013-2018. One of the key factors 
      contributing to this market growth is the increase in investment in the 
      Power sector by China. The Global Mining Finance market has also been 
      witnessing the decrease in global mining deals. However, the lack in 
      investor confidence could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The key vendors dominating this market space are Bank of America 
      Corporation, JP Morgan Chase  Co., and Citigroup Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Other vendors mentioned in the report are RK Mine Finance, Orion Mine 
      Finance, Silver Wheaton Corp, Anglo Pacific Group, Franco Nevada, Royal 
      Gold, and Sandstorm Gold.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: The market has 
      become volatile in recent years, which has had an impact on mining 
      deals. There has been a significant decline in the number of merger and 
      acquisition deals in the Mining sector, which is hampering the 
      consolidation and growth of the market. As some companies took advantage 
      of the lower cost of borrowing to purchase assets, the number of deals 
      across the global Mining sector declined in the first half of 2013. Some 
      of the major players have continued to finance their operations, many 
      projects have been deferred, and capital spending has been curbed by 
      many mining companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the 
      increasing demand for metals with respect to the increasing investment 
      in the Power sector, especially in China. The growth in the Global 
      Mining Finance market is attributed to the increasing population and 
      industrialization in China and the consequent demand for metals.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - An eagle and two birdies in the closing stretch allowed South African Dawie van der Walt to shoot a 66 and secure an emotional two shot victory at the curtailed Nelson Mandela Championship on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Walt achieved his win just a day before former South African president Mandela, who died last week aged 95, is laid to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's obviously really special, making you a part of history," Van der Walt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Winning The Nelson Mandela at this time, when it's sad for everyone, everyone is mourning and tomorrow's the big day, it means a lot and it's something I can keep close to my heart forever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van der Walt carded four under par 66 on Saturday at the tournament reduced to 54 holes due to bad weather earlier in the week. The event also concluded a day earlier than usual so that it avoided clashing with Mandela's funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van der Walt finished ahead of Spain's Jorge Campillo and England's Matthew Baldwin, who both carded two under par 68s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Brooks relinquished his overnight lead following an abysmal start and struggled to a six over par 76 finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having not dropped a shot in his opening two rounds, Brooks succumbed to four bogies and a double bogie in his front nine on Saturday to slide down the leaderboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday's win was a welcome return to form for Van der Walt, who claimed his second win on the European Tour this year following his success at the Tshwane Open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I haven't been in that good form, I had an injury and have been struggling, so this is almost overwhelming. It almost felt like I have been at the top of my game and then hit rock bottom this year, so to win the last event of the year will make Christmas a lot more fun," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nick Said in Cape Town; editing by Pritha Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal judge to order former Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice president Fabrice Tourre to pay more than $1.1 million for his role in a failed 2007 mortgage deal, according to a court document filed Monday in Manhattan federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the SEC's highest-profile trial stemming from its investigations into causes of the 2008 financial crisis, a federal jury found Tourre liable in August on six of seven civil charges he faced over the deal, which the SEC said cost investors $1 billion in losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its lawsuit, the agency said Tourre - who referred to himself as "the fabulous Fab" in an email describing his activities - misled investors by failing to disclose that hedge fund billionaire John Paulson helped choose, and intended to bet against, mortgage securities underlying the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These lies mattered," lawyers for the agency told U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in the document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson &amp; Co made about $1 billion from his short position on the deal, while investors including ACA Capital Holdings Inc and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG lost about the same amount, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is critical that Tourre's conduct be addressed through significant disgorgement and penalties, to ensure that he is punished for his wrongdoing and that he and others are deterred from engaging in such conduct in the future," lawyers for the agency said in the document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency asked that Tourre pay a civil monetary penalty of $910,000. It also asked that he pay $175,463 in ill-gotten gains, plus interest of $62,858.03, according to the document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC also said Tourre should be prohibited from accepting reimbursement for the penalty from Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Tourre declined to comment and a spokesman for Goldman Sachs did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission asked a federal judge to order former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice president Fabrice Tourre to
pay more than $1.1 million for his role in a failed 2007

charges he faced over the deal, which the SEC said cost
investors $1 billion in losses. [Id: nL1N0G223E]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its lawsuit, the agency said Tourre - who referred to
himself as "the fabulous Fab" in an email describing his
activities - misled investors by failing to disclose that hedge
fund billionaire John Paulson helped choose, and intended to bet
against, mortgage securities underlying the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These lies mattered," lawyers for the agency told U.S.
District Judge Katherine Forrest in the document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulson &amp; Co made about $1 billion from his short position
on the deal, while investors including ACA Capital Holdings Inc
and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG lost about the same
amount, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is critical that Tourre's conduct be addressed through
significant disgorgement and penalties, to ensure that he is
punished for his wrongdoing and that he and others are deterred
from engaging in such conduct in the future," lawyers for the

$910,000. It also asked that he pay $175,463 in ill-gotten
gains, plus interest of $62,858.03, according to the document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC also said Tourre should be prohibited from accepting

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department's
Office of the Inspector General tried to examine whether
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co interfered with its regulator's
oversight duties, according to a statement on Monday from the
counsel to the inspector general, but the office failed to win
permission to subpoena the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Delmar, counsel to the inspector general, said his
office wanted to look into whether JPMorgan had hindered the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in its attempts to
probe JPMorgan's banking relationship with convicted Ponzi
scheme operator Bernard Madoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Madoff did reach out to the Treasury OIG, with
information about his banking relations with JPMorgan," Delmar
said in an email to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This office was looking into allegations made by JPMC's
regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),
that its oversight of the bank was being impeded, specifically
with respect to the bank's provision of banking services to
Madoff. The OIG sought to obtain information from the bank on
this issue, in order to test Madoff's assertions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delmar said his office tried to subpoena the bank for
information, but JPMorgan contested the subpoena and the U.S.
Justice Department decided not to enforce it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Takes Various Actions on JPM 2007-LDP12
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded two classes, upgraded one class, and 
      affirmed 19 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities 
      Trust commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2007-LDP12. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upgrade is a result of increased credit enhancement from paydown and 
      higher than expected recoveries on two of the larger assets liquidated 
      since Fitch's last rating action, lowering Fitch's overall loss 
      expectations. The downgrades to the distressed classes are due to a 
      greater certainty of loss expectations associated with loans currently 
      in special servicing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 10.2% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 12.8%, including $134.5 million (5.4% of 
      the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has 
      designated 35 loans (25.5%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 
      nine specially serviced assets (6.9%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the November 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 27.2% to $1.82 billion from $2.5 
      billion at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, one loan (0.2% of the 
      pool) is defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes F 
      through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is the REO asset, Liberty 
      Plaza (2.4% of the pool), a 371,109 square foot (sf) community shopping 
      plaza located in Philadelphia, PA, anchored by a 24 hour Wal-Mart, 
      Dick's Sporting Goods, and PathMark. The loan was transferred to special 
      servicing in January 2013 due to imminent default and became REO through 
      a deed in lieu. Per the special servicer, the largest tenant, Wal-Mart 
      has exercised an option to extend its lease through March 2014. Wal-Mart 
      plans to vacate at lease expiration as they will be relocating to an 
      adjacent location at the Franklin Mills Mall. Wal-Mart comprises 131,812 
      SF (36% of NRA and 34% of net rental income. The property is 98% 
      occupied as of July 2013. Per the special servicer, the leasing team 
      continues to search for replacements for Wal-Mart. The servicer is also 
      addressing deferred maintenance items.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is the St. Joe 150 W. 
      Main loan (2.5%), which is secured by a 227, 047 sf multi-tenanted 
      office building located in Norfolk, VA. The largest three tenants are 
      Kaufman  Canoles (28%), SunTrust Bank (21%), CB Richard Ellis (7%) with 
      lease expirations in 2022, 2018, and 2015; respectively. Occupancy at 
      the property has declined to 78% from 84% at last review with average 
      rent of $23.30 per square foot (psf). There is minimal rollover until 
      2015 when 11% of the space rolls. Per REIS as of 3Q 2013, the Norfolk 
      submarket vacancy is 20.5% with average asking rent of $21.69 psf. The 
      most recently reported debt-service coverage ratio as of September 2013 
      is 0.84x with occupancy at 78.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is the BBT Tower loan 
      (1.7%), which is secured by an 18 story high rise office building with 
      252,507 sf built in 1975, renovated in 1994, located in Jacksonville, 
      FL. The largest tenants are Branch Banking (19%), HDR Engineering (9%), 
      Patriot Transport (6%), with lease expirations in 2019, 2018, and 2023; 
      respectively. As of September 2013, the property is 84.2% occupied with 
      average rent of $19.80 psf. Per REIS as of 3Q 2013, the Jacksonville 
      metro vacancy rate is 20.8% with asking rent of $18.52. The loan 
      structure includes a leasing holdback and capital expenditure holdback 
      for the purpose of upgrading the property's equipment and common areas. 
      Wells Fargo has reviewed and approved a second amendment to the office 
      lease for Office of Chapter 13 trustee, an instrument of the US 
      Government. The loan matures in July 2014. There is 4% upcoming rollover 
      in 2015 and 12% in 2016. The Replacement Reserve has a current balance 
      of $250,241; Tenant Reserve $1,608,632; and Debt Service Reserve $31.23.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, (JPM.N) which is pushing to simplify operations on its $2.46 trillion balance sheet, has put up for sale its Global Special Opportunities Group, an Asia-based unit that makes investments in mid-sized companies, according to a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group employs about 35 people and tends to take stakes in loans that rank low in the capital structures of companies smaller than the large multi-national corporations the bank usually courts for international business, the person said declining to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is marketing the unit to private equity funds and credit-oriented hedge funds that make similar investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit is focused on real estate, impaired assets and principal finance and has expertise in distressed debt, according to a page on JPMorgan's website. It has its home office in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to sell the unit was reported earlier on Monday by the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has been moving this year to unload ancillary businesses, or "hobbies," as CEO Jamie Dimon sometimes calls them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is selling its physical commodities business after concluding its prospects were too dim in light of how much it complicated the relationship with regulators. It is also spinning off One Equity Partners, its private equity business, and has said it will quit making student loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank announced its drive to simplify after coming under pressure from regulators and politicians for its size amid questions about whether it can safely manage its diverse operations. Last year, the company lost more than $6.2 billion when a derivatives trading strategy went out of control in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Cedar Oak Plantation Sells at Absolute Auction Through J. P. King Auction Company as Part of Tom Honecker Estate&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;HOLLY SPRINGS, MS--(Marketwired - Dec 16, 2013) - The Cedar Oak Plantation, a 1,779-acre property belonging to the estate of the late Tom Honecker, sold on Thursday. Though it was offered in 16 tracts, which included a seven-bedroom lodge and several other improvements, the property was purchased as an entirety at an absolute auction conducted by J. P. King Auction Company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was Tom's lifelong dream to own a place like this," Mary Honecker said of her late husband, who passed away in 2010. "J. P. King paid attention to the details and were easy to work with, listening to our needs and encouraging us through a difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I live a long way from Cedar Oak Plantation, so having somebody arranging the details and trying to avoid complications was so elpful," she said. Mrs. Honecker lives in their Findlay, Ohio home and chose an auction to sell Mr. Honecker's estate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction drew about 60 attendants and 20 registered bidders, hailing from Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee. Prior to the auction, J. P. King's marketing campaign attracted interest from four states, along with over 4,000 Web hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home to a carefully conserved quail habitat for hosting events such as the Mississippi Shooting Dog Championship and the Prairie All-Age Trial, Mr. Honecker also trained CedarOak Kate on the property, who won a Field Trial National Championship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About J. P. King:
				J. P. King Auction Company specializes in high-value properties such as luxury homes, condominiums, land and ranches. The company has marketed properties in all 50 states and six countries with recent events in Idaho, Michigan, Colorado, Minnesota and Montana.&lt;/p&gt;

			MMRF Expands Leadership Responsibilities and Aligns Organization 
      for Future Growth
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) is proud to announce the 
      promotion of Walter M. Capone from Chief Operating Officer to President 
      of the MMRF, effective on December 16, 2013. In his new role Mr. Capone 
      will assume full responsibility for the organization and its operations. 
      He will report directly to Kathy Giusti, MMRF Founder and CEO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Walter&#8217;s experience in developing and taking a strategic vision and 
      executing on that vision will further strengthen the MMRF and its 
      position as the largest private funder for accelerated research, 
      education and treatment for multiple myeloma,&#8221; said Ms. Giusti. &#8220;He 
      possesses the leadership skills needed to successfully take on the 
      ambitious programs that have expanded our reputation as innovators in 
      the field of cancer research and pioneers in making precision medicine a 
      reality for our patients. Walter has also transformed our business model 
      to reach new levels of growth and developed the innovative strategies 
      needed to build new collaborative relationships with pharmaceutical, 
      biotech companies and research institutes while extending our 
      geographical reach worldwide.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Capone joined the MMRF in July of 2010 as Chief Operating Officer 
      where he focused his efforts on accelerating cures by bringing together 
      researchers and clinicians with the pharma, biotech, and diagnostic 
      industries. He spearheaded the development of the groundbreaking MMRF 
      CoMMpassSM Study, a longitudinal study involving more 
      than 50 academic and community centers in following 1,000 myeloma 
      patients from the time of their diagnosis through their journey with the 
      disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      He was also instrumental in building the technology platform to launch 
      the MMRF 
      Researcher Gateway and the MMRF 
      CoMMunity Gateway. As a result, doctors and researchers worldwide 
      now have open access to clinical and genomic data enabling and 
      expediting the classification of myeloma patients and matching them to 
      more precise and optimal treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Capone has 20 years of pharmaceutical and biotechnology leadership 
      experience in the areas of commercial development, operations, finance, 
      marketing and sales both within the United States and internationally. 
      Before joining the MMRF, he served as Vice President of Commercial 
      Development and Operations at Progenics Pharmaceuticals working with 
      their global partner Wyeth/Pfizer to commercialize the company&#8217;s first 
      approved drug, RELISTOR&#174;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Capone received his BA in International Relations from Brown 
      University and has an MBA in Finance and International Business from 
      Columbia University Business School.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to representing the MMRF at US and international conferences 
      on the topics of accelerated drug development and business innovation, 
      this past August Mr. Capone was selected for the prestigious 2013 
      PharmaVOICE&#160;100 that recognizes leaders for their 
      contributions in positively impacting the Life Sciences industry through 
      their influence and actions.

      the lowest of all cancers. In 2013, more than 22,000 adults in the 
      United States will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma and nearly 11,000 
      people are predicted to die from the disease.

      Siemens Enters Into Master Agreement With Pfizer for Companion 
      Diagnostics
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. announces that it has entered 
      into a master collaboration agreement with Pfizer Inc. to design, 
      develop and commercialize diagnostic tests for therapeutic products 
      across Pfizer&#8217;s pipeline. Under the agreement, Siemens will be one of 
      Pfizer&#8217;s collaboration partners to develop and provide in vitro 
      diagnostic tests for use in clinical studies and, potentially, eventual 
      global commercialization with Pfizer products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The partnership will leverage Siemens&#8217; worldwide leadership in providing 
      clinical diagnostic solutions for hospital and reference laboratories, 
      specialty laboratories and point-of-care settings (including clinics and 
      physician offices) to help enable diagnostics development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Companion diagnostics are an important enabler of targeted therapies 
      for patients,&#8221; said John Hubbard, Senior Vice President and Worldwide 
      Head of Development Operations at Pfizer. &#8220;This agreement with Siemens 
      Healthcare Diagnostics is another example of Pfizer&#8217;s commitment to 
      develop new precision medicines to address unmet clinical needs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Companion diagnostic tests are clinical tests linked to a specific drug 
      or therapy intended to assist physicians in making more informed and 
      personalized treatment decisions for their patients. When used in the 
      drug development process, companion diagnostics may help pharmaceutical 
      companies improve patient selection and treatment monitoring, determine 
      the preferred therapy dosing for patients, and establish a protocol to 
      help maximize the treatment benefit for patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our relationship with Pfizer marks a major milestone in Siemens&#8217; 
      personalized medicine strategy,&#8221; commented Dr. Trevor Hawkins, Senior 
      Vice President, Strategy  Innovations, Diagnostics Division, Siemens 
      Healthcare. &#8220;We look forward to collaborating with Pfizer to realize the 
      goal of advancing innovative solutions that change the way patient care 
      is delivered and, together, shape the future of diagnostic medicine.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Siemens Clinical Laboratory (SCL), a &#8220;high-complexity,&#8221; cutting-edge 
      testing laboratory focused on advancing personalized medicine, will 
      develop the companion diagnostic tests under the master agreement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Siemens Healthcare Sector is one of the world's largest 
      suppliers to the healthcare industry and a trendsetter in medical 
      imaging, laboratory diagnostics, medical information technology and 
      hearing aids. Siemens offers its customers products and solutions for 
      the entire range of patient care from a single source &#8211; from prevention 
      and early detection to diagnosis, and on to treatment and aftercare. By 
      optimizing clinical workflows for the most common diseases, Siemens also 
      makes healthcare faster, better and more cost-effective. Siemens 
      Healthcare employs some 52,000 employees worldwide and operates around 
      the world. In fiscal year 2013 (to September 30), the Sector posted 
      revenue of 13.6 billion euros and profit of 2.0 billion euros. For

		&lt;h1&gt;SDL Accurately Predicts Winner in Black Friday Battle between Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One - But Microsoft Isn't Finished Yet&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Supply shortages on the day meant 200,000 potential PS4 customers left empty handed&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;MAIDENHEAD, UNITED KINGDOM and WAKEFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS--(Marketwired - Dec 16, 2013) -  As SDL initially predicted a week prior to Black Friday, Sony ended November outselling Microsoft by 200,000 consoles in the U.S. According to an ongoing study of predictive customer commitment from SDL (LSE:SDL) this gap could have been almost double, but SDL's analysis estimates that as many as 200,000 potential customers that were ready to buy left without a PS4 over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SDL identified several key reasons that Sony won the launch battle up to Black Friday, including:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Being the first to build brand awareness
            Delivering targeted messaging to their core gaming audience
            Getting to market three weeks earlier
			&lt;p&gt;Although Sony won the short-term Black Friday battle, SDL predicts that Microsoft will win the longer- term launch through the important holiday season. Through the Black Friday week, Microsoft was edging ahead of Sony across the entire shopping journey through its awareness-building activities encouraging the gaming community to explore the Xbox One's new functionality and gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, SDL predicts that Microsoft will end the first quarter of 2014 firmly ahead, as its global launch strategy, consistent marketing and broader appeal beyond a core gaming market will drive its console's long-term success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social data behind the Battle of the Brands predictions is part of the SDL CX Playbook "Successful Customer Driven Strategies," which includes nine rules for designing a successful customer experience strategy. The Playbook shows the value actionable social intelligence can bring to businesses that need to make informed, data-driven decisions in real-time that improve the customer experience - and ultimately the buying journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SDL's Battle of the Brands shows specific reasons that drove the outcome of this high-profile face-off between Sony and Microsoft," said Paige O'Neill, CMO of SDL. "Marketers should view the insights behind this battle as an opportunity to understand how a data-driven customer experience strategy can enable them to directly pinpoint the impact marketing can have on sales. SDL's Customer Experience offerings can help marketers uncover these insights today -not next quarter- so they can immediately course-correct to impact the bottom line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SDL aggregates the conversations and online data that are indicative of a buying journey and then analyzes and scores these conversations utilizing SDL's Product Commitment Score (PCS) for overall commitment to purchase. This allows brands to make data-driven decisions to optimize their customer's experience. The holiday brand battle is part of a year-long study of customer commitment by SDL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To follow this important brand battle, please visit www.sdl.com/battle-of-the-brands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About SDL &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SDL (LSE:SDL) allows companies to optimize their customers' experience across the entire buyer journey.

      Arkansas Family Wins 2013 Chevron Delo&#174; Big Bass Boat Sweepstakes
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Products Company, a Chevron U.S.A. Inc. division, maker of the 
      Delo&#174; brand of technologically advanced engine oils, lubricants and 
      coolants, today announced the results of the 2013 Delo&#174; Big Bass Boat 
      Sweepstakes, which ran from July 27th through October 31st. 
      This year&#8217;s Grand Prize winners were Kevin and Michelle Downs of 
      Jonesboro, Arkansas, who were presented with a fully equipped 2013 ZX190 
      Skeeter&#174; bass boat during a presentation at Craighead Forest Lake. On 
      hand to award the boat was Edgar Hansen, Chief Engineer of the fishing 
      vessel Northwestern, which is featured on the Discovery Channel&#8217;s 
      &#8220;Deadliest Catch.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I was shocked, I wasn&#8217;t sure whether to believe it or not,&#8221; said 
      Michelle Downs. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never won anything this big. Our whole family 
      loves to fish, so the boat will definitely be put to good use!&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We had a tremendous response to the Big Bass Boat Sweepstakes this 
      year,&#8221; said Jim Gambill, North America Commercial and Industrial Brands 
      Manager, Chevron Products Company. &#8220;The Delo Bass Boat Sweepstakes is a 
      fun way to engage with our customers and share our message of equipment 
      durability, fuel efficiency and long engine life. We&#8217;d like to wish the 
      Downs family many years of fun and great fishing experiences with their 
      new Skeeter bass boat.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s great to know Kevin and Michelle love to fish,&#8221; said Hansen. 
      Crabbing off Alaska is a little different than angling for bass in 
      Arkansas, but either way, we share a love of fishing. I&#8217;m glad to 
      partner with Chevron and it&#8217;s my pleasure to be here to award this 
      beautiful bass boat to some fellow fishermen.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Other prizes included in the sweepstakes were First Prize, an 
      all-expense-paid trip to appear on the &#8220;Honey Hole All Outdoors&#8221; TV 
      show. Second Prize &#8211; awarded to four winners &#8211; was a $500 cash gift card.

&lt;p&gt;Boston (REUTERS) - Michael Giangregorio's son Nicholas was diagnosed as severely autistic when he was 18 months old. Now 12, Nicholas requires nearly round-the-clock care - special schooling as well as speech, occupational and physical therapy - that can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a formidable expense, but starting in January, Giangregorio's employer, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, will chip in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company announced in late November that it would add comprehensive autism coverage for expensive intensive therapies such as Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) to its health plan for 2014. The bank joins about 15 of its Fortune 100 peers, according to the advocacy group Autism Speaks, which expects that number to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as one in 50 U.S. school-age children &#8212; or about 1 million &#8212; have a diagnosis of autism, according to a national survey released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lifetime costs of treating one person with autism could top $2.3 million, according to 2012 research from the University of Pennsylvania and the London School of Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the expense, it is no surprise that insurers have had to be prodded to cover many autism treatments. Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia now require insurance carriers to extend coverage for ABA and other autism treatments in some or all of their individual and small-group policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But states don't regulate the self-funded policies offered by JPMorgan and other large employers, under which about one-quarter of Americans are covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is changing rapidly. An accelerating number of major companies have been extending their health plans to include autism coverage. Companies announcing this year they will add at least partial benefits include General Motors Co, United Technologies Corp, Chrysler Group and American Express Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adding this type of benefit has been the biggest request we've heard from employees in recent years, and the outpouring of gratitude has been overwhelming," says Bernadette Ulissi Branosky, JPMorgan's head of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the required co-insurance, Branosky estimates, most employees who qualify will pay less than $4,000 annually, compared with amounts that run as high as 20 times that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INSURERS WARN OF HIGHER PREMIUMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABA, a form of highly structured one-on-one coaching by trained teachers, has become the most widely used autism treatment in the United States. It is endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the U.S. Surgeon General and the American Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many insurers, however, still categorize ABA as an experimental treatment, because of a lack of long-term research on its effectiveness, and have largely refused to cover it. School districts must offer some services for school-age children, but parents often bear much of the expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABA's very high cost, as much as $60,000 per year per child, no doubt underlies this reluctance. The Council for Affordable Health Insurance, a Virginia-based association of health insurance companies, says that mandating autism coverage could raise premiums across the board by 1 percent to 3 percent, according to research it conducted in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That added expense, the industry group has warned, could make basic coverage unaffordable for many Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, data collected from states that require autism coverage suggests such concerns may be overblown. Two years after requiring coverage, seven states saw monthly premiums rise by 31 cents on average per member, according to figures collated by Autism Speaks. In Arizona's second year of mandated coverage, autism-related claims totaled about $389,000 &#8212; less than 10 percent of the $4,900,000 that the legislature forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorri Unumb, vice president for state government affairs at Autism Speaks, reports similar results in the private sector. "Companies tell us the additional cost is miniscule, a rounding error that most don't even pass along to employees," she says. JPMorgan, which reported $21.3 billion in profits in 2012, estimates the added benefit for its roughly 200,000 employees in the United States will cost it around $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OBAMACARE ADDS LAYER OF COMPLEXITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal law governs self-funded health plans, and advocates had hoped that Affordable Care Act's 2010 passage would bring expanded coverage for autism treatment all around. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has suggested a national standard could come in 2016, but so far the Obama administration has left it to states to define what the "essential benefits" are that insurers must provide when it comes to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Autism Speaks, only 26 states included ABA coverage in their benchmark health insurance plans, which outline the minimum benefits that must be offered on state exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see the current state mandates where you live, go to link.reuters.com/fas45v. For an Autism Speaks analysis of the Affordable Care Act and autism, click on r.reuters.com/gas45v.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many employers with self-funded plans are moving forward even without mandates. Several of the country's major technology companies, including Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp, led the way more than a decade ago, possibly because autism - according to California Department of Developmental Services records - is especially prevalent in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past two years have seen other employers catching up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial services company Capital One Bank is one of the few employers to pay 100 percent of the cost. Tricare, the Pentagon's health insurance plan, asks families to contribute as little as $25 for care regardless of the overall cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express, in addition to now covering ABA under its health plan, provides guidance for employees with autistic children on topics including educational rights, estate planning and childcare. The company is also in the process of establishing a special-needs support network, pairing parents of recently diagnosed children with those have older offspring with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employer-sponsored benefits apply to children up to the age 26 under the Affordable Care Act. The CDC defines children as individuals 17 years old and younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giangregorio, for his part, says he is proud JPMorgan has decided to add coverage for ABA and other autism treatments. In the past, he says, Nicholas was not able to get the necessary services he needed, including ABA, due to a lack of insurance. "Fortunately none of my colleagues with autistic children will face that now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Linda Stern and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company announced in late November that it would add
comprehensive autism coverage for expensive intensive therapies
such as Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) to its  health plan
for 2014. The bank joins about 15 of its Fortune 100 peers,
according to the advocacy group Autism Speaks, which expects
that number to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as one in 50 U.S. school-age children - or about 1
million - have a diagnosis of autism, according to a national
survey released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention last March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lifetime costs of treating one person with autism could
top $2.3 million, according to 2012 research from the University
of Pennsylvania and the London School of Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the expense, it is no surprise that insurers have had
to be prodded to cover many autism treatments. Thirty-four
states and the District of Columbia now require insurance
carriers to extend coverage for ABA and other autism treatments
in some or all of their individual and small-group policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But states don't regulate the self-funded policies offered
by JPMorgan and other large employers, under which about
one-quarter of Americans are covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is changing rapidly. An accelerating number of major
companies have been extending their health plans to include
autism coverage. Companies announcing this year they will add at
least partial benefits include General Motors Co, United
Technologies Corp, Chrysler Group and American
Express Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adding this type of benefit has been the biggest request
we've heard from employees in recent years, and the outpouring
of gratitude has been overwhelming," says Bernadette Ulissi
Branosky, JPMorgan's head of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the required co-insurance, Branosky estimates,
most employees who qualify will pay less than $4,000 annually,
compared with amounts that run as high as 20 times that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INSURERS WARN OF HIGHER PREMIUMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABA, a form of highly structured one-on-one coaching by
trained teachers, has become the most widely used autism
treatment in the United States. It is endorsed by the American
Academy of Pediatrics, the U.S. Surgeon General and the American
Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many insurers, however, still categorize ABA as an
experimental treatment, because of a lack of long-term research
on its effectiveness, and have largely refused to cover it.
School districts must offer some services for school-age
children, but parents often bear much of the expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABA's very high cost, as much as $60,000 per year per child,
no doubt underlies this reluctance. The Council for Affordable
Health Insurance, a Virginia-based association of health
insurance companies, says that mandating autism coverage could
raise premiums across the board by 1 percent to 3 percent,
according to research it conducted in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That added expense, the industry group has warned, could
make basic coverage unaffordable for many Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, data collected from states that require autism
coverage suggests such concerns may be overblown. Two years
after requiring coverage, seven states saw monthly premiums rise
by 31 cents on average per member, according to figures collated
by Autism Speaks. In Arizona's second year of mandated coverage,
autism-related claims totaled about $389,000 - less than 10
percent of the $4,900,000 that the legislature forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorri Unumb, vice president for state government affairs at
Autism Speaks, reports similar results in the private sector.
"Companies tell us the additional cost is miniscule, a rounding
error that most don't even pass along to employees," she says.
JPMorgan, which reported $21.3 billion in profits in 2012,
estimates the added benefit for its roughly 200,000 employees in
the United States will cost it around $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OBAMACARE ADDS LAYER OF COMPLEXITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal law governs self-funded health plans, and advocates
had hoped that Affordable Care Act's 2010 passage would bring
expanded coverage for autism treatment all around. The U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services has suggested a national
standard could come in 2016, but so far the Obama administration
has left it to states to define what the "essential benefits"
are that insurers must provide when it comes to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Autism Speaks, only 26 states included ABA
coverage in their benchmark health insurance plans, which
outline the minimum benefits that must be offered on state
exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see the current state mandates where you live, go to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many employers with self-funded plans are moving forward
even without mandates. Several of the country's major technology
companies, including Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp
, led the way more than a decade ago, possibly because
autism - according to California Department of Developmental
Services records - is especially prevalent in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past two years have seen other employers catching up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial services company Capital One Bank is one
of the few employers to pay 100 percent of the cost. Tricare,
the Pentagon's health insurance plan, asks families to
contribute as little as $25 for care regardless of the overall
cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Express, in addition to now covering ABA under its
health plan, provides guidance for employees with autistic
children on topics including educational rights, estate planning
and childcare. The company is also in the process of
establishing a special-needs support network, pairing parents of
recently diagnosed children with those have older offspring with
autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employer-sponsored benefits apply to children up to the age
26 under the Affordable Care Act. The CDC defines children as
individuals 17 years old and younger.
  Giangregorio, for his part, says he is proud JPMorgan has
decided to add coverage for ABA and other autism treatments. In
the past, he says, Nicholas was not able to get the necessary
services he needed, including ABA, due to a lack of insurance.
"Fortunately none of my colleagues with autistic children will
face that now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI Dec 16 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase has
promoted two bankers to senior roles in Saudi Arabia, the bank
said in a statement on Monday, after its top banker in the
kingdom left earlier this year to join the central bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rayan Fayez has been named senior country officer for Saudi
Arabia, the statement said. He joined JP Morgan from Goldman
Sachs in 2012 as investment banking head and co-chief
executive of Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fayez replaces Abdulaziz Al Helaissi, who left JP Morgan in
the first half of 2013 to take a position at the Saudi Arabian
Monetary Agency. His move was part of a wider trend in the
kingdom to tap senior executives from leading global financial
institutions to run key state entities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bader Alamoudi has been named chief executive of
JP Morgan's Saudi Arabian business, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;

But a series of political obstacles, notably over the divided island of Cyprus, and resistance to Turkish membership in Germany and France, have slowed progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tulay Karadeniz; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by Nick Tattersall and Patrick Graham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 17 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in federal court
on Tuesday, saying the agency owes it more than $1 billion in
compensation for not assuming legal claims arising from its
acquisition of Washington Mutual's assets after its 2008
implosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bought Washington Mutual's banking operations in an
FDIC-arranged deal at the height of the financial crisis, a
little more than a week after Merrill Lynch agreed to sell
itself to Bank of America Corp and Lehman Brothers filed
for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the deal, an FDIC receivership "broadly
agreed to indemnify JPMC both for liabilities JPMC did not
assume and for numerous other matters," the bank claimed in the
24-page lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are promises that the FDIC made to JPMC to induce JPMC
to enter into the...agreement when WMB failed in September 2008,
in the largest bank failure in this nation's history," the
lawsuit states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank accused the FDIC of breach of contract and breach
of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, while seeking
declaratory judgments that the agency is obligated to compensate
the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit states that JPMorgan seeks to recover
"substantially in excess of a billion dollars of
indemnification," and that $2.75 billion of assets it says
remain in the Washington Mutual receivership "should be
sufficient" to satisfy its claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank claims it is entitled to compensation from
settlement amounts it paid to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
stemming from bad loans they bought from Washington Mutual,
numerous lawsuits that allege that Washington Mutual misled
investors in residential mortgage-backed securities, and claims
by various state taxing authorities seeking to recover
Washington Mutual tax obligations, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which had agreed to maintain Washington Mutual's
documents, is also seeking compensation for costs incurred
producing "many millions of pages" of documents in these and
other cases, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for the FDIC and JPMorgan declined to comment
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases is JPMorgan Chase Bank National Association v.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday notified Chevron Corp. that it found dozens of failures to comply with federal environmental laws in an investigation stemming from a 2012 fire at the company's Richmond, California, refinery, according to documents provided by EPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No workers were injured in the fire, but in the days following, 15,000 San Francisco Bay area residents sought treatment for respiratory irritation due to the smoke plume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said it found 49 failures by Chevron to effectively operate a risk management plan for the refinery, where a pipe ruptured on a crude distillation unit on August 6 2012, igniting a massive blaze and sending a huge plume of black smoke and particulates over the San Francisco Bay area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These violations increased the probability of failure of (the pipe) and the risk that such a failure would have significant consequences," said EPA Regional Director Jared Blumenfeld in a letter sent to the refinery on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokeswoman said on Tuesday the company was reviewing EPA's letter and list of violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are committed to work with EPA and the other agencies as they completed their investigations into the August 2012 incident," said Chevron spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter and violations issued to Chevron is the first action by EPA after completing its probe of the 2012 blaze, Blumenfeld wrote in the letter to Chevron. The company has 30 days to reply and explain its plans to correct the violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Chevron fails to correct the failures, EPA could ask a federal court to fine the company $37,500 per violation per day. Blumenfeld did not say what penalties Chevron may ultimately face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPA also found 13 failures to report releases from the refinery in 2010, 2012 and 2013 to appropriate regulators in compliance with the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Chemical Safety Board has said the pipe on the crude distillation unit had become dangerously thin due to corrosion from sulfur in crude oil in the years before the August 6, 2012 explosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board, which investigates chemical explosion, found Chevron refinery managers had several opportunities over several years to replace the pipe prior to its failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blast led to the shutdown of the CDU, which does the primary refining of crude oil coming into the refinery and provides feed for all other units, for nine months, cutting gasoline production from the 245,000 bpd plant by up to 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, California's Occupational Safety and Health Division issued nearly $1 million in fines to Chevron due to the blaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, Chevron agreed to pay $2 million in fines and restitution after pleading no contest to six misdemeanor violations of state law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company faces lawsuits by the City of Richmond and hundreds of area residents due to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to cost of repairs to the CDU, the refinery has been inspecting and replacing pipe at the refinery since the blaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We provided approximately $10 million to affected community members and local government agencies in Richmond and West Contra Costa County for medical and response-related costs," Ritchie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bob Burgdorfer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
has appointed two senior executives to run its global metals and
commodities businesses, sources said on Tuesday, the latest in a
series of high-level changes at Wall Street's No. 1 bank for
commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based Charles McGarraugh, who is currently head of
European mortgage product trading, will be global head of metals
trading, running one of the world's biggest metal derivatives
desks, two sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don Casturo, who is based in New York and is global head of
commodities investor products, has been named chief operating
officer of global commodities, a newly created position, one of
the sources said. He will retain his investor products job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment on the
appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reorganization comes after the bank lost two senior
commodity executives -- co-head of global commodities trading
Magid Shenouda and global head of commodities sales Peter
O'Hagan -- in October and follows a tumultuous year for the
bank's metals business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGarraugh is taking over the role held by long-time metals
chief Stephen Branton-Speak, who left the bank at the end of
2012, the first of three key metals departures in the past
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has struggled to expand in physical metals trading,
which is very capital intensive and considered high risk, after
first entering the business in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two executives are also taking over the reins at a time
of unprecedented regulatory pressure amid allegations that the
bank's metals warehousing business inflated physical aluminum
prices. The Federal Reserve is also considering ways to limit
Wall Street's deep involvement in raw materials markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has considered selling the warehousing unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, revenues at Goldman and other banks have
been shrinking as lower market volatility and tighter regulation
 hurt profits.

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit followed an 18-month probe, according to Hood, and adds to a long list of legal problems facing JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the New York-based bank reached a record $13 billion settlement over its sale of shoddy mortgage securities. It also faces probes over such matters as its hiring practices in China and its dealings with former client Bernard Madoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a complaint filed in a state court in Hinds County, Mississippi, JPMorgan has, since at least 2007, relied on "robo-signing" and other discredited practices to pursue consumers for sums they did not owe, already paid, or had excused in bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit said employees described a "chaotic" and "disorganized" workplace marred by "rampant" mistakes, inadequate training, constantly changing policies, high turnover and unrealistic quotas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hood also accused JPMorgan of relying on "outhouse" law firms that would churn out lawsuits without first reviewing the underlying claims, and working with now-defunct arbitration firm Mann Bracken -- dubbed "Mann Broken" by bank employees -- that could not keep track of customer payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumers' paychecks were garnished and their credit damaged, making it harder for them to refinance their homes, take out a car or student loans, or even get jobs," Hood said in a statement. "We have tried for months to resolve our concerns cooperatively, but have been forced into litigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation, which Hood said could result in a "significant" sum, and a ban on similar future misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Paul Hartwick declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 19, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ordered JPMorgan to refund $309 million to about 2 million customers they said were harmed by its debt collection and other credit card procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, JPMorgan said collection issues affected fewer than 1 percent of its customers, and that it stopped filing collection lawsuits in 2011 and stopped enrolling customers in credit monitoring services in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, California Attorney General Kamala Harris also filed a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan of "robo-signing" in credit cards and flooding state courts with questionable lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Mississippi ex rel.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 17 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co was sued on
Tuesday by Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, who accused
the largest U.S. bank of violating state consumer protection
laws in its alleged pursuit of delinquent payments by credit

It also faces probes over such matters as its hiring practices
in China and its dealings with former client Bernard Madoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a complaint filed in a state court in Hinds
County, Mississippi, JPMorgan has, since at least 2007, relied
on "robo-signing" and other discredited practices to pursue
consumers for sums they did not owe, already paid, or had
excused in bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit said employees described a "chaotic" and
"disorganized" workplace marred by "rampant" mistakes,
inadequate training, constantly changing policies, high turnover
and unrealistic quotas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hood also accused JPMorgan of relying on "outhouse" law
firms that would churn out lawsuits without first reviewing the
underlying claims, and working with now-defunct arbitration firm
Mann Bracken -- dubbed "Mann Broken" by bank employees -- that
could not keep track of customer payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumers' paychecks were garnished and their credit

and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ordered
JPMorgan to refund $309 million to about 2 million customers
they said were harmed by its debt collection and other credit
card procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, JPMorgan said collection issues affected fewer
than 1 percent of its customers, and that it stopped filing 
collection lawsuits in 2011 and stopped enrolling customers in

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 17 (Reuters) - IMS Health Inc has hired
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co Inc to lead a proposed initial
public offering that could value the private equity-owned
healthcare information company at close to $10 billion,
according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPG Capital LP, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB)
and Leonard Green &amp; Partners LP, which bought IMS in 2010 for
$5.2 billion, including debt, chose JPMorgan as the lead
underwriter after interviewing investment banks late last week,
the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs would also
lead the planned offering, which is planned for 2014, the people
said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the private equity owners could also explore an
outright sale of Danbury, Connecticut-based IMS to another
company, a public offering is a more likely outcome, some of the
people added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMS Health, TPG, CPPIB and Goldman Sachs declined to comment
while Leonard Green, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley did not
immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMS Health provides prescription data to the pharmaceutical
industry, medical device makers, government agencies and other
companies in the healthcare sector. Founded in 1954, the company
has over 5,000 clients and operates in more than 100 countries
according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has posted lackluster revenue growth since 2009,
yet cost cuts, acquisitions and restructuring initiatives have
enabled it to grow its free cash flow, after capital
expenditures, to more than $150 million this year, according to
Moody's Investors Service Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its private equity owners have taken advantage of the strong
cash flow to draw $1.95 billion in dividends from the company in
the last 14 months by having it borrow, according to Moody's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity firms have sought to unload their portfolio
companies this year as stock markets have enjoyed strong
valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year ranked as the strongest for U.S. IPOs since 2000
by dollar volume, according to Thomson Reuters data, as large
floats such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings and Plains GP
Holdings lifted deal proceeds up 21 percent from 2012
to $56.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Tuesday announced the appointment of a former Microsoft Corp executive to oversee its revamped HealthCare.gov website and expand on technology improvements achieved by the site's outgoing czar, Jeffrey Zients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurt DelBene, who recently retired as head of the software company's Microsoft Office unit, will spearhead efforts to continue the overhaul of the website, which was set up to provide federally subsidized health insurance to millions of consumers in 36 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DelBene, who starts his new job on Wednesday, takes over only days before a December 23 deadline for people to sign up for coverage to begin on January 1, which could cause traffic on the newly revamped site to soar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zients, a longtime aide to President Barack Obama, oversaw a five-week emergency fix that turned HealthCare.gov from a crippled online portal to one that now operates smoothly for most visitors. Zients, an expert in crisis management, starts a new job as top economic adviser at the White House in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the consumer-facing part of the website has improved, officials are still racing to finish critical "back end" features. Missing pieces include software that will enable the federal government to verify enrollment data with issuers and to pay plans billions of dollars in federal subsidies on behalf of lower income enrollees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration is also trying to fix some troubling glitches. An official said on December 6 that about 10 percent of applications to the main website are not being accurately transmitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kurt will ... focus on increasing system stability, redundancy and capacity, and building on improvements to the user interface, while continuing to prioritize security and privacy issues," U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a blog posting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DelBene is expected to remain in the job at least through the first half of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website's ability to handle rising volumes this month and early in 2014 could have far-reaching implications for Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress. They have been battered by Republican criticism over the botched website and other issues related to Obamacare, as attention turns to next November's mid-term election battle for control of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new Reuters-Ipsos poll of 1,558 American adults, conducted December 13-17, showed that 55 percent disapprove of Obama's job as president. But on the question of which party has a better plan for healthcare, Democrats still outpace Republicans 29 percent to 19 percent. The data has an overall margin of error of 2.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VOLUNTEER WORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As head of Microsoft's most profitable division, DelBene was in charge of providing complex software and services, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and the Microsoft Exchange email system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under DelBene's leadership, Microsoft moved toward making the Office suite of applications available online, a departure for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DelBene, husband of U.S. Representative Suzan DelBene of Washington, is volunteering, a White House official said. He will return his entire compensation, which was not released, to the Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DelBene earned $7.59 million at Microsoft during the company's fiscal year that ended June 30, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zients was brought in two months ago to take charge of the contractors working on HealthCare.gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website could not handle traffic when it launched on October 1, slowing enrollments and creating a political embarrassment for Obama, who had promised a smooth roll-out for his signature health reforms.

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO Dec 17 (Reuters) - An Ontario appeals court ruled
on Tuesday that a group of Ecuadoreans can seek enforcement in
Canada of a $9.5 billion judgment against U.S. oil company
Chevron Corp, overturning a lower court decision from
earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest turn of a two-decade conflict between Chevron
and residents of Ecuador's Lago Agrio region in the Amazon
jungle, a three-judge panel said the case should proceed, which
means the Ecuadoreans can seek damages in Canada that were
originally awarded to them in a South American court two years
ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision overturns a May ruling by Ontario Superior
Court Justice David Brown, who had granted Chevron a stay in the
proceedings on the basis that the case had little hope of
success and that Chevron Canada's assets were not directly owned
by Chevron Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After all these years, the plaintiffs deserve to have the
recognition and enforcement of the (Ecuadorean) judgment heard
on the merits in an appropriate jurisdiction. At this juncture,
Ontario is that jurisdiction," the panel wrote in a 29-page
decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs have gone to Canada to target what they say
are Chevron's $15 billion worth of assets in the country. The
California-based company no longer has any assets in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judges ordered Chevron and its Canadian subsidiary to
pay C$100,000 ($94,300) in costs to the plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Chevron said it was evaluating its next
steps, including a possible appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the plaintiffs truly believed in the validity of the
(Ecuadorean) judgment, they should seek enforcement in the
United States, where Chevron Corp resides," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are aware that in the U.S., however, they would be
confronted by the fact that eight federal courts have already
found the Ecuador trial to be tainted by fraud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadoreans claim that Texaco, which Chevron acquired in
2001, contaminated the Lago Agrio area from 1964 to 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The recognition by the Superior Court (of Canada) will
continue and we expect in the coming months to begin taking
actions against assets of the company, once the sentence is
recognized," said Julio Prieto, a lawyer representing the
plaintiffs, during a press conference in Quito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs were awarded an $18 billion decision in an
Ecuadorean court in February 2011, but Chevron has steadfastly
refused to pay, saying the ruling was influenced by fraud and
bribery. The size of the original judgment was reduced last
month by Ecuador's Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs have since sought to persuade the Ontario 
court -- among other jurisdictions -- to collect the damages
awarded to them by the South American court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A related fraud case in New York wrapped up in November,
though a decision from that proceeding is not expected right
away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the country's
courts can recognize and enforce foreign judgments in cases
where there is a "reasonable and substantial connection" between
the cause of the action and the foreign court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement suggests the world's biggest software company is nearing the end of its search for a new leader, which began in August when Steve Ballmer announced his plan to retire within 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft pledged to pick a successor within that timeframe, although most investors had expected the process to be finished by December or January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a complex job.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc on Tuesday said it would allow Teva Pharmaceutical Industries to sell generic forms of its Viagra anti-impotence treatment in the United States beginning in late 2017, in a settlement of longstanding patent litigation between the two drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's U.S. patent on Viagra lapses in 2020, including a six-month extension granted for having tested the medicine in young patients. That means Israeli drugmaker Teva, under the arrangement, could launch its generic version several years before other generic drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in a statement that it would receive a royalty from Teva, but no other financial details were disclosed. Teva will be authorized to launch its U.S. generics by December 11, 2017, or earlier in certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viagra began facing cheaper generics in Europe in June, including formulations sold by Teva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viagra, the first drug to treat impotence, was approved by U.S. regulators in 1998. It has annual sales of about $1.8 billion, including U.S. sales of $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's basic U.S. patent on Viagra had been slated to lapse in 2012, which would have opened the floodgates to cheaper generics. But a federal judge in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2011 - during the legal battle with Teva - ruled that a secondary Pfizer patent covering the way that Viagra is used protects the oral drug from generic competition well into 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were little changed in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Dec. 17, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Following on the heels of a SEC and FINRA actions, Gana LLP filed an investor claim against J.P. Turner  Company, LLC and National Securities Corp. On November 8, 2013, the SEC issued an order finding that employees of JP Turner engaged in excessive trading and churned customer accounts and its executive vice-president, Michael Bresner, failed to supervise its registered representatives. Churning is generally defined as the act of buying and selling securities for the purpose of generating commissions. The registered representatives named in the SEC action were Ralph Calabro, Jason Konner and Dimitrios Koutsoubos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, on December 5, 2013, FINRA, the largest independent securities regulator in the United States, also sanctioned JP Turner for $700,000 in restitution for the unsuitable sale of leveraged and inverse Exchange-Traded Funds and for excessive mutual fund switching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The 125 page SEC order found that JP Turner employed a monitoring system to highlight accounts that may have been churned using various measurements of activity in the accounts. The system identified over 300 hundred accounts that had indications of excessive trading activity but potentially were not properly supervised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The SEC Administrative Law Judge that rendered the decision against the JP Turner employees said he was "shocked at the cavalier attitude" exhibited toward the churning activity. As a result, all named brokers were barred from the industry and the supervisor was barred from employment in a supervisory role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"It is incredible that the SEC found over 300 accounts involving over 100 representatives that were generating such high commissions without JP Turner taking appropriate action," said Adam Weinstein, a partner with Gana LLP. "I have dedicated my career to protecting investors and I am appalled by this activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The attorneys at Gana LLP have represented hundreds of individual and institutions that have been the victim of financial fraud in arbitrations and in court seeking to recover losses. Gana LLP is a leading law firm nationally for investor protection. Gana LLP has handled cases involving suitability, churning, account supervision, and fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			New Skills at Work, Landmark Economic Opportunity Initiative from 
      JPMorgan Chase, Commits $15 Million to Chicago
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Aims to revolutionize how employers and skills trainers develop 
      talent for jobs in local high-growth industries; Mayor 
      Emanuel highlights ongoing work to address skills gap in the city 
      through College to Careers program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. today announced it is committing $15 million toward 
      workforce readiness and demand-driven training in Chicago, as part of 
      its unprecedented five-year, $250 million global New Skills at Work 
      initiative. Launched last week, New Skills at Work is the largest ever 
      private-sector effort aimed at addressing the &#8220;skills gap&#8221; that exists 
      across many industries, such as healthcare and advanced manufacturing, 
      where not enough trained workers have the specific skills to fill the 
      jobs available. New Skills at Work will build upon successful programs 
      around the country, like the College to Careers program underway across 
      the City Colleges of Chicago.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Unemployment in Chicago is at nearly 10%, and yet over 100,000 jobs 
      remain unfilled. According to an IMF analysis, the skills gap accounts 
      for approximately one-third of the U.S. unemployment rate. Using 
      research and data analysis, public-private partnerships and engagement 
      with local leaders and organizations, New Skills at Work will accelerate 
      economic growth by supporting training programs that will have the 
      greatest impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have long supported the skills training and development work of 
      high-impact organizations throughout the Chicago area,&#8221; said Glenn 
      Tilton, Chairman of the Midwest, JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;And we are pleased to 
      make Chicago one of the inaugural cities of New Skills at Work, which 
      aims to train people for the jobs that are available &#8211; today and 
      tomorrow. Our data-driven approach will better equip organizations to 
      serve the community and help people get the skills they need to succeed. 
      Mayor Emanuel has been a national leader in skills training and we are 
      looking forward to working together to help more people get jobs.&#8221; In 
      addition to his role with JPMorgan Chase, Tilton is a co-chair of the 
      Plan for Economic Growth  Jobs at World Business Chicago and the board 
      chair for Skills for Chicagoland&#8217;s Future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am grateful to JPMorgan Chase for believing in the city of Chicago 
      and making this strong commitment that will foster opportunity 
      throughout our city,&#8221; said Mayor Emanuel. &#8220;Helping people obtain the 
      training and resources they need to be able to find the jobs that are 
      available is a key area of focus for my administration. I am confident 
      this program will build on the success we&#8217;ve seen with our programs here 
      in Chicago.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Chicago, Mayor Emanuel&#8217;s work to close the skills gap includes an 
      innovative program at the City Colleges of Chicago &#8211; called College to 
      Careers. The program, launched in 2011, partners faculty and staff at 
      City Colleges with more than 100 industry leaders to design curriculum 
      and facilities and offer internships and job opportunities to ensure 
      Chicagoans are ready to hit the ground running in fast-growing fields. 
      Leaders from the private and public sectors, college faculties and 
      industry groups come together to design innovative coursework, 
      curriculum and training, to ensure students are trained with the skills 
      they need for the jobs of tomorrow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      New Skills at Work will provide much-needed data about employer demand 
      to better inform workforce training programs and help drive more 
      effective and strategic local workforce planning. The initiative will 
      produce Workforce Readiness Gap Reports that will explore workforce 
      deficiencies and challenges specifically in the Chicago area and seek to 
      identify holes in local job markets and the skills needed to fill 
      identified gaps. The data will be used to inform program development 
      efforts with all stakeholders &#8211; the business groups and sector 
      associations as well as leading national workforce training groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Addressing the skills gap is critical to reduce unemployment in Chicago 
      and create a more stable, growing economy,&#8221; said Jamie Dimon, chairman 
      and chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;JPMorgan is using its 
      best assets, including industry intelligence and strong partnerships in 
      Chicago, to provide a platform for employers, educators and workforce 
      participants to help people gain the skills they need to succeed.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase (JPM.N) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) are extending bans on the use of multi-dealer online chatrooms, sources familiar with the plans told Reuters, as banks crack down on potentially inappropriate communications following a string of scandals.&lt;/p&gt;

      Students in 16 U.S. Communities

			Collaboration with DonorsChoose.org generated nearly $7.1 million for

      Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and DonorsChoose.org today announced that the 2013 Fuel 
      Your School program generated nearly $7.1 million in 16 U.S. 
      communities, benefitting more than 8,000 local public school classroom 
      projects, including more than 4,000 resources to support science, 
      technology, engineering and math (STEM) curriculum, and impacting a 
      total of 940,440 students. The program has grown each year to support 
      students in various communities where Chevron has business operations. 
      Since its inception in 2010, Fuel Your School has helped fund more than 
      17,000 classroom projects in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through Chevron&#8217;s 2013 Fuel Your School program, teachers at more than 
      2,500 public schools received valuable classroom resources. Kelvin 
      Smith, a science teacher at Kipp Ways Academy in Atlanta, wants to see 
      100 of his students become engineers &#8211; an especially challenging goal 
      since the Atlanta middle school could not afford lab equipment. Fuel 
      Your School helped provide Smith with physical science lab kits to help 
      him reach his goal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I teach in one of the most impoverished areas of Georgia but I teach 
      students of limitless potential,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;The lab equipment I 
      requested will play a large role in making science more fun for my 
      students and with helping the students learn physical science concepts.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Fuel Your School is an innovative collaboration to help our local 
      public schools and to help support young students with an effective 
      education in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM),&#8221; said 
      Dale Walsh, president of Chevron Americas Products. &#8220;At Chevron, we 
      depend on an educated workforce to meet our business needs, and we know 
      that an educated and skilled workforce helps lead to economic growth for 
      our business and the communities where we operate.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Fuel Your School is a part of Chevron Corporation&#8217;s multimillion dollar 
      holistic education 
      commitment to support educational programs, including those in STEM, 
      that help increase access to and the quality of education and career and 
      technical training at every level &#8212; from education to employment. To 
      achieve this, Chevron works with education organizations, government 
      officials, non-profit organizations and community leaders to develop and 
      support innovative programs that invest in tomorrow&#8217;s workforce by 
      educating students, supporting teacher training, providing classroom 
      resources, supporting educational standards, funding out-of-school 
      activities and preparing workers to excel in their jobs, including 
      possible engineering positions at Chevron.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Teachers spent on average nearly $500 of their own money last year on 
      materials for their students,&#8221; said Charles Best, CEO of 
      DonorsChoose.org. &#8220;Chevron&#8217;s innovative Fuel Your School program 
      addresses the lack of adequate public school funding by helping equip 
      and empower teachers to benefit students and improve education.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through the Fuel Your School program, $1 was contributed when consumers 
      purchased eight or more gallons of fuel during the month of October at 
      participating Chevron and Texaco stations, generating up to nearly $7.1 
      million, to help fund eligible classroom projects in local public 
      schools in the following 16 U.S. markets:
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 17 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase, the
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is banning the use of multi-dealer
online chat rooms and the use of such chat rooms among staff for
social purposes, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chat rooms have been a focus for regulators investigating
manipulation of benchmark interest rates and possible rigging in
the $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chat communications featured prominently in a five-year
probe into the rigging of a key interest rate known as the
London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which has already cost
banks billions of dollars in settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source said JP Morgan's decision was unrelated to the FX
probes which first surfaced in June, noting that this had been
under review at the bank since even earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has always been about more than FX," the source said,
adding that the casual nature of online chat rooms increased the
potential for "inappropriate" remarks to be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban will come into force later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bilateral online chats between JP Morgan traders and traders
at other financial institutions are under review, while external
chats between JP Morgan staff and clients will still be
permitted, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan declined to comment because the plans have yet to
be finalised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other banks have taken similar action recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank has prohibited its foreign exchange
and fixed income staff from using online chat rooms, and UBS
 banned the use of multi-bank and social chat rooms at
its investment banking division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders at banks and financial institutions often
communicate with each other online via third-party services
including Bloomberg LP and Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Lohfeld WinCenter(TM) Combines Proven Capture and Proposal Process With Software to Drive Competitive Advantage&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;EDGEWATER, MD and RESTON, VA--(Marketwired - Dec 17, 2013) -  Lohfeld Consulting Group, Inc., the premiere capture and proposal services consulting firm in the government market, and CorasWorks Corporation, a global leader in work management software and solutions on Microsoft SharePoint, today announced a partnership to combine their respective expertise to incorporate the Lohfeld capture and proposal processes into an integrated application for government contractors to automate the acquisition of new business. The application runs on a Microsoft SharePoint platform and provides an enterprise-wide solution for companies to manage their new business activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lohfeld Capture and Proposal Management WinCenter&#8482; is based on the industry-leading Lohfeld capture and proposal management process. WinCenter&#8482; allows Federal Government contractors of all sizes to plan and execute better capture campaigns, write more effective proposals, increase their new business win rate, and reduce their overall cost of acquiring new business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With declining government budgets as the new normal, Federal Government contractors need a way to enhance their competitiveness -- affordably and practically," said Bob Lohfeld, CEO of Lohfeld Consulting Group. "By partnering with CorasWorks and leveraging their SharePoint-based platform, we're able to offer a single solution that integrates our practical capture and proposal process into actionable, manageable, tailorable, and measurable software."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lohfeld WinCenter&#8482; is based on Lohfeld's proven five-phased capture and proposal management process that combines process, templates, instruction, just-in-time capture and proposal coaching, and training. The process is currently being used by many Federal Government contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"WinCenter&#8482; is a game changer," said William Rogers, Chief Workplace Architect at CorasWorks. "There are many 'vanilla' products and solutions in the market today that separately address capture and proposal management. Through this partnership with Lohfeld, we are now incorporating their proven process into our software to create the first-ever integrated capture and proposal solution that actually embeds and automates their best business practices and processes in a single tool. This is a huge value-add over the generic solutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to combining process and software, other key features of the Lohfeld
				WinCenter&#8482; include: &lt;/p&gt;
			
				Integrated Capture and Proposal Management System - Integrates the two key elements of business development and provides a seamless process and transition from capture through proposal development, complete with "how to" narrative guidance for capture novices and experts, templates, and access to a single asset library.
            
				Individual Homepage for each opportunity - All capture and proposal tasks, activities, action items, graphics, documents, artifacts, work products, color reviews, gate reviews, and reporting are available in and accessed through the WinCenter&#8482;. Significantly increases the team's efficiency and overall performance by providing a single place from which to work and communicate.
            
				Increased Visibility, Consistency, and Accountability - High-level dashboard that displays capture and proposal progress for each new business opportunity and customized reporting ensures managers and executives have the information they need, in the format they need it, when they need it. Also ensures consistency in information capture and reporting.
            
				Integration with External Systems - Seamlessly integrates with almost any external system or database, including Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and Human Resource (HR) systems.
            
				Flexible and Customizable - Custom tailor the solution to address your specific requirements, and enhance and extend it to meet your evolving needs.
			&lt;p&gt;"The extremely high level of competition in this industry is driving Federal Government contractors to find ways to heighten their competitive advantage," said Rogers. "And we're now giving them an answer. Our solution provides a proven, winning structure to guide their activities, removes the inefficiencies inherent in the process, and helps remove much of the risk. These combine to provide a significant competitive advantage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those interested in learning more about the Lohfeld WinCenter&#8482; can join a live webcast on Wednesday, January 22, 2014.

&lt;p&gt;The stake - worth 381.6 billion won as of the Wednesday

considering selling 21 percent of the general insurer, LIG said
in November in a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koo and other members of LIG's owning family are selling the
stake to reimburse investors for losses sustained after buying

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 18 (Reuters) - Trading firm Virtu Financial
LLC is planning to go public and has hired Goldman Sachs 
to help it with the process, two sources familiar with the
situation told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Virtu, a market maker in equities, fixed
income, currencies and commodities markets, is planning to
submit a confidential IPO filing under the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act within the next couple of months, said one
of the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources wished to remain anonymous because they are not
permitted to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtu and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtu will likely bring in other banks to help with the IPO,
but has not yet chosen them, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtu has around 150 employees and offices in Europe and
Asia, as well as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm, which is backed by private equity firm Silver
Lake, had bid for embattled market-making firm Knight Capital
Group last year and planned to take the company private. Virtu
lost out to Getco Holding Co on the acquisition. Getco went
public upon merging with Knight and is now called KCG Holdings
Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal initially reported on Wednesday that
Virtu had hired Goldman Sachs for an IPO.

&lt;p&gt;By Rob Cox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opini0ns expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can General Electric&#160;keep activist investors at bay? If the gates at Apple, Microsoft and Procter  Gamble can be rattled, complacency just isn&#8217;t an option for any company, even and maybe especially a $270 billion conglomerate. While GE&#8217;s broad strategy looks more coherent than ever, the Connecticut giant still has two potential vulnerabilities: its finance arm and its longtime leader Jeffrey Immelt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate America has learned of late that size offers no immunity from the braying of ornery shareholders. A $320 billion market value didn&#8217;t shield Microsoft from the pressures of ValueAct Capital, which nabbed a board seat and accelerated the exit of Chief Executive Steve Ballmer. Even bigger Apple, and boss Tim Cook, have been targeted by both David Einhorn and Carl Icahn to return more cash to shareholders. A long-standing reputation as a consumer-products stalwart didn&#8217;t protect $220 billion PG from the advances of Bill Ackman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE has so far kept clear. Its executives, however, seem to be cognizant of how quickly that could change. The engines-to-dishwashers manufacturer has been proactively restructuring in ways that could wisely head off rabble-rousers. GE is reducing its exposure to finance, and in recent years exited businesses like NBC Universal, deemed ancillary to a strategy focused on global infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the existing configuration of GE&#8217;s industrial portfolio looks better positioned to take advantage of a middle-class future. That world, to put it simply, involves more people around the globe seeking better healthcare, traveling on jet planes and gaining access to clean water and abundant energy &#8211; from which they can run GE appliances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what would an activist investor go after at GE? The most obvious weak spot is GE Capital. During the financial crisis, the division&#8217;s balance sheet of some $550 billion overshadowed the world-class industrial businesses. The need to finance a large financial institution without a stable base of deposits stoked fears GE might even need to jettison valuable assets. GE Capital has since pared its balance sheet by almost a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s also more to come. In November, GE said it would begin the process of spinning off its consumer finance business, which carries some $59 billion of assets. Once the divestiture is completed, GE Capital will have a loan book of about $350 billion. That&#8217;s far below its peak. Yet it still puts GE Capital on a par with U.S. Bancorp and renders it among the country&#8217;s biggest financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this is easy to justify. About a quarter of GE Capital&#8217;s assets will be devoted to what it calls &#8220;GE Verticals&#8221; where it uses its balance sheet to help finance customer purchases of GE products. But it still envisions tying up more than half its assets in lending and leasing initiatives and some $50 billion in commercial real estate. To investors wanting a more focused, industrial GE, this could provide a potential soft spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of capital allocation and portfolio management, the other typical target for activists is management. Chairman and Chief Executive Immelt can&#8217;t ignore the possibility of a broadside. Since taking over in 2001, GE&#8217;s total shareholder return has been flat compared to a doubling of the SP 500 Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immelt was passed a tough hand. His ascent coincided with the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the subsequent economic downturn. He also led GE through the outburst of financial services, which brought earnings to a record high of $38 billion, or $2.21 a share, in 2007. The crisis erased those gains. A dozen years on, GE is slated to record $146 billion of revenue and earnings of $1.64 a share &#8211; just around 28 cents more than in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, with hindsight it&#8217;s easy to argue that Immelt should have been more proactive at reducing the size of the financial business he inherited from his predecessor Jack Welch. What matters now is that Immelt has put the organization on a better trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not impossible, though, to envision a new hard-nosed investor demanding a more aggressive reduction of GE&#8217;s exposure to financial services, a conflict that could escalate into a referendum on management. That would put Immelt in an uncomfortable spot. He has at least groomed many able successors. Don&#8217;t be surprised if one of them gets a shot at the job in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Foods Group Inc, a producer and distributor of egg and dairy products owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) private equity arm, is exploring a sale that could fetch more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Foods has asked Goldman Sachs' investment banking unit and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) to help it prepare for an auction, and is working on detailed financial information to send to potential buyers, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company could attract interest from food companies as well as private equity firms, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Foods and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Michael Foods produces and distributes various products to the retail, food service and ingredient markets, including specialty egg products, refrigerated potato products, cheese and other dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its egg product brands include Papetti's, Abbotsford Farms, All Whites and Better'n Eggs. Michael Foods also owns the Simply Potatoes line of refrigerated potato products, as well as Crystal Farms branded cheese and refrigerated products, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Capital Partners bought Michael Foods from private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners LP in 2010 for around $1.7 billion. Thomas H. Lee retained an ownership stake of about 20 percent as part of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the nine months ending September 28, Michael Foods posted adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $188 million, up 7.2 percent from the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the full year, the company is on track to report EBITDA of close to $250 million. Michael Foods is hoping to fetch roughly 9 times that amount, two of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has changed the way it invests in private equity since it bought Michael Foods to comply with the so-called Volcker rule, which limits investment bank investments in illiquid asset classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a bid to pool money for deals without raising a private equity fund, the Wall Street bank has been underwriting the equity in deals and then lining up clients willing to put money into accounts set up to invest in them, people familiar with the matter said earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Soyoung Kim, Greg Roumeliotis and Olivia Oran in New York.

			&lt;p&gt;IGC Brava for OpenText Content Server SharePoint Connector Gives SharePoint Users Access to the Content Server Repository, Simplifying Document Management&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SCOTTSDALE, AZ--(Marketwired - Dec 18, 2013) - &#160;In large organizations, headquarters may keep important data and documents in OpenText Content Server while individual departments use Microsoft SharePoint for team collaboration. If this sounds familiar, you have probably encountered this problem: How can workers using different content management systems collaborate on the same content? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IGC's Brava!&#174; for OpenText Content Server SharePoint Connector lets workers on SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013 use Brava to access files stored in OpenText Content Server and in SharePoint, offering these benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Workers continue using the SharePoint interface they're familiar with, yet use Brava to collaborate on documents with coworkers across the enterprise.
            
				Organizations take full advantage of the investment that they made in Brava for OpenText Content Server by giving SharePoint users full access to the universal viewing, annotation and redaction capabilities that Brava provides.
            
				Workers across the organization can use Brava to access practically any file in OpenText Content Server, reducing the number of content silos used throughout the enterprise, simplifying document management, and reducing version control and records management issues.
			&lt;p&gt;The recently updated Brava connector integrates to OpenText Application Governance and Archiving version 10.5 for SharePoint 2010 and version 10.6 for SharePoint 2013. Read our product sheet (http://www.infograph.com/sites/default/files/BravaOT_SP_Connector.pdf) for details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With this SharePoint connector, workers in a mixed-platform environment can all have access to the same powerful collaboration tools that Brava provides," said IGC CEO Gary Heath.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in federal court on Tuesday, saying the agency owes it more than $1 billion in compensation for not assuming legal claims arising from its acquisition of Washington Mutual's assets after its 2008 implosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bought Washington Mutual's banking operations in an FDIC-arranged deal at the height of the financial crisis, a little more than a week after Merrill Lynch agreed to sell itself to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the deal, an FDIC receivership "broadly agreed to indemnify JPMC both for liabilities JPMC did not assume and for numerous other matters," the bank claimed in the 24-page lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are promises that the FDIC made to JPMC to induce JPMC to enter into the...agreement when WMB failed in September 2008, in the largest bank failure in this nation's history," the lawsuit states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank accused the FDIC of breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, while seeking declaratory judgments that the agency is obligated to compensate the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit states that JPMorgan seeks to recover "substantially in excess of a billion dollars of indemnification," and that $2.75 billion of assets it says remain in the Washington Mutual receivership "should be sufficient" to satisfy its claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank claims it is entitled to compensation from settlement amounts it paid to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stemming from bad loans they bought from Washington Mutual, numerous lawsuits that allege that Washington Mutual misled investors in residential mortgage-backed securities, and claims by various state taxing authorities seeking to recover Washington Mutual tax obligations, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which had agreed to maintain Washington Mutual's documents, is also seeking compensation for costs incurred producing "many millions of pages" of documents in these and other cases, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for the FDIC and JPMorgan declined to comment Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases is JPMorgan Chase Bank National Association v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 13-cv-01997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bernard Vaughan; Editing by Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

stake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Mitsui will take about 10 pct of TonenGeneral from
ExxonMobil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on
Wednesday cut its stake in Japan's second-biggest refiner,
further reducing its downstream presence in the world's
third-biggest economy, amid a rejig in the country's refining
industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon will sell a 10 percent interest in TonenGeneral Sekiyu
KK to trading house Mitsui &amp; Co as part of
TonenGeneral's takeover of a small oil products retailer, the
Japanese refiner said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale comes almost two years after Exxon cut its
controlling stake in TonenGeneral as part of a strategy of
scaling back on downstream activities, such as crude processing
and oil product sales, to focus on its more lucrative upstream
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon is also reducing its presence in an industry that is
realigning, with oil firms cut refining capacity to offset
shrinking demand from a declining population and shifting to
technology that is more energy efficient and environmentally
friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TonenGeneral will buy oil products retailer Mitsui Oil Co.,
a unit of Mitsui, for 24.9 billion yen ($242.4 million), the
companies said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the deal, the Japanese refiner will take the 89.93
percent share that Mitsui holds in Mitsui Oil Co, and aims to
acquire additional shares to lift its stake to about 95 percent
by the end of March 2014, the refiner said in a filing with the
stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Mitsui will take a 9.99 interest in terms of
voting rights in TonenGeneral, which ranks only behind JX
Holdings Inc in terms of refining capacity in Japan,
from Exxon for 33.6 billion yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both transactions are schedule to be completed on Feb. 4,
2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil currently holds a 22.21 percent share in terms of
voting rights in TonenGeneral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the transaction, TonenGeneral will also get the
50 percent stake from Mitsui Oil that it does not already own in
Kyokuto Petroleum Industries, which operates a 175,000 barrels
per day crude distillation unit (CDU) at its Chiba refinery,
east of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities was the lead
financial advisor on the deal, with SMBC Nikko Securities also
providing advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former stock broker pleaded guilty on Thursday to charges stemming from a conspiracy to engage in insider trading ahead of a 2009 acquisition by IBM Corp (IBM.N).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Weishaus, 33, told a federal judge in Manhattan that he had traded on a tip a friend got from his roommate that IBM had agreed to buy Chicago-based software company SPSS Inc before the $1.2 billion deal was publicly announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know my conduct was wrong, and I apologize to the court and my family, especially my mother and father," Weishaus said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plea came amid a crackdown on insider trading by New York federal prosecutors, who since October 2009 have secured convictions of 78 people. On Wednesday a jury convicted Michael Steinberg, a portfolio manager at Steven A. Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors accused of insider trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weishaus, whose case is unrelated to Steinberg's, was first indicted in November 2012 and faced a January 21 trial date. He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and one count of securities fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plea is subject to a cooperation agreement. In a statement, Preet Bharara, the Manhattan U.S. attorney, said the investigation is continuing. The indictment mentions two unnamed co-conspirators who also traded ahead of the IBM deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weishaus, a former employee at Westport, Connecticut-based Euro Pacific Capital Inc, was the last of three individuals charged in connection with an insider trading scheme that prosecutors say netted them and others more than $1 million in profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say the IBM deal details came from an associate at the New York law firm that represented the computer giant. While not named, Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore has said it was IBM's counsel in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Thursday's hearing, Weishaus said that after a friend also working at his firm gave him the tip, he bought SPSS call options and made a profit following the deal's announcement on July 28, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say the friend was Thomas Conradt, who himself traded in SPSS ahead of the deal's announcement based on tips from his roommate, Trent Martin, an Australian financial analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Condradt, like Weishaus, worked at Euro Pacific, while Martin at the time of the trading worked at Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (RBS.L), according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Condradt and Martin earlier this year pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the insider trading probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter set Weishaus's sentencing for April 25.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission charged two Seattle men on Thursday with 35 counts of illegally trading on private Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) information, which prosecutors said netted the pair more than $390,000 in illicit profits over an 18-month period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades 2 Classes of JPMC 2003-CIBC6
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded two classes and affirmed 10 classes of JP 
      Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMC) commercial 
      mortgage pass-through certificates series 2003-CIBC6. A detailed list of 
      rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades reflect an increase in Fitch expected losses primarily 
      associated with the specially serviced loans, in addition to adverse 
      selection due to increasing pool concentrations. Fitch modeled losses of 
      14.6% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool 
      balance total 2.8%, including $10.2 million (1% of the original pool 
      balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch has designated 12 loans 
      (48.9%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes five specially 
      serviced assets (17.2%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the December 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 87.4% to $133.8 million from $1.06 
      billion at issuance. There are 24 of the original 129 loans remaining in 
      the transaction. Per the servicer reporting, three loans (6.8% of the 
      pool) are defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting class NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is secured by a 102,310 
      square foot (SF) suburban office property located in Cherry Hill, NJ 
      (5.6% of the pool). The property experienced cash flow issues when its 
      largest tenant, Campbell Soup Co. (previously 30% of the net rentable 
      area [NRA]), vacated at its February 2013 and May 2013 lease 
      expirations. The loan transferred to special servicing in January 2013 
      for imminent maturity default, followed shortly thereafter by the 
      maturity of the loan in May 2013 without repayment. A receiver was 
      appointed in July 2013, and the lender had completed foreclosure in 
      September 2013. Occupancy reported at 46% as of September 2013. The 
      servicer is working to lease up the vacant space and stabilize the 
      property.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is secured by a 231,242 
      SF suburban office building located in Southfield, MI (5%). The loan 
      transferred to special servicing in March 2013 for imminent maturity 
      default, followed shortly thereafter by the maturity of the loan in May 
      2013 without repayment. The servicer had reported that the borrower 
      indicated difficulty in obtaining take-out financing due to the 
      property's low occupancy, currently at 74%, as well as poor market 
      conditions for Detroit. The servicer is pursuing foreclosure as well as 
      evaluating borrower proposals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is secured by a 
      portfolio Colorado mobile home parks. Originally secured by three parks 
      totaling 232 units, the subject loan transferred to special servicing in 
      January 2011 due to payment default. One of the parks located in Fort 
      Morgan, CO (previously 80 units; 27% of allocated balance) was 
      completely shut down as of January 2013 due to water safety issues. The 
      servicer continues to pursue the guarantor for deficiency claims under 
      the environmental indemnity. The servicer had completed foreclosure of 
      the remaining two properties in June 2013, and is currently marketing 
      them for sale. The September 2013 rent rolls reported the combined 
      occupancy at 72% for the remaining properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlooks on classes B through G remain Stable due to sufficient 
      credit enhancement and continued pay down. The Negative Outlooks on 
      classes H and J reflects the concentrated nature of the remaining pool 
      and continued risk of adverse selection, in addition to the thin 
      supporting tranches, which makes these bonds susceptible to downgrade 
      should actual losses exceed Fitch expectations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$7.8 million class K to 'CCCsf' from 'Bsf'; RE 100%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.2 million class L to 'CCsf' from 'CCCsf'; RE 15%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$4.7 million class B at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$32.5 million class C at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Human disconnect, social isolation and the transition to an increasingly digital era come crashing together in "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," actor-director Ben Stiller's personal take on a classic story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Walter Mitty," out in theaters on Christmas Day, finds Stiller not just reimagining the character made famous from author James Thurber's 1939 short story of the same name in The New Yorker magazine, but redefining what Walter Mitty has come to represent in popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Mitty is described by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as "a commonplace unadventurous person who seeks escape from reality through daydreaming," and is often used to describe people who imagine themselves greater than they are in reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stiller's Walter Mitty is different. A middle-aged man trapped by financial responsibility, Walter is a photo archivist at the dwindling Life magazine, a job that is being replaced by machines. Shy, sheltered and reserved, he is isolated from the environment around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(He's not) some kind of an oddball or loner or nerd, but just a regular guy who has a lot of potential and hadn't figured out a way to unlock it," Stiller told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movie blurs in and out of Walter's imagination as his daydreams take him into new worlds and personas, be it the rugged explorer seducing his crush Cheryl, played by Kristen Wiig, or jumping into a fiery apartment to save trapped residents. But as he breaks out of social isolation and makes real human connections, Walter finds himself living a real life far greater than his imagination could conjure up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stiller, 48, who has built up a body of directorial works from 1994's dark comedy "Reality Bites," 2001's goofball modeling parody "Zoolander," and 2008's farcical action-movie send-up, "Tropic Thunder," said "Mitty" marks a new chapter in his catalog of works, and one that resonates closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was more of an experience that I have been feeling in my life, maybe generationally, having grown up and experienced the world pre-computers," Stiller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seeing the whole (digital) transition, to me what's getting left in the wake of that are the real things, the tangible things that go away when everything becomes digital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director added that even the comedic tone of "Walter Mitty" is different from his previous works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The film is a lot less cynical than other movies I've made in terms of its comedic tone, and I think that for me was uncharted territory," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMBRACING LIFE IN A DIGITAL AGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caught up in a society shifting from the analog to the digital age, Walter is tasked with recovering the photograph that will appear on the cover of the final Life magazine as the publication is downsized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His journey to track down the photo, shot on film by maverick photographer Sean O'Connell, played by Sean Penn, sees Walter finally letting go of Life magazine and embracing life, a motto echoed by the publication renowned for capturing iconic and arresting photographs, which folded in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A real Life magazine from 1945 is a piece of history; you're holding something that actually existed back then.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Dec 19 (Reuters) - Human disconnect, social
isolation and the transition to an increasingly digital era come

things that go away when everything becomes digital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director added that even the comedic tone of "Walter
Mitty" is different from his previous works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The film is a lot less cynical than other movies I've made

digital age, Walter is tasked with recovering the photograph
that will appear on the cover of the final Life magazine as the
publication is downsized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His journey to track down the photo, shot on film by
maverick photographer Sean O'Connell, played by Sean Penn, sees
Walter finally letting go of Life magazine and embracing life, a
motto echoed by the publication renowned for capturing iconic
and arresting photographs, which folded in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A real Life magazine from 1945 is a piece of history;

specific with how we showed the fantasies and how visually they
related to the real world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" in a contemporary
world helped Stiller wrap cultural touchstones such as eHarmony
online dating or Instagram into the comedy, which the director
hoped will make the story more real for audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I would hope for is that it's more than just a
diversion, that it somehow connects to something emotionally
with people on some level," the director said.

      Fitch Affirms Microsoft at 'AA+'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed Microsoft Corp.'s (Microsoft) ratings as 
      follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'AA+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-Term IDR at 'F1+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper (CP) program at 'F1+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch also assigned an 'AA+' rating to Microsoft's $1.3 billion 
      revolving credit facility (RCF), which serves as a backstop for the 
      company's $1.3 billion CP program. Approximately $25 billion of debt is 
      affected by Fitch's action, including Microsoft's issuance of $8 billion 
      of senior notes on Dec. 6, 2013 and $1.3 billion RCF.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings and Stable Outlook reflect Microsoft's:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Strong core software position: Microsoft Windows remains the primary 
      operating system (OS) for servers and PCs, despite lackluster adoption 
      of Windows 8 for PCs to date. Windows has approximately 90% share of the 
      PC market and Windows-based servers accounted for 50% of total server 
      revenue in the third quarter of 2013, according to IDC. Microsoft's 
      Office is also the leading software productivity suite, particularly in 
      the commercial market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Very strong liquidity: Liquidity is supported by nearly $81 billion in 
      cash and short-term (ST) investments (94% offshore) as of Sept. 30, 2013 
      and consistent free cash flow (FCF), which totaled nearly $16 billion in 
      the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch projects Microsoft's FCF (post-dividends) will decline to $13 
      billion in fiscal 2014 (ends June 30) compared with $17 billion in 
      fiscal 2013. The decline primarily reflects a 55% increase in capital 
      expenditures to $6.5 billion, equivalent to 3x the amount spent in 
      fiscal 2012, for datacenters to support Microsoft's various cloud 
      initiatives, including Azure and Office 365.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Material Recurring Revenue: Approximately 50% of Microsoft's revenue 
      base is recurring from long-term commercial licensing agreements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Highly Diversified Revenue Base: Microsoft's revenue base is 
      diversified by end market with commercial and consumers representing 
      53.4% and 46.6% of total revenue, respectively, but the Devices and 
      Consumer segment accounted for only 30% of segment operating profit, 
      excluding corporate and other. The greater operating profit from the 
      commercial business is significant because Fitch views Microsoft's 
      consumer market as less defensible to competition from Apple and Google 
      than the commercial business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's credit concerns center on:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Reliance on Windows and Office for Vast Majority of FCF: In aggregate, 
      these products accounted for 77% of total operating income, excluding 
      unallocated corporate level expenses. However, strong growth and margin 
      expansion in the Server and Tools business has reduced the contribution 
      of Windows and Office from a four-year high of nearly 89%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Competitive Threats to Core Business: Microsoft Windows competes with 
      free or lower cost operating systems from Google in the tablet and 
      smartphone markets (Android - 80% smartphone share) and in the notebook 
      PC market (Chrome), primarily in the consumer and education markets, as 
      traditional PC companies diversify their OS offerings beyond Windows in 
      part due to Microsoft's release of its Surface tablet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Google Apps, an alternative to Microsoft's Office productivity suite, is 
      available for free to consumers, supported by advertising revenue. 
      Google Apps for government, education and business costs less than 
      Office for commercial users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Low Share of Tablets and Smartphones: Windows share of smartphone and 
      tablet markets is increasing but remains below 5% in both markets, which 
      are growing well in excess of the traditional PC market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Weak Consumer PC Demand: Windows and Office, with the exception of 
      Office 365 (SaaS), are being pressured by weak consumer PC demand, which 
      reflects an extended PC replacement cycle due to the popularity of 
      tablets and smartphones and consumer substitution of tablets in lieu of 
      traditional PCs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Pressure to Issue Debt: Significant dividend and share repurchase 
      programs are likely to continue pressuring the company to issue debt to 
      avoid repatriation of foreign earnings, which represent the majority of 
      total annual FCF.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
NEW YORK, December 19 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed
Microsoft Corp.'s 
(Microsoft) ratings as follows: 
--Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA+';
--Senior unsecured debt at 'AA+';
--Short-Term IDR at 'F1+';
--Commercial paper (CP) program at 'F1+'.
The Rating Outlook is Stable. 
Fitch also assigned an 'AA+' rating to Microsoft's $1.3 billion
revolving credit 
facility (RCF), which serves as a backstop for the company's
$1.3 billion CP 
program. Approximately $25 billion of debt is affected by
Fitch's action, 
including Microsoft's issuance of $8 billion of senior notes on
Dec. 6, 2013 and 
$1.3 billion RCF.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The ratings and Stable Outlook reflect Microsoft's:
--Strong core software position: Microsoft Windows remains the
primary operating 
system (OS) for servers and PCs, despite lackluster adoption of
Windows 8 for 
PCs to date. Windows has approximately 90% share of the PC
market and 
Windows-based servers accounted for 50% of total server revenue
in the third 
quarter of 2013, according to IDC. Microsoft's Office is also
the leading 
software productivity suite, particularly in the commercial
market. 
--Very strong liquidity: Liquidity is supported by nearly $81
billion in cash 
and short-term (ST) investments (94% offshore) as of Sept. 30,
2013 and 
consistent free cash flow (FCF), which totaled nearly $16
billion in the latest 
12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2013. 
Fitch projects Microsoft's FCF (post-dividends) will decline to
$13 billion in 
fiscal 2014 (ends June 30) compared with $17 billion in fiscal
2013. The decline 
primarily reflects a 55% increase in capital expenditures to
$6.5 billion, 
equivalent to 3x the amount spent in fiscal 2012, for
datacenters to support 
Microsoft's various cloud initiatives, including Azure and
Office 365. 
--Material Recurring Revenue: Approximately 50% of Microsoft's
revenue base is 
recurring from long-term commercial licensing agreements.
--Highly Diversified Revenue Base: Microsoft's revenue base is
diversified by 
end market with commercial and consumers representing 53.4% and
46.6% of total 
revenue, respectively, but the Devices and Consumer segment
accounted for only 
30% of segment operating profit, excluding corporate and other.
The greater 
operating profit from the commercial business is significant
because Fitch views 
Microsoft's consumer market as less defensible to competition
from Apple and 
Google than the commercial business. 
Fitch's credit concerns center on:
--Reliance on Windows and Office for Vast Majority of FCF: In
aggregate, these 
products accounted for 77% of total operating income, excluding
unallocated 
corporate level expenses. However, strong growth and margin
expansion in the 
Server and Tools business has reduced the contribution of
Windows and Office 
from a four-year high of nearly 89%. 
--Competitive Threats to Core Business: Microsoft Windows
competes with free or 
lower cost operating systems from Google in the tablet and
smartphone markets 
(Android - 80% smartphone share) and in the notebook PC market
(Chrome), 
primarily in the consumer and education markets, as traditional
PC companies 
diversify their OS offerings beyond Windows in part due to
Microsoft's release 
of its Surface tablet. 
Google Apps, an alternative to Microsoft's Office productivity
suite, is 
available for free to consumers, supported by advertising
revenue. Google Apps 
for government, education and business costs less than Office
for commercial 
users. 
--Low Share of Tablets and Smartphones: Windows share of
smartphone and tablet 
markets is increasing but remains below 5% in both markets,
which are growing 
well in excess of the traditional PC market. 
--Weak Consumer PC Demand: Windows and Office, with the
exception of Office 365 
(SaaS), are being pressured by weak consumer PC demand, which
reflects an 
extended PC replacement cycle due to the popularity of tablets
and smartphones 
and consumer substitution of tablets in lieu of traditional PCs.
--Pressure to Issue Debt: Significant dividend and share
repurchase programs are 
likely to continue pressuring the company to issue debt to avoid
repatriation of 
foreign earnings, which represent the majority of total annual
FCF.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Negative: Future developments that may, individually or
collectively, lead to 
negative rating action include:
--Strong commercial adoption of the public cloud and/or
open-sourced software 
materially reduces demand for key Microsoft products, including
Windows Server, 
SQL Server, System Center and others, pressuring overall
financial results; 
--Penetration of alternative operating system's such as Chrome
OS in the PC 
market and/or market share gains by Apple;
--Greater acceptance of cheaper software applications that
compete with 
Microsoft Office such as Google Apps. 
Positive: Upside movement on the ratings is unlikely at this
time.

      Walton Signs Agreements with Mid-Atlantic Builders and Haverford Homes 
      for Westphalia Town Center
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Homebuilders to Build Remaining 204 of 348 Townhomes During Phase I
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walton Group of Companies (Walton), a family-owned, real estate 
      investment, planning, and development group in Virginia and Maryland, 
      with U.S. headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, announced today that it 
      has entered into agreements with Mid-Atlantic Builders and Haverford 
      Homes to build townhomes at Westphalia Town Center in Upper Marlboro, 
      Maryland.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each builder purchased 102 townhome lots that together commit the 
      remaining 204 of 348 lots. Walton&#8217;s first builder agreement was made 
      with NVR, Inc for 144 lots and the latest agreements with Mid-Atlantic 
      Builders and Haverford Homes complete Phase 1 with 100% commitment for 
      348 homes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At the outset, Walton committed to offering a variety of residential 
      properties at Westphalia Town Center. With the addition of Mid-Atlantic 
      Builders and Haverford Homes, we have followed through on that 
      commitment,&#8221; said John Vick, President of Walton Development  
      Management, Northeast USA. &#8220;All three of our builders are experienced in 
      delivering quality homes to residents of Prince George&#8217;s County. We are 
      pleased to bring them together in our community.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 479-acre Westphalia Town Center is Walton&#8217;s first development in 
      Maryland and one of the largest commercial real estate developments in 
      Prince George&#8217;s County to date. Upon completion, Westphalia is expected 
      to offer diverse residential options, including single-family homes, 
      townhomes, and apartments. The development also will feature an 
      elementary school, fire and rescue facility, shopping and restaurants, 
      commercial office space, as well as a hotel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Construction at Westphalia began earlier this summer following a 
      ground-breaking ceremony with Lt. Governor Anthony Brown and County 
      Executive Rushern L. Baker III. Phase I work is projected to be 
      completed in early 2014. Westphalia Town Center is expected to deliver a 
      significant economic boost to the region, with a projected 15,000 
      permanent office and retail jobs, as well as $21 million in county taxes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton manages approximately 3,500 acres of land in Maryland, including 
      2,900 acres in Prince George&#8217;s County. Construction-related spending to 
      completely develop Walton&#8217;s Prince George&#8217;s County holdings is estimated 
      to be more than $1.3 billion and is estimated to directly support an 
      annual average of more than 900 jobs during the construction period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Parallels Joins Microsoft Server Virtualization Validation Program to 
      Help Microsoft Customers Using Parallels Hypervisor
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Parallels works with Microsoft to validate its hypervisor and offer 
      cooperative technical support to Microsoft customers virtualizing with 
      Parallels
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Parallels, 
      a leading hosting and cloud services enablement provider, announced 
      Microsoft Corp. has validated the Parallels Hypervisor under the 
      Microsoft Server Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP). With the SVVP 
      validation, Parallels customers who run Parallels Hypervisor on Windows 
      Server will have access to cooperative support from Microsoft and 
      Parallels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft&#8217;s SVVP Program enables Parallels and other software providers 
      to validate machine virtualization products so that Microsoft customers 
      running instances of Windows Server they have acquired and licensed from 
      Microsoft directly can receive technical support for Windows Server in 
      virtualized environments. With the SVVP validation in place, Microsoft 
      can cooperate with Parallels to provide technical support to customers 
      running Windows Server together with Parallels Hypervisor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our Service Providers and their customers rely on Parallels 
      virtualization and Windows Server operating systems and Microsoft Server 
      applications to run their businesses,&#8221; said John Zanni, chief marketing 
      officer, Service Provider, Parallels. &#8220;Parallels will continue to 
      provide professional product support to our Service Providers, who will 
      continue to support their customers. In addition, Parallels and 
      Microsoft are working to help ensure that Microsoft customers that have 
      Windows Server instances and Microsoft applications running on Parallels 
      hypervisor will receive cooperative support from both Microsoft and 
      Parallels.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft is committed to serving our customers on our Windows Server 
      with Hyper-V platform, as well as supporting our customers who run 
      Microsoft operating systems and applications on third-party hypervisors 
      that have been validated through the SVVP program,&#8221; said Mike Schutz, 
      General Manager, Server and Tools Marketing, Microsoft. &#8220;Validating the 
      Parallels hypervisor allows us to work together to ensure that as 
      Parallels continues to support its Service Provider customers, we can 
      cooperate with Parallels to ensure top notch support for licensed 
      Microsoft guest OSs.&#8221;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				For 2013, CCE affirms comparable earnings per diluted share at the

        range of 2&#189; to 3 times.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Regulatory News:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE/Euronext Paris: CCE) today affirmed diluted 
      earnings per share guidance for full-year 2013 at the high end of the 
      previously stated range of $2.45 to $2.50, including a positive 2 
      percent currency impact at recent rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Including this currency impact, CCE continues to expect comparable 
      full-year net sales and operating income to grow in a low single-digit 
      range versus prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company expects 2013 free cash flow of approximately $500 million 
      after including a year-over-year increase in cash restructuring expenses 
      in a range of $100 million to $125 million. Capital expenditures are 
      expected to be in a range of $300 million to $325 million. Weighted 
      average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent and the 
      comparable effective tax rate for 2013 is expected to be in a range of 
      26 percent to 27 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are managing each element of our business to drive efficiency and 
      effectiveness as we continue to work through ongoing challenging 
      marketplace and macroeconomic conditions,&#8221; said John F. Brock, chairman 
      and chief executive officer. &#8220;We remain focused on our most important 
      objective &#8211; creating increased value for our shareowners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While we have seen some operating headwinds moderate, we expect 
      underlying challenges to continue and impact growth in 2014. As a 
      result, our expectations for next year are modestly below our long-term 
      operating growth targets,&#8221; Mr. Brock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;However, we remain confident that over time, the combination of our 
      global operating framework, our successful brands, and our focus on 
      operational excellence and customer value creation will continue to 
      create sustained opportunities for meaningful growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SHARE REPURCHASE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE began a $1.5 billion share repurchase program in January 2013 and 
      will repurchase approximately $1 billion of its shares this year. The 
      Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase 
      program &#8211; this is the fourth program since the 2010 transaction that 
      created the new CCE. The company plans approximately $800 million in 
      repurchases in 2014. These plans may be adjusted depending on economic, 
      operating, or other factors, including acquisition opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2014 OPERATING OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 2014, CCE expects earnings per diluted share to grow approximately 
      10 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Although too 
      early to predict the impact, based on recent rates, currency translation 
      would benefit full-year 2014 earnings per share in a range of 3 percent 
      to 4 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net sales are expected to grow in a low single-digit range and operating 
      income is expected to grow in a mid-single-digit range. This outlook is 
      comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company also expects 2014 free cash flow in a range of $600 million 
      to $650 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 
      $350 million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be 
      approximately 3 percent and the comparable effective tax rate for 2014 
      is expected to be in a range of 26 percent to 28 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With an outlook for modest category growth in 2014, our business plan 
      is focused on creating additional marketplace opportunities and 
      improving our foundation for long-term growth,&#8221; said Hubert Patricot, 
      executive vice president and president, European Group. &#8220;We are 
      implementing strategies focused in three key areas &#8211; building on our 
      core strengths, enhancing our focus on high growth brands and segments, 
      and investing in our future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For example, we will build our marketing initiatives to support our 
      core brands by continuing our successful Share a Coke campaign, seizing 
      the opportunities of the 2014 World Cup, and enhancing our marketing 
      programs for summer and the holidays.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We will also further develop our Coke Zero brand and our successful 
      energy portfolio with brand extensions, promotions, and new packaging,&#8221; 
      Mr. Patricot said. &#8220;And we will build for the future, utilizing 
      initiatives such as the introduction of the 1.75 liter bottle in Great 
      Britain as the new primary large PET package.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Combined with effectiveness programs such as Ownership Cost Management 
      and the reorganization of our business in Norway, these efforts are the 
      foundation of our work to deliver sustained operating growth that will 
      drive continued increases in shareowner value,&#8221; Mr. Patricot said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. Provides Business 
      Update and 2014 Guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				For 2013, CCE affirms comparable earnings per diluted share at the 
        high end of a range of $2.45 to $2.50, which includes a currency 
        benefit of approximately 2 percent at recent rates.
			
			
				CCE will repurchase approximately $1 billion of its shares in 2013 
        and expects year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio to be within its 
        long-term range of 2&#189; to 3 times.
			
			
				Board of Directors has authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase 
        program; CCE expects 2014 share repurchases of approximately $800 
        million and year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio within its long-term 
        range of 2&#189; to 3 times.
			
			
				2014 comparable and currency neutral earnings per diluted share are 
        expected to grow approximately 10 percent.
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE/Euronext Paris: CCE) today affirmed diluted 
      earnings per share guidance for full-year 2013 at the high end of the 
      previously stated range of $2.45 to $2.50, including a positive 2 
      percent currency impact at recent rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Including this currency impact, CCE continues to expect comparable 
      full-year net sales and operating income to grow in a low single-digit 
      range versus prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company expects 2013 free cash flow of approximately $500 million 
      after including a year-over-year increase in cash restructuring expenses 
      in a range of $100 million to $125 million. Capital expenditures are 
      expected to be in a range of $300 million to $325 million. Weighted 
      average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent and the 
      comparable effective tax rate for 2013 is expected to be in a range of 
      26 percent to 27 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are managing each element of our business to drive efficiency and 
      effectiveness as we continue to work through ongoing challenging 
      marketplace and macroeconomic conditions,&#8221; said John F. Brock, chairman 
      and chief executive officer. &#8220;We remain focused on our most important 
      objective &#8211; creating increased value for our shareowners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While we have seen some operating headwinds moderate, we expect 
      underlying challenges to continue and impact growth in 2014. As a 
      result, our expectations for next year are modestly below our long-term 
      operating growth targets,&#8221; Mr. Brock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;However, we remain confident that over time, the combination of our 
      global operating framework, our successful brands, and our focus on 
      operational excellence and customer value creation will continue to 
      create sustained opportunities for meaningful growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SHARE REPURCHASE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE began a $1.5 billion share repurchase program in January 2013 and 
      will repurchase approximately $1 billion of its shares this year. The 
      Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase 
      program &#8211; this is the fourth program since the 2010 transaction that 
      created the new CCE. The company plans approximately $800 million in 
      repurchases in 2014. These plans may be adjusted depending on economic, 
      operating, or other factors, including acquisition opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2014 OPERATING OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 2014, CCE expects earnings per diluted share to grow approximately 
      10 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Although too 
      early to predict the impact, based on recent rates, currency translation 
      would benefit full-year 2014 earnings per share in a range of 3 percent 
      to 4 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net sales are expected to grow in a low single-digit range and operating 
      income is expected to grow in a mid-single-digit range. This outlook is 
      comparable and currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company also expects 2014 free cash flow in a range of $600 million 
      to $650 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 
      $350 million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be 
      approximately 3 percent and the comparable effective tax rate for 2014 
      is expected to be in a range of 26 percent to 28 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With an outlook for modest category growth in 2014, our business plan 
      is focused on creating additional marketplace opportunities and 
      improving our foundation for long-term growth,&#8221; said Hubert Patricot, 
      executive vice president and president, European Group. &#8220;We are 
      implementing strategies focused in three key areas &#8211; building on our 
      core strengths, enhancing our focus on high growth brands and segments, 
      and investing in our future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For example, we will build our marketing initiatives to support our 
      core brands by continuing our successful Share a Coke campaign, seizing 
      the opportunities of the 2014 World Cup, and enhancing our marketing 
      programs for summer and the holidays.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We will also further develop our Coke Zero brand and our successful 
      energy portfolio with brand extensions, promotions, and new packaging,&#8221; 
      Mr. Patricot said. &#8220;And we will build for the future, utilizing 
      initiatives such as the introduction of the 1.75 liter bottle in Great 
      Britain as the new primary large PET package.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Combined with effectiveness programs such as Ownership Cost Management 
      and the reorganization of our business in Norway, these efforts are the 
      foundation of our work to deliver sustained operating growth that will 
      drive continued increases in shareowner value,&#8221; Mr. Patricot said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DURHAM, N.C., Dec. 19, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chimerix, Inc. (Nasdaq:CMRX), a biopharmaceutical company developing novel, oral antivirals in areas of high unmet medical need, today announced that Kenneth I. Moch, President and CEO of Chimerix, will present at the 32nd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Thursday, January 16, 2014 at 12:30pm PST (3:30pm EST) at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	A live audio webcast of the presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of Chimerix's website at http://ir.chimerix.com/events.cfm, where it will be archived for 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Brincidofovir (CMX001)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Chimerix's lead product candidate, brincidofovir (CMX001), is an oral nucleotide analog that has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity against all five families of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses that affect humans, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus (AdV), BK virus (BKV) and herpes simplex viruses. Brincidofovir has a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with no evidence of kidney or bone marrow toxicity in nearly 900 patients dosed with brincidofovir to date. Chimerix believes that brincidofovir has the potential to be the first broad-spectrum antiviral for the prevention and treatment of clinically significant infections and diseases caused by dsDNA viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Following positive Phase 2 results in CMV, in the third quarter of 2013 Chimerix initiated the Phase 3 SUPPRESS trial which will support Chimerix's initial regulatory submission for prevention of CMV infection in adult hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. In September 2013, data from this Phase 2 trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (N Engl J Med 369:1227-36). Chimerix recently presented results from its Phase 2 trial in AdV, an often-fatal infection with no approved treatment. A brincidofovir dose of 100 mg twice weekly demonstrated a potent antiviral effect on levels of AdV in the blood, and a numeric decrease in overall mortality. Chimerix continues to work with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to develop brincidofovir as a medical countermeasure against smallpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About the Phase 3 SUPPRESS Trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	SUPPRESS is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of brincidofovir for the prevention of CMV infection versus a placebo control, as no therapy is currently approved for the prevention of CMV in HCT recipients. The primary endpoint for SUPPRESS is the rate of clinically significant CMV infection through the first 24 weeks post-transplant. The trial is powered to detect a relative 50% decrease in clinically significant CMV infection in subjects receiving brincidofovir versus those receiving placebo. Secondary endpoints in the SUPPRESS trial include clinical and virologic evidence of dsDNA viral infections, including AdV, BKV and other herpes viruses such as HHV-6 and varicella zoster virus that contribute to morbidity and mortality in the first year following HCT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	SUPPRESS is anticipated to enroll approximately 450 HCT recipients who are at increased risk of CMV infection, with approximately 300 subjects receiving 100 mg twice weekly brincidofovir and 150 receiving placebo (2-to-1 ratio). &#160;Approximately 40 transplant centers will participate in SUPPRESS. &#160;Dosing of study drug will begin shortly after subjects receive their transplant, and will not require evidence of stem cell "engraftment" (evidence of production of blood cells by the new transplant), a safety precaution incorporated in the Phase 2 trial of brincidofovir and other recent trials of investigational antivirals for CMV prevention. &#160;Enrolled subjects will continue on brincidofovir or placebo through Week 14 post-transplant, the period of highest risk for viral reactivation. &#160;Subjects will continue to be monitored for evidence of CMV and other dsDNA viral infections through Week 24 post-transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Data from SUPPRESS are anticipated in mid-2015 and, if positive, may support Accelerated Approval of brincidofovir for the prevention of CMV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Double-Stranded DNA (dsDNA) Viruses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	CMV is a member of the herpes virus family and is the most common infectious pathogen in transplant recipients. &#160;A majority of adults in the US have been exposed to CMV, generally in childhood, with lifelong viral latency established following resolution. &#160;In healthy individuals with a functioning immune system, CMV remains dormant throughout life. &#160;A functioning immune system protects an infected individual against future exposure to CMV but does not clear the virus from their body. &#160;In immunocompromised individuals with weakened immune systems, such as transplant recipients, CMV often reactivates during the post-transplant period when the immune system is rebuilding itself. &#160;No therapies are approved for the prevention of CMV in HCT recipients. &#160;Currently available systemic anti-CMV agents can be effective against CMV; however, their use is limited by significant toxicities, including bone marrow suppression and renal impairment, and these therapies are only approved for certain solid organ transplant patient populations. &#160;CMV infection is known to correlate with progression to CMV disease and death. &#160;CMV itself is immunosuppressive and reactivation of the virus can predispose a patient to other opportunistic viral infections in addition to fungal and bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Chimerix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Chimerix is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing novel, oral antivirals in areas of high unmet medical need.&#160;Chimerix's proprietary technology has given rise to two clinical-stage nucleotide analog lipid-conjugates, brincidofovir (CMX001) and CMX157, which have demonstrated the potential for enhanced activity and safety in convenient, orally administered dosing regimens. &#160;Chimerix's lead product candidate, brincidofovir, is an oral nucleotide analog that has shown broad-spectrum activity against all five families of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses that affect humans, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, BK virus and herpes simplex viruses.&#160;In the third quarter of 2013, Chimerix initiated the Phase 3 SUPPRESS trial of brincidofovir for the prevention of CMV infection in adult hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, also known as bone marrow transplants. &#160;Brincidofovir has received Fast Track designation by the FDA, and the Phase 3 data, if positive, may support Accelerated Approval of brincidofovir for the prevention of CMV infection in adult HCT recipients. &#160;Chimerix continues to work with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to development brincidofovir as a medical countermeasure against smallpox. &#160;Chimerix's second product candidate, CMX157, an oral nucleotide analog for treatment of HIV infection, was licensed to Merck in July 2012. &#160;For further information, please visit Chimerix's website, www.chimerix.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLEVELAND, Dec. 19, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Athersys, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATHX) today announced that Pfizer Inc. has completed patient enrollment of a Phase II clinical study involving administration of Athersys' MultiStem&#174; cell therapy to ulcerative colitis patients as part of a 2009 collaboration agreement between Athersys and Pfizer. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of MultiStem therapy in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Athersys expects initial results from the study to be disclosed in the second quarter of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"With enrollment now completed, we and our partner, Pfizer, look forward to the results from this study," commented Dr. John Harrington, Chief Scientific Officer at Athersys. "Despite progress in recent years, there remains a substantial need for new and improved treatments for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, especially among patients with more advanced disease.&#160;Based upon MultiStem's preclinical safety and efficacy profile and novel mechanisms of action, we believe that MultiStem could provide meaningful benefit to these patients.&#160;The results from this study should provide significant insight into the potential for MultiStem therapy for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions that affect the colon and small intestine, typically resulting in severe abdominal pain, weight loss, vomiting and diarrhea.&#160;The most common IBD conditions include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which are estimated to affect four million people or more in the United States, the major European markets and Japan.&#160;IBD can be a severely debilitating condition, and advanced cases may require surgery to remove the affected region of the bowel, and may also require temporary or permanent colostomy or ileostomy.&#160;In many cases, surgery does not achieve a permanent or durable cure, and patients suffer a return of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial is being conducted by Pfizer at sites in the United States, Canada and Europe.&#160;Subjects enrolled in the study have received either MultiStem treatment or placebo initially, followed by a second round of treatment with MultiStem cells or placebo at eight weeks, resulting in two groups for evaluation through eight weeks and four groups for evaluation through 16 weeks and beyond.&#160;The primary endpoints for the study include incidence and severity of adverse events over 16 weeks, change in endoscopic score (as measured by modified Baron score) at week eight, and changes in the Mayo rectal bleeding sub-score at weeks four and eight.&#160;Additionally, there are multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints evaluating disease indicators and markers over 16 weeks and through the entire study period.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Athersys expects that study data will be available in the second quarter 2014 in two parts.&#160;The first&#160;results, anticipated to be available in April or May, will describe the primary endpoints and certain secondary and exploratory endpoints for all subjects through eight weeks following the initial treatment.&#160;The second results, expected later in the second quarter, will cover additional data for subjects through 16 weeks following treatment.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About MultiStem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	MultiStem cell therapy is a patented regenerative medicine product that has shown the ability to promote tissue repair and healing in a variety of ways, such as through the production of multiple therapeutic factors produced in response to signals of inflammation and tissue damage.&#160;MultiStem has demonstrated therapeutic potential for the treatment of inflammatory and immune disorders, neurological conditions, and cardiovascular disease, as well as other areas.&#160;It represents a unique "off-the-shelf" stem cell product that can be manufactured in a scalable manner, may be stored for years in frozen form, and is administered without tissue matching or the need for immune suppression.&#160;The product is extensively characterized for safety, consistency and potency.&#160;Athersys has forged a strategic partnership with Pfizer Inc. to develop MultiStem for treating inflammatory bowel disease, while independently evaluating it as a novel therapeutic approach for indications in the neurological, cardiovascular and transplant support areas, as well as other potential opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			Forward-Looking Statements &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the expected timetable for development of our product candidates, our growth strategy, and our future financial performance, including our operations, economic performance, financial condition, prospects, and other future events. We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by using such words as "anticipates," "believes," "can," "continue," "could," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "may," "plans," "potential," "should," "suggest," "will," or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and are largely based on our current expectations. A number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors could affect the accuracy of these statements. Some of the more significant known risks that we face that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by forward-looking statements are the risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of discovering, developing, and commercializing products that are safe and effective for use as human therapeutics, such as the uncertainty regarding market acceptance of our product candidates and our ability to generate revenues, including MultiStem for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, acute myocardial infarction, stroke and other disease indications, including lysosomal storage disorders, and the prevention of graft-versus-host disease. These risks may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to differ materially from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Other important factors to consider in evaluating our forward-looking statements include: our ability to raise additional capital; the timing of the results from Pfizer's Phase II clinical study involving MultiStem cell therapy to ulcerative colitis patients; final results from our MultiStem clinical trials; the possibility of delays in, adverse results of, and excessive costs of the development process; our ability to successfully initiate and complete clinical trials; changes in external market factors; changes in our industry's overall performance; changes in our business strategy; our ability to protect our intellectual property portfolio; our possible inability to realize commercially valuable discoveries in our collaborations with pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies; our ability to meet milestones under our collaboration agreements; our collaborators' ability to continue to fulfill their obligations under the terms of our collaboration agreements; the success of our efforts to enter into new strategic partnerships and advance our programs; our possible inability to execute our strategy due to changes in our industry or the economy generally; changes in productivity and reliability of suppliers; and the success of our competitors and the emergence of new competitors. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this press release, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: William (B.J.)

			Chevron Awards &#163;150 million U.K. Drilling Contract
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron North Sea Limited announced today that it has awarded a new &#163;150 
      million contract to Dolphin Drilling Limited, a subsidiary of Fred. 
      Olsen Energy ASA, for a 20 month multi-well drilling and completion 
      program across several of Chevron&#8217;s operations in the U.K. sector of the 
      North Sea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The contract is to provide drilling and completion operations using the 
      semi-submersible rig, the Blackford Dolphin, and includes a rig 
      refurbishment to upgrade the unit for North Sea activity work.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The drilling program is expected to commence in 2015 for an initial 
      period of 572 days. Chevron has an option to extend the drilling program 
      for a further one to two years.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co mailed incorrect replacements for payment cards to about 4,000 people for the state of Connecticut after personal data stored at the bank was accessed in a cyber attack this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank made the mistake as it tried to reissue Connecticut-branded cards to pay unemployment compensation and tax refunds for the state, according to an announcement from Connecticut Treasurer Denise Nappier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan notified the state of the error on Thursday, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nappier said: "This latest error heightens my concern about the company.

      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2007-LDP10; Maintains Negative Outlook on Super Sr 
      'AAA' Classes
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust, commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates, series 2007-LDP10 (JPMCC 2007-LDP10). A detailed list of 
      rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are due to the relatively stable performance of the 
      remaining pool that is in-line with Fitch's expectation at the last 
      rating action. Fitch modeled losses of 21.8% of the remaining pool; 
      expected losses on the original pool balance total 19%, including $182.3 
      million (3.4% of the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. 
      Fitch has designated 88 loans (56%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which 
      includes 29 specially serviced assets (24.5%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Negative Outlooks reflect the high concentration of specially 
      serviced assets and the uncertainty regarding their workouts and final 
      disposition. Distressed classes (those rated below 'B') may be subject 
      to further downgrades as additional losses are realized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the November 2013 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 28.6% to $3.8 billion from $5.3 
      billion at issuance. Three loans (1.7% of the pool) have been defeased. 
      As of the November 2013 remittance report, cumulative interest 
      shortfalls are currently affecting the junior 'AAA' classes through 
      class NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to modeled losses is the third largest loan, the 
      Skyline Portfolio (5.3% of the pool). The collateral consists of a 
      portfolio of eight office buildings totaling approximately 2.6 million 
      square feet (sf) located in Falls Church, VA. The loan was transferred 
      to special servicing in March 2012 for imminent default. The sponsor 
      cited the Base Realignment and Closure statute (BRAC) as contributing to 
      recent and upcoming vacancies at the properties. The pari passu loan was 
      modified in October 2013 with the $203.4 million pari passu portion in 
      the transaction split into a $105 million A-note and a $98.4 million 
      B-note. The loan maturity was extended to February 2022 with a one-year 
      extension option if certain performance metrics are attained.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to modeled losses is the Solana loan 
      (3.7%), the third largest specially serviced asset in the pool. The loan 
      was transferred to special servicing in March 2009 for imminent default. 
      The collateral is a large mixed-use development located in Westlake, TX 
      consisting of 11 office buildings, a retail center, a health club, and a 
      294-key Marriott hotel. This asset was identified as part of a 
      multi-asset marketing plan. According to servicer notes, bids are 
      anticipated in November/December. The latest reported appraisal from May 
      2013 indicates a value significantly below the loan amount.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to modeled losses is the StratREAL 
      Industrial Portfolio II loan (4.2%), the second largest specially 
      serviced asset in the pool. The portfolio transferred to special 
      servicing in December 2012 for imminent payment default. The collateral 
      originally consisted of a portfolio of 10 industrial properties totaling 
      over 5 million sf located across four regional markets: the Memphis, TN 
      MSA, the Columbus, OH MSA, the Sacramento, CA MSA, and the Nashville, TX 
      MSA. The two Sacramento properties have since been sold and released 
      from the portfolio with proceeds allocated to the loan. As of June 2013, 
      the weighted average portfolio occupancy of the remaining eight 
      properties (comprising over 4 million sf) is 63%, down significantly 
      from the 92% reported at issuance. Two of these properties are fully 
      vacant, three are occupied by single tenants, and three have individual 
      occupancies ranging from 37% to 84%. The latest reported appraisals from 
      first quarter 2013 indicate an aggregate value significantly below the 
      loan amount.

		&lt;h1&gt;Lakefront Property Brings Area's Highest Sales Price in 10 Years Through J. P. King Auction Company&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS, MN--(Marketwired - Dec 20, 2013) -  The Brentwood Estates, a private, 30-acre property overlooking the Big Chippewa Lake, pre-sold in the days leading up to an auction, commanding the highest sales price in Douglas County in over a decade. J. P. King Auction Company handled the sale of the eight-parcel, four estate property that included 1,230 feet of lake frontage, manicured gardens and a 1950s-inspired malt shop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the auction, J. P. King's marketing campaign drew interest from four states, with 11,000 hits to the listing on J. P. King's Web page and 16 interested buyers touring the property. The Brentwood Estates sold and closed on Thursday. The buyers' broker, Donna Wilberg with Counselor Realty in Alexandria, said the sale exceeds the highest price for a residential property in the area by nearly $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we built Brentwood, we wanted to build something our family could enjoy, and for all these years, it's served that purpose," said Tom McLeod, the property's seller. "Then our grandchildren grew up, and we're not able to use it as much anymore. We're thankful someone else wants to come in and continue that dream."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The property, which was purchased by Tom and Barbara McLeod 20 years ago, has served as their family's retreat since they hired Widseth Smith Nolting to design the first home in 1993. Each year, Mrs. McLeod hired a bus service to pick up their 28 grandchildren for their annual "Cousins Camp," where they enjoyed all the recreation the property provided, including a talent show in the main home's 15-seat theater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About J. P. King:
				J. P. King Auction Company specializes in high-value properties such as luxury homes, condominiums, land and ranches. The company has marketed properties in all 50 states and six countries with recent events in Idaho, Michigan, Colorado, and Montana.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 4429 Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 4429- 'AA/F1', Positive Outlook; DRIVERs, Series 
      4429A-D -'AA', Positive Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA+', Positive Outlook ratings assigned to the series 
      4429 PUTTERs and series 4429A-D DRIVERs are based on the ratings that 
      Fitch has assigned to the New York State Urban Development Corporation 
      State Personal Income Tax Revenue Bonds (General Purpose), Series 2013E 
      (rated 'AA', Positive Outlook) that have been deposited in the series 
      4429 trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 4429 PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (rated 
      'A+/F1', Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs will 
      expire on June 30, 2014, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, 
      unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

			Genesys Brings Rich, Multi-Channel Customer Experience to Lync 
      Customers by Unifying Contact Center Interactions and Enterprise 
      Communications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Genesys (www.genesyslab.com), 
      a leading provider of customer experience and contact center solutions, 
      today announced that it has achieved Microsoft 
      Lync 2013 qualification. The Microsoft 
      Lync Independent Software Vendor (ISV) qualification program is 
      designed to help ensure that qualified applications from Microsoft 
      Partners meet customer expectations for specific scenarios. With third 
      party testing, the program defines specific requirements for 
      interoperability with Lync Server, installation, set-up and 
      configuration, documentation, and support. With the latest Lync 2013 
      qualification, Genesys continues to enable Lync customers to unify their 
      contact center interactions and enterprise unified communications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Companies select Genesys and Microsoft Lync to leverage the combination 
      of best-of-breed contact center and unified communications solutions, 
      rather than closed proprietary hardware-based solutions. By 
      incorporating multi-channel customer experiences and contact center 
      capabilities from Genesys, Lync customers can seamlessly deliver voice 
      and instant messaging (IM) interactions to both their customer service 
      agents and back office employees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With qualification for Lync 2013, Genesys extends Lync into 
      multi-channel contact center customer service,&#8221; says Dan Benedict, 
      Program Manager Lync ISV Qualification Program, Microsoft. 
      &#8220;Organizations can now benefit from Genesys customer service solutions 
      integrated with Lync 2013 as their voice platform in contact centers and 
      across the enterprise.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Genesys integrates the real-time presence and availability status of all 
      Lync users, which enables companies to route calls coming into the 
      contact center to any available employee wherever they may be located - 
      in stores, branch offices, home offices, outsource partners, or any 
      other location. As a result, organizations using both remote employees 
      and contact center agents are able to track the availability of an 
      employee resource beyond the contact center and better direct enquiries 
      based upon the status of any given resource to increase efficiency of 
      service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The integration of Genesys and Microsoft Lync has already brought 
      unprecedented rich collaboration and multimedia experiences to contact 
      center agents and non-contact center employees,&#8221; said Merijn Te Booij, 
      Executive Vice President of Products and Strategy, Genesys. &#8220;We are 
      proud of being one of the first to achieve qualification on the new 
      Microsoft Lync 2013.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recently, Genesys announced that it is a Silver Sponsor at the upcoming Lync 
      Conference 2014 on February 18, 2014, in Las Vegas, and will be 
      demonstrating the solution at the event.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Procter  Gamble&#8217;s Always Brand and the National Sleep Foundation 
      Help Women Sleep Uninterrupted on Longest Night of the Year and Beyond
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Always Named Official Overnight Pad of the National Sleep Foundation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to a poll by the National Sleep Foundation, 67 percent of 
      women who menstruate toss and turn for two or three days during each 
      month.1
			That&#8217;s why
			Procter  Gamble&#8217;s (PG) 
      Always, the world&#8217;s leader in feminine protection, and the National 
      Sleep Foundation are partnering to help women understand the unique 
      biological differences that impact the quality of their sleep. Always, 
      the Official Overnight Pad of the National Sleep Foundation, helps women 
      sleep leak- and worry-free, while the National Sleep Foundation provides 
      healthy sleep tips so women can get their best sleep all month long.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Always found that many women are wearing the same pad during the day 
      and night, but their protection needs are different, this can cause 
      women to have leaks or worry and then not sleep as well,&#8221; said Sarah 
      Innes, PG North America FemCare Marketing Director. &#8220;In our partnership 
      with the National Sleep Foundation, we share a common goal to help women 
      sleep comfortably. This includes making sure a woman has the right 
      protection from Always and tips and advice from the National Sleep 
      Foundation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A woman&#8217;s quality of sleep is impacted by fluctuating levels of hormones 
      that she experiences throughout the month and over her lifetime.2 According 
      to research by the National Sleep Foundation and others, the three days 
      prior to menstruation and the first four days during are associated with 
      the worst quality of sleep.1 In addition, menstruating women 
      spend the longest amount of time in bed on weeknights (7 hours, 32 
      minutes on average), with more than two thirds of these women 
      experiencing symptoms of insomnia.1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Achieving the appropriate amount of sleep is vital, but the quality of 
      sleep is just as important. Biological conditions unique to women, like 
      the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and menopause, affect how well a woman 
      sleeps,&#8221; said Fiona C. Baker, PhD, program director of the Human Sleep 
      Research Program at SRI International and a member of the National Sleep 
      Foundation&#8217;s Women  Sleep Expert Panel. &#8220;Establishing a nighttime 
      routine, especially during her period, is important to sleeping 
      uninterrupted.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For that time of the month, the Always Maxi Overnight Extra Heavy pad 
      features a larger back to catch leaks quickly when lying down and stays 
      4x drier versus the leading Regular Maxi pad. While many women have 
      bedtime routines, using the right nighttime products is important for 
      worry-free sleep especially while on their period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Tips to Sleep Uninterrupted from the National Sleep 
      Foundation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Relax with Heat. Have trouble sleeping due to bloating, breast 
        tenderness, backaches and pelvic pains during menstruation? Soak in a 
        warm bath or use a heating pad to ease muscular aches and transition 
        into a sleepy mindset.
      
			
				Stick To Light Snacks. Researchers stress the importance of not 
        eating at least 2-3 hours before sleep. However, menstruating women 
        often have an increase in appetite. If you can&#8217;t resist the urge to 
        snack close to bedtime, avoid heavy portions and stick to a few bites 
        of something light.
      
			
				Write Away Your Worries. One in every three women reports a 
        disturbance of sleep during their period.1 Save your 
        restless worries for the daytime. If concerns come to mind, write them 
        in a &#8220;worry book&#8221; so you can address those issues the next day. 
        Regular exercise may help; exercise at any time of day, but not at the 
        expense of your sleep.
      
			
				Turn Down The Lights. When it comes to your bedroom, think 
        dark. A dark bedroom contributes to better sleep. Try light-blocking 
        curtains, shades or blinds, and remember to turn off the TV.

&lt;p&gt;QUITO (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Chevron Corp appealed on Monday to Ecuador's highest court, asking it to cancel a $9.5 billion fine for polluting the Amazon rainforest in a long-running case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month Ecuador's National Court of Justice upheld a 2011 verdict by a lower court that Chevron was responsible for pollution in the area caused by U.S. oil firm Texaco, whose assets were bought by Chevron in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says that 2011 ruling was obtained by fraud and it is pursuing a case in New York against the U.S. lawyer representing the plaintiffs who it says resorted to corruption to win what it calls an "illegitimate" verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron Corp asked the Constitutional Court of Ecuador today to revoke the fraudulent $9.5 billion sentence against the company because of the multiple violations of constitutional guarantees," the U.S. company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villagers in the remote jungle region say the pollution has harmed their health. Chevron says Texaco cleaned up the area before handing it to Ecuador's state oil company, Petroecuador, which Chevron says bears the responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge in the 2011 ruling ordered Chevron to pay $9.5 billion, plus an additional $9.5 billion for refusing to publicly apologize for the pollution. The National Court of Justice halved the fine last month, saying there had been no legal basis to sanction Chevron for not apologizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, an Ontario appeals court ruled that a group of Ecuadoreans can seek enforcement in Canada of the judgment against Chevron, overturning a lower court decision from earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs traveled to Canada to target what they say are Chevron's $15 billion worth of assets in that country. The California-based company no longer has any assets in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alexandra Valencia; Writing by Daniel Wallis; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Blasio appointed Alicia Glen deputy mayor for housing and

Sachs, a unit that concentrates on "social impact investing" and
has committed $2.7 billion to projects such as affordable
housing and renovations of urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glen has a background in public service. She was a junior

discount rate caused a $3.1 million change in the value of his

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relatively new industry of litigation funding, in which an investor otherwise uninvolved in a dispute agrees to front the money for one side or the other (almost always the plaintiffs) to litigate the case, has occasioned much soul searching about who has the right to bring a claim and control its prosecution. But theres really nothing new about investors betting on litigation, albeit by acquiring a direct interest in a case. Im speaking, of course, about hedge funds engaged in litigation arbitrage, in which they purchase a security in the hope that successful litigation will drive up its value. The phenomenon is best known in the distressed debt arena, where hedge funds have made heaps of money by buying up notes of bankrupt or near-bankrupt companies and then clawing for creditors rights by any means necessary. You also see trading in claims against receiverships, as in the brisk secondary market for claims belonging to Bernard Madoffs investors, as well as trading in stock whose value is particularly driven by litigation developments, as, for instance, MBIAs used to be. More recently, weve seen investors buying mortgage-backed notes with the intention of acquiring a big enough stake to force the MBS trustee to pursue repurchase claims. (Although, as I told you last week, thats become a very low-odds bet, thanks to the New York state appellate courts new ruling on the statute of limitations for put-back suits.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge funds that succeed in this game are, by definition, smarter than other investors about how litigation will impact the value of the securities they acquire. In that sense, Paulson  Cos reported sale last week of its stake in Washington Mutual senior secured notes is a sign that JPMorgan is winning its years-long fight with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over indemnification for WaMu MBS liability. As The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, the hedge fund ditched its position in WaMu debt days after JPMorgans lawyers at Sullivan  Cromwell filed a complaint in federal court in Washington, demanding first dibs on the FDICs $2.7 billion WaMu receivership funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgans new suit repeats its long-running argument that when it took Washington Mutual off the FDICs hands in 2008, the acquisition contract required JPMorgan to assume only certain WaMu liabilities  and that liability based on deficient WaMu MBS remained with FDIC. The banks latest complaint does not assert a claim, at least for now, against the FDIC as a corporate entity, but demands more than $1 billion from the FDICs WaMu receivership fund, which contains about $2.75 billion (roughly $1.9 billion from JPMorgan purchase of WaMu plus another $800 million that the fund recovered through the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of WaMus holding company). JPMorgans complaint identifies 13 settled WaMu MBS investor cases and five that have yet to wrap up, and claims that the FDIC receivership is responsible for covering those deals, among other costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the bank is not demanding indemnification for the $1.53 billion it paid to resolve the Federal Housing Finance Agencys claims that WaMu committed securities violations in its sale of MBS to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA did not require JPMorgan to give up its indemnification claim against the receivership as part of their deal, but the banks subsequent settlement with the Justice Department included that provision. JPMorgans new suit does demand payback from the FDIC for its previous mortgage repurchase (or put-back) settlement with FHFAs wards, Fannie and Freddie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgans rivals for the $2.75 billion in the FDIC receivership are WaMus creditors, chief among them the senior noteholders who hold some $6 billion in debt that WaMu issued before it failed. Those noteholders are a revolving cast of sophisticated investors represented by Dechert and Zuckerman Spaeder. Unfortunately for them, theyve been pretty much shut out of the litigation over JPMorgans right to indemnification from the FDIC, in which the banks new suit is only the latest chapter. The main event is occurring in a put-back suit by Deutsche Bank as a WaMu MBS trustee. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer of Washington, who is presiding over all of the litigation involving the FDIC, WaMu and JPMorgan, has said that she will rule in the Deutsche Bank trustee case whether JPMorgan or the FDIC is responsible for WaMus MBS liability, but such a ruling is a long way off; Collyer has asked for expert reports but hasnt scheduled hearings. And meanwhile, the judge has rebuffed senior noteholders, including Monarch, Silver Point and York Capital, from intervening in the trustee litigation to defend their right to the money in the receivership. In July, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals upheld Judge Collyers decision on intervention, ruling that the noteholders dont have standing in the trustee case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulsons reported sale of its position looks like an acknowledgement that the hedge fund believes it has squeezed all it can from its investment in WaMu secured notes, which will obviously decline in value if JPMorgan gets first crack at the money in the receivership. (Paulson  Co referred me to an outside spokesman, who didnt respond to my email.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There could, of course, be other explanations for Paulsons sale that have nothing to do with JPMorgans new suit, and Paulson could certainly change its mind and repurchase WaMu debt after New Year. Moreover, the size and significance of Paulsons WaMu stake is not publicly known, and Paulson was not publicly identified in the noteholders attempt to intervene in the Deutsche Bank case. And whoever bought the WaMu notes from the hedge fund is clearly betting that noteholders will end up with the lions share of the $2.75 billion receivership. But from what Ive seen, Paulsons litigation advisors make savvy bets. If I were JPMorgan, Id be happy to have the hedge funds implicit endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan counsel Robert Sacks of SC and WaMu noteholder counsel Thomas Vartanian of Dechert declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Network Marketing Powerhouse C. Anthony Harris Joins ViSalus&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;With 18 Years of Network Marketing Experience, Harris Accepts the Challenge&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - Dec 23, 2013) -  C. Anthony Harris announced today that he has joined the Promoter ranks of the Vi Community. ViSalus, Inc. is the company behind the #1 90-Day weight-loss and fitness challenge platform in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris and ViSalus were, in many ways, destined to be together. It was a match that took 16 years to align, but not for lack of opportunity. Harris first met ViSalus Co-Founders Nick Sarnicola and Blake Mallen when they worked together at their first network-marketing company. When the trio ended their tenure together nine years ago, Harris moved on to become a top earner at another network marketing company while Sarnicola and Mallen started ViSalus. They have stayed in touch ever since. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris' career is relatable to anyone who has ever had the desire to be their own boss. Eighteen years ago, at the age of 33, with a solid career in place, Harris was not satisfied with his job as a systems analyst for the federal government and turned to network marketing as his exit strategy. He found solace in his mentor's advice to stay the course, believe in the product, and copy the habits of other successful people. He grew his team to a massive 200,000 people over the past nine years, which culminated in 15 of his team members achieving million-dollar annual revenues and thousands of others to make a solid full-time income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarnicola, who currently leads the Promoter field as a ViSalus Global Ambassador, had been trying to get Harris to join ViSalus for years. "C is one of my closest friends, and I can't express how excited I am to have not just a friend, but also a top industry leader join us," says Sarnicola. "He will challenge not just me but the entire organization to achieve even higher levels of excellence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just felt the timing was now," says C. Anthony. "I'm a very passionate person and I'm not a gypsy, so joining ViSalus was an extremely important move for me, my family and our future. I've been using the product for a long time and love the quality and selection. The future of ViSalus is so strong, and while this is a new direction for me, Nick is the only person on the planet I trust enough to guide us on this journey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ViSalus owes much of its success to its family-friendly environment that focuses on having fun while supporting good nutrition in local communities. "We are excited that C is on board. We have an incredible history together, and our combined energy is going to excite the entire Promoter field," says Blake Mallen, ViSalus Co-Founder and CMO. "C is proof that challenging yourself while believing you have the power to make a difference, can fuel unrestricted success. This next year is going to be incredible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information please contact C. Anthony Harris at CAnthonyHarris@cox.net. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About ViSalus

&lt;p&gt;GENEVA (Reuters) - Russian former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky applied for a Schengen visa at the Swiss embassy in Berlin on Tuesday, the Swiss foreign ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khodorkovsky, 50, has been staying in Berlin since Russian President Vladimir Putin's surprise decision last week to free him after a decade in prison on fraud and tax evasion charges. Khodorkovsky has close ties to Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He made a request for a visa, which will be studied," Swiss foreign ministry spokesman Jean-Marc Crevoisier told Reuters, speaking from the capital Berne. "One could imagine that he intends to come to Switzerland."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesman said the request was for a three-month visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khodorkovsky's second wife Inna has a home in Geneva, where several of his companies had operations, the Swiss daily Le Matin said on Tuesday, quoting the Russian state-run radio Voice of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khodorkovsky, whose release from a Russian prison camp near the Arctic Circle and flight to Germany last Friday were shrouded in mystery reminiscent of the Cold War era, said on Sunday he had received a visa to stay in Germany for one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gave no further information on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany is also part of the visa-free Schengen zone, which includes a majority of European Union member states and several countries outside the bloc including Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany's former foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher played a key role in securing Khodorkovsky's arrival in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Gareth Jones)&lt;/p&gt;

      Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount 
      from their net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;), which may increase investors&#8217; risk 
      of loss. At the time of sale, an investor&#8217;s shares may have a market 
      price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than the 
      original investment. There is no assurance that the Fund will meet its 
      investment objective. Past performance does not guarantee future 
      results. Investments in securities of MLPs involve risks that differ 
      from investments in common stock, including among others risks related

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates Sacramento City Unified School District JPFA, CA's LRBs 'A'; 
      Outlook to Negative
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns an 'A' rating to the following Sacramento City 
      Unified School District Joint Powers Financing Authority, California 
      bonds:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$40.8 million lease revenue refunding bonds (LRBs), 2014 series A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bonds are scheduled to sell via negotiation on or about the week of 
      Jan. 8, 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Fitch affirms the following Sacramento City Unified School 
      District (the district) ratings:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$213.7 million general obligation bonds (GOs) at 'A+';--$32.6 
      million certificates of participation (COPs), series 2001 at 'A'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is revised to Negative from Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SECURITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The GOs are secured by an unlimited ad valorem property tax.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The LRBs and COPs are secured by annual lease payments for the use and 
      occupancy of essential district school buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      POOR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: The Negative Outlook reflects the district's 
      failure to return to structural budget balance in 2014 as previously 
      predicted due to a failure to control spending. Financial oversight is 
      weak.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WEAK RESERVE POSITION: The district's reserves are very weak with 
      unrestricted general fund balance equal to just 3.2% of expenditures at 
      the end of fiscal 2013. The district expects to spend reserves down to 
      just 2% of expenditures in fiscal 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CHALLENGING BUDGET ENVIRONMENT: The district must manage a volatile 
      state funding environment and has no meaningful revenue raising 
      flexibility because of state law, forcing budget adjustments to be made 
      primarily through expenditure reductions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ECONOMIC RECOVERY BEGINS: Sacramento's government-dominated economy has 
      begun to recover from a deep recession with stabilization in the state 
      of California's budget position. The region proved more vulnerable to 
      cyclical downturns than expected in the recent recession, but has solid 
      fundamental underpinnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LARGE, DIVERSE TAX BASE: The district's large, diverse tax base has 
      begun to grow again after a period of relatively manageable assessed 
      value (AV) declines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM LIABILITIES: The district's debt profile is weak, 
      with a moderate but growing debt burden, manageable exposure to 
      variable-rate debt, a poorly funded teachers' pension plan, and a large 
      unfunded liability for other post-employment benefits (OPEB).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MANAGEMENT WEAKNESS: The district's management is in flux with the 
      recent resignation of its superintendent. The governing board has shown 
      a willingness to spend down reserves to an inadequate level.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FAILURE TO RESOLVE STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE: Fitch expects to downgrade the 
      ratings if the district does not convincingly restore structural balance 
      in the near term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CREDIT PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The district includes just over half of California's state capital and 
      some adjacent suburban areas. The district is the state's 12th largest 
      school system with 42,623 students.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WEAK FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The district's financial position remains surprisingly weak in the face 
      of a much improved revenue environment. The district has posted net 
      deficits after transfers in three of the past four years and projects 
      continued deficit spending in 2014 and 2015. Continued deficit spending 
      would reduce reserves to the state's minimum 2% fund balance threshold 
      for school districts of this size. The district had a deficit of $1.7 
      million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, reducing its 
      unrestricted fund balance to $12.4 million, or 3.2% of expenditures and 
      transfers out.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Negative Outlook largely reflects the district's failure to return 
      to structural balance in 2014. Fitch downgraded the district's bonds in 
      May 2013 on expectations that the district would spend reserves down to 
      near the state minimum before restoring structural balance through 
      budget cuts in fiscal 2014. In the spring of 2013, the district 
      presented a list of board approved cuts that would have eliminated a 
      $5.2 million deficit for fiscal 2014, returning the district to 
      structural budget balance. The district subsequently changed its 
      spending plans, budgeting an 8% spending increase that more than fully 
      offsets a 6.1% jump in funding due to an improved state revenue 
      environment. The district now projects a deficit of $10.2 million for 
      the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      INADEQUATE RESERVES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multiyear projections show fund balance decreasing to 2% of spending in 
      the current budget year and not recovering meaningfully across the three 
      year forecast horizon. The minimum reserve is inadequate to maintain the 
      current ratings given the volatility in state funding the district 
      routinely faces. The district is likely to beat the forecast slightly in 
      the current year because of conservative elements of the budget; 
      however, Fitch lacks confidence in the district's ability and 
      willingness to control expenditures to the degree necessary to return to 
      structural balance as forecast.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Financial oversight is weak. Policymakers have allowed the district to 
      run persistent budget deficits, failed to make available spending 
      adjustments that would have restored balanced budgets, and have drawn 
      reserves to a level that leaves the district vulnerable to falling below 
      the state's minimum fund balance requirement in the event of an economic 
      shock or unanticipated expenditures. The district also lacks official 
      board policies that would support a return to a higher level of reserves 
      over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IMPROVED REVENUE ENVIRONMENT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An improving state revenue environment should make it possible for the 
      district to restore its financial health if policymakers choose to. The 
      district is benefiting from the state's new Local Control Funding 
      Formula (LCFF), which gives significant additional funding to schools 
      with high numbers of second language learners and students in poverty or 
      foster care. The district is likely to see continued improvement in 
      state funding over the next several years, but revenue gains are 
      unlikely to provide the robust surplus operations needed to rebuild 
      reserves in the near term. The district's current multiyear projections 
      assume gains in state LCFF revenue of 4.5% annually over the next two 
      years. This assumption appears reasonable and could turn out to be 
      conservative if state revenue improvements continue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SPENDING CONTROL IS KEY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The district has made very large cuts to spending in recent years by 
      trimming staff, but it has failed to fully realign its expenditures to 
      match its revenues in part due to a difficult to control increases in 
      healthcare costs. General fund spending on employee benefits is 
      projected to rise to $110.5 million, or 26% of expenditures in the 2014 
      budget, from $92 million, or 22% of expenditures in 2008. The district 
      is also likely to face labor cost pressures from teachers who have not 
      had a raise (outside of step and column raises) in five years. The 
      district's financial plans assume it can hold teacher salaries at their 
      current level through 2015, but Fitch is concerned that any upside 
      revenue performance would spur demands for raises that more than offset 
      gains in revenues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      STATE CAPITAL NOT INSULATED FROM ECONOMIC DOWNTURN
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The district sits at the heart of a significant, government-dominated 
      economy that has been hard hit by state budget cuts and the housing 
      downturn. While the Sacramento region remains dominated by government - 
      which provides more than a quarter of all jobs in the Sacramento 
      metropolitan area - the economy has diversified over the years. The 
      economy also includes significant healthcare, educational, professional 
      services, technology, and construction industry employers. Sacramento's 
      unemployment rates have not proven more stable than the state or the 
      nation over recent business cycles, despite the presence of large 
      governmental, healthcare and educational employers that would suggest 
      greater economic stability. The city's non-seasonally adjusted 
      unemployment rate was 9.8% in October 2013, down by more than two 
      percentage points over the past year, but well above the national rate 
      of 6.6%. District socioeconomic indicators are below average with an 
      elevated poverty rate (19.6%) and median household income at 91% of the 
      national level.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The school district's $26.3 billion tax base is largely residential and 
      quite diverse with the top 10 taxpayers representing just 3.8% of AV. 
      Sacramento's older, more established housing stock has protected it from 
      the extraordinary declines seen in communities with large amounts of new 
      development during the housing boom. AV declined a manageable 9.4% from 
      its peak in fiscal 2009 to its trough in fiscal 2013. AV returned to 
      growth with a 3.6% gain in fiscal 2014. Broader economic and housing 
      market improvement is likely to support continued tax base gains over 
      the next several years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MODERATE BUT RISING DEBT BURDEN
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The district's debt burden is moderate, with direct and overlapping debt 
      equal to 4.1% of AV, or $3,287 per capita. The district's debt burden is 
      likely to rise somewhat over the next several years due to continued 
      borrowing to support the district's capital plan. Sacramento voters 
      approved a $414 million GO bond authorization in November 2012, of which 
      $344 million remains to be issued over the next several years. The 
      district is likely to issue the bonds gradually in a way that doesn't 
      sharply increase debt ratios. Amortization is solid with 48.6% of debt 
      paid down over 10 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TYPICAL LEASE PROVISIONS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rated lease revenue bonds (series 2014A) are being sold alongside an 
      unrated parity private placement (series 2014B) to refund the district's 
      outstanding 2001 and 2011 COPs. The 2014B LRBs will refund variable-rate 
      COPs currently outstanding as SIFMA index notes. The refunding will not 
      meaningfully increase the general fund's debt service burden given the 
      district's large budget and will improve the district's debt profile by 
      replacing the SIFMA index notes (which were unhedged and needed to be 
      rolled over periodically) with fixed-rate, fully amortizing lease 
      revenue bonds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The security is typical for California leases with a covenant to budget 
      and appropriate, as well as a cash funded debt service reserve fund at 
      the maximum size allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. The bonds are 
      secured by lease payments from the district to the authority for 
      essential assets - two of the district's seven high schools. The leases 
      are subject to abatement if the district does not have beneficial use 
      and occupancy of the properties. This risk is somewhat offset by the 
      district's covenant to maintain the standard, 24-month rental 
      interruption insurance policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SIGNIFICANT RETIREE LIABILITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Post-employment liabilities are a significant and growing burden on the 
      district. The district participates in California Public Employees' 
      Retirement System (CalPERS) as well as in the poorly funded California 
      State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) pension systems. 
      Contribution rates for CalPERS are actuarially based, but those for 
      CalSTRS are set by statute and have been below the level required to 
      amortize the system's unfunded liability. The system reported a funded 
      ratio of 69.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. Fitch estimates 
      the funded ratio to be 65.7% based on its more conservative 7% rate of 
      return assumption. Fitch expects the district's CalSTRS contribution 
      rate to rise over the coming years, perhaps significantly, after the 
      legislature begins to address the system's growing unfunded liabilities. 
      The district's unfunded accrued actuarial OPEB liability is particularly 
      high at $632.7 million, or 2.5% of AV.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Carrying costs for debt service, pension and OPEB were moderate at 16.5% 
      of governmental funds spending in fiscal 2013. Rising healthcare costs 
      and CalSTRS's weak funding ratio are likely to push carrying costs 
      higher over the next several years, though district officials are 
      actively working with labor unions to reduce the growth of medical and 
      OPEB costs.

&lt;p&gt;Cyrus, 21, who has grabbed headlines in the past year for her admitted drug use, sexually suggestive dancing and wearing as little as boots in a music video, said she was surprised by the scrutiny her new persona has attracted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I went from people just thinking I was, like, a baby to people thinking I'm this, like, sex freak that really just pops molly and does lines all day," Cyrus told the New York Times in an interview to be published on Sunday and made available early online, referring to the drugs MDMA and cocaine, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like, 'Has anyone ever heard of rock 'n' roll?'" the "Wrecking Ball" singer countered. "There's a sex scene in pretty much every single movie, and they go, 'Well, that's a character.' Well, that's a character. I don't really dress as a teddy bear and, like, twerk on Robin Thicke, you know?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyrus, who rose to prominence as a teen star of the Disney musical TV series "Hannah Montana," has become a bad girl of pop music since her performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September when she "twerked" (a sexually suggestive dance) during a performance of Thicke's hit "Blurred Lines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't have a bunch of celeb friends, because I feel like some of them are a little scared of the association," Cyrus said of her new persona. "This is terrible. I was backstage with (the rising pop star) Ariana Grande. I'm like, 'Walk out with me right now and get this picture, and this will be the best thing that happens to you, because just you associating with me makes you a little less sweet.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyrus, whose newest music video "Adore You" shows her writhing between bed sheets in her underwear, sucking her thumb and rubbing her body, said she feels more free to be herself now that she is no longer under a Disney contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I was no longer employed by anyone, that's when I was like, 'O.K., I'm going to do my own thing.' But I waited until I felt like I had respectfully finished out what I was supposed to do, you know?" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyrus signed with label RCA this year after releasing her first three albums on Disney's Hollywood Records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyrus, the daughter of country music singer Billy Ray Cyrus, also fired back at pop star Joe Jonas, formerly of the Jonas Brothers, who said Cyrus and pop singer Demi Lovato introduced him to marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to smoke weed, you're going to smoke weed," Cyrus said. "There's nothing that two little girls are going to get you to do that you don't want to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Eric Kelsey; Editing by Mary Milliken and Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

      offering, raising $826.3 million of equity, excluding any exercise of 
      the underwriters&#8217; option to purchase additional shares. The Credit 
      Facility allows the Fund to deploy leverage while taking advantage of 
      the current short-term rate environment.

      Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount 
      from their net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;), which may increase investors&#8217; risk 
      of loss. At the time of sale, an investor&#8217;s shares may have a market 
      price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than the 
      original investment. There is no assurance that the Fund will meet its 
      investment objective. Past performance does not guarantee future

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates Sacramento City Unified School District JPFA, CA's LRBs 'A'; 
      Outlook to Negative
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns an 'A' rating to the following Sacramento City 
      Unified School District Joint Powers Financing Authority, California 
      bonds:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$40.8 million lease revenue refunding bonds (LRBs), 2014 series A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bonds are scheduled to sell via negotiation on or about the week of 
      Jan. 8, 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Fitch affirms the following Sacramento City Unified School 
      District (the district) ratings:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$213.7 million general obligation bonds (GOs) at 'A+';--$32.6 
      million certificates of participation (COPs), series 2001 at 'A'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is revised to Negative from Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SECURITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The GOs are secured by an unlimited ad valorem property tax.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The LRBs and COPs are secured by annual lease payments for the use and 
      occupancy of essential district school buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      POOR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: The Negative Outlook reflects the district's 
      failure to return to structural budget balance in 2014 as previously 
      predicted due to a failure to control spending. Financial oversight is 
      weak.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WEAK RESERVE POSITION: The district's reserves are very weak with 
      unrestricted general fund balance equal to just 3.2% of expenditures at 
      the end of fiscal 2013. The district expects to spend reserves down to 
      just 2% of expenditures in fiscal 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CHALLENGING BUDGET ENVIRONMENT: The district must manage a volatile 
      state funding environment and has no meaningful revenue raising 
      flexibility because of state law, forcing budget adjustments to be made 
      primarily through expenditure reductions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ECONOMIC RECOVERY BEGINS: Sacramento's government-dominated economy has 
      begun to recover from a deep recession with stabilization in the state 
      of California's budget position. The region proved more vulnerable to 
      cyclical downturns than expected in the recent recession, but has solid 
      fundamental underpinnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LARGE, DIVERSE TAX BASE: The district's large, diverse tax base has 
      begun to grow again after a period of relatively manageable assessed 
      value (AV) declines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM LIABILITIES: The district's debt profile is weak, 
      with a moderate but growing debt burden, manageable exposure to 
      variable-rate debt, a poorly funded teachers' pension plan, and a large 
      unfunded liability for other post-employment benefits (OPEB).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MANAGEMENT WEAKNESS: The district's management is in flux with the 
      recent resignation of its superintendent. The governing board has shown 
      a willingness to spend down reserves to an inadequate level.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FAILURE TO RESOLVE STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE: Fitch expects to downgrade the 
      ratings if the district does not convincingly restore structural balance 
      in the near term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CREDIT PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The district includes just over half of California's state capital and 
      some adjacent suburban areas. The district is the state's 12th largest 
      school system with 42,623 students.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WEAK FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The district's financial position remains surprisingly weak in the face 
      of a much improved revenue environment. The district has posted net 
      deficits after transfers in three of the past four years and projects 
      continued deficit spending in 2014 and 2015. Continued deficit spending 
      would reduce reserves to the state's minimum 2% fund balance threshold 
      for school districts of this size. The district had a deficit of $1.7 
      million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, reducing its 
      unrestricted fund balance to $12.4 million, or 3.2% of expenditures and 
      transfers out.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Negative Outlook largely reflects the district's failure to return 
      to structural balance in 2014. Fitch downgraded the district's bonds in 
      May 2013 on expectations that the district would spend reserves down to 
      near the state minimum before restoring structural balance through 
      budget cuts in fiscal 2014. In the spring of 2013, the district 
      presented a list of board approved cuts that would have eliminated a 
      $5.2 million deficit for fiscal 2014, returning the district to 
      structural budget balance. The district subsequently changed its 
      spending plans, budgeting an 8% spending increase that more than fully 
      offsets a 6.1% jump in funding due to an improved state revenue 
      environment. The district now projects a deficit of $10.2 million for 
      the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      INADEQUATE RESERVES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multiyear projections show fund balance decreasing to 2% of spending in 
      the current budget year and not recovering meaningfully across the three 
      year forecast horizon. The minimum reserve is inadequate to maintain the 
      current ratings given the volatility in state funding the district 
      routinely faces. The district is likely to beat the forecast slightly in 
      the current year because of conservative elements of the budget; 
      however, Fitch lacks confidence in the district's ability and 
      willingness to control expenditures to the degree necessary to return to 
      structural balance as forecast.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Financial oversight is weak. Policymakers have allowed the district to 
      run persistent budget deficits, failed to make available spending 
      adjustments that would have restored balanced budgets, and have drawn 
      reserves to a level that leaves the district vulnerable to falling below 
      the state's minimum fund balance requirement in the event of an economic 
      shock or unanticipated expenditures. The district also lacks official 
      board policies that would support a return to a higher level of reserves 
      over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IMPROVED REVENUE ENVIRONMENT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An improving state revenue environment should make it possible for the 
      district to restore its financial health if policymakers choose to. The 
      district is benefiting from the state's new Local Control Funding 
      Formula (LCFF), which gives significant additional funding to schools 
      with high numbers of second language learners and students in poverty or 
      foster care. The district is likely to see continued improvement in 
      state funding over the next several years, but revenue gains are 
      unlikely to provide the robust surplus operations needed to rebuild 
      reserves in the near term. The district's current multiyear projections 
      assume gains in state LCFF revenue of 4.5% annually over the next two 
      years. This assumption appears reasonable and could turn out to be 
      conservative if state revenue improvements continue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SPENDING CONTROL IS KEY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The district has made very large cuts to spending in recent years by 
      trimming staff, but it has failed to fully realign its expenditures to 
      match its revenues in part due to a difficult to control increases in 
      healthcare costs. General fund spending on employee benefits is 
      projected to rise to $110.5 million, or 26% of expenditures in the 2014 
      budget, from $92 million, or 22% of expenditures in 2008. The district 
      is also likely to face labor cost pressures from teachers who have not 
      had a raise (outside of step and column raises) in five years. The 
      district's financial plans assume it can hold teacher salaries at their 
      current level through 2015, but Fitch is concerned that any upside 
      revenue performance would spur demands for raises that more than offset 
      gains in revenues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      STATE CAPITAL NOT INSULATED FROM ECONOMIC DOWNTURN
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The district sits at the heart of a significant, government-dominated 
      economy that has been hard hit by state budget cuts and the housing 
      downturn. While the Sacramento region remains dominated by government - 
      which provides more than a quarter of all jobs in the Sacramento 
      metropolitan area - the economy has diversified over the years. The 
      economy also includes significant healthcare, educational, professional 
      services, technology, and construction industry employers. Sacramento's 
      unemployment rates have not proven more stable than the state or the 
      nation over recent business cycles, despite the presence of large 
      governmental, healthcare and educational employers that would suggest 
      greater economic stability. The city's non-seasonally adjusted 
      unemployment rate was 9.8% in October 2013, down by more than two 
      percentage points over the past year, but well above the national rate 
      of 6.6%. District socioeconomic indicators are below average with an 
      elevated poverty rate (19.6%) and median household income at 91% of the 
      national level.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The school district's $26.3 billion tax base is largely residential and 
      quite diverse with the top 10 taxpayers representing just 3.8% of AV. 
      Sacramento's older, more established housing stock has protected it from 
      the extraordinary declines seen in communities with large amounts of new 
      development during the housing boom. AV declined a manageable 9.4% from 
      its peak in fiscal 2009 to its trough in fiscal 2013. AV returned to 
      growth with a 3.6% gain in fiscal 2014. Broader economic and housing 
      market improvement is likely to support continued tax base gains over 
      the next several years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MODERATE BUT RISING DEBT BURDEN
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The district's debt burden is moderate, with direct and overlapping debt 
      equal to 4.1% of AV, or $3,287 per capita. The district's debt burden is 
      likely to rise somewhat over the next several years due to continued 
      borrowing to support the district's capital plan. Sacramento voters 
      approved a $414 million GO bond authorization in November 2012, of which 
      $344 million remains to be issued over the next several years. The 
      district is likely to issue the bonds gradually in a way that doesn't 
      sharply increase debt ratios. Amortization is solid with 48.6% of debt 
      paid down over 10 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TYPICAL LEASE PROVISIONS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rated lease revenue bonds (series 2014A) are being sold alongside an 
      unrated parity private placement (series 2014B) to refund the district's 
      outstanding 2001 and 2011 COPs. The 2014B LRBs will refund variable-rate 
      COPs currently outstanding as SIFMA index notes. The refunding will not 
      meaningfully increase the general fund's debt service burden given the 
      district's large budget and will improve the district's debt profile by 
      replacing the SIFMA index notes (which were unhedged and needed to be 
      rolled over periodically) with fixed-rate, fully amortizing lease 
      revenue bonds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The security is typical for California leases with a covenant to budget 
      and appropriate, as well as a cash funded debt service reserve fund at 
      the maximum size allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. The bonds are 
      secured by lease payments from the district to the authority for 
      essential assets - two of the district's seven high schools. The leases 
      are subject to abatement if the district does not have beneficial use 
      and occupancy of the properties. This risk is somewhat offset by the 
      district's covenant to maintain the standard, 24-month rental 
      interruption insurance policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SIGNIFICANT RETIREE LIABILITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Post-employment liabilities are a significant and growing burden on the 
      district. The district participates in California Public Employees' 
      Retirement System (CalPERS) as well as in the poorly funded California 
      State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) pension systems. 
      Contribution rates for CalPERS are actuarially based, but those for 
      CalSTRS are set by statute and have been below the level required to 
      amortize the system's unfunded liability. The system reported a funded 
      ratio of 69.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. Fitch estimates 
      the funded ratio to be 65.7% based on its more conservative 7% rate of 
      return assumption. Fitch expects the district's CalSTRS contribution 
      rate to rise over the coming years, perhaps significantly, after the 
      legislature begins to address the system's growing unfunded liabilities. 
      The district's unfunded accrued actuarial OPEB liability is particularly 
      high at $632.7 million, or 2.5% of AV.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Carrying costs for debt service, pension and OPEB were moderate at 16.5% 
      of governmental funds spending in fiscal 2013. Rising healthcare costs 
      and CalSTRS's weak funding ratio are likely to push carrying costs 
      higher over the next several years, though district officials are 
      actively working with labor unions to reduce the growth of medical and 
      OPEB costs.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 29 (Reuters) - Shares of Coca-Cola Co 
could see steep upside next year, following an extended period
of relative underperformance compared with major indexes,
Barron's wrote on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beverage giant's stock is up about 12 percent in 2013,
well below the 29 percent gain of the S 500 and the 26
percent jump of the Dow, of which Coke is a component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The underperformance has left a typically expensive stock
looking affordable," Barron's wrote, adding that the stock could
rise 20 percent or more in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial publication also said that Coca-Cola stands to
benefit from a growing global middle class, which it estimated
could result in a doubling of soft drink sales over the next 10
to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Coke closed Friday at $40.49.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      c Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not rate the $48,695,815 class NR or the $82,511,815 
      interest-only class X-C. Class X-B has been withdrawn from the deal 
      structure since Fitch issued its expected ratings on Dec. 10, 2013. The 
      classes above reflect the final ratings and deal structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 64 loans secured by 72 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.082 billion as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association; Barclays Bank PLC; General Electric 
      Capital Corporation; Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation; and RAIT 
      Funding, LLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 76.9% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 78.2%, and asset summary reviews on 78.2%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.11x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 106.7%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 8.7%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 9.4% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Leverage: This transaction has higher leverage than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower deals. The pool's Fitch LTV of 
      106.7% is higher than the 2012 and third-quarter 2013 averages of 97.2% 
      and 102.1%, respectively. However, excluding the third-largest loan 
      secured by a multifamily property in New York City, the pool's Fitch LTV 
      is 104.6%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High Multifamily / Low Lodging Exposure: This pool has an above-average 
      concentration of multifamily properties, which represent 25.5% of the 
      total pool balance. This is above the average 2012 and third-quarter 
      2013 concentrations of 6.3% and 11.6%, respectively. Additionally, this 
      transaction has a below-average concentration of hotel properties, which 
      represent 8.6% of the total pool balance; the 2012 and third-quarter 
      2013 average hotel concentrations were 13.5% and 15.6%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Increased Percentage of Partial IO Loans: This pool has a significantly 
      higher concentration of partial-interest loans (56.1%) than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower deals. This is higher than the 2012 
      and third-quarter 2013 averages of 20.1% and 31.0%, respectively. 
      However, full interest-only loans represent only 1.5% of the pool 
      balance, lower than the 2012 and third-quarter 2013 averages of 13.0% 
      and 16.9%, respectively. The pool is scheduled to amortize approximately 
      15.1% prior to maturity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch performed two model-based break-even analyses to determine the 
      level of cash flow and value deterioration the pool could withstand 
      prior to $1 of loss being experienced by the 'BBB-sf' and 'AAAsf' rated 
      classes. Fitch found that the JPMBB 2013-C17 pool could withstand a 
      39.37% decline in value (based on appraised values at issuance) and an 
      approximately 14.99% decrease to the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing $1 of loss to the 'BBB-sf' rated class. Additionally, 
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 48.97% decline in value and 
      an approximately 28.45% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      pre-sale report.

      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,

		&lt;p&gt;
      Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount 
      from their net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;), which may increase investors&#8217; risk 
      of loss. At the time of sale, an investor&#8217;s shares may have a market 
      price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than the 
      original investment. There is no assurance that the Fund will meet its 
      investment objective. Past performance does not guarantee future 
      results. Investments in securities of MLPs involve risks that differ 
      from investments in common stock, including among others risks related 
      to limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting MLPs, 
      potential conflicts of interest risk, cash flow risks, dilution risks 
      and trading risks.
